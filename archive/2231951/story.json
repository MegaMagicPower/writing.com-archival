She had her head down and was inspecting something, while her boss Carly, wearing a short-sleeved pink salon tunic, black boot-cut slacks and a pair of black leather 3-inch stiletto pumps, was busy putting the finishing touches to a client's manicure. Of course, reception was where Holly seemed to be most of the time now, but she was at least thankful to still have a job after Lash Academy had closed it's doors. Zoe had taken Holly with her back to Beautylicious when Carly offered them both jobs. Now here she was, working under Carly and Zoe, and her other co-workers were Hannah and a certain lesbian American by the name of Nat, who used to work at Wilko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly!\" Zoe's voice suddenly called out as she walked over in her 3-inch heeled black patent pumps. Holly looked up at her former employer now co-worker, the tall brunette looked as professional as ever, her stylish shoes complimented by a knee-length and form hugging black pencil skirt and a red short-sleeved blouse. Zoe was wearing her dark brown hair in a plait today that was hung over her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Holly replied, a little startled by the sudden mention of her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" Zoe giggled slightly as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly shook her head gently. \"Nothing, just deep in thought.\" She lied, as she slipped a certain remote looking device back into her handbag. \"What is it?\" She then smiled, noticing the piece of paper in one of Zoe's manicured hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to pop down to Wilko luv and buy a few things. We're out of several lipsticks and nail polishes and we need some more wax strips.\" Zoe said, as she held out her hand and let Holly take the shopping list from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, okay.\" Holly just nodded, opening the paper up and looking at it. Zoe's handwriting was not as easy to read as Carly's, but she could make out the items that the salon needed. Holly stood up and grabbed her handbag/purse, putting it over her shoulder. Then she inspected her appearance briefly. Holly herself was dressed in a white short-sleeved blouse, a plaid skirt, black tights and a pair of black suede ankle boots with 2-inch block heels. As usual, she wore her ash blonde hair in twin plaits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the money.\" Zoe smiled, handing Holly a \u00a320 note before clicking off in her heels to find Nat and ask her to make some coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly slipped the money in her purse and gave her boss Carly a quick smile before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, Holly looked sykwards, took in a breath of fresh air, and started walking down towards towards Wilko. Along the way, she dug into her handbag and pulled out the remote looking device she had been inspecting earlier. A curious smile formed on her pretty face as she thought of the possibilities. The device had arrived at her apartment that morning by anonymous mail, with a note inside the package explaining what it was. A 'Trait Exchanger Device' or TED for short. The note explained that the device could swap people's traits and clothing without them noticing. But it also mentioned that in rare occurrences, somebody else other than the wielder might notice the swaps. Of course, Holly was still sceptical, but as she got near Wilko, her curiosity was biting hard and she just had to know if the device actually worked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once infected, your head somehow becomes detachable. The added side effect is that you can also place your head on somebody else's body. Scientists have dubbed this strange new virus Hovis-19.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly knew that the virus was spreading like wildfire, especially at mass gatherings like illegal raves. Although she was still absolutely gorgeous, she was no spring chicken, at 38 years old, she was only 2 years away from 40. After coming out of another bad relationship, Carly decided she deserved to treat herself to something special. She thought about selling her Range Rover and buying something a bit sportier, perhaps a Porsche. But when this pandemic started sweeping the globe, Carly had a much more sinister plan to treat herself. She decided that she was going to steal herself a younger body and she knew exactly where to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly knew that there were a lot of younger girls at the local Wilko store where her own mother used to work before she retired. All she had to to was walk in, sneeze on someone, then the virus would spread like wildfire. She could have her pick of nubile young bodies that she could place her pretty 38 year old head on. If she got bored with it, she could always steal another. Carly smiled smugly, she knew she should be self isolating, but this was going to be too much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of ruminating about her plan, Carly decided to switch on her TV. She flicked through the channels impatiently as she kicked her heels off and put her feet up on the sofa as she tried to find something to watch. It wasn't long before she settled upon her favourite quiz show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly hated being single, her pussy ached for attention, she especially missed having her pussy eaten out. That's when Carly smirked to herself wickedly \"I couldn't could I? I mean eat my own pussy?\" Carly muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the better of her. Carly peeled her white slacks off and lowered the red thong she wore around her ankles. Still lying on the sofa, Carly reached up and placed both hands on her head, it took a bit of effort but after a couple of hard tugs her head detached with an audible pop, a bit like the sound of a champagne bottle opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly held her detached head in her hands for a moment before lowering her face down towards her own waxed, hairless pussy. It was already wet as she began to lick the outer lips of her own folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly shuddered, the feeling of her own tongue teasing her twat. \"Fuck this is kinky!\" Carly groaned before ramming her tongue deep into her own pussy. Carly got lost in herself as she went to town. This was the ultimate form of masturbation and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who needs a fucking man!\" Carly groaned as she finally brought herself to climax, her toes curled and her screams were muffled by her own pussy. After she'd stopped quivering with ecstasy, Carly calmed down. She decided to leave her head detached for the rest of the night, not even bothering to clean her own juices from her face. There was no point, she was going to give herself a break for a few minutes before going back for round 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The average age of our staff is the lowest in the whole of the country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose one store had to be the lowest.  I like to think we have a young, vibrant workforce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too but apparently the high ups think we are giving out the wrong message.  Wilko doesn't want accusations of being an employer who discriminates because of age.  We've to focus our recruiting towards a wider age range in the future.\" Emma explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's strange, most of our workers have been here for donkeys too.  You think the average age would be creeping up.  It's not our fault older people don't want to work retail.  It can be physically demanding especially in a hardware store where a lot of the stock is quite heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Liz.

We don't even have that many Christmas temps to take on that other retailers do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is training too.  Most of our existing employees have been here so long they are worth two temps, who are only here for a few weeks and don't have time to learn all the jobs properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma found her imagination wandering off as she thought about the problem.  \"What we'd want is somehow to be able to swap the minds of our staff into older bodies.  That would get the average age up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or get older experienced people, into younger bodies.  Surely mental age counts instead of physical age.  Everyone keeps saying 'It's just a number' after all.\" Liz said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked up to the ceiling.  \"I wish we could do all that.\" She brought her head back down again.  \"Oh well enough for fantasy land.

She quickly slammed down the lid of her laptop and pushed her swivel chair out from underneath the desk, watching as Liz did a similar thing albeit with her face more red and flustered. Emma straightened her blouse and composed herself before she clacked up to the door handle. She\u2019d already prepared a whole host of excuses to use to explain her and Liz\u2019s idleness but none were needed this occasion as a reasonably young lady in a fluorescent fuchsia bodycon dress burst into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry ma\u2019am, we don\u2019t allow customers up...\u201d Emma was beginning to say when the woman put her finger to her lips. She moved quickly yet cautiously, peeping out of the overlooking window before closing the shutters before proceeding to lock the door behind her and pull the latch across. \u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am?\u201d Emma\u2019s voice tried to command confidence but squeaked midway as her knees trembled. Both Wilko employees were feeling helplessly terrified and crept towards the back of the room. The young lady seemed to notice and raised her arms in surrender, adjusting her glasses slightly as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she said in a scintillating Polish-tinged accent, \u201cGuys, you need to calm down.\u201d That was maybe a bit too much to ask for from Liz who\u2019d already moved beside the PA intercom and was about to press the button and holler for help. The woman tentatively took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove an inch closer and I\u2019ll have the whole store coming for you,\u201d Liz hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stopped in her tracks, hands still raised in surrender. \u201cLook guys, I know you\u2019re probably a bit frightened right now but please, let me explain.\u201d Though Liz was still sceptical, Emma nodded and motioned for her assistant manager to hold off for a second. The lady breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cThank you, Emma, honestly. I don\u2019t want to think what would happen if anyone else found out about this. Look, I know this sounds far fetched and I know it\u2019s hard to believe\u2014God, I find it hard to believe myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hear me out. Alright... guys, it\u2019s me, Steven.\u201d Emma\u2019s jaw dropped. Liz stumbled backwards slightly and looked at \u2018Steven\u2019 in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the-... No way, it can\u2019t be true...\u201d Emma and Liz were both firmly entrenched in a shared state of disbelief. Aesthetically speaking it was clear this \u2018woman\u2019 wasn\u2019t Steven; first off, of course, they were a woman. A woman with many feminine characteristics such as their slender build, supple legs and thighs with plump magenta lips, a cute button nose and thinly painted eyebrows. The lady\u2019s clothes were also quite racy by Liz and Emma\u2019s standards, hugging her curves tightly, barely covering the rim of her bulbous bum, and allowing the pert nipples of the woman\u2019s bountiful D-cups to poke through the light material. Though her blonde-highlighted hair was cropped a bit short to one side and her arms were a bit more muscular than the managers were used to, this ofigure in front of them was unmistakably womanly. The only item that vaguely reminded Emma of Steven were the dorky looking spectacles placed in the bridge of her nose. They seemed oversized for her face and it seemed too out of place to be a stylistic choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f5/c1/b3/f5c1b38da7c52d857903bfe48fa226ac.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f5/c1/b3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the...\u201d Emma tried to find words to describe how she was feeling but no sound escaped her lips. Liz meanwhile strode up to her old friend and assessed him up close, pinching his soft cheeks and feeling his new breasts (much to Steven\u2019s arousal) to verify if what they were seeing was real. Steven squealed girlishly as Liz took a firm grasp of his left nipple in her nails. \u201cOw, f*ck that hurt! What\u2019re you doing, Liz?!\u201d he screeched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grinned and turned back towards Emma. \u201cWell we know she definitely <i>whinges</i> like Steven!\u201d They all shared a chuckle and the ice growing between them had thawed and splintered partially. Emma gingerly stepped beside Steven and reached out, feeling soft flesh behind her finger. \u201cWow... It feels so real...\u201d she mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is real. I went to this car boot sale nearby my house, a weird thing for me to do in the first place and even weirder considering that I knew the person organising it was this whackjob old hag down the street. Anyways, I was just browsing through when I saw this amazing looking girl browsing through some old jewellery on display there. She\u2019d picked up this beautiful golden teardrop earring with this strange glowing emerald inside and put it on but, for whatever reason, she couldn\u2019t find the second one. Lo and behold I look down and see that the identical other half had rolled right beside my feet. Now I don\u2019t what came over me but I got this <i>really</i> incessant urge to try it on, only for a second, and then I\u2019d just take it off afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou put the earring on?\u201d Emma asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c \u2018Beautiful teardrop earring\u2019?\u201d Liz asked, bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven blushed slightly and pushed a lock of hair behind his ear (a nervous idiosyncrasy he\u2019d absentmindedly inherited from his host body). \u201cThere are layers to me that you don\u2019t even know about, Liz,\u201d he chuckled warily. \u201cBut don\u2019t get me sidetracked! So basically I put on the earring for a second and <i>BLAM!</i> I\u2019m on the other side of the display cabinet, inside the woman\u2019s body and staring back at myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly moly,\u201d Emma said, \u201cThat sounds so surreal, luv!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you get aroused by looking at yourself?\u201d Liz chimed in before Emma punched her in the shoulder. \u201cWhat?! I caught Courtney once writing one of those smut stories where this kind of sh*t happens! There\u2019s always a perv that gets turned on by themselves! Am I right, Steven?\u201d Steven blushed scarlet red once more. He cleared his throat brusquely and shook his head unconvincingly. \u201cNo, no way, pfft! Course not,\u201d he fibbed, \u201cThat\u2019s not the point of my story, alright! Let\u2019s just say I was very confused and these new female hormones were screwing up with my head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I could say anything the woman in my body strode over and dropped the other earring into my hand and left, just disappeared into the crowd, leaving me stranded with her body and these crappy bodyswapping pieces of junk!\u201d Steven threw the earrings across the room with surprisingly strong force, sending them whizzing alarmingly close to Liz\u2019s right ear. While Emma calmed him down, Liz ducked underneath her and Emma\u2019s shared desk and picked up the antique trinkets. She marvelled at the ornate design, golden leaf patterns and strange inscriptions etched into the jewel\u2019s surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, Steven! These could cost a fortune!\u201d Liz snapped as she wiped off the dust that\u2019d rubbed onto it with her blouse. Steven scoffed. \u201cPlease, those things are useless now. I tried putting them back on but nothing happened. Guess I\u2019m stuck like this for the foreseeable future.\u201d As he sighed dejectedly, Liz and Emma looked at each other and shared a knowing grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you are, Steven,\u201d Emma chuckled softly. \u201cMaybe your new body and these weird artefacts are exactly what we need in order to show the area manager that we <i>are</i> diverse and we don\u2019t discriminate against employees according to age!\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven seemed puzzled. \u201cWhat are you on about? Did you not hear that I\u2019m now <i>stuck</i> like this?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was on the same thought track as Emma and quickly replied, \u201cYes, we heard that Steven and, though we offer you our deepest condolences, maybe this can actually lead to more pros for the branch than cons! Listen, corporate are starting to get on our backs. Apparently our workforce looks a bit too fresh-faced in their eyes and they\u2019re worried that Rotherham\u2019s showing biases towards younger people in the selection process. These earrings,\u201d she said, lifting them in front of Steven\u2019s bespectacled eyes, \u201cMay just be exactly what we need to prove them wrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of silence passed, no-one inside the room saying anything at all. Then suddenly Steven burst out howling, slapping his knees and snorting in a cute way that would\u2019ve sounded obnoxious back in his old body. He looked towards Liz and then onto Emma, both of their expressions rigid and stone-cold. \u201cC\u2019mon guys, you can\u2019t honestly expect me to say that\u2019s a good plan! Those stupid things don\u2019t even work anymore and when they did, they screwed me over! I\u2019ve still got my old crappy eyes right from before I swapped over! Even afterwards I must\u2019ve put those damn earrings on and taken them off a dozen times!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you didn\u2019t try it with someone else, did you? You might not be able to swap back to your old body anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven groaned as the realisation hit him. He trudged over to the desk and sat on the edge, splaying his legs out in a decidedly unladylike manner. \u201cEven if you were to try an idea as stupid as that,\u201d he whined, \u201cHow would you get anyone agree to give up their youth just for a stupid reason like this? There\u2019s only one pair of these things so you\u2019ll have to do all the swaps one at a time. It\u2019s not feasible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma giggled as she took the golden earrings from Liz and juggled them inside her palm. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry your pretty little head, Stevie,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI can be <i>very</i> persuasive when I want to be.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't swap eyes and you got her accent.  Why didn't that woman you swapped with, accuse you of stealing her body?\" Steven shrugged.  \"I think we need to experiment.\" She opened the desk drawer and pulled out the notepad she usually carried when making her rounds.  \"I'll take notes.\"  She looked over at Liz. \"We'll need another person to swap with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz leaned over towards the PA intercom. \"Who did you have in mind Emma?\" She asked.  Emma smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was thinking of you, luv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Liz asked somewhat surprised. \"What if I get stuck in Steven's body? What will Eric think when I tell him?\" She was worried about her husband's reaction.  Emma took another look at Steven's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think he'd complain.\" She turned back to Liz. \"Do you?\"  Liz looked at Steven herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the boobs are a bit smaller but I don't think he'd have a problem with anything else on that body.\" She winked at Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stood up. \"Who says I want to be in Liz's body?\" He asked Emma.  Before Emma could respond Liz butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with my body?  You'd still be younger than you were as a man.\" She poked one of his breasts with her finger. \"Just remember, I've got three years on you sunshine.\" Steven scowled at her silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Said Emma whilst clasping her hands, \"Now we've got that sorted out.  Lets see if we can reproduce what happened originally.\" She unclasped her hands and handed an earring to Steven. \"Put that on.\"  Steven put it in his ear.  She walked over to Liz who was taking her own earring out.  \"Okay Liz.  You know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Liz the earring. Liz was about to put it on when Emma stopped her. \"Wait a second till I get my notepad.\"  She leaned over to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up Emma, for some reason, I really, really want to put this on.\" Liz was having to use all her willpower to stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, just like Steven. Okay luv stop resisting.\" She started scribbling down notes.  Liz put the earring on and everything in the office went a little fuzzy for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at her hand and saw the other earring but it wasn't actually her hand.  It was the hand of the young woman Steven had swapped with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz why did you just give Steven the earring?\" Emma asked while leaning over her pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't, he did. We've swapped.\" Liz said with a slight Polish accent.  She looked at Steven again. \"And he's put his glasses on my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma and Steven in Liz's body, looked at Liz somewhat confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make sense.\" Emma said looking at both of them. \"You are still in your own body Liz. Steven is in the body he got earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it didn't work.  I'm still stuck as this woman with these huge tits.\" Steven said looking down at Liz's large breasts while grabbing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was getting frustrated. \"Those are my tits, I mean breasts.\" Emma shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, luv we've worked together for years, I know what you look like.\"  Liz was about to tell her Emma she was wrong again when she worked out what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your memories have changed.\" Liz told them.  They both looked at her sceptically. \"When Steven swapped at the car boot sale.  That woman must have had her memories changed so she though Steven's body was her own.  That's why she didn't accuse him of stealing her body.\" Emma scratched her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which would mean, the person who put the earring on second remembers but the first person doesn't.\" Emma said thinking it out.  She leaned over and noted the discovery down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't make sense either.\" Steven said as he put his hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Asked Liz in the young sexy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the earrings change our memories, how come you didn't recognise me when I turned up in this body,\" he thought about it for a few seconds then pointed at Liz, \"that body I mean. This is bloody confusing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me, I'm the only one that remembers it right.\" Liz said as she sat her body back on the desk. She kept her legs together unlike Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what err, Steven is saying. Even though I find it hard to believe, that body was a stranger to us.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see another problem.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our ages. If people's memories change, then I imagine the records will too and I'll still be thirty eight.  It won't make any difference to the average age of the workers in the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were about twenty five?\" Steven asked Liz, convinced her current body was her original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the age goes with the body.  That does help then.\" Liz said. She turned to Emma. \"You better write that down Emma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma wrote that down. \"So how old are you Steven?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm forty one.  I don't know how old this body is probably about the same, maybe a bit older.\" He said as he examined the back of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheeky bugger, I just told you it's thirty eight because that's what I was before we swapped.\" An annoyed Liz told him as she stood back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had the top of the pen in her mouth as she thought about it. \"Again Steven should think he's thirty eight but he still remembers being forty one.  There must be something else we're missing.\"  They all thought about it silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it!\" Liz practically shouted.  She put both earrings on. Everything seemed to go fuzzy again. \"I remember Steven said he put the earrings on to try and change back.  Did it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got my body now.  We must have swapped again.\"  He thought about it for a second moving his eyes from side to side. \"No we haven't, have we?\" Liz shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just remembering the swap properly now.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who is who?\" A confused Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Liz.\" Liz said from the young body. \"Your memories aren't affected any more.  I've swapped with Steven and you remember our original bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Steven has your body.  Okay so that's what happens when the second person puts on the earrings, so what happens when the first person puts them on?\"  Liz took off the earrings and handed them to Steven.  He put them in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anything happened?\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can tell.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\" Liz confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical.\" Steven said as he removed them. \"They never seemed to do anything when I wear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on.\" Liz told him as she moved her sexy body towards him. \"We've cleared out everyone's false memories, so maybe it does something else if the first person wears them before the second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded. \"You'll have to swap back to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can.\" Steven said somewhat dejectedly.  He handed Liz an earring.  She put it in her ear. \"Well here's hoping.\" Steven said as he put on the earring.  Everything went fuzzy.  Steven found the earring in his hand. He was back in his young sexy female twenty five year old body again.  His glasses were back on his nose. After the previous swap he knew he was the person with the correct memories.  He turned to Emma. \"Let me guess. You think we haven't swapped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz?\" Emma asked. Steven shook his head. \"Steven.  That makes sense you were swapped before but now you must be back in your original bodies even if I remember that body as being Liz's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Steven said. \"Liz was the first person to put on the earring, so she needs to put them on.\" He gave them to her and she put them on. Everything went fuzzy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just did what it did the last time.\" I remember I'm back in my original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not.\" Emma told her. \"As far as I remember that is Steven's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  It only affects me.\" Said Liz as she handed the earrings back to Steven. \"Put them back on.\" Steven nodded.  He put them back on and once again everything went a little fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so you are back in your originally bodies?\" Emma asked.  Both Liz and Steven nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven said \"I can't believe I'm thinking of this as my original body.  I was a man.  It seems like such a distant memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so melodramatic Steven.\" Liz told him as she rubbed his shoulder.  \"You're a pioneer.  The first of many people who'll be getting swapped around here shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma finished writing her notes. \"I think I've got it all worked out.  If one person each puts on an earring, they swap bodies mostly.  The eyes stay with the mind they belong to.  The first person to put on the earring and everyone else thinks there hasn't been a swap and their memories are adjusted.  The first person gives their earring to the second person but doesn't remember doing it.  The body's age seem to go with the body.  The mind seems to think it is the age of the body.  That could get weird if there is a big age difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to help us massively with the staffing issue though.\" Liz interjected.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the second person is unaffected by the change in memory.  If the first person puts on both earrings they are the only person made aware of the swap.  If the second person puts on both then everyone becomes aware.  I think that's about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Steven  asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,  you are going to get changed into a company uniform.  Don't think swapping bodies is going to allow you to get away with skiving off work.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz disappeared out the office with Steven, leaving Emma on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally she'd be back on her computer. Right now she was far too excited to play Solitaire.  She wanted to make use of the earrings but she wasn't sure how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she needed a brief distraction and chose to touch up her make up.  She opened her desk drawer and pulled out the vanity mirror she kept in there.  As she applied the make up, she looked at her face.  She didn't think of herself as old yet but she knew she wasn't young any more.  She looked at the crows feet at the corners of her eyes and the few wrinkles around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her fingers through her dark hair.  She had to dye it more regularly now to stop the grey creeping through. She thought about how much longer it took to get over an illness or a hangover for that matter.  Emma suspected she had started to go through the early stages of the menopause, having the occasional hot flush.  She felt like time was slowly catching up with her.  \"It would be great to be a young again.\" She said out loud to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked idea suddenly popped into her head.  She put the mirror away.  Emma pulled out her mobile phone and called her daughter Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was currently at home in the living room, sitting on the sofa, watching television and eating her breakfast.  Her phone began ringing. \"Hi mum.  What's up?\" She asked as she answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could pop by work luv.  I may have a lead on a job for you.\"  Alice was currently 'looking' for a temporary summer job before starting university. She yawned in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be there in couple of hours.\" She said sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you need to come as soon as possible.  The interview is today.  I just found out about it.\" Emma lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should wear that outfit I got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the mini-me one?\"  She laughed at the derisory term she used for the outfit that resembled her mother's work clothes.  It consisted of black trousers and a white blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's professional.\" Emma insisted.  Maybe it was a step too far she thought.  She was starting to have doubts about this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly trendy though.  I'm kind of in the middle of something right now anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can afford to miss an episode of This Morning.\" Emma told her referring to the daytime talk show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Homes Under the Hammer actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed.  \"The point is you're wasting your whole day away doing nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just gone ten o'clock.  That's hardly the whole day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've been up since seven.\" Emma really didn't want to get angry with her. The poor girl was just relaxing after finishing school.  She couldn't blame her for that.  Emma was starting to reconsider her whole plan. She calmed herself down. \"There's more to life to sitting in your PJs, watching daytime TV and eating cornflakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" Alice insisted, \"it's Weetabix.\"  This instantly angered Emma again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the Weetabix is mine.\"  Emma was annoyed by the cheek of the girl, stealing it.  This decided it for Emma.  Her plan was going ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fancied a change.\" <i>Me as well</i>, Emma thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you got a job you could buy your own bloody Weetabix.\" Emma told her in the well established tone of a parent.  Alice mimicked her nagging silently.  \"And stop making faces.\" She told her after using her parental telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mum.\" Alice said with only the slightest hint of sarcasm. \"I'll get the bus, should be there in about an hour or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is urgent. Get a taxi and wear the outfit.\" Emma changed to a sweet tone. \"See you soon, luv you.\" She hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stepped into the manager's office just under an hour later.  Emma who had been waiting impatiently, closed her computer and stood up to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Honey.\" Emma said in a friendly manner as she looked at Alice in her business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this job is worth it.  I feel silly in these clothes.\" Alice told her as she looked at their nearly identical outfits.  Emma frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad news I'm afraid.  They already hired someone.  One of their temps it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great. All this effort for nothing.\" Alice said as she put down her hand bag on the desk. \"You could have phoned.  Where was it for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma thought of something on the spot. \"Our store in Barnsley.\"  Emma said in that unique way all people from Yorkshire say Barnsley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like I dodged a bullet. I'm glad I'm not going to Barnsley every day. Well, if I hurry back I might catch Bargain Hunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't run off.\" Emma said pulling out the earrings.  \"I picked these up today.  They are antiques.  I thought you could tell me what you thought.\" She handed one to Alice. She looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are kind of pretty,  I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Model it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My piercings have sealed up.  I need them redone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know luv.  I think these earrings have a special attachment.  Just try please.\" Emma insisted.  Alice shrugged with her eyebrows and put the earring to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow. It does attach.\"  Emma instantly felt the compulsion to put on the other earring.  She didn't resist.  Everything went fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked down and saw the other earring in her hand.  She looked up and found herself facing herself.  It was such a strange sensation she could barely keep a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny, mum?\" Alice asked in Emma's middle-aged voice. She picked up her own handbag.  Emma noticed, finding it interesting that the hand bag's ownership didn't swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" She lied, in her new voice.  She grabbed her own handbag and pulled out her purse.  She noticed Alice's nails were unvarnished.  She reached in and pulled out a twenty pound note.  \"This is for your taxis.  Get yourself some lunch with change.\"  Alice took the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mum.\" Alice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sat down behind the desk and opened her computer.  She looked up. \"I'll see you later.\" She returned to looking at her computer indicating that the conversation was over.  Alice turned round and walked out closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma leaned back on her seat, in her new young body and smiled. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Time for a bit of an appraisal, I think.\" Emma said out loud.  It still made her feel giddy talking in this new voice.  She pulled her mirror out her drawer again.  She spent several minutes examining her new face.  She was familiar with it of course but she'd never seen it from this angle before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noted Alice's facial resemblance to her own.  It seemed even more noticeable now.  Many family members had commented on how much Alice looked like a younger version of her mother.  In fact she clearly remembered someone using the word clone as a joke.  That suited Emma just fine.  If you were to get a younger body and you were generally happy with your looks surely you'd want some familiarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found it quite difficult to tell if she had her original eyes.  Like her facial features Alice's eye colour was similar to Emma's.  On closer inspection though, she was fairly sure she had kept the originals.  They just looked 'older'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent quite a bit of time making faces in the mirror.  She finished by pursing her lips several times and giggling each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the mirror down and ran her fingers through her hair.  It felt silkier than her own.  Emma was also aware it hadn't been damaged by years of dye treatment.  In fact she couldn't remember Alice ever dying it.  She didn't like her hair down though, especially when she was working.  She reached into the drawer and pulled out her spare scrunchy.  She quickly styled the hair into a pony tail. \"Much better.\" She said to nobody again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put the mirror back in the drawer, she spotted her handbag.  As that hadn't swapped with Alice she was curious about the contents.  She opened it.  It seemed to be all her own stuff.  She opened her purse and pulled out her driving licence.  There on the pink piece of plastic was a photo of Alice with Emma's name next to it.  She looked at the Date of Birth.  It was the same as Alice's.  As far as the world knew Emma was a few weeks shy of her eighteenth birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was even more surprised when she saw the date the licence was issued.  It was eight years ago.  \"How the hell does that work?\" Emma asked out loud.  She wondered how a nine year old girl got a driving licence.  It seemed the earrings could change more than just memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the licence away.  She knew she had to investigate the age thing more but for now she wanted to inspect the rest of her body.  She pulled out the chair and stood up.  She would have preferred a full length mirror but she could kind of see a reflection in the office window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't mind posing in front of it.  The old Tesco across the river had been demolished a few years ago.  All that was visible was the Wilko store roof.  She couldn't resist the urge to feel her own breasts.  She cupped them in her hands.  She was a little disappointed Alice's seemed a little smaller than her own.  She wasn't complaining though, she'd gained thirty years in age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved around she felt a different sensation.  It felt like her underwear was digging into her ass crack.  She slipped her fingers down to free the rogue knickers when she suddenly stopped.  \"Am I wearing a thong?\" She asked out loud after feeling the fabric. She had to see.  She quickly pulled her hand out and unfastened the trousers letting them drop to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did indeed reveal a very skimpy teal coloured thong underneath them.  She couldn't recall ever seeing thongs in Alice's laundry.  She would have had something to say about it, if she had.  That wasn't her only surprise.  There on her hip just below her non-existent waistband was a tattoo.  It was a small red heart.  \"When the hell did she get that?\" She asked both amazed and annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she felt she had a certain level of control in Alice's life, she was quickly learning there was a lot more going on than she was aware of.  She slowly pulled the trousers back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished fastening them, just as Liz walked in the door Emma had forgotten to lock.  She silently cursed herself for getting distracted by the contents of her trousers.  She put it out of her mind for now and returned to manager mode.  \"You all right Emma?\" Liz asked as she fiddled with the printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.  How are you getting on with Steven?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Stefania now.  I came up to print his, I mean her, name badge.\" She said as she loaded the name badge blank into the printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get her sorted out with a new uniform?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually,\" Liz sighed.  \"She is a total diva.  She didn't like any of the underwear I got her.  Reckoned the bras chaffed her too much.  My bras chafe too but you don't hear me complaining about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is what happens when a man is in a woman's body.  They complain about all the stuff we take for granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Liz said as she opened the badge template on her computer.  \"Anyway she ended up dressed.  Our uniforms aren't designed for ladies with his proportions.  He's quite the sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine. So how are you explaining our new staff member?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we're telling everyone Steven has gone on a course.  We're going to say Stefania's a trainee assistant supervisor who is getting sent to a different store.\" Liz explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Parkgate or Meadowhall?\" A worried Emma asked, referring to the two nearby stores in the out-of-town shopping centres.  \"The staff know loads of people from there.  They'll find out.\" Liz shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic.  Barnsley.\"  She said as the badge started printing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed with relief.  \"Thank goodness.  Our staff wouldn't know anyone from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would want to?\" Liz asked rhetorically with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was amazed that she could chat to Liz in Alice's body like normal and she was completely unaware.  She was quickly getting used to experiencing a swap first hand.  She decided to put the memory alteration to the test.  \"How many years have we worked together now Liz?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had a thoughtful look on her face as she stood up.  \"What's it been? Three or four years since you started here.\" She said as she walked over to the printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded.  \"Yeah four years I think.  I was pretty young back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure were.  I remember you could barely fill a bra when you started.\" She said laughing.  Emma remembered Alice had been fairly flat chested till she got a growth spurt about three years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still drove to work though, right?\" Emma asked.  Liz stopped and stared at her. Liz eyed her manager suspiciously.  \"Of course.\" She said slowly.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've used them, haven't you?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The earrings, you've used them.  Standing there grinning and asking me strange questions.\"  Liz correctly deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Emma said grinning even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it.  Oh my God, did you swap with me?  Is that my body?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, you're being paranoid love.\" Emma reassured her.  Liz still unconsciously stood away from her. \"Look I'll prove it.\" Emma picked up the earrings and handed them to Liz. \"Put these on and you'll know.\"  Liz slipped them on her ears and the room went fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you telling me I saw her in your body?\" Liz asked.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should still see me as Emma though.  We didn't swap, so how come the earrings are making you see the truth?\" Emma asked a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we assumed a few things when we were doing the experiments with Stefania.  It looks like anyone who wears the earrings sees the truth.  The only person it seems to make a difference with, is the person who put on the second earring.  They cancel it out for everyone.\"  Liz deduced from what she'd seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to take more care with who gets to wear them after a swap.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you swap with Alice anyway?\"  Liz wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are expecting the staff to swap for the good of the store.  I wouldn't expect them to do anything I wasn't prepared to do myself.\" Emma said like a General talking about their troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you pick someone from the store? Is what I meant Emma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well err, I thought it made sense to swap with a family member first.  I thought it would be easier. This way I don't have to be an interloper in a family of strangers.  I wouldn't have to locate the other person's house either.\"  Emma felt she'd covered up her own selfish motivations pretty well with her explanation.  She certainly wasn't going to mention the stolen Weetabix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded but still felt a bit cynical about Emma swapping with her teenage daughter.  \"So you aren't planning on swapping out before the end of shift then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to call her in here again today.  The last thing I want is for her to get suspicious.  I can do it when I get home.\"  She could see Liz wasn't convinced.  \"It's been a learning experience too. I've already found out...\" She paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Liz asked now curious. Emma lowered her voice and leaned closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice has got a tattoo.\" She leaned back and made a 'what do you think of that?' expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was a little surprised.  \"She's managed to keep that hidden from you?\"  Emma nodded.  \"Is it a boy's name or something juicy like that?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a heart on her hip, it must be nearly an inch across.\" Emma said trying to impress her assistant manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's hardly anything these days.  Courtney's got a fire breathing dragon right across her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I don't need to know.\"  After Liz's revelation, Emma considered she was a bit more out of touch with young people than she liked to admit.  \"That's the only one I've found so far anyway.\" She was feeling a little jealous now that she knew tattoos were commonplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you are going to check? Don't you think that's, you know, a bit of an invasion of privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changed days luv.  Do you think Stefania cares about the privacy of the body she's in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right. If someone's mind is in it, realistically the body belongs to them.\" Emma was pleased, Liz had came round to her way of thinking.  \"Speaking of you and Stefania, I thought the whole point of this was to increase the age of our staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Emma could see where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have forty members of staff here.  You've lost, what thirty years,\" Emma nodded, \"and Stefania has lost about fifteen.  That's forty five years roughly. Between the pair of you, you've managed to knock the average of the staff down by over a year.  We are going in the wrong direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, aiming to go work for corporate one day Liz?\" Emma asked sarcastically.  \"You sure seem bothered by following their directives to the letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just don't want us to get into any more bother from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a manager I probably don't count and even if I do, I'm going to class this,\" she pointed at her body with both hands, \"as a managerial perk.\"  She could see the looks Liz was giving her.  \"We'll get it sorted out eventually.  Don't get you knickers in a twist luv.\"  Emma said as she sat back down at her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I'm getting cold feet about all this now.\" Liz said worried about the way it was effecting Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try it.  Swap with Courtney.  At least you'll be doing something productive with her body. Look at Alice, if I hadn't swapped with her she'd be wasting her days away watching TV and stealing my Weetabix.  Now her body is actually doing something constructive with its youth.\" Emma said as she started up Solitaire on the computer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once she was sure Liz was away, Emma closed her computer down.  She opened the drawer again to grab her vanity mirror.  \"You know I really should check this body for any more hidden surprises.\" She said to herself.  She twisted her head in the other direction.  \"That sure sounds like a good idea Emma.\"  She giggled as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Emma there was a small bathroom attached to the manager's office.  The managers weren't expected to use the regular toilets.  It was yet another symbol of the 'them and us' mentality of employers when it came to staff, in many large workplaces throughout the nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a managerial perk though, it wasn't particularly impressive. It was tidy enough, John cleaned it personally, not that it required much cleaning as it was only used by two people in a shop with forty workers.  It was pretty small though.   It's contents were unimpressive, there was just a toilet and a hand basin with a mirror above it.  It was usually illuminated by a small skylight covered in bird droppings.  Luckily someone had the good sense to install an extractor fan near the skylight, so nasty aromas weren't an issue in the manager's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked into the tiny dingy room.  She would never describe it as impressive but it was just about suitable for what she had in mind.  She shut the door and locked it with a well worn snib.  After putting the vanity mirror on the toilet cistern, she started undoing the buttons on her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way down the stairs Liz started to reconsider Emma's suggestion.  She originally hadn't been keen on the idea of swapping with Courtney.  It certainly wouldn't help with the staffing issue but why shouldn't she get herself a younger body too?  It wasn't as big an age change for her either. Just fifteen years rather than thirty.   The apparent issues Emma had with the generation gap wouldn't be as big a problem for her. The pros seem to add up in Liz's mind while the cons were rationalised away.  She giggled at the thought of going all the way with the swap. Let Courtney be the one to deal with looking after her little brother.  Liz would be free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted when she reached the bottom of the stairs.  She could see a figure skulking in the shadows in a dark corner of the corridor.  Liz mentally reminded herself to mention the broken light bulb to John yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her eyes adjust to the darker area she could make out the silhouette of the skulker.  Actually it was pretty easy to recognise.  \"Stefania what are you doing?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know it was me?\" Stefania asked back, stepping out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Liz asked as she glanced at Stefania's breasts.  Stefania just stared back.  \"Apart from me you've got the biggest boobs in the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see.\" She seemed a little distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those nipples should come with a government warning.  If Health and Safety saw them, they'd shut the store down or make us fit warning lights.\" Liz joked.  Stefania stared off into space not responding.  \"So anyway, what you doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just taking a breather.  Everything has been a bit, intense.\"  She told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shop busy?\" Liz asked.  Stefania shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just the guys have been keeping me really, occupied.\"  She looked Liz in the eyes.  \"You know normally I can go a whole shift and nobody will come up to me.  Usually I have to go chasing people.  Today, I can barely turn around without one of the blokes being in my face with a price query or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Liz asked pretending to be concerned but actually completely unsurprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I tell them what they need to know, then they start asking me other questions that aren't work related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing inappropriate I hope.\" Liz asked.  Stefania shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Stuff like, do I have a boyfriend?  Do I have plans for the weekend?  Do I prefer tall guys or short ones?  Stupid stuff like that.\"  Liz kept nodding sympathetically.  \"They've been complimenting me too.  They keep saying things like, I'm the best supervisor they've ever had, I'm very understanding or telling me they like my uniform.   They seem to get in my personal space more than they normally would too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz couldn't believe Steven had got through forty one years of life with this level of naivety when it came to men's motives.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately it goes with being a woman.  It shouldn't but it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really want to be a guy again.  I need to track down my body or swap with another guy as soon as I can.\" Stefania's eyes were nearly tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, Stefania.  I'm sure you can handle being female for a couple of days.  I've managed it for nearly forty years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm worried Liz, I'm worried I'm going to start liking the attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was currently naked in the small toilet.  She had decided to strip completely down.  This included her shoes and knee high pop socks.  Her blouse and trousers hung on the hook on the back of the door.  Her matching teal, thong and bra sat on the cistern.  The tag on the bra had informed Emma she was now a B-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was bent over in an unusual position looking into the vanity mirror.  She was trying to look at her back and bum in the reflection of the mirror above the hand basin.  She carefully angled the mirror to see different parts of her body.  Eventually she put her tired arms down. Her extensive examination had failed to find any other tattoos on Alice's body. After what Liz had told her earlier about their popularity, she was somewhat disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other major surprise was her bush, or the lack of one.  She was completely shaved.  This made perfect sense considering Alice's apparent fondness for thongs.  This was a new experience for Emma, she'd never been shaved or waxed bald before.  She turned round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wash basin mirror was surprisingly large.  She could actually see a good amount of her naked body.  Emma was actually becoming quite fond of the smaller breasts and nipples.  She rubbed her hands and down her bare arms feeling the soft supple skin.  She looked at her unpainted nails again.  A trip to Beautylicious was definitely required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to look at Alice's pale alabaster skin.   There seemed to be masses of it.  A blank canvas almost.  She fantasised about getting a tattoo herself.  She immediately felt her pulse raise.  She could hear the blood from her young heart pumping through her ears.  She felt herself tingle all over.  Her pussy seemed to be drawing her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned cheekily at herself as her reflected hand moved downwards and disappeared out of view in the hand basin mirror.  \"Oh I'm soooo naughty.\" Emma said in her sexiest voice.  \"Mmmm....\" Her fingers made contact with the moist folds of skin.  She closed her eyes.  \"Mmmm.... On company time too.\"</span></div></div>",

It did cross Liz's mind that maybe she had been a bit hasty expecting Steven to adapt quite so quickly.  He was genuinely struggling with all the male attention.   His ego seemed surprisingly fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz excused herself to go into the corridor.  After all the soul searching, she was determined to get Courtney's body today.  She called her on her mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Liz.\" Courtney said.  Liz could hear the sound of traffic in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been shopping all day.  I'm in town right now.\"  Courtney informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what did you buy?\" Liz asked, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I'm skint.\" She said some what unhappily.  Courtney had been looking for an excuse to get out the house and window shopping was the best idea she could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you far away from my shop?\" Liz asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can swing by.  I need to talk to you about something.\"  There was a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was crossing the road.\" Courtney said. \"Can't it wait? We'll both be home in a couple of hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it needs dealing with now.\"  Liz said, becoming insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want dad to know then?\"  It was a logically conclusion for Courtney to come to.  Liz didn't want Eric to know but she really hadn't thought about that part when she contacted Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just come by the shop.  I'll explain everything then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Courtney entered the store.  Liz met her just inside the main door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had planned on doing the swap in the manager's office.  When she went up to retrieve the earrings she'd heard sexual moaning from the toilet.  She left a quick note for Emma while she was there. She'd explained she'd taken the earrings.  Liz left the office as quickly as possible, not wishing to hear Emma's squeals of self gratification any longer than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz needed to find somewhere else reasonably private, quickly.  The logical choice was the break room.  Stefania was in there of course but she knew about the earrings so Liz didn't think that would be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Courtney.\" Stefania said, automatically as her and Liz walked in.  The Polish beauty immediately blushed with embarrassment as she remembered she wasn't supposed to know her.   She had messed up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know you?\" Courtney asked a little surprised.  Stefania couldn't use the name badge excuse this time.  She just looked at her blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of.\" Stefania admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's part of the reason I brought you here.\" Liz told her step-daughter.  \"Sit down please.\" A confused Courtney pulled out a chair and sat down.  Liz put the earrings on the table. Liz took a deep breath. \"Now Courtney the reason I asked you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Code three hundred! Code three hundred!\" Natalie's loud voice came out the PA intercom speaker, interrupting Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Liz said.  Natalie was requesting a manager urgently.  She hoped Emma would deal with it but given what Liz had heard earlier she doubted it very much.  She waited a few seconds.  Nothing happened. \"As I was saying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Code three hundred! Code three hundred!\"  Natalie's voice was practically screaming into the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, don't go anywhere.  I'll be right back.\"  Liz said to Courtney who was also aware of the code meant.  She nodded towards her step-mother.  Liz shot off out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney turned to face Stefania and the two women smiled awkwardly at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried phoning Emma first,\" Natalie said, \"but there was no answer.\" Her and Liz were near the front of the store surveying the damage.  A car had mounted the pavement and hit one of the large windows at that faced the street.  The window had stopped the car but had become badly cracked in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an ambulance and police car outside.  There was also a small crowd of onlookers.  \"Nobody was hurt, were they?\" Liz asked.  Natalie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the driver is getting checked though.\"  Liz sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only just fixed that window last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later Liz was heading back to the break room.  She had popped back to the office to phone the emergency glazier and contact head office about the accident.   Emma was still locked in the toilet.  While Liz was on the phone there was no sounds coming from the small room.  She began to wonder if Emma had fell asleep in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was getting ready to leave when the moaning started again.  She wondered where Emma got the stamina from. Even in Alice's much younger body she'd been at it for several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz approached the break room she could hear the two young women talking and laughing.  She was happy they had been keeping each other company.  Upon entering she could see them sitting on both sides of a table.  Stefania's glasses sat on the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. We had a bit of an emergency. As I was saying,\" Liz looked at the two women who were both smiling at her, \"what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz,\" Stefania said, \"guess what?  We've swapped bodies.\" She pointed at Courtney.  Liz looked at them both a little confused.  It was then she noticed the earrings in Courtney's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" Courtney said.  She picked up the large glasses and put them on her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefania's body spoke again.  \"This is so cool.\" She was beaming.  \"I'm hot now!\" Courtney's body nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be so much better for me too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefania had unintentionally stolen Liz's new body from right under her nose.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liz thought about what she wanted to say. Did she actually want to admit, she had planned on taking Courtney's body for herself? Courtney might be upset with her but that was a pretty common situation.  It had been worse when she was younger, with Liz being the 'evil' step-mother.  It had got better as Courtney matured but she still had her moments.  \"I thought that's what you had in mind when you brought Courtney here.  When you brought the earrings, I was certain of it.  I took it upon myself to explain the earrings, she was sceptical at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney stepped into the conversation. \"He got me to ask questions only he'd know the answer to.   He answered them all correctly.  The thought of this hot body being mine was a no brainer to me, so we swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz put her hand over her mouth.  Steven actually believed Liz had brought Courtney here for him to do a swap with.  Steven continued talking to Liz.  \"You knew I was struggling being in that body.\"  He pointed at Courtney in Stefania's body.  \"This was amazingly kind of you Liz. You are such a thoughtful person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Courtney agreed, \"I'm glad you thought of giving me this body before anyone else.  It's really sexy.  Have you heard this accent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well just doing my bit.\" Liz lied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness.\" Steven said. \"I had started to worry I'd made some sort of mistake.  We should really have talked about it with you first.\"  Liz silently cursed him.  She had expected him to sit there quietly till she got back.  Why did he have to show some initiative for once, totally spoiling her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had planned to discuss it beforehand, you know, explore,\" Liz paused,  \"the possibilities,\" she took a deep breath,\"the consequences...\"  She noticed Courtney was wearing the badly fitting polo she'd gave Stefania.  \"You reset the awareness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded.  \"Yeah I didn't really fancy the prospect of going home to an empty house.   You've been so helpful about my sudden change.  If I start to struggle again, it will be comforting to know we'll be under the same roof at home.  Knowing me,  I'll be around you so much, I'll be like your shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Liz said without emotion.  Normally, Courtney and her didn't interact much.  Now Steven was going to be hovering around her at home.  It would be a constant reminder of the swap that could have been.  She didn't want to dwell on it too much. She turned to Courtney.  \"You realise now the awareness has been reset, everyone will think you're Stefania.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suits me.  Steven was telling me he'd made a big hit with the fellas in here.  I could do with the pay too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can handle the job?\" Liz asked.  She was a bit concerned that it could be too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've worked for the company before.  I know the procedures.  I know the job.\" She had been a temp for four months in the run up to Christmas last year.  \"I was assisting the staff supervisor directly in the Barnsley store.\" She reminded Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. \"I remember, I don't think you've ever fully recovered.\"  Courtney rolled Stefania's eyes. \"I'll have to discuss it with Emma,\" she doubted Emma would ever get out the bathroom before the end of the shift, \"at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven removed the earrings and handed them back to Liz.  She was still desperately trying to think of a way to repair this mess.  She could swap with Courtney. Stefania was indeed hot but part of her motivation was getting more normal sized breasts.  That certainly would not happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could take the direct route and swap with Steven.  She would get Courtney's body which was her original goal.  Unfortunately, that would leave Steven in her body.  Knowing how unlucky he was, that would probably end in disaster.  If it did, the last place she wanted Steven to be was in her body.  Her thoughts were interrupted by Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, I was wondering...\"  He looked a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" The distracted Liz asked.  He seemed to squirm a little in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be all right if I called you 'mum'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked around the small bathroom.  Had she passed out?  She looked down.  She was naked and leaning back on the toilet.  Her legs were spread wide in a very unladylike fashion.  One hand sat on her thigh, the other on her very wet pussy.  She moved her hand, her lips and clit looked red raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly put her legs together.  They were feeling stiff.  She pushed her arms out and braced herself on the wall.  It took a massive effort on her part but she managed to get on to her feet.  She unsteadily stepped towards the mirror.   The figure in the reflection was barely recognisable.  A combination of sweat and tears had caused all her make up to run down Alice's face.  Her skin was still sweaty.   There was a dried trail of saliva that had clearly run down her chin and on to her neck.  Much of her hair was sticking to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nipples and breasts were no longer pale, they were red like her pussy.  In a strange way it looked kind of sexy, like a young woman who had been screwing for hours.  She felt a tingle deep in her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Emma almost shouted at her reflection.  Her vocal chords strained to speak after all the moaning she'd been doing.  She had heard Liz talking in the office earlier.  She had bit her finger to stop herself moaning as she came over and over.  Thinking about it was setting her off again.  \"Get a grip Emma.  Actually don't get a grip luv, that's how I ended up in this state.\"  She picked up her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" She exclaimed when she saw it was after four.  \"I need to get cleaned up.\"  She knew with the limited facilities available it would be no easy task.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emma filled the basin with the warmest lukewarm water the shop's crappy heating system could provide.  She tried to wash herself as best she could.  It wasn't easy, given how stiff and sore she was.   Luckily she'd had the common sense to remove all her clothing before starting on her marathon masturbation session.  This meant they were reasonably clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on Alice's skimpy underwear and had a good long look at herself in the mirror.   Pulling herself away she put on the rest of the clothes.  She decided to leave the top few buttons of her blouse undone.  That is something she would never have done in her own body.   She liked to dress conservatively but Emma decided to show off Alice's body a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe re-applied the make up, using her own colours and shades.  Finally she grabbed the scrunchy and put her hair back in the ponytail.  She smiled at her reflection.  She actually looked quite presentable but she still decided, she was still going to have a long hot bath when she got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unbolted the door and stepped out.   There was no sign of Liz.  There were however a large number of post-it notes stuck to Emma's laptop.   They all appeared to be in Liz's hand writing, she put them all in a bundle in her hand.  She sat down to read them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Courtney here, took earrings.</i>\" She read out loud.  \"You did take my advice.\" She said with a grin. She discarded the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Contacted Head Office.  They'll say they'll contact insurers.</i>\" A confused Emma read.  \"What the hell happened?\" She quickly flicked through the post-its till she got to the one about the window being broken.  \"What again? We just fixed that.\"  She sighed with relief that it was nothing more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz came storming into the office.  Her body language clearly betrayed that fact she was angry.  Emma being at her desk caught her by surprise.  \"Oh, you're back.\" She observed while calming down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, looks like you've been quite busy.\" She said pointing at the post-it notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, it's all dealt with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry luv.  I did get a bit carried away.\"  Emma felt a little guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit? It's been nearly half the shift.\" An angry Liz spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I knew I could count of you to look after the place.  You're the best assistant manager anyone could ask for.  I don't tell you that often enough.\"  The compliment took the wind out of Liz's sails somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well...\" She looked down at her hands.  The earrings were in them.  \"I was bringing these back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you swap?\" An excited Emma asked.  \"You still look like you. I wouldn't know anyway.\"  Liz shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's still me.  I had planned on swapping with Courtney but Steven beat me to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz went on to explain what had happened earlier.  How Steven had swapped bodies with her step-daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cheek of it.\" Emma said.  \"He hadn't even been in that body five minutes and already he's swapped out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I've got to live with him too.\" Liz said shaking her head.  She wasn't looking forward to that all.  Although Steven generally acted civilly around others, he was unattached for good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he gets out of working here.  The lazy bugger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Courtney will be keeping his pay.\"  Liz said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are briefing each other in the break room right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma picked the earrings up and spun round, facing the large office safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Emma could open it. Liz asked \"Aren't you going to use the earrings later?\"  Emma was still in Alice's body.  She slowly spun back round.  Her face was a crimson colour.  \"No.\" She admitted.  \"I wanted to see how it changed my clothes, personal belongings and things like that.  I'm quite curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you'll be sharing a bed with Kyle, in that body.\" Liz said, pointing at her. \"I guess he won't know of course, but still.  That's Alice's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I deserve this.  I sacrificed a lot for her.\"  She couldn't think of a specific example at that exact moment.  She was sure there were plenty of times she'd given up something in life for Alice's benefit.  Weetabix popped into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but won't,\" Liz made a circle with her index finger and thumb.  She took her other index finger and pushed it in and out of the circle.  It was a commonly used crude gesture indicating sex,  \"be an issue?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked shocked and disgusted.  \"I don't think so.  I'll be having a headache tonight.  Kyle is used to them.\" She spun back round and opened the safe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe safe was ancient, older than any staff member currently in the store.  It was far too big for the cramped office. At one time it had held many valuables, important documents, pay packets, customer cheques and the like. The march of technology had made it largely redundant.  All that it was used for now was the small cash floats for the tills. It was so huge and cumbersome, it would cost too much to replace it with a smaller one. It remained as a monument to the businesses of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some unknown reason the office lights flickered slightly as the heavy door creaked open.   A musty smell came from inside. The open safe seemed to absorb light and little could be seen past the front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never appreciated how creepy that safe is.\"  Liz told Emma as she picked up the earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a safe,\" Emma said as she reached inside,\" there is nothing creepy... ...Aaahhh!\"  Emma screamed.  \"Something's got my arm,\" Emma fell out of her chair.  It looked like she was being pulled into the cavernous depths of the safe.  Liz ran round the desk to help Emma her large breasts bouncing as she went.  She wasn't entirely sure what she could do to help.  Emma was trying to shake off, whatever had grabbed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Emma stopped moving.  Her panicked expression changed to a smile as she leaned back against her chair and began laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" Liz said completely unimpressed.  She figured with the bodyswap Emma had got a more immature sense of humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her hands beside her head.  \"Oh, help me Liz, the big scary monster that hides in the safe is going to eat me up.\" Emma said sarcastically as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay I get it.  I'm a worrier.\"  Several small bags had fell out of the safe as Emma had flopped about.  She picked them up and threw them back inside. \"What are in those?\"  Emma shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea.  I really should do an inventory one day.\" Emma said as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can get you to quit solitaire,\" Emma didn't respond, \"or playing with yourself.\" She mumbled under her breath as the safe door clanged shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing.  I just noticed the time.\" Liz said as she looked at the clock.  The shop had shut ten minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz could see Steven already sitting in the passenger seat of her car as she walked off the footbridge, that led to the car park.   He had his seatbelt on and looked like he was ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was practically bouncing up and down as Liz got into the car.  His glasses nearly fell of his face.  \"This is so exciting.\" He said as he barely contained himself in Courtney's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like a big kid.\"  Liz pulled on her own seatbelt. \"Courtney is twenty two, not twelve.  You are even older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mum, it's just I'm happy to not be Stefania any more.\"  Liz cringed at him calling her mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just the two of us, you can still call me Liz.\" She started the engine.  \"Courtney calls me Liz anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww!\" Steven pouted.  \"You said I could.\"  Liz looked down at the body that should have been hers by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.  \"Just don't say it too much.\" She warned him as she drove out the car park.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They\u2019d both snuck into Elizabeth\u2019s former digs and had torn into the piles of assorted clothing dumped there. Though it\u2019d been relatively easy to pick out a reasonably presentable red polo that was just about large enough to accommodate his new proportions, it was proving nearly impossible to satisfy the bodyswapped assistant supervisor. Each bra was too chafing, each pair of slacks was too tight and each set of footwear was too constricting. Eventually after a handful more painful tries to appease She-Steven, Liz decided to just whip out a skimpy two-piece bikini set that hadn\u2019t sold the previous summer and chucked it Steven\u2019s way, consequences be damned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this? I\u2019ll look like a bloody whore if anyone sees me!\u201d Steven moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh relax, you big crybaby. No-one\u2019s gonna see it underneath the uniform anyway so why does it matter?! Look, that\u2019s the last item of lingerie that you haven\u2019t chucked back into my face so, like it or lump it, you\u2019re wearing it!\u201d Steven sarcastically mocked Liz\u2019s voice as he slipped the swimsuit on, prompting her to roll her eyes in return. \u201cWhatever,\u201d Liz chuckled sardonically as she watched Steven struggle to pull the polo over his head. As she observed him squirming and writhing she had to resist her urge to cuff him over the back of the head while he was haplessly defenceless. Instead she strode to his side and helped him like a good friend would, struggling to contend with Steven\u2019s constant wriggling but gradually pulling the shirt over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbled as his cheeks turned rosier. He pushed his glasses back onto the bridge of his nose and yelped as he peeked downwards. No wonder why, the polo that\u2019d seemed to be able to fit beforehand barely made it down to his midriff, making him look like a pale-complexioned Indian belly dancer or just your average English sket. Steven screeched piercingly as he frantically tried to pull the material downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, Liz, no way am I wearing this outside of this room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine Steven\u2019s face as he watched Liz try (unsuccessfully) to stifle her laughter by covering her mouth in her palms. \u201cC\u2019mon, luv, you\u2019re overreacting,\u201d she squealed between short bursts of laughter. \u201cHonestly, I think it <i>suits</i> you. Anyway, I\u2019m not helping you to put another one on again, you nearly took out my eye the first time! Just take these bottoms I found you and stop complaining!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grumbled as he took the slacks in his dainty hands and pulled them on. \u201cGod, I look like a 70\u2019s <i>Charlie\u2019s Angels</i> reject.\u201d He whined unceremoniously as he twirled in the breezy bellbottomed trousers. \u201cStop being a drama queen,\u201d Liz taunted as she nearly reached bursting point. To add insult to injury, Emma decided to make her presence known at that very exact moment and she was immediately dumbfounded by Steven\u2019s...<i>interesting</i> clothing ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did...? Why did you...? You know what, never mind. I just came here to hand you this.\u201d Emma passed him a laminated piece of card, his new name tag, and Steven eagerly clipped it on. Liz, ever the eagle eyed supervisor, was the first to notice a slight amendment to the text on the name tag. \u201cEmma, how come it says <i>\u2018Stefania\u2019</i> instead of Steven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smacked her forehead as she realised her mistake. \u201cSorry, luv, must\u2019ve been a typo! I\u2019ll go back and get another one printed out...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steven said in a surprisingly stoic tone. Emma and Liz stopped in their tracks. \u201cI mean, no, it\u2019s fine, Emma. Maybe assuming a new identity is the best thing, at least for now. I don\u2019t want <i>anyone</i> outside this circle knowing about what went on with me. Until we can locate my old body, I guess I can pretend to be \u2018Stefania\u2019 for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick question: do I still get the salary of an assistant supervisor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, but if you\u2019re gonna be working in the store with the others, you might not qualify...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled!\u201d Steven skipped out of the room, humming a pleasant little tune to himself while his trouser legs billowed underneath him. Meanwhile Emma and Liz looked to one another, holding off for a second before exploding into raucous laughter. Liz wiped a joyful tear from her eye before presenting the golden earrings in her right palm to Emma. \u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How will they find out about our new assistant supervisor?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get the workers you talk to, to pass it on that there is a new staff member.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably won't have to, you know the way gossip travels around this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a constant stream of talking and laughter coming from the break room as Liz and <i>Stefania</i> walked down the corridor.  Liz went in first, there were a few glances in her direction but the noisy talking continued.  When <i>Stefania</i> stepped inside, you could have heard a teaspoon drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men looked dumbstruck.  She quickly looked around the room from side to side.  Her exaggerated head movement seemed to be in slow motion to her male audience.  It gave the impression they were in some sort of shampoo advert.  Unconsciously she removed her glasses which just added to the effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer female audience stared silently for different reasons with the possible exception of Allie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone if I could have your attention for a moment.\" Liz said loudly although she didn't have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this work related? because we don't get paid for breaks.\"  Asked Michael in a militant mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I'll be brief.  Just remember who pays for your free tea, coffee and fridge when you are on your unpaid break.\" Liz said, shutting him down. She smiled at everyone. \"I want to introduce you to Stefania our new temporary assistant supervisor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has Steve been sacked then?\" Asked Aaron.  Before getting a response he continued. \"No surprise, I can understand why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the others nodded.  \"Yeah he was pretty useless.\" Said Charlotte.  <i>Stefania</i> bit her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven has not been sacked.\" Liz said loudly, she could see the annoyed look on Stefania's face.  \"He's been sent on staff training.  Stefania is training here before going to another store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\" Asked Aaron. Liz hadn't thought of one when she was putting together this hastily concocted cover story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barnsley!\" She practically spat out.  There was a large amount of sympathetic murmuring throughout the group. \"Well I'll let her introduce herself.  <i>Stefania</i> took a step forward feeling very self conscious in her new attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi everyone.  I look forward to working with you.\"  Again most of the men were spellbound by the sweet sounds coming from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Polish?\"  Kiran asked from the far end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stefania</i> nodded.  \"I think so, Kiran.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do you know my name?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stefania</i> started to panic.  She'd almost blown it already.  \"I read it on your name badge.\"  She said proudly, impressed at her own cleverness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, from over there?  They must be really good glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe break period had barely been over two minutes when Natalie came storming into the manager's office.  She nearly caught Emma finishing the pile by putting on her last King. \"What's this about Steven being replaced?  Shouldn't I be told about this?\" An angry Natalie demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz was right, word does travel fast.\" Emma said as she sat upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry luv, it was one of those last minute things.  I didn't get much notice myself.  She just appeared in our office this morning.  It caught me and Liz by surprise too.\" She said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I see.\" Said Natalie, calming down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you met the replacement yet?\"  Natalie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard conflicting stories.  Some of the staff were saying she's very beautiful and very friendly.   Others said she was rude and standoffish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've been talking to male and female staff, I'm guessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind.  Her and Liz will still be in the break room if you want to talk to her yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered the idea.  It would be a great excuse to be off the shop floor.  It was her manager's idea after all.  \"I might just do that.\" She was about to turn to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go luv, tell me what you think of these.\" Emma said as she pulled out the earrings.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Emma slyly persuaded Natalie to try on the earring, Steven was having a difficult time trying to adjust to his new predicament. He\u2019d left the break room temporarily to try and get some work done, leaving Liz to sip her tea on her lonesome. His work wasn\u2019t that hard all things considered\u2014though he still preferred to work down and amongst his colleagues, his role as a supervisor had slashed his workload in half. No, the thing that perturbed him the most were the looks he was receiving from all sides. He\u2019d noticed at least a dozen men glance his way and size him up, many of which had stars in their eyes and one brazen fella even had the nerve to catcall him. He blushed profusely, too embarrassed and too uncomfortable to react to any of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst culprits by far were his own coworkers. While many of the women stared at him purely for the sake of sizing up their new superior (Allie being the exception; her glances were a lot more lustful than anything else), the men looked at him for one reason and one reason only. And to be fair to them, Steven couldn\u2019t blame them. Heck, had a beautiful Eastern European girl been hired at the store a day before he had little doubt he wouldn\u2019t have been slobbering over her. Steven swore under his breath as he walked into the canned goods aisle. Though the loosely cut bell bottoms provided plenty leeway for his supple legs to move, the skimpy thong underneath them clung to him tighter than stink on rice. He grumbled as he slipped his dainty hand inside to try and readjust it\u2019s position, rummaging around whilst his other hand reached high to place a can of baked beans onto the top shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be no suitable placement though and after a few dozen seconds without success Steven grew frustrated. A customer looking for some canned peas strode into the aisle but soon strolled right back out, seeing a very out of context scene indeed. Steven meanwhile was still going ham on the bikini thong, using both hands now to pull the restrictive material out from his buttcrack. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on the reader\u2019s perspective of the ensuing incident, Steven\u2019s hand somehow slipped as it moved through and his manicured fingers brushed  against the edge of his clit, sending a fuzzy vibration coursing through his body from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d Steven moaned slightly. Wow. Is that what female arousal felt like? Steven swivelled his head from side to side to make sure no one was watching him. Although he wanted to try and experience that feeling again, he didn\u2019t want to be caught by a customer, or even worse, a coworker, and have to try and explain his way out of an awkward moment. Curiosity beat out caution and Steven was mere moments from trickling his fingers back inside his front when he heard a light cough over his shoulder. He reacted poorly to the surprise, stumbling in the heeled ballet flats Liz had lent to him, and would\u2019ve fallen to the ground had the stranger not caught him in their arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, sorry there,\u201d their familiar voice said as they levered Steven back upright. It turned out that the person was no stranger but was actually Luis. The Dominican born man watched silently as Steven brushed himself off and adjusted his glasses back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo sorry if I startled you, <i>chica</i>,\u201d he said in an easygoing Dominican tone. \u201cSorry, I meant to say \u2018ma\u2019am\u2019. Excuse my informality, Miss...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStefania. Just Stefania.\u201d Steven held out his hand to shake but Luis instead kissed it, eliciting a shy blush and a nervous giggle from him. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no need to call me \u2018Miss\u2019 or anything like that. Think of me as just another coworker who\u2019s covering for the assistant supervisor until he comes back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hopefully soon,</i> he grumbled internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis chuckled. \u201cHow can I think of a sweet little <i>j\u00e9von</i> like you as just another coworker?\u201d Steven blushed again and cursed himself for it. Why did this body get so flustered at every single ambiguous example of flirtation? Luis noticed \u2018Stefania\u2019\u2019s rosy cheeks and grinned partially. \u201cSorry about that, we Dominicans are natural flirts. Can\u2019t help myself. Anyways, I just came over \u2018cause I saw you struggling to put that can on the shelf. Here, let me help.\u201d Steven silently passed it over and watched as Luis stretched up and positioned effortlessly. Steven couldn\u2019t help but observe Luis\u2019 athletic figure ripple underneath the standard red polo, his tanned biceps straining the seams. Steven didn\u2019t even blame his new form for admiring Luis\u2014no homo but that dude was built like an Olympic cyclist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, Miss Stefania. Holler at me if you need anything else, y\u2019hear?\u201d Steven nodded and thanked Luis as he stepped out of the aisle. He breathed a huge sigh of relief knowing Luis hadn\u2019t seen anything. He still had the urge to experiment with his new equipment but seeing as how close he\u2019d got to getting busted before he didn\u2019t think it was the wisest idea yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now at least he\u2019d try to keep his head down and stay out of people\u2019s way as much as possible. He pulled the thong out once more and moved onto the next task set for him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had asked Natalie several times to try on one of the earrings and she had refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't really my style.\" The supervisor said a little frustrated by her manager's insistence.  Emma sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose I better come clean then.  I do have an ulterior motive.\" She admitted.  Natalie looked at her confused.  \"This should be on a need to know basis but you are the most senior member of staff after Liz.  You are higher up the totem poll than Steven, after all and he knows obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knows what?\" A confused Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, luv.  They are magical earrings.\" Emma informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are nice I suppose, if you like that kind of thing but I wouldn't say they were magical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, magical like hocus pocus.\" Emma waved her hands around like she was casting a magic spell.  Natalie stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay Emma?\" A concerned Natalie asked.  \"The stress of the job getting to you?  I know it can be tough at the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't believe me?\" Emma asked, a little disappointed.  Natalie shook her head.  \"They can swap bodies.  Steven has already used them.  Don't you think it's a bit of a coincidence his replacement who has suddenly appeared has a very similar name?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to tell me <i>Stefania</i> is really Steven in a different body?\" Emma nodded.  \"What sane woman would want to swap bodies with Steven?\" She asked, which she followed with a nervous giggle.  In her mind the whole thing was preposterous.  She did find the idea a little intriguing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want proof then?\" Emma asked.  She slipped one of the earrings into her ear.  She pulled open her drawer pulling out her make up mirror and put it in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that would be a reasonable request.\" Natalie said.  She was a little concerned she might be fuelling Emma's delusion.  Hopefully when she saw it didn't work, she would see the whole idea was silly.  Emma walked round the desks and handed her the other earring.  Unaware of the compulsion, Natalie slipped the earring on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in the office seemed to go a little fuzzy for a few seconds.  Natalie found herself holding the second earring in her hand.  She immediately noticed the nail varnish and that she wasn't wearing her polo shirt.  She looked down and saw a white blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" She asked in Emma's voice just as she saw a woman in front of her who looked very familiar. \"That's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't freak out luv.  You are in my body.\" Emma told her in Natalie's own voice. \"Actually in my mind,  I think it's still your original body.  I know we've swapped, so I really know it isn't.\" Being in someone else's body was confusing enough.  She had no idea what Emma was going on about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma lifted the earring out of Natalie's hand.  Extending her other hand, Natalie understood what she wanted.  She took the earring off and handed it to Emma.  \"I'll sort this out in a second.\" Emma said as she slipped both earrings on.  The room went fuzzy again.  \"That's better now I know that is my body.\" She said pointing at Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a trick.  You've drugged me and dressed me up in Emma's clothes.\" Natalie just couldn't believe it. Emma pointed towards herself. \"That doesn't explain me. Did I use the secret cloning machine in the stock room?\" Emma asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are obviously a body double.  You don't actually look that much like me.\"  Natalie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who is in denial?\" Asked Emma.  She pointed at the mirror in Natalie's other hand. \"Check it out for yourself.\"  Natalie lifted it to see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell!\" She practically screamed as she saw Emma's features in the mirror.  She raised her hand to touch her face just to make sure.  Along with the excitement, she felt something else.  Her underwear or rather Emma's underwear was feeling a little moist.  She wondered if being in Emma's body was turning her on.  \"The earrings are magic.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded with a smile.  She'd spent so much time trying to convince Natalie of the truth she had neglected to examine her own body.  She gently cupped her polo covered breasts.  They felt similar in size to her own but were definitely firmer.  Natalie did have ten odd years on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Natalie said when she saw what Emma was up to.  \"That's my body.\" She said, although honestly it was turning her on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine now, luv.\" Emma told her as she put her hands on her hips.  She rubbed them too, moving slowly round to the backside of Natalie's younger body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can swap back right?\" A worried Natalie asked her manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anytime but do you want to?\" Emma asked.  If this had been purely a hypothetical situation, discussed beforehand Natalie would have definitely said yes.  Now she was actually here and experiencing it, she wasn't so keen to swap back.  There was also the fact she was finding being in Emma's body just a little bit sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try it for a little while,  I suppose.\" Emma grinned. \"So I have to pretend to be you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want but right now the rest of the world sees us as ourselves.  You can just be yourself with the knowledge you're in my body.   If you put both earrings on, everyone will see us normally and you will have to pretend to be me.\"  Emma explained.  \"Either way, bed time with our husbands tonight will be interesting.\" Emma winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I wasn't meaning for that long.  I just meant a couple of hours or till the end of shift.\"  Said Natalie in Emma's shocked voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just pulling your leg luv.\" Emma said a little unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie wanted to change the subject.  She didn't really want to dwell on the ideas Emma had presented. \"Where did the earrings come from?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea.  Steven found them at a car boot sale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to know a lot about how they work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've done some testing.\" Emma admitted.  She looked at Natalie's watch.  \"Time is rolling on.  One of us is going to have to go downstairs.  Who is it going to be?\" </span></div></div>",

Though she found the idea of infiltrating Emma\u2019s life and becoming the manager for a day intriguing, what she\u2019d just learnt was a lot to process and trying to pass as someone else might just overwhelm her. \u201cI appreciate the offer, Emma, but for now I think I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s too much for right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grinned and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cFair enough. Guess it\u2019s for the best. I wouldn\u2019t want to make things awkward between you and your family by acting weird. Though I\u2019d love to see little Harry and squeeze his cute widdle cheeks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can still do that. How about you and Kyle come over for dinner tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great! It\u2019s been too long since we\u2019ve shared a proper cuppa and convo. I\u2019ll bring Alice and Grace while I\u2019m at it, they absolutely adore you! Well, Grace definitely does\u2014Alice is in one of her irritable phases in which she hates absolutely everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both chuckled. Emma grinned mischievously as she looked downwards to her new form. \u201cHoly moly, I haven\u2019t felt this spry in years!\u201d Natalie shifted uncomfortably as she watched Emma use her former hands to cup her bosom and jiggle them around. \u201cDamn, not even a sign of sagging in these girls... Sorry Natalie, but...\u201d Emma moaned sensually as she played around with Natalie\u2019s now erect nipples inside her polo. Natalie blushed as conflicting thoughts entered her mind; as strange as the scene was, something about seeing herself (or Emma in her body as she had to remind herself) masturbating in front of her turned her on. Despite being close to menopause, Emma\u2019s snatch was surprisingly active and made Natalie very restless indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s enough, Emma,\u201d Natalie said, her bottom lip placed in a stranglehold between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Natalie? So soon? Come on, luv, I didn\u2019t even get a chance to do this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie winced as she watched Emma slip her fingers inside her black slacks. After a few tense moments of rummaging, Emma finally found her target, plunging a tentative index into Natalie\u2019s welcoming pussycat. Emma groaned as her finger brushed past the clit and then deeper into Natalie\u2019s crevice. \u201cGod,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly <i>tight</i>...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprisingly?\u201d Natalie giggled nervously as she felt herself getting more sweaty by the second. She placed her hands nervously into her lap but took them off as she felt a damp patch slowly stretching out like wet tendrils onto the front of her black bottoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma spotted Natalie\u2019s unease and decided to screw around with her. She steadily began increasing her volume, playing up each plunge verbally and moaning like one of the C-list pornstars she\u2019d seen Alice watching once. Soon enough and Natalie\u2019s groans synchronised with Emma\u2019s own, creating a sexual symphony that Mozart himself would be proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d Natalie yelled in between groans, her cheeks puffing and her trousers dripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma rolled her eyes but laughed nonetheless. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun, I was <i>so</i> close to making you orgasm.\u201d Emma giggled as she took her fingers out of her pants and licked them clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shrugged. \u201cHow else do you want me to clean \u2018em? In ten years or so when you get to my stage, you\u2018ll learn to appreciate the kinkier moments in life. Actually scratch that: you\u2019re already at that point right now! Anyway, I can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so peeved. You seemed to be loving it a few minutes ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie blushes again. \u201cOk, maybe it turned me on a little, but that doesn\u2019t excuse you jacking yourself in my body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not, Natalie, but your kitty\u2019s a treat. Mike\u2019s a lucky fella...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything so sexual with you?! Let\u2019s change the subject.\u201d Natalie harrumphed loudly and crossed her arms. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said as she felt the wet material around her new crotch. \u201cHappen to have any spare underwear lying about? I seem to have... ugh, <i>creamed</i> myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, hun. I always bring a spare set of trousers to the office with me. You know, just in case. Just pop your head into that little box in the corner and sort yourself out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just get them for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma\u2019s pale blue eyes sparkled mischievously. \u201cWell in normal circumstances it\u2019d be no problem, luv, but these are <i>far</i> from normal circumstances. It\u2019s been fun being you for these fun few moments but me and Liz have got some... <i>\u2018staff restructuring\u2019</i> to do that requires me to maybe pick up a few new bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so you\u2019re just going to give my body to some random goon off the street?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Well at least probably not. It\u2019s hard to explain but trust me, we\u2019ll find a way to make sure you can get back to your body if needs be. For the meantime have fun in my body. It may be slightly older but its still got a heck of a long way to go before its ready to settle down, if you know what I mean!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie pondered whether she should explode or not before dropping her shoulders and sighing her worries away. \u201cFine,\u201d she said begrudgingly. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with the magical earrings so I don\u2019t think I have much say in the matter. Just know I trust you Emma and I know you won\u2019t let someone screw around with my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re trust is much appreciated, Natalie. Don\u2019t worry about it though, I\u2019ll make sure if I do leave your body, I\u2019ll leave it in responsible hands.\u201d A thought popped up in Emma\u2019s mind and she quickly darted to her handbag. She ruffled a few papers round before pulling out a chic pair of glasses and placing them on Natalie\u2019s forehead, resting on the front of her new shoulder-length brunette hair. \u201cAlmost forgot these. I\u2019d be half blind walking round the store without them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey look good on me,\u201d Natalie giggled. In the reflection of the glasses she could see her own eyes lodged firmly in Emma\u2019s eye sockets, colour unchanged and shining brightly back at her. \u201cSo if you\u2019re gonna get up to more hijinks with those earrings, what am I supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the time being just get back to work. No one can tell we\u2019ve swapped bodies so everything will basically stay the same. Maybe you can keep an eye out for good customers that we can use as body donors, y\u2019know ones that look a bit more mature but not old and decrepit. Think you can do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. No problem.\u201d Natalie waved goodbye and quickly exited the room, stumbling slightly as she was unused to her new sense of gravity and Emma\u2019s 2-inch t-bar heels. Emma chuckled as the door closed behind Natalie. She had a newfound sense of confidence in her gait as she sashayed up to her chair and crashed down into it. She laughed to herself as she replayed their meeting in her head. She didn\u2019t know whether it was the fact that she\u2019d suddenly lost 10 years or if it had been the swap that had increased her libido but she was still feeling horny as hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe discreetly lowered the hem of her black slacks and reached inside with curious fingers once more. Had anyone walked past they might\u2019ve heard the occasional moan escaping through the door. However, Emma was too lustful and too preoccupied to care anyway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emma was determined to finish what she had started in Natalie's body.  Her limber legs were wide open and her hand buried deep in the crotch of her black slacks.  Her knuckles were visible moving under the tight fabric.  She couldn't remember the last time she'd been this horny.  Her fantasy had started with her husband Kyle.   She found herself unconsciously moving on, imagining sex with some of the better looking male workers in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the orgasm build quickly.  She let out one last long moan, before silence came as she hit her crescendo.   She couldn't draw breath as she came all over her panties.  The pleasure was just too much, she gripped on to the chair with her spare hand fearing she'd lose her balance. \"Oh yesssss!\" She screamed as her breath returned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that exact moment Liz walked into the office after her tea break.  Emma had locked the door after Natalie left but Liz had her own key.  Emma had been so lost in pleasure she hadn't even heard it turning in lock.  \"Bloody Hell Emma!\" Liz said.  She slammed the door shut as she stepped backwards in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer manager was panting like a dog on a hot day, her face covered in perspiration.  Her hand was deep in her slacks which had been pulled down over her hips.  Her eyelids were half closed and she was grinning.  It was quite the spectacle for the assistant manager.  Emma slowly regained her composure as Liz stared at her. \"What?\" Emma asked.  \"Everybody does it.   That's what Alice told me when I caught her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the middle of the manager's office they don't.\" Liz said as Emma pulled her hand out her slacks with a noticeable plopping sound.  Liz face took on a slightly disgusted look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't help myself.  I think this body is sex obsessed.\"  Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've swapped?\" Liz asked.  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's...\" She never got the chance to finish.  Liz put her hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me.  I had an idea when I was on my tea break. Where are the earrings?\" Emma was going to push them towards her but she didn't have the energy.  She vaguely pointed towards them and collapsed back in her chair.  Liz picked them up and put them on.  The room went fuzzy for a few seconds.  \"Natalie?\" A surprised Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that?\" An equally surprised Emma asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to thinking, we never tried putting the earrings on someone who wasn't part of the swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma thought back to earlier.  Liz was right she hadn't. \"I wouldn't make a very good scientist.\" She admitted.  \"I'm guessing because you can see me, it is the same effect as for the first person who put an earring on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it.\" Liz said.  \"Natalie eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted to know about Stefania but when I explained about the earrings she wouldn't believe me and so here I am.\" Emma said raising her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering why you were wearing a polo.  I know it's not strictly against policy but I've never seen you wear one since you started here.  I'm going to start noticing stuff like that all the time now and think people have been swapped.  I'll get suspicious of anyone acts slightly out of character.\"  She put the earrings back on the desk.  \"So what's Natalie's body like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.   I haven't had a good look but she's so slim, you'd never guess she's had a kid.  It took me years to get my figure back after Alice.  As for these.\" She cupped her breasts.  \"Much firmer than mine.  If I had to guess I'd say she was in her twenties not mid thirties.\"  She looked at the fluid drying on her fingers.  She grabbed a wipe to remove it. \"And horny, wow. I've been gushing since we swapped.\"  Liz looked intrigued.  \"I think Natalie is a bit of a wolf in sheep's clothing, she must be amazing in bed.\" Emma said concluding her review of the staff supervisor's body.  She saw Liz licking her lips a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma narrowed her eyes as she looked at the hunger in Liz's own eyes.  \"Are you wanting a go?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\" Her eager colleague said as she grabbed an earring. \"Wait, I'll go first.\" Emma said as she picked up her earring.  The room went fuzzy as they swapped places.  Liz found herself in Emma's chair.  Emma was standing beside her after putting the earring in her hand.  Emma spotted the earring and took it out Liz's hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what to do Liz pulled out her earring and handed it to Emma.  She put them both on and the room went fuzzy.  She looked downwards. \"Wow, Liz luv how do you know where to put your feet?\"  Her view was obscured by Liz's large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decades of practice.\" She admitted as she grabbed her own much smaller breasts. \"I haven't been this small since I was thirteen.\" She said, a stray strand of hair, fell across her face.  She blew it away and didn't taken her hands of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma recalled the task Liz had been assigned while in the break room.  \"How did you get on finding people for swaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if anyone would be interested working on a special secret company project.\" She moved one hand downwards over Natalie's slim belly.  \"I did get a few people interested, mostly the brown nosers though.  I think we'll maybe need to offer some incentives.\"  Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm off to do my rounds.  I'll maybe offer them some gift tokens or something.  That might help.\" She picked up her notepad. \"I'll leave you in peace, luv.\" She said to Liz with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz got up as Emma headed towards the door.   She almost lost her balance to begin with as she stepped forward.  She wasn't used to not having as much weight up front and her body was quite tired. \"Where are you going?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike you I'm planning on using a little decorum.  I'm going to use the bathroom, besides I'm quite interested to see what my breasts look like now. I'm not going topless in the middle of the chuffing office.\" She said as she stepped into the manager's toilet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her only real cause for concern were the the black Prada loafers that Liz had worn that squeezed dangerously on her dainty little toes inside. A bit clunky for her taste but it really made no difference to Emma\u2014her focus was unwavering as she scanned each passing customer and coworker in sight and approximated age assessments for each and every one of them. She also, obviously, wasn\u2019t just gauging them on their ages alone. Though she wanted a more mature look aesthetically, she\u2019d no intentions of swapping decades-old dinosaurs into the fray just for the sake of appeasing corporate. No, she wanted to give herself some good eye candy to stare at during the shift. Especially now that she had Liz\u2019s younger snatch she was hungry for some stimulation and the urge needed to be sated quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a few customers in the range from cute to appealing but none stood out as significant candidates worthy of mention. There was a bloke who looked decently hung that Emma would\u2019ve tried her luck with had she had the opportunity to speak with him, but he exited the store as quickly as he came with his dumbbells and shaving cream tucked underneath his arms. That brought up a new question for Emma; though she was still quite uncertain about the nature of the swapping abilities given by the earrings, the prospect of hopping into a male body and experiencing the throes of a male orgasm made her so giddy she was practically foaming at the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what\u2019s the best way to do that?\u201d she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering there weren\u2019t any, quote unquote, \u2018prize male specimens\u2019 laying about in the customer gene pool available to her, Emma decided she\u2019d just play it safe and stick to the store\u2019s employees. Emma slyly gave Liz\u2019s nipples a slight tweak for motivation before she set off to look for her next target.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She occasionally pretended to write a few scribbles in her notepad to make others think she was actually paying attention to what was going on.  It also helped keep the workers on their toes, as they became paranoid she was writing about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon saw Stefania.  There were a group of men round her. Emma thought she looked a little flustered.  As Emma walked towards the group, one of the guys spotted her.  She could see them talking amongst themselves.  They all walked off in a hurry pretending to be doing it casually, like they hadn't just been spotted shirking work by a manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you doing, luv?\"  Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I guess Emma.\"  Stefania said.  Emma grinned at Stefania's complete inability to tell she was actually in Liz's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was all that about with the guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they were just being friendly to the new girl.  Welcoming me to the store that sort of thing.\" Emma nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay but it shouldn't be taking them away from their own work.\"  Stefania nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kept telling them that too but they just seemed to change the subject on to work related matters for a little while before talking about me again.  It made it difficult to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of them must think I have a bad memory or something, they keep introducing themselves and telling me they are single.  Even the ones that aren't.  I honestly don't know what's so interesting about me.  I guess it must be these stupid clothes or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked down a Stefania's body.  The outline of the bikini she wore under her polo was pressing into the fabric.  Her breasts pushed the polo shirt out so far, when she was standing straight, it hung away from her body.  It revealed a enticing sliver of her slim belly.  The oversized trousers whilst massively flared at ankle level, got tighter and tighter as you moved upwards. Her large ass looked like it was just about ready to escape from it's confines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded.  \"Yeah, it might be the clothes.\" She told the oblivious Stefania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to spend any longer than I have to in this body.  I could ask one of the guys if they want a swap and get a male body at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we don't want to start over complicating things right now.   Honestly I don't think the guys would want a swap with you,  anyway.\" Emma told her assistant supervisor in a dismissive fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem pretty interested to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but being a woman is completely different from just looking at an attractive one.   For one thing, it takes a bit more effort to get yourself off.  Most men like the easy route, just grab hold of your dick and give it a few tugs.\" Emma suddenly realised she was unconsciously mimicking jerking off with her hand.  She put her hand down quickly and looked around to see if she had been spotted.  \"Anyway, you get my point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefania nodded.  She understood was Emma was saying, she hadn't expected her to be so graphic about it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was topless and sitting on top of the toilet.  Her slacks pulled down to her knees, so she could get easier access to Natalie's pussy.   Emma had been so right about this body.  It's sex drive seemed never ending.  She'd already orgasmed several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also got to see more of it than Emma.  Natalie's tits were fantastic to look at it.   They were so firm Liz doubted Natalie needed a bra.  Liz was actually a little bit jealous.  Bras had been a fact of life for Liz for the past twenty five years.  Even resting in bed could be painful without one.  Yet another reason Liz wore a bra, was her large nipples.  Without it her arousal would be obvious, her nipples poking through her top.  Natalie's nipples had got hard but they were kind of on the small side and hadn't stuck out like Liz's own would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had a body like Natalie's she'd never wear a bra again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she enjoyed this body though, it was getting physically tired.  Liz had stifled a yawn a couple of times.  She gently rubbed herself in post-orgasmic pleasure.  She looked down at the mess that was Natalie's underwear.  She had no idea how many loads of female lubricant had coated them.  She speculated that if she removed them and threw them at the wall they would stay in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get back to work, I suppose.\" Liz said as she put her hand over her mouth covering another yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had reached the actual Natalie down on the shop floor.  Emma couldn't help but notice Natalie was staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong luv?\" Emma asked as she looked at Natalie in her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I'm just back from the toilet.\" She winked, indicating she'd had some fun in there.  \"I must say your body is in great shape for your age.  I was expecting your bush to look like, well a bush but I was happy  to see you keep it trimmed a little.  Not as short as I like though.  I'm guessing you haven't done it for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I should take offense or not.\" Emma told her with a smile.  \"If I'd known I'd be swapping bodies today I would have put a bit more effort into tidying up my garden.\"  Natalie laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually surprised you've still got my body.  I thought you would have swapped it away by now.\"  Natalie admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, do you..?\" Emma couldn't quite understand why Natalie still thought Emma was in her body.  She kept silent while she thought about this, so she wouldn't give herself away.  It kind of made sense.  The last swap Natalie was aware of, was her swapping with Emma.  As long as Natalie didn't wear the earrings or the memories were reset, she'd think Emma was in her body no matter how many times Emma swapped with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, do I, what?\" Natalie asked, repeating Emma's unfinished question back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, nothing.\" Emma decided to see how far this swapping of awareness went.  She looked down at Liz's sizeable chest.  \"I'll tell you what though.  I was struggling to know wear to put my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie laughed. \"I can imagine, to be fair I've had decades of practice though.\" She looked downwards over Emma's middle-aged body.  \"It is nice to see my feet when I'm standing. Even if they are actually your feet.\"  Emma was amazed.  As far as Natalie was concerned she'd had Liz's body her whole life.  Emma was struck by how incredibly powerful the earrings were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to change the subject to stop Natalie getting suspicious. \"I am thinking about swapping with a man.\" Emma blurted out.  She didn't even consider this made her a total hypocrite when it came to Stefania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" An intrigued Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too good an opportunity to miss, isn't it?  Get to see how the other half lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But having a dick though, you think you could deal with that?\"  Emma felt herself getting excited at the mention of it.  She made a somewhat non-committal nod.  \"Imagine it, a hard thing like that in your underwear all the time, I think it would be annoying.\" As Natalie continued to voice her concerns, Emma got turned on more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it to be someone good looking.  Without being nasty, there aren't exactly a lot of attractive men working here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, some of them aren't too bad. What about Darrell?\" Asked Natalie, referring to their colleague with mixed heritage.  Emma vigorously shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Lord no.   If the rumours are to be believed, I don't want to handle his monster before I get a bit of practice on something a bit more manageable.\"  Emma did find the idea appealing but just wasn't ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about?\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natalie, when I asked for advice I expected to hear good ideas.\u201d Natalie harrumphed loudly, placing Emma\u2019s corner hands on her pudgy hips. The swapping seemed to have made Emma such a diva now and it was starting to irk Natalie. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll take my bad ideas somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to leave but felt Emma\u2019s impatient grip on her elbow. \u201cWait!\u201d she yelled in hushed tones. Her head swivelled from left to right before she said, \u201cSorry, Natalie, it\u2019s just that Mark\u2019s a bloody beanpole! I respect his work rate but I don\u2019t want to have to lug around his spider arms everywhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you being so picky?

Natalie observer the change in demeanour and turned around expectantly, opening her mouth in shock as she locked onto who Emma was eyeing up. The person in question was none other than Luke, the handsome, crewcutted employee with rippling pecs and a charming smile. Natalie admired his dazzling blue eyes from a distance, her mature snatch moistening as she discreetly pawed at it inside her slacks, whilst Emma\u2019s gaze was firmly locked on the flaccid bulge in the front of his black trousers. Though he didn\u2019t seem to be aroused while he bantered with a nearby shopper, his constant rearranging of his boxers told Emma that he was at least packing some kind of serious heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Luke.\u201d Emma chuckled devilishly to herself and stroked the tip of her chin with Liz\u2019s manicured finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you\u2019re gonna steal a man\u2019s body, I\u2019d advise you to take one as hot as that! But aren\u2019t you worried about the implications of taking his form? Stealing a cock-and-balls for your own enjoyment might seem fine to you but how will your husband or your kids think of it? Not to mention the fact that Luke\u2019s already engaged to a woman already, that girl...what\u2019s her name? Rachel, or whatever her name is, might not necessarily want to eat out her soon-to-be husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma hadn\u2019t really thought of all that before and now she felt guilty for not even asking those questions herself. Was the thrill of swapping really worth risking everything she\u2019d built up for herself? Emma nearly chickened out until she felt a dream breeze blow through the store, brushing past Liz\u2019s bulbous nipples and causing a sharp sting of arousal coursing through Emma\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew it,\u201d she said, throwing caution to the wind. \u201cKyle and the kids won\u2019t think anything\u2019s amiss anyway if I don\u2019t pass the second earring over. As for Luke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, well she might actually like the idea of hot lesbian sex. It\u2019ll be fun to see them doing all sorts of kinky stuff, maybe even going so far as to share a fake dildo someday...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie didn\u2019t protest as Emma jogged over to Luke and whispered something in his ear. Luke didn\u2019t seem to be too alarmed so Natalie accurately guessed that Emma had come up with a feasible excuse for him to follow her. Soon enough Emma had grabbed Luke\u2019s hand and dragged him up to her office behind her, a giddiness evident in her steps and an exuberant smile plastered on her lips. Natalie rolled her eyes as she continued to take inventory of the items on the shelves. Natalie wouldn\u2019t have admitted it directly to Emma but the thought of Emma trading away her body felt a tad disheartening. She knew she wasn\u2019t a spring chicken anymore with her stretch marks and the occasional wrinkle but she\u2019d have hoped Emma would\u2018ve taken more time to appreciate her new figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was completely oblivious to the fact that Emma had swapped herself out with Liz beforehand so she was unaware that she was unconsciously complaining for Liz\u2019s sake rather than her own. However, some tiny sliver of her now perverted mind surprisingly found the prospect of \u2018her\u2019 former body bedding up with another girl incredibly sexy. She bit her lip as she pulled out her fingers from her pants and straightened herself out. At this rate she\u2019d have to go back into the toilets and satiate her cougar urges once more. In a move more out of curiosity than of practicality, Natalie took her fingers and dabbed the tips of them onto the edge of her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlech!\u201d she exclaimed, pulling her hands out and spitting the fishy tasting liquids out of her mouth in a very crass manner. <i>Apparently it doesn\u2019t taste as good as Emma made it out to be,</i> she thought to herself as she took the fabric of Emma\u2019s white blouse and scraped it across her taste buds. She made a mental note to not do that in the future before well and truly resuming her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me I have to wear this in order to earn a free day of paid leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma beamed at Luke\u2019s question. It had been child\u2019s play to convince Luke to follow her upstairs. He\u2019d been sceptical when she\u2019d mentioned an employee questionnaire but the prospect of paid leave was absolutely class for him. Emma knew that his wedding was just over the horizon and he\u2019d been wailing about not having a day to plan everything over the past couple months. What better method could she have used to exploit him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the deal, plain and simple. We need to make sure customers get the utmost satisfaction from our products and if our employees don\u2019t even want to buy them, why would they?\u201d Luke shrugged his shoulders as Emma crouched down low to him with one earring in hand. He winced as she clipped it on and then looked dejectedly at himself in the mirror Emma had procured from inside her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, whaddaya think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look like my Grandma on bingo night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma giggled and rolled her eyes. \u201cHardy har, good one kid. Relax, they look adorable on you. But on me...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grinned as she pulled the other earring out of her pocket and slipped it into her left earlobe. Everything in the office seemed to go a little fuzzy for a few seconds. After a moment or two of disorientation Emma found herself holding the second earring in her hand. She immediately noticed the nail varnish, or lack thereof, and found that though she was still wearing a polo shirt, this specific one hugged a little tighter to her chest. She looked down and saw the toned arms she\u2019d been admiring on Luke before as well as that, oh so sweet, bulge sat snugly between her thighs. As she watched it, it quickly grew in girth and length, stretching the material of the boxers Emma now found herself wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she saw the familiar chiselled features and crewcut hairstyle. \u201c...But on me, they look absolutely <i>f*cking incredible.</i>\u201c Now Emma was the one sat in the chair as Luke crouched down beside her and held the mirror up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, guess so,\u201d he said as he stood up and scratched his head. He had no idea how he\u2019d ended up down there. His mind reasoned that he\u2019d somehow dropped the mirror and had to pick it up from the floor but something seemed wrong about that. Oh well, he was feeling a bit dizzy for whatever reason. Maybe that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does that mean I get that extra vacation day?\u201d Luke watched on in silence as Emma shamelessly groped herself, flexing her biceps and fondling her ball sack like she\u2019d never seen it before in her life. He had to cough to get her attention before she could reach her hand into her underoos and stroke her womanhood. Emma blushed bright scarlet. \u201cSorry, excuse my inappropriate behaviour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no problem at all. It\u2019s perfectly normal to pleasure yourself, everyone does it.\u201d Luke looked side to side before leaning on and whispering, \u201cBetween you and me, I sometimes take time off my lunch break to pop into the bathroom and finger myself silly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma burst out in laughter, both at the statement and at the preposterous nature of the obliviousness the earring provided. \u201cAren\u2019t you not supposed to tell your manager about misconduct like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, in normal situations you wouldn\u2019t want to divulge that kinda information. But something tells me you won\u2019t tell anybody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. Oh, but in the worst case scenario where you were to tell anyone, please don\u2019t tell Liz. I\u2019ve already been late 6 times in the last fortnight and I don\u2019t want to give her another reason to chew me out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You might actually like that,</i> Emma thought to herself as she pictured Liz in Natalie\u2019s polo and slacks eating out her former pussy with stars in her eyes. Still she agreed not to tell anything to Liz (whether she\u2019d uphold it or not was yet to be seen\u2014she had her fingers crossed the whole time) and stifled her horny giggles until Luke had strutted out of the room and closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to get acquainted, little buddy,\u201d Emma cackled as she plopped herself back into her swivel chair and undid Luke\u2019s bulky leather belt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emma, Liz and Natalie were also having their private discussion. Caleb and John were also talking to each other. They themselves were shocked to be called for the meeting.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly Charlotte asked, \"Why are we assembled? Why only some of us are here? Can someone please explain?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then Liz got up from her chair and started talking. She told them, \"The store owner has given us a task. They want to conduct an experiment among the store employees for each week over the next month. It is compulsory for all the Wilko employees to take part in the experiment. For this week all the employees in the assembly except us are going to take part in the experiment. For that reason, you all have been called up.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Steven asked, \"But what is the experiment?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liz said, \"The friend of the store owner is a renowned scientist and they have good relations. He has invented a machine which is going to be used in the experiment. The machine is meant to swap the lives of two people.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After hearing this, all of them were shocked. Jessica asked, \"Is this a prank? How is that even possible?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Natalie tried to calm them down. After a while Liz continued, \"I know this might come as a shock. But it is true. He is considered one of the world's best scientists. None of his experiments have failed. We all have to take part in this experiment.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Laura asked, \"But how is this even possible? We cannot go around and live each other's lives.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Laura was cut off by an impressive looking woman in her early 30's. She acknowledged Emma and started talking. She said, \"I am Elizabeth. I am the assistant of the scientist. I think you all now know why you were gathered. But you still have some doubts. We have built a machine which is meant to swap lives. You all will live the life of the person you are to swap with. No one will have a clue other than you and your partner. But before that you all have to sign an NDA.\" Natalie then gave everyone an NDA and everyone reluctantly signed them. After that everyone was given a diary. Elizabeth continued, \"To make things more interesting we have decided to swap male employess with female employees. It'll not only help you know what goes on on the other fence of gender field but will also help us understand your perspective. You have to write all of your feelings in the diary given to you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly Ruby interrupted Elizabeth, \"But there are only 6 male employees here and 8 female employees other than the managers.\" Natalie intervened saying, \"Caleb and John are also going to take part in the experiment for this week.\" Everyone was shocked after hearing that. Female employees constantly opposed it as they didn't want to work as a janitor or a security guard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some time later, Elizabeth came with a bowl of papers in which all male employees names were written. She told all female employees to pick one paper. All of them reluctantly picked one. Elizabeth told them, \"You are going to swap lives with the person whose name is on the paper you chose. Open the paper and read the names.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of them were nervous as no one knew what was going to happen. All the female employees opened their paper.

All female employees had the same reaction as Sasha after hearing that Jessica was going to swap with John. John was also shocked. He himself wasn't happy. Some swaps were wild like Jessica &amp; John, Claire &amp; Caleb, Steven &amp; Ruby. Girls were devastated but everyone hold their feelings. Other swaps were Luke &amp; Kiran, Stuart &amp; Sasha, Mark &amp; Laura, Alex &amp; Charlotte, Rashid &amp; Mona.

She told Jessica and John to follow her to the next room where the experiment was going to be conducted. Jessica was now less emotional than before. She followed John to the room where Elizabeth took them. She was looking at John while going there. John was always on good terms with Jessica but he was totally opposite of what Jessica was. She couldn't digest that she was going to live the life of a 42 year old janitor. They entered the room where two similar pods were kept with all the wires connected to it. There were two more people who also looked like scientists. One of them started speaking. He said, \"Thank you for taking part in our experiment. We will start in a while. But first I have a suggetion for you. After reading both of your profiles, I think you'll need different traits to live each other lives. This machine will only swap your life. You'll physically remain the same. But you need to have each other's traits to make it easy for you. But I can only swap one physical or mental trait between you. You both should decide what do you want from each other.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They both were startled after hearing the scientist.

They sat in the chair and in a few minutes all the connections were made. One of the scientist pulled the plug &amp; everything went blank for both of them. After some time they started gaining their senses, they both came out of their respective pods and looked at the scientists. They looked happy but Jessica and John were still slowly coming to their senses.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as Jessica started feeling better, she also felt weird. She looked at the scientist before her who was taller than her before the experiment but now looked shorter. She looked down at herself and was shocked to see that she was not wearing her uniform. She was now dressed in dark blue coveralls with black t shirt underneath. She touched her breasts and found out that she wasn't wearing her bra. She also realised that she was wearing black work boots. She worriedly looked around and was more shocked after seeing John.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0John took long time to come back to senses but he was shocked as soon as he realised that he was finding it difficult to stand. He looked down to know why but he saw that he was wearing a red blouse fitted to his semi-muscular body and black trousers which were tighter in groin area. Then he realised that he was also wearing a bra and panties. He was having difficulty because of his black high heel stiletto pumps. He somehow managed to stand straight but he got hit in the face with long hair. Then he realised that he now had ginger hair in a ponytail. Then he started looking around and saw a shocked Jessica who had her hands on her mouth, and who also appeared taller to him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jessica was shocked to see almost a replica of her in front of her. After watching John touching his hair, she realised that she didn't have long hair anymore. She knew that she now sported John's balding brown hair and slightly graying beard as well. She slowly started moving towards him. As soon as they got close, they were shocked and couldn't speak a word. Elizabeth intervened, \"How do you both feel? Are you okay?\" They both looked at her and nodded. Then she handed both of them a file and continued, \"These files have most of the information of each other's lives you should know. If you want, you can share more afterwards. But remember that as soon as you leave this room, you both are going to live each other's lives. Everyone is going to see you and treat you as each other.

Jessica realised that and gave him her hand. They both saw that John now had Jessica's former red nailpolish. There was awkward silence while they were walking towards the exit. Jessica tried to break the silence. She told John, \"I think we still have all of our body parts. Except from the obvious changes we are still the same. But just like she said we have to live each other's lives. So that means now I have to go your house. Tell me how to reach there. And is there anything you want to tell me?\" John responded, \"I usually walk home. I live nearby to the office. There isn't anything specific I want to tell you. I guess these files have almost everything in them. Should I know something that isn't in the file?\" Jessica said, \"No. You might know that you have to take a bus from the stop. Don't engage with Sara too much. She is my roommate &amp; she talks alot but avoid her as much as possible. If there is anything else, I'll text you.\" They reached the office exit by the time their conversation ended. They both waved goodbye to each other. John watched Jessica walk by from the bus stop. He still was in shock about the scene.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jessica left John at the office exit and soon started to walk towards her new house. She was reading the file while walking. It was 10 minutes from the office. She read that she has to reach the office at 8 AM, an hour before her usual timing. She also knew that she was now married to 40 year old woman named Amanda. She also had two teenage kids. She was still not used to being one of the tallest in public. She felt good that she got to look at people at eye level. She reached her new house and rang the bell. She was getting anxious now. Someone opened the door and Jessica looked to see that it was her new daughter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile John was waiting for a bus at the bus stop outside the office. He was still feeling awkward wearing woman's clothes in public and they were tight in certain areas. He realised that he was getting used to stand in heels. He was carrying Jessica's purse over his shoulders. He started reading about Jessica's life from the file and realized that she was still single. He was somewhat relieved to find that out but also wondered how a beautiful woman like her can be single. He was tired from the day's work so he kept the file back in his purse and waited for the bus. He then realised that he was getting looks from men on the bus stop. He tried to ignore those men and decided to use Jessica's phone. After some time, the bus arrived at the bus stop. He reached home safely and rang the door bell. A 25 year old woman opened the door. John thought that she must be Sara.</span></div></div>",

Jessica was still trying to come to terms with the situation. She was now going to enter in an unknown house. Her thoughts were interrupted by a voice, \"How was your day, honey?\" She looked up to see a woman approaching her. The woman came and kissed Jessica on the lips. She grabbed her hand to take her inside. All of that happened in an instance. Jessica didn't know what was happening until she was pushed by her now-wife asking, \"Are you alright, honey? You seem out of place.\" Jessica came out of her thoughts and responded, \"Yeah I'm good.\" Amanda told her to get washed and said she would arrange dinner for everyone. Jessica was rushing towards the bathroom but she heard a boy saying, \"Dad, your room is upstairs.\" Jessica didn't know how to repond to someone calling her dad so she hurried towards the room upstairs. She reached the bathroom where she saw her face in the mirror for the first time since the swap. She knew it was her face but without makeup and John's hairstyle and beard made her look different. She stared at her face for a long time before proceeding to wash it. She got out of her clothes and was shocked to find out that she now had hairy hands and legs. She looked at her breasts to see some hair sprout from them as well. She still had her lean body with perky breasts and flat stomach but she was now living as a janitor. After cleaning up she opened her now shared wardrobe but she knew that she cannot wear girly clothes anymore. She took out a white tee shirt and black shorts. After wearing them she realised that they were now resized to fit her new frame. While wearing shorts over her underwear, she heard Amanda calling her downstairs for dinner. She was still not used to being called 'honey'. After having some awkward conversations during dinner, she was ready to sleep now. As she was going to sleep, she saw Amanda coming in wearing a pink nightgown. She was somewhat worried as Amanda came and sat beside her. She was giving Jessica dirty looks. Jessica realised the situation and said, \"I'm so tired today as I had to work extra. I'm feeling sleepy. Goodnight.\" After that she pretended to sleep. She heard a slight moan coming from her bedside but she didn't react and kept her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0John entered his new house and said thank you to Sara. Sara laughed, \"When did you start thanking me Jessica? Let it be. Get washed quickly. Wear your sexy clothes. We have to go to a party at 10.\" John instantly blurted, \"Party?\" Sara started laughing again, \"Did you forget about it? You are the one who always reminds me of them. You gave me this habit of going to parties regularly.\" John was stunned. He didn't know how to respond. Sara interrupted his thoughts. \"Come on, Jessica. Hurry up. Otherwise we'll be late.\" John said, \"No, I cannot come to the party today.\" 'Why though? You were so excited in the morning about this?\" John suddenly replied, \"I'm tired. I had a lot of work at the store today. You should go.\" Sara was surprised by the response of her supposed-friend. She said, \"I cannot believe you are saying this Jessica. Okay I really think you need rest. Okay I'll get ready and leave then. If you need something text me.\" Sara went to her room after the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was relieved and saw that there was another room. Thinking that it might be Jessica's, he went to the room. He was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of her room. He then put his purse on the bed and went to the bathroom for pee. He untied his trousers and relaxed his member from panties. He then pulled his panties and trousers back up. He went towards the mirror to wash his face. He was surprised by the reflection in the mirror. His face void of his beard was fully made up. He also saw his long ginger hair closely. He had started to go bald during his teenage years so it was huge change for him. He didn't know if he should wash his face so he left it as it is and came back to his bedroom. He decided to get out of his work clothes. As soon as he removed his upper clothes, he was standing there in bra and panties. He then sat down on the bed to remove heels. Then he realised that his legs had no hair on them. He then looked at his hands. His muscular arms were nor hairless. He also didn't have any chest hair. He then removed his bra and went towards the wardrobe. He looked at all the variety of woman's clothes. This reminded him of his wife and kids. He was now worried for Jessica as well. He decided to text her after getting dressed. He started searching for some comfortable clothes but found out that all the clothes were quite girly. He reluctantly picked out a least girly looking white nightgown. He wore it as it fit him perfectly in all areas. He was now feeling hungry so he went ti the kitchen to find something to eat. He saw that there was nothing but some instant noodles. He quickly cooked them and started eating. He messaged Jessica, \"I am home. Everything went fine. How are you coping?\" After eating he went back to now his bedroom and tried to sleep. It took him alot of time to go back to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

WHAT'S HAPPENING!?\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't answer, simply because he didn't have time to. The swirling black smoke suddenly shot into his mouth and forced his head back as it disappeared inside. His cheeks were forced out and his body shook the whole time.

His face contorted into a wicked grin. \"Hey babe.\" He said, as Laura began backing up. \"There's always some curious little meatbag somewhere isn't there, willing to play around with powers they know nothing about.\" Dylan chuckled, as he held his hands up and clenched them a few times, before inspecting his body as though it was new to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan, what's wrong with you?\" Laura asked, her heart beating in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very bright are you, bitch?\" Dylan chuckled, or rather the demon now possessing his body did. \"Your little boyfriend ain't at home anymore, just me.\" He said, his eyes returning to their normal brown color as he continued grinning. \"But hey, at least his little spell worked, right?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gulped, looking first left and then right, before suddenly running for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan immediately lifted his left hand and made a sweeping motion, which sent Laura flying through the air and against another wall, landing on a small table and smashing it to pieces. \"No leaving just when we're having fun.\" The demon laughed again, as Laura laid there, wincing and whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just don't hurt me, and let Dylan go.\" Laura cried, holding her injured arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe I will.\" The demon said, Dylan's eyes turning black again as he maintained his grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura just looked on in horror from her prostrate position on the floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'If only I had just stopped him from reading that stupid spell' or something like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura jumped when she heard the demon perfectly replicate her voice with Dylan's mouth. The tears were now running down her face as she tried (and failed) to escape her invisible bondage. The demon-in-Dylan smiled evilly as he pressed his body against hers and ran his stolen hand up and down her side. He leaned close and whispered into her ear, \"Ya know what would be funny though? Well?! Do ya?!?!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no\" Laura muttered, feeling the demon's saliva hit her neck and flinching. Her whole body was trembling with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine if a mother fuckin' wolf or something jumped out at a little helpless doe. But it turns out the sheep wasn't really helpless at all.

Sweet and innocent and all that jazz. No one would ever suspect ya of doing anything wrong. You'd make a perfect wolf in sheep's clothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's eyes went wide with terror. She tried to scream, but felt her mouth tighten shut as the demon clenched Dylan's hand closed. \"Why're ya complaining, bitch? I'm only giving you what you asked for. I'll let Dylan's body go, and I certainly won't hurt you. No, I actually think we'll make a lovely team\" The demon said, letting Laura fall as Dylan's body pressed her tightly against the wall himself. \"By the way, you can call me Azazel. And I can't wait for the fun we're gonna have together. Now open wide for your medicine\" he said as he released his grip.

Instead he raised his hand again... then made a sharp, downward motion, and Laura's black work trousers were forced all the way down to her ankles. A repetative motion with his other hand and Laura's knickers followed suit, revealing her pussy. \"Hmm, pretty.\" Azazel chuckled acerbically, before waving his hand again and Laura flew across the room, landing face down on the couch, with her ass in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura still found herself unable to scream, or even whimper as the demon inside her boyfriend had his way with her. Azazel unzipped Dylan's jeans and reached inside to pull out his hard cock. He couldn't help but mimic Laura's own voice again while inside her boyfriend. \"Oh Dylan, what a nice big dick you have, I want you to screw my pathetic brains out.\" The delicate, feminine tone left Dylan's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, with tears streaming down Laura's cheeks, she felt her boyfriend's cock being forcefully inserted into her asshole, and the demon began pounding her rectum. \"The back passage is always fun, so much tighter. I like things tight... including my meatbags.\" Azazel then said, as he sodomized the girl with her boyfriend's appendage. \"Problem is, I've yet to get inside a meatbag that has stamina worth mentioning.\" Azazel then mentioned, as he felt an orgasm building in Dylans body. His cock suddenly exploded and sent three or four ropes of hot white cum into Laura's ass. The demon enjoyed the sensation, but wasn't blown away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving essentially raped Laura, Azazel pulled Dylan's softening shaft out of her backside and stepped back, allowing Laura to regain control of her functions. She was distraught and violated, unable to run, and he knew this. \"Clean yourself up bitch, I don't want to be wearing a leaking meatbag.\" Azazel told Laura, throwing her a nearby box of tissues. Laura reluctantly did as she was told, wiping her ass clean, all the while crying and feeling lost. Through reddened eyes, she looked up at her possessed beau, just in time to see the swirl of black smoke emerge from his mouth as his head tipped back. Dylan's whole body shook violently for a moment until the demon had exited him, then Dylan slumped backwards, hitting the floor hard, with his spent cock still hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already accepted her fate, Laura just slumped to her knees and looked up as the mass of black smoke circled in the air a few times, before diving down straight towards her. Her mouth was forced open and Azazel rapidly disappeared inside. Laura's head jerked forward and her mouth snapped shut, then when her eyes opened... they were an inky black. Her tear drenched face contorted into a grin, and her body quickly shot upright. \"Cracking Laura's neck from side to side, Azazel held her slender hands up in front of him to inspect them. \"There, wasn't that fun? For me anyway.\" He chuckled in her voice. Giving his new perky B-cup breasts a squeeze, Azazel sized up his latest victim. \"Hopelessly average, but you'll do for now.\" He said, before reaching down and pulling up Laura's knickers and trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Dylan's unconscious body on the floor, Azazel sneered from inside his girlfriend's body as he went through Laura's mind to plan his next move.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, before any of that could start, something had to be done with Dylan, who was lying on the floor unconscious. The possessed young woman flicked her wrist, sending Dylan flying into an open walk-in closet, which then locked behind him. It would be a good few hours until he woke up, and then another while for him to get out, but for good measure, the demon also telepathically moved the remains of the table in front of the door. Maybe he'd return to have some fun with Dylan at some point, but for now he just had to be out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel hummed a tune as he stripped off Laura's clothing and hopped in the shower, cleaning up his new body thoroughly and making sure to feel himself all over in the process. \"Mmm, just like I thought. So sweet and unassuming. I can definitely see myself upgrading, but you'll do nicely for my purposes at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Laura then dried herself off and slipped on a pair of black leggings and a grey tank top. Not the meatbag's usual look, but Azazel thought the dark and tight clothing complimented her. Once the demon finished putting Laura's hair in its familiar ponytail, he folded up the summoning spell and tucked it into her bra. She ran a finger across it and smiled at the thought about how much fun would be had at the unsuspecting department store. Especially once some friends were brought into the picture. Grabbing Dylan's car keys and locking the apartment door, Azazel continued humming the tune in Laura's sweet tone, thinking the lyrics as Laura's body strutted confidently through the building. <i>It's the end of the world as we know it... and I feel fine.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This wasn't so much out of a sense of familiar love (though Gabriel had always been more fond of Lucifer than others, even when the latter was still on good terms with the Heavenly court), but mostly because he just didn't see the point in fighting. Demons were hedonistic and cruel, but few of them were truly evil in a way that warranted their effective genocide. Since Gabriel was an angel who himself didn't mind the occasional walk on the wild side, he prefered to just live and let live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, neutrality no longer seemed to be a viable option. The demons were getting roudier, disseminating more summoning spells for unsuspecting humans to find. Something wicked was in the works, and all hands were needed on deck, especially with Michael no longer available to lead the charge if another full-on war broke out. But since Gabriel was at least not as despised by demons as the rest of his family, it made him the perfect point-man for investigating what the demons were up to. Which is what brought him here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>Hello Dylan,</i></span> he said, causing the young man to jolt awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? Who are you?\" Dylan asked, scared. All he could tell was that it was dark and that he was surrounded by clothing. There was a flicker of light coming from the wall. He pressed himself against what he assumed was a door, but it didn't budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>No use, kid. You're stuck in a closet with a heavy table blocking the door. Only something superhuman can get you out before the demon you summoned gets back here and decides if he wants you dead or just tortured.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demon? What're you talking about?\" Dylan asked, his memory of the last few hours foggy. He tried again to push against the closet door to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>Remember the spell you were given that you thought was so cool? You used it to summon a demon named Azazel. As far as I can tell, he took the body of whoever you were with out for a spin. I need to figure out who that was and what's being planned now. Because Azazel isn't just any demon, he's one of the big three. If he's hanging around you meatballs, there's a reason and it's not good for your species. So... wanna be deputized?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever I was with... Laura?!?! But she wouldn't hurt a fly! And deputized... what the hell does that mean?\" Dylan tried one last time to open the door and then gave up, banging his head against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>Well, I'm not sure if you can tell, but right now I'm just a voice inside your head. Angels aren't like demons. We can't just take over without permission. I need you to let me use your body to get to the bottom of all this. Once I'm inside, I'll be able to access the memories of what happened when Azazel was summoned. Then I'll go after him and make sure both you and your girlfriend never have to deal with any of this crap again. How's that sound?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That sounds insane...</i> Dylan thought, but couldn't bear to be responsible for Laura hurting herself... or others. \"Okay, angel. Do what you need to do...\" Dylan closed his eyes as he felt a warmth growing inside his chest. A white light filled the room as blue sparks surrounded his body. When his eyes opened again. they were glowing bright blue. Gabriel placed Dylan's hand against the closet door and it immediately opened as the table fized itself in mid-air and floated back to where it belonged. Memories previously hidden flooded into Dylan's head as Gabriel saw what had happened... how Azazel had violated Laura with Dylan's body before possessing her himself and heading out, presumably to the department store where Laura worked, which Gabriel knew to be directly above a... well, very dangerous fault line. Gabriel prepared to get to work and looked himself over, noticing Dylan's pants were still down, cum hardened on his dick and thighs from when he had been made to sodomize his now-girlfriend. \"Okay, kid. I'll do what I need to do, but first we have to get you cleaned up\" he said as he turned and headed to the shower. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately he could feel a hidden power from somewhere nearby, but the interruption of one of his meatsuit's co-workers proved to spoil the moment of intensity. The voice happened to be Laura's best friend Rebekah, and she looked none too pleased. \"You have any idea how hard it's been for me to cover for you for this long? Natalie, Steven and Liz all asking where you were. I've been lying my ass off to protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel sized up the pretty blonde human in front of him, and smiled. \"Well, what are friends for, right?\" He replied calmly. \"If it makes you feel any better, me and Dylan had such a good time together.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you make out? I thought he wanted to show you something.\" Rebekah asked, her irritation changing to curious interest as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel chuckled, folding his arms under his perky tits. \"Oh he did show me something. His cock, just before he rammed it up my arsehole. And ooh damn did it feel good.\" He winked, even though he had done the actual fucking himself, while possessing Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you've always hated the idea of anal.\" Rebekah muttered, grimacing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky, luv, you won't have lived until you get your arse stretched out by a big cock.\" Azazel smirked, grabbing Rebekah by her shoulders and giving her a gentle shake. \"You should try it, trust me.\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah's frown grew further when she noticed Laura's tight leggings and grey tank top. \"And why are you out of uniform? You know you'll get in trouble.\" She inquired, eliciting an uncaring shrug from who she still saw as her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really care, I wear what I want.\" Azazel stated abruptly. <i>And I wear who I want.</i> He thought. \"Now run along before you start really getting on my tits.\" Azazel told Rebekah, slapping her ass as he forced her away. Rebekah's expression of befuddlement by this time was almost permanent. She had no idea why Laura was acting like she was, but she passed it off as just her being in a bad mood. \"Now, let's see exactly what this dump contains.\" Azazel looked around, Laura's eyes briefly turning an inky black again, before returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set off walking the aisle of the store, and even the back storage areas.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Crouching just above it, Azazel placed his slender host's hand just above the crack, which immediately glowed brighter and began to spread on the floor, nearly doubling in size. \"Ow! The hell?!\" Azazel exclaimed, pulling the summoning sheet out from its home against Laura's breast. The paper, which had heated up to well over a comfortable temperature fell into the crack and immediately burst into flames. Azazel quickly jumped up and hovered Laura's body over the ground as the crack opened up, becoming a circular pit of green energy. Black, red, and white pillars of smoke flew around within the pit. The distant sound of swords clashing against each other was heard and looking far enough into the swirling energy revealed the distinct shape of a cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><i>FREE ME, MY CHILD</i></span> a voice boomed, loud enough to shake the walls and cause Azazal to close his stolen eyes and move Laura's hands over her ears. When his vision came back, he was once again hovering over a tiny, glowing crack, with the summoning spell completely in-tact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bloody hell\" Azazel said as Laura's black sneakers ightly touched down on the ground. \"I found the fucking cage\" Azazel said as he bent down to pick up the spell and fold it up again. Laura's eyes faded to inky black as the words of the spell glowed brightly. Soon, Azazel found himself psychically connected with an old friend. <i>Lilith, it's me. I found the cage. Track my essense to this store and find yourself a new meatbag here. You'll probably need one slightly more... mature than your usual preference.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Laura immediately heard the voice of a young girl respond in her head. <i>Well that's no fun... you know how much I hate grownups. I'll meet you there, but don't presume to tell me what to wear, Zazey</i> she said, using a nickname that Azazel absultely despised before closing the connection with a huff. Though one of the oldest demons, Lilith did tend to be a bit immature. Still, unlocking the cage would require the \"big three\" and maybe a few extra hands on top. Unfortunately, Crowley wasn't yet in this plain of existence and would have to be summoned. Luckily, there was no shortage of potential meatsuits walking around for the taking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hated stock inventory, and she constantly regretted having got a job at Wilko in the first place. It was no place for a teenager like herself, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lexi, just shut up and do the job. Complaining about it isn't going to help.\" Ruby responded with a sigh, as she pushed her dark red hair behind her left ear and continued writing on her sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi scowled at Ruby. \"You shut up.\" She spat back. \"I'm wasted here, and so are you. We're teenagers for fuck sake. And we're stuck in a grotty storage room counting shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, cry me a river.\" Ruby shrugged, not noticing the swirling white smoke pouring through a crack in the floor near a pillar. <i><span class=\"chotpink\">Oooh, a pretty one, don't mind if I do.</span></i> Lilith thought to herself, spying Ruby sat on the floor, her crosses legs encased in her black jeans. Lilith usually possessed blonde meatbags, but redheads could be fun too, she knew. Lilith acknowledged the presence of the black girl who was with the redhead, but she was a safe distance away and too busy whining to herself to probably notice what Lilith intended next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting time, Lilith moved her essence forward and passed up and over Ruby, before turning back in on her smoke form and forcing herself into the girl's mouth. Ruby's eyes and mouth glowed for a moment and her body shuddered, her fingers snapping the pencil she was holding. Then her head jerked forward, and when it rose again, Ruby's eyes rolled all the way into her head, becoming entirely white, as a grin appeared on her face. \"Oh yes, I like this one.\" Lilith said in her new voice, patting herself down and standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ruby's eyes returned to normal Lilith then scowled over to Lexi, who was still complaining. \"Hey motormouth, zip it!\" Lilith barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi just sat there, staring open mouthed at Ruby, who then smiled at her. \"Thank you.\" Lilith said, before walking past Lexi and out of the storage area.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh well, nothing I can do. I guess I'll see for myself soon enough\" Azazel said with a shrug as he looked down at the green glow emanating from the crack. He could feel the power radiating out from deep below, but his train of thought was interupted by a tight squeeze from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ZAZEY!!!!!!\" Lilith exclaimed, practically jumping on Laura's back with Ruby's teenage body. \"I missed you so much! It's been centuries! What's new? How's existence treating you? Did you kill any humans lately?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel nearly fell down from the weight of Ruby's body jumping on her like a child.

In what plain of existence would that have been enough time for a full summoning? I haven't even started thinking about a host for him yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith frowned as she swung higher on her invisible toy. \"Well that's no fun. How are we supposed to free daddy without Crowley here? We'll need to get him here soon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel sighed. \"Yes Lilith, I'm aware of that. We also need to make sure no one gets suspicious of what's going on down here. That means we'll need to bring in some lower demons to take over the management and maybe one or two of the folks next door. So, incase you haven't noticed, there's a lot to fucking do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith stopped her swinging and kicked one of Ruby's feet against the wall, leaning back and getting some red hair out from in front of her eyes. \"Sorry, Zazey. The last time the three of us were together, we got half a town in the colonies burnt at the stake thanks to the witch hunts we lead them on. I can't wait to see what we cook up this time, especially when daddy joins us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel nodded. \"Well, at least with both of us here we can move twice as fast now. I'll go up to the store. Laura here has to show her face before she gets in too much trouble since we aren't running the place yet. I'll focus on getting Crowley here. You summon some minor demons and make sure they know the plan. You're strong enough get at least five or ten of them here without breaking a sweat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith sighed. \"Fiiiinnnneeeeee, but I get to have fun with Crowley first once he's here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel laughed. \"Lil, you and I both know that the only one who can tell Crowley who to have fun with first is Crowley. But if you do a good job down here MAYBE I'll tell him you asked. Unlike you, I have realistic expectations, so I exect the lowers to be in place by the time Crowley and I get back here.\" The possessed Laura gave the possessed Ruby a cute wink before turning around and walking up the stairs, returning to the surface, summoning spell in hand.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Yep, definitely a portal to Hell. And not just any part of Hell, but the very deepest circle, where Lucifer's cage was hidden. \"Don't worry, daddy, we'll see you soon\" she said as she stood up and cracked her back. \"Ugh, why do I have to be the one with the boring job? Zazey and Crowely had better appreciate this\" she said as she pulled a pen out of the breast pocket of Ruby's company polo and began drawing arcane symbols on some of the cardboard boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that should be enough\" she said as she cracked the 19-year old's knuckles and closed her eyes in concentration. The boxes with the drawings on them began to shake as Ruby's eyes opened, now glowing white. Lilith began chanting words in an ancient language and the lights began flickering. After several moments, the lights came back on and Ruby's eyes returned to their natural color. Lilith snapped her stolen fingers as black smoke exited the writing-covered boxes, forming six pools of smoke. \"Yeah, this is plenty,\" Lilith said, admiring her summoning work. Minor demons were mostly-mindless grunts who would unquestioningly do anything a stronger demon like herself asked. They weren't much in terms of personality, but they knew how to take orders and stay out of the way of their superiors. \"You boys ready for some fun?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><i>Yessssssssss Mistressssssss Llliiillllliiitttthhhhh,</i></span> they said in unison, awaiting their orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith giggled and clapped her hands. \"Excellent! That's what I wanted to hear! Azazel, Crowley, and myself will be hard at work here preparing to break Lord Lucifer out of his cage. We need to make sure nothing interupts us. Luckily, we can get most of management on our side very easily with your help.\" Lilith lifted Ruby's arm and pointed to the ceiling. \"A few floors up is an office with four people having lunch together. Two of them are part of the management team here and two of them run the beauty salon next door. Four of you will possess them on the spot. You two,\" she said, motioning to two of the black masses at random, \"will wait in the shadows. If you want, you can possess whoever you want, but keep a psychic chain open with the other four. If either the group here or at the salon need assistance, you'll be on call to drop whatever meatsuit you found and help them. All of you are to prioritize allowing the three of us to have unlimited access to this area and to whichever employees we need. If anyone begins to suspect, it is up to you to handle them. Am I understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[c:lgrey}<i>Yessssssssss Mistressssssss Llliiillllliiitttthhhhh,</i></span> the roared, again in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then. Off you go! Have fun, boys!\" Lilith laughed happily as the six clouds of smoke flew up through the ceiling and towards their targets. She then stretched and found herself admiring Ruby's young and shapely form. \"Hmmm, it has been a while since I've worn someone so mature. Now that I've done my job, maybe I can afford a quick break to get to know myself a bit better or find a playmate\" she said, remembering that Lexi was still upstairs (probably complaining about) doing her job.<br>\r\n</div></div>",

She pulled Ruby's trousers down, then her knickers, while inside Ruby Lilith kept smiling and looking down, putting her hands on her meatsuit's hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, it's been a while since I've experienced anything like this.\" Lilith squealed in apparent 'girly' excitement as she watched Lexi bury her face in her crotch and start licking the folds of her stolen pussy. \"Don't forget to go deep.\" She told Lexi, and immediately Lexi's tongue extended out further and probed inside her co-worker's vagina, sending growing waves of pleasure through Lilith's host body. \"Pick up your pace girl.\" Lilith commanded, and Lexi obeyed, her tongue increasing it's pace of licking as she began teasing Ruby's clit. \"That's the spot, right there.\" She grinned. \"I bet this meatsuit is a squirter.\" She then chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when Ruby's body climaxed, Lexi's face was covered in girl cum. Lilith felt the intense if brief rush of an orgasm wrack her stolen form, and she basked in it, before clicking her fingers and causing Lexi to stand up. \"Done with you now, you can get on with your menial labor.\" She giggled, as Lexi picked her pen and paper back up and went back to work without saying anything else. \"Oh and don't clean your face off, you want to show people what a slut you are.\" Lilith lastly said to Lexi, before sauntering out of the storage area.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, Crowley was the bossiest of the higher demons, and tended to enjoy hosts who were in positions of power. Unfortunately, most of the supervisors were currently on their respective lunch breaks at the moment and Crowley was needed as soon as possible since he was the only one of the three higher demons who actually knew how to open the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the store, Azazel saw that there were two main possibilities. One of them was Natalie, the staff supervisor. She was probably the highest authority figure easily accessible at the moment. Azazel expected that Crowley would appreciate her good looks and ability to give orders to any employee she interacts with. The downsides are that she's still not at the top of the food chain and that it would be incredibly hard to get her somewhere private enough for a full summoning ritual while the other senior employees are out. Even if Azazel used his demonic abilities to persuade her, other employees would notice her absence if she left while the others were away. Then again, if Lilith did her job right, there would be some help arriving on that front pretty soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other top candidate was Rebekah, Laura's best friend. She wasn't exactly in a position of authority, but she was very attractive and it would be quite easy to get her in private. Besides, Azazel couldn't wait for an excuse to see more of her body after slapping that lovely ass earlier. At the very least, Crowley would appreciate her looks until he could easily transfer into someone with more power.

As the customer went to grab what they had been looking for, Azazel wrapped Laura's arms around Rebekah's waste, and ran a hand down her side. \"Hey luv!\" he said with a grin as Rebekah jumped in surprise, quickly pushing who she thought was her friend away before they were seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the bloody hell as gotten into you, Laura? You're acting really strange today!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Laura giggled, stairing into Rebekah's eyes. \"Follow me, bitch!\" she said as the other girl's eyes glazed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Rebekah said with a nod, emotionlessly following Azazel as he walked into into the employee ladies room and locked the door behind them. Rebekah shook her head as she snapped out of her trance. \"How'd we get back here?\" she asked in a slight daze as she headed for the door, only to find herself unable to walk forward due to what felt like an invisible grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the grip released her and Laura grabbed her shoulders with tears in her eyes. \"Becky, you need to help me! Please! I don't know who else to t-tell\" Laura said, hugging her friend tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grip released Rebekah and she chalked it up to being in her head as she instinctively hugged her best friend back. \"Hey, what is it, luv? Does it have anything to do with how you were acting earlier?\" She asked, trying to calm Laura by gently running a hand up and down her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... it was Dylan. He b-brought me into the apartment to show me s-something. A-a-a-and he... oh lord, Becky... he cast a spell and was possessed!!!! H-h-h-h-h-e did such h-horrible things to me. And then he m-m-made me do h-h-h-horibble things too! I'm fighting him, b-but you need to send him away. I know this sounds crazy, but please, you have to help me before he takes over again!\" Laura took a folded piece of paper that must have been tucked into her bra and handed it to Rebekah. \"T-this is the s-s-summoning spell Dylan used. If s-someone else reads it, it'll send him away. I c-can't because he's still in me but if I hold your hand while you read it, it'll work! Please, Becky! You're my best friend and I need your help. I know it sounds crazy, but please trust me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah held Laura tighter. It did sound crazy, but she sounded so sincere. Rebekah had no idea what had really happened between her and Dylan, but she had a feeling it really traumatized Laura. She'd be sure to give him a piece of her mind later, but for now Rebekah knew she just had to calm down her friend, so if reading this stupid spell would do that then that was what she had to do. \"Don't worry, Laura... we'll get through this\" she said, taking her friend's hand in hers as she looked at the strange writing on the page. Despite it being in what was clearly a different language, she was able to pronounce the words easily. As she completed the incantation, the bathroom lights began flickering and it felt like the floor was shaking. Suddenly, Laura broke away from her grip and pushed her hand forward forcing Rebekah against the locked door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's eyes became replaced with Azazel's inky blackness as the tears disappeared. \"Thanks for being such a sport, Becky. I knew I could count on you\" the demon said with a grin as red smoke began to descend from the ceiling. \"Summoning spells are such a pain. A human that's possessed or entranced isn't able to read them. They have to be recited by someone doing it of their own free will. You're a smart kid, so I had to go for the emotional attachment. And boy oh boy, did it work like a charm. I mean, all I had to do was turn on the waterworks and you were like putty in my hands! Hell, you still are!\" Azazel motioned with Laura's hand, pulling Rebekah from the door into the middle of the bathroom and made a few manuevers with Laura's hand, forcing off her shirt. The possessed-Laura looked up at the red smoke that appeared to be watching the two girls. \"Come on, Crowley! I know you want her! Quit playing hard to get and join the fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now shirtless Rebekah followed her former friend's gaze, just on time to see the red smoke barelling towards her. As she opened her mouth to scream, the smoke easily forced it's way in, causing her neck to shoot upwards. Her body shook as the smoke made its way inside, with Azazel massaging Laura's cunt and moaning as she watched the shirtless Rebekah's breasts bouncing up and down as she lost control of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rebekah's head dropped down limply and she stood up, feeling herself over before lifting her head and cracking her neck. Rebekah's eyes were now glowing bright red as an evil smile formed on her face, mirrored by the possessed Laura. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's cold in here.\" He joked, using Rebekah's own hands to grab her perky tits and squeeze them in said hands. \"Nice and young too, not bad.\" Crowley kept talking, before staring over at the possessed Laura, whose eyes were still inky black. Rebekah's own eyes returned to their normal blue color as Crowley looked through them. \"We're freeing the big bad then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Lilith is already making moves to secure our hold over this place and the surrounding area, unless she's got distracted playing with her meatbag.\" Azazel replied in Laura's cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowley just tilted his head, running his fingers though his long blonde hair. \"Well, they do say, all work and no play, makes one very irritable.\" He said, before raising Rebekah's hand and trying to pull Laura's possessed body towards him. However, Azazel raised Laura's right hand, and kept her eyes an inky black as he blocked his fellow demon's telekinesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off Crow, you're not tossing me around like a meatbag. You want me over there, ask me to come over.\" He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowley rolled his host's pretty eyes, then slumped her shoulders a little. \" Well okay then, get that little bitch over here.\" He gestured, referring to Azazel's host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel moved Laura's legs and approached his 'friend' straight away. Crowley started pacing around the inky-eyed Laura, using Rebekah's eyes to wander up and down her best friend's possessed form. Crowley suddenly grabbed Laura's ass cheeks and squeezed them, before moving in to sniff her neck. \"I see you had your fun with her before taking her over.\" He muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. It was her pathetic boyfriend who summoned me to earth, I possessed him first. Then I fucked this little meatsuit and tried her on instead. And I like how she fits, nice and tight.\" Azazel replied in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowley just remained silent for a moment, then cracked Rebekah's neck again. \"I would ask why you picked out a host body for me that wields absolutely no authority in this dump. And WHERE are our minions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, Lilith is sorting out assuming control of this place, and as for the body, consider it a temporary layover.\" Azazel said, turning around to look his fellow demon in his pretty new features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough! But don't put too much faith in Lilith.\" Crowley warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll get the job done.\" Azazel stated, as he let Laura's eyes finally revert back to their normal color. He then moved forward a planted a kiss on Rebekah's lips, causing Crowly to arch his host's eyebrows and lick his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" Crowley then said, before moving in to properly start kissing Laura's possessed body. \"In the meantime, let's make these two 'besties' get even more intimate with each other, whad'ya say?\" He grinned, in between kisses.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wilko Assistant Manager Liz, Assistant Supervisor Steven, Beautylicious owner Carly, and senior employee Zoe were in the midst of their bi-weekly lunch date. The four were quite close with each other and had been for several years, sharing many wild and unbelievable adventures in that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, it would be a great idea!\" Steven said, again trying to sell the group on his latest plan to boost employee satisfaction. \"Imagine how much more fun everyone would have?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but good look convincing Nat of that. I certainly won't suggest it for you. I want to actually keep my position!\" Liz said, playfully nudging Steven as the two salon-workers giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys have the craziest ideas\" Carly said before taking a sip of her coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I thought dealing with our customers was annoying. Imagine all this drama too\" Zoe said as she had a bite of her salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group continued talking and joking, one of the lights started flickering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy, I thought we were supposed to get these bad fuses fixed weeks ago\" Steven muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me, Emma's the one who handles stuff like that. But she's always so busy in her office. Id be shocked if she knows about anything that goes on anywhere else\" Liz said with a frown as three more lights began flickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four were so busy focusing on the lights, that none of them saw the four swirls of black smoke rising from the floor until they sped up and headed straight into their mouths. Steven, Liz, Carly, and Zoe all fell to the floor gagging as their bodies shook uncontrollably. The table, containing all their food, had fallen with them, creating a mess of spilled food and broken glass on the floor. Within a few moments, the lights were back to normal and the four friends sat motionless on the ground. One at a time, they rose and opened their eyes, revealing inky blackness only slightly less slick than Azazel's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, look at these! This one's nice\" 'Zoe' said, giving her large breasts a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mine's not bad either\" said 'Carly,' who was now admiring her reflection in a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, you're all lovely, but this cock isn't going to suck itself\" said 'Steven,' who already had his pants down with 'Liz' caressing him. \"Shall we have some fun in honor of new management?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The demon inside him peered down at 'Liz' as she greedily took the full length of his shaft into her mouth while simultaneously rubbing her vagina through her trousers. The once professional assistant manager had been turned into a cock-sucking whore by the male demon inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame these meatbags only have one dick between them.\" 'Zoe' said, breaking off from snogging 'Carly'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's eyes finally returned to their normal colour as the demon looked at Zoe's possessed body. \"With my stamina, there's enough of this dick to go around.\" He chuckled, as Liz's head continued to move back and forth vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time 'Carly' spun around on her stiletto heels. \"There will be if this dipshit stops hogging it.\" She said, swiftly kicking Liz's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's body just gave 'Carly' the middle finger as it continued blowing Steven's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can have fun with these meatsuits without a dick.\" 'Zoe' chuckled as she sashayed over to her 'best friend' and 'co-worker', approaching behind her and slipping her manicured hands down Carly's skirt and into her knickers. The demon wearing Zoe had to bent over significantly to do this act, as he was much taller than his fellow demon inside Carly's petite form.

These demons also did not have the same telekinetic abilities as their masters and mistress. Of course, staying in the shadows wasn't the most fun in the world, but orders were orders...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they watched the show, however, they heard noise from a few rooms over, which they curiously followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allie, our bosses are all like three doors down, if we get caught...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Nat, we'll be fine.

Ever since she came across the medallion, her life had changed for the better. It allowed the user to shapeshift into another person, just by wearing the medallion and touching an item of clothing worn by another person, to take on their form. The medallion could also cause two people to morph into each other if they touched it at the same time. Emma also found out that if you concentrate hard enough you can morph individual body parts. Emma was very careful and kept the medallion in a safe in her office, she'd heard rumours that the medallion had a tendancy to dissappear. She often wondered how many people the medallion had left permanently morphed in its wake. Through experimentation, Emma also discovered that you had to wait at least twelve hour between morphs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's popularity certainly increased when she told her staff about the medallion and allowed them to use it whenever they wanted to, but strictly under her supervision. She would not let the medallion out of her sight, it didn't even leave her office. Once a morph had been made, Emma immediately locked the medallion away in her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed once more, she was currently wearing the form of one of her previous employees, Natasha. Natasha left Wilko a few years back, but luckily for Emma, Natasha had left her old work polo shirts behind. Natasha was fairly attractive, 5'8\", 21 years old and had C-cup breasts. What Emma really loved about Natasha was her Athletic body. Natasha wasn't the only form that Emma would take on, but in recent weeks it was one of her favourites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma reluctantly placed the medallion around her neck, and held an old t-shirt of her own and morphed back into her own form. Emma was disappointed to be in her old body, but at least it was only 42 years old now instead of 47 years old. The t-shirt that Emma had used to morph back into herself was last worn when she was on holiday five years ago. If she knew that she was going to come across the medallion of Zulo, she never would have given her old clothes to charity six months ago. What she would give to be able to morph into her own body, but when it was only 21 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma spent a few minutes getting changed. She had to change her suit as the one she wore in Natasha's 5'8\" body no longer fit her 5'4\" frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Emma finished getting changed, there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Emma said as she sat behind her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her supervisors, Steven, walked in, his high heels clicking on the floor as he entered. Steven, a 41 year old man was now one of the prettiest people in the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me?\" Steven said with his feminine voice. Steven looked a little confused to see Emma in her own body... looking a little younger than it used to if he remembered correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright love?\" Steven asked. It had been months since he saw Emma wearing her own body, and knew she only did it reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed \"Gemma's coming in for a visit today... for some bullshit HR thing. I don't want her finding out about the medallion, so you'd better morph back into yourself pronto. Gemma would be pissed if she found out that we had a magic shape-shifting medallion. She'd be even more pissed if she found out that you were using it to turn into an exact replica of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven huffed and stamped his foot on the floor \"You know how much I hate being a man. Especially wearing my own body! Besides it was your idea for me to be a woman permanently, to keep with the female supervisor tradition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma rolled her eyes \"Don't you get sassy with me you stroppy cow! I'm the one who made you supervisor and I can also unmake you! If you don't want to be yourself, then you'd better morph into someone who isn't Gemma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven pouted, he loved Gemma's body, but knew he'd have to choose another... at least for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... I'll wear another form!\" Steven whined like a spoiled little girl as he punched the code into the safe and removed the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven placed the medallion around his neck and looked towards Emma \"You got anything new to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smiled \"You know what I have! I snuck by Carly's salon earlier and took her scarf from the coat rack when she wasn't looking. Also I emptied Elizabeth's old locker yesterday and found she left an old bracelet in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor, below the safe was a box of clothing, Steven pondered to himself, should he morph into Carly? Elizabeth? Or pick something from the box he was more familiar with? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm, time to be a little curvier and shorter.\" Steven cooed in Gemma's voice, as he picked up Carly's scarf, that Emma had stolen from Beautylicious. Immediately he felt a tingling sensation overwhelm his sexy body, and he first began to shrink in height. His long blonde hair retreated into his head until he sported a familiar bobbed hairstyle, his tits - while staying a C-cup - sagged a little more but his ass and hips expanded against he fabric of his skirt. In no time at all, Steven had morphed into a copy of his friend Carly, from Beautylicious. He stepped out of the black patent high heels he had been wearing with ease, since his new feet were slightly smaller than Gemma's. And his skirt suit also seemed a tad too big for him, but not much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always a rush seeing someone transform like that.\" Emma shook her head, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Steven grinned, speaking in Carly's sexy voice as he walked around to where the box of clothes was on the floor. Next to the box was a large carrier bag, which contained some of Carly's older clothes and shoes that he had been tasked with taking to a charity shop. Of course he didn't, and he'd kept them himself. He took the medallion off first and tossed it to Emma, who kept it in her hand for now. Then Steven pulled a red tank top and a short white skirt from the bag, quickly getting changed into them and tossing his navy skirt suit in the box. He did however keep wearing the knickers and bra he'd worn while being Gemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think Carly would be pissed if she found out you were turning into a copy of her? Emma smirked, as she watched Steven slip his feet into a pair of Carly's well-worn, black leather pumps with a 3-inch heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah, probably. Though not as pissed as Gemma would be to see me in her form.\" Steven giggled, running his fingers through his new hairstyle as he strutted around the room in Carly's pumps. He slapped his manicured hands on his shapely ass and then flashed a grin at his manager, who was a couple of inches taller than him while wearing her T-bar heels. \"But she won't know, will she?\" He said to her in a giddy tone. \"God, her body feels so fucking nice. But it needs a good fucking.\" He lamented. \"She's single again and therefore... she's not getting laid. And even though this is only a copy of her body, it's a god damn accurate one.\" Steven explained, rubbing his pussy through his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, Steven, I know how the whole thing works.\" Emma chuckled, as she inspected herself in her compact mirror. She could tell that she was a few years younger than she was usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when's the bitch arriving?\" Steven chirped in his new voice, as he squeezed his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a couple of hours. I've still got to let Liz know, and Natalie.\" Emma answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking great.\" Steven mumbled, shaking his pretty head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several of the characters will disappear and some new ones will be introduced. Story plots can take place outside of Wilko of course, as long as at least some of the story's characters are used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Wilko Employees:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emma</b>, 47, is the manager of the store and is in good shape for her age.

At work she wears a short-sleeved white blouse, a pair of black, womens' trousers and a pair of black, 2-inch heeled t-bar shoes. She's married to Kyle, 45, has a biological daughter, Alice, 17, and an adopted daughter Grace, 14, both with long, dark brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Liz</b>, 38, is now the assistant manager of the store following Elizabeth's departure to run her own store in Crystal Peaks, Sheffield. Liz is 5'4\" tall, her light brown hair is long, past her shoulders and she wears it in a ponytail nearly all of the time. She has size 30H-cup breasts, average curves and an ample backside. At work, due to her new position and her dislike of skirts, she is required to wear a black trouser suit, a white blouse and a pair of <i>Prada</i> black leather high heel loafers that boost her height to 5'7\". Liz is married to her much older husband Eric, 53, and has a five-year old son, Ethan (via artificial insemination). Eric has a son, Reece, 28, and a daughter, Courtney, 22, from his previous marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Natalie</b>, 34, is now the staff supervisor following Liz's promotion. She is a fairly attractive woman with shoulder-length, straight brown hair with blonde highlights, she stands 5'6\" tall and is quite slender, she has a modest backside and C-cup breasts. Not overly curvy, she is still very pleasing to the eye. At work she wears her Wilko polo, black slacks and some comfortable flats. Natalie is married to her husband Mike, 35, and is the mother of a young son, Harry, who is now almost four years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Steven</b>, 41, is now the assistant supervisor, having been persuaded to take on the role by Liz. He is the second oldest male employee, he is 6'0\" tall, he wears glasses is average looking and has very short, brown hair.

Steven still has not entered into a relationship with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gemma</b>, 31, is still the HR Rep who regularly visits the store.

He is well built but not overly muscular, has a shaved head but his hair is normally black when he starts growing it. While at work he wears black trousers, a white security shirt with the logo of his security firm sewn on the pocket and a pair black leather boots.

Caleb has a blonde wife, Esther, and two young daughters, Leah, 12, and Maya, 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>John</b>, 42, is Wilko's janitor. He's 5'11\" and has a decent build, but a bit of a pudgy gut. He is the oldest male employee, has short, balding brown hair and a slightly graying beard. At work, he wears dark blue coveralls with a black t-shirt underneath as well as a pair of black work boots. John is generally a friendly man and gets along well with the rest of the Wilko staff. He's married to his wife Amanda, 40, and they have two kids, Brendon, 15, and Melody, 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sasha</b>, 25, is the new cosmetics salesperson in the store. She is an attractive woman with raven black hair that she wears in a bob style. Standing 5'3 tall, she has a nice figure, a sexy ass, nice D-cup breasts and wears either a skirt suit or trouser suit to work, along with a white blouse and a pair of black suede, 3-inch stiletto pumps that boost her height to 5'6\". She is engaged to her boyrfriend Isaac, 27, but they have any kids yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Aaron</b>, 33, he is about 5'10\" tall, and he's got himself back in shape at the gym after letting his physique go for a while. He is still a heavy smoker, and sometimes smokes weed. He's calmed down over the years but can still get angry if provoked, and he sometimes refrains from speaking to anyone. Usually wears black sneakers along with his usual black trousers and company polo. Aaron has a chubby girlfriend called Sue and they now have a young daughter named Kirsty who is nearly three years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Becca</b>, 30, still the chattiest worker in the store, standing about 5'5\". She is still a bit on the chubby side, which has made her ass a little bigger also, and her breasts are a C-cup. Her goth phase is way behind her and her hair is back to it's natural brown color. She now wears normal black slacks instead of jeans and either black sneakers or leather flats. Despite her minor weight gain, Becca is single again after splitting up with her boyfriend a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Luke</b>, 27, a tall individual at 6'2\" in height, has a short, dark brown crewcut hairstyle and is quite handsome and fit. He is popular and easy going, always one to have a laugh with his friends. He wears a red company shirt, black pants and smart, dress shoes. Used to have a crush on Rebekah but it went away some time after he hooked up with his girlfriend Rachel, 26, whom he is now engaged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mark</b>, 29, standing 6'1\" tall, he is somewhat gangly and has short black hair in a crewcut. He has average looks, but is good natured and surprisingly he is still engaged to an attractive girlfriend named Vicky, who is 25 years old. They can't agree on their marriage date. The usual red company shirt is accompanied by Mark's black trousers and his black sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rebekah</b>, 25, one of the friendliest and prettiest staff members, very attractive woman, shapely figure, about 5'5\" tall, long blonde hair, B-Cup breasts. She's slowly matured over the last few years and now looks much sexier. Very warm personality. She's currently single after breaking up with her Spanish boyfriend six months ago, but there is no shortage of male interest in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Laura</b>, 24, not so shy anymore, but still quiet, and she is Rebekah's best friend. Standing 5'5\" tall, she also wears her dark blonde hair in a plait style or a ponytail at work, and wears the trademark company polo shirt, black, boot-cut trousers, black tights underneath and a pair of sensible black flats. This delightful individual has perky B-Cup breasts and is quite attractive. She is still dating her good looking boyfriend, Dylan, 24.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mona</b>, 25, a pretty Iranian-born Muslim girl, about 5'4\" in height, B-cup breasts, black hair (she does not wear a headscarf, unlike her mother), she wears contacts (or glasses), has perky breasts and as well as the usual company top, she wears black trousers or jeans and either a pair of ballet flats or dark sneakers. Wears a necklace with an Islamic crescent hanging from it. She has now been married to a family friend, Ahmad, 28, for over 12 months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Charlotte</b>, a 25-year old woman who has tried to change her behavior for the better over the last couple of years. Her co-workers have noticed an improvement in her attitude towards others, but she still finds herself easily irritated by some people she meets. And she is still more than capable of holding a grudge. Charlotte is the second tallest woman in the store at 5'9\" tall, wears her dark hair in whatever style she fancies on the day. She also has B-Cup breasts. She wears black pants/leggings and either black flats or purple plimsolls. Charlotte is still dating a boy she met in college, Jacob, 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jade</b>, 25 years old, she has long auburn hair, which she nearly always wears down, but occasionally in a messy bun. Jade is 5'7\" and is also on the slender side, but what sticks out about Jade most is her piercings and several tattoos. She is usually dressed in the company polo, a pair of tight womens' pants and black lace-up shoes. Jade is not a very chatty girl, and she's into rock music and some metal bands. Jade has shown no apparent interest in romantic relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rob</b>, 24, a slender guy with short black hair, 5'9\" tall, decent looks. He knows how to have a laugh and is a decent worker. Though he is known to slack off if those around him are doing the same. Wears black trousers and black sneakers as well as his Wilko polo. Rob has a 'casual' girlfriend, a cute 5'4\" brunette named Stacey, age 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Liam</b>, 23, still the worst employee at Wilko as far as work rate and personality are concerned. Liam is 5'8\" and has now cut his brown hair short. Certainly not ugly but not male model material either. His work rate has improved slightly, but only since Liz was promoted to assistant manager. He's still not very popular with the other staff because of his lax attitude. He wears his company shirt, normal black trousers and a pair of black boots or sneakers. Liam still has no girlfriend, unsurprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kiran</b>, 22, is a very petite young woman, the shortest employee at 5'0\" tall, and has long, dyed black hair, mostly worn down but occasionally in a ponytail. She's very pretty and has a nice figure, along with perky B-cup breasts. She also has an outgoing personality. Likes to wear stylish black slacks and ballet flats when she's working. Kiran is still with her boyfriend, Sean, 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jessica</b>, 28, is an attractive, curvy red-head, 5'5\" tall and has C-cup breasts. She's outgoing, polite and acts very \"girly\", and with her red Wilko blouse/polo shirt and black trousers she also wears either a pair of black high heel ankle boots or stiletto pumps. She wears her ginger hair in a ponytail and she still has no interest in finding a boyfriend. Jessica is also heavily into environmentalism and donates to charities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Michael</b>, 26, is a tall, broad shouldered employee with short, neatly-combed dark hair. He's about 6'1\" tall, has kind of a smug personality and isn't a stranger to skipping work whenever he can get away with it. Though he isn't as bad as certain others are at slacking. Michael wears a Wilko formal shirt instead of a polo shirt, black pants and smart black shoes. Michael is still engaged to his girlfriend Amy, 23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jodie</b>, 24, is a redheaded young woman with freckles, she stands 5'4\" tall and either wears her hair down or in a ponytail while she works. She has C-cup breasts and she wears the usual Wilko blouse/polo shirt, black trousers, socks and a pair of well-worn flats. She seems to be the quiet sort, not known to smile a lot, and is the mother of a two-year old son, Oliver, whose father wants nothing to do with him or Jodie following a family feud. Because of stress she suffers from, she smokes cigarettes but she is trying to quit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ellie</b>, 23, a 5'3\", friendly woman with light brown hair reaching to halfway down her back. She has a full figure but is not chubby, she also has perky C-cup breasts and a nice big ass which comes close to Becca's in size.

He is one of the tallest individuals in the store at 6'2\", is good looking, has a buzz cut, and is the most muscular of all the male employees. He wears the Wilko polo shirt, black trousers and Nike sneakers. Darrell has a black girlfriend, Alisha, 24, and they too are now engaged to be married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Claire</b>, 22, is one of the store's more diligent workers. She stands at 5'10\", making her the tallest girl at Wilko, ahead of Charlotte, and is very slender, lacking any noticeable curves. She has small A-cup boobs and a boyish ass, she has cropped, dark red hair and she wears designer glasses. She's a timid girl, but also friendly and chatty when engaged in conversation. Claire recently came out as a lesbian to her co-workers, but this really didn't surprise anybody. Despite coming out, her colleagues still don't know if she has had a girlfriend in the past or remains a virgin, and she hasn't shown any inkling of being willing to share such personal information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily</b>, 23, is 5'5\", pretty, has a decent figure and is a quiet, slightly nerdy looking girl, preferring to keep to herself most of the time. She has C-cup breasts, wears dark-rimmed glasses and has long dark hair that she wears up in a ponytail. At work she wears the usual company polo shirt (fleece optional), fairly tight black slacks, black tights underneath and a pair of women's black patent loafers with a slight chunky heel. She still does not have a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Michelle</b>, 32, is one of the more demure employees. Not the most intelligent person, she is nonetheless a polite, cheerful woman with straight brown hair that she wears down at work. She is 5'5\" tall, pretty and has a decent figure and C-cup breasts. At work she wears the usual Wilko polo, tight black slacks and some black suede flats.
