If you hadn't moved, you'd have been pancaked instantly--a heck of a way to go, but you preferred survival to a memorable death.

During your impromptu flight, you catch sight of her--what else--reading a book, utterly engrossed in the text. She looked pretty cute like that, so enthusiastic over her book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again, survival prevailed over cuteness. Trying to control your areal tumble, you make a grab for the closest thing you can--a strand of Twilight's mane. You snatch the purple-and-pink lifeline, and hold on for dear life! You were going so fast that your momentum carries you forward, swinging on Twilight's mane like some tiny Tarzan. Well, maybe not Tarzan. You doubted if he ever swang from a vine treated with flower-scented shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay...this was starting to get fun! You let out a giddy laugh, whooping with adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hairs you'd grabbed on to were long enough to partially wrap around Twilight's head--and make you lose your grip at the apex of the arc, sliding off her mane and falling right onto the book Twilight was reading, your landing making a little <i>thud!</i> on the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally still, and not sensing any danger, you burst out laughing between pants. \"Well, that was...a lot of fun!\" You exult.  \"I almost wish I could do...that...again?\" Another shadow covers you, and you look up in fear....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And find Twilight Sparkle looking down at you, her purple eyes wide. Even sitting down, she towered over you--you had to be the size of a grain of rice compared to her. Maybe this wasn't so much fun, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked in surprise at your sudden appearance, cocking her head to one side. She leaned in, examining you closely--<i>too</i> closely, making you yelp again and scramble back in fear. She wasn't showing any signs of anger or hostility, but you instincts still kicked in; having a she-creature who was hundreds of feet tall from your perspective was unnerving, no matter how cute she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled at your frantic reaction, pulling her head back to give you space.

The supply-shelves along the walls were as big as radio towers--and that wasn't even touching on the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place looked big enough to fit an aircraft carrier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the effect was impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to stand up, rubbing your temples and giving yourself a pep-talk. \"Okay...so somehow I find myself in a giant version of Carousel Boutique--or I shrank somehow and this is normal-sized--and however I got here apparently knocked me unconscious.

It was even a little bouncy too. Getting your mid off of your situation for a bit, you stand up on this surface, and bounce around on it, playfully giggling as you do. It was almost as fun as a moon bounce. Where ever you thought these kidnappers took you, it sure was enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to pan around the area, and what you saw was kinda odd. 3 weird looking mountains in a row stood very close to you. You bounce over to them and saw that they stood at least 20 feet taller than you. You touch them, and find that they are not made of rock, but something a little like..... glass. You could see that where the \"mountains\" lowered, they wrapped around the long field of that bouncy fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like a giant glass slipper\" you thought. This really got you to wonder where the hell you were, so you decide to leap off the weird object, and onto the floor. But what you landed on seemed to be like large stalks of fabric, that went halfway up your body, at least up to your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is really getting weird. Where am I?\" you said, and turned to pan the room again. By now, your eyes adjusted to the dark, and what you saw, made your jaw drop. The object you thought was a giant slipper, was just that, a gigantic slipper. And it looked like there were 3 others bunched up with each other. You looked around even more, and saw what looked to be dressers the size of skyscrapers, a decorative rug the size of a track meet field, and a bed the size of a White Star Liner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Everything is so HUGE!\" you yelled in surprise. You decide to pinch yourself, and it hurts. You obviously are NOT dreaming. \"Where am I? A-At some movie set...... or d-did I really shrink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*RUMBLE*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the room started to quake beneath your feet. Judging by the size of everything, you knew that the owner of this room, had to be a giant, and a BIG one at that. You didn't know where to go. You didn't want to hide in the slippers, you knew you would get crushed if you did. You could only stand and hope the giant didn't see you. Though you were as small as an ant, how would he...... or not to your knowledge, she.</span></div></div>",

I'm a living being!\" You shouted at her, although it sounds like high pitched squeaks from Luna's point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe thou does not have much of a choice hooman.\" Luna replied as she levitated you to the slipper that you bit her hind hoof on, dropping you in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only look up as Luna's giant smiling face fills the slippers entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, when I put my hoof in the slipper I expect thou to lick and massage it as I go fulfill my duties in Night Court. If thou does not, thou will be punished for disobedience.\" Luna proclaimed as she pushed her hoof inside the slipper, pinning you to the insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna taps her hoof as if saying \"I'm waiting.\" Knowing that you do not have much of a choice and didn't want to risk whatever punishment that Luna would inflict on her tiny 'pet' you obediently licked her soft hoof and used your tiny body to massage her hoof as best you can. Luckily for you, her hoof doesn't taste that bad but you don't know how long that will last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Luna lets out a pleased sigh as she feels your tiny tongue lapping at her hoof and your tiny body squirming underneath it as she walks to her Night Court with a bit more pep in her steps.</span></div></div>",

It was more comfortable as well to be pressed into the plush of the throne as opposed to the hard crystal ground.<br>\r\nBy the time you finished her first forehoof you felt very tired as well as a bit sick from swallowing all the dirt and sweat but you console yourself by remembering that you only have one hoof left.<br>\r\nCadence then orders you to stop and magically moves you to the next hoofrest and presses her other forehoof into you for you to lick.<br>\r\nAfter a good while you finally finished cleaning the Princess' hooves and she smiled down at you.<br>\r\n\"I'm actually impressed, most humans are more resistant at first. But you seem to be quite submissive, a very good trait in a human.\" Princess Cadence said as she casually brushed you off of her hoofrest, causing you to tumble to the ground.
