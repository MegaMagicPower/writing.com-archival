Mostly he just swept and polished the machines in the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day while he was cleaning up in the lab he noticed a new piece of machinery. It looked like a large metal circle. On a nearby table there was a remote control. James picked it up and walked near the circle and looked at the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what this does.\" says James checking out the remote. Sudenly, James accidently hit a button, the circle opened up, and the next thing James new he was falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while of falling James saw abright light and then he stopped falling. He had landed on something soft and warm. James looked around and realized he was in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey will you get off of me?\" Came a voice from the big cushion he had landed on. It sounded just like his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he realized that he had landed on someones stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry. I don't how I...\" As he got off he saw the face of the person he landed on. Only he saw himself looking back!! The guy looked exactly like James only he was incredibly fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!!!\" they both yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Who are you?\" asked the large James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm James. Who are you?\" said James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm James.\" said the large James.\"How'd you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was working at the lab and then I got sucked into this machine and...\"suddenly James remembered that the people in the lab had been trying to find a way into another dimension and he must have landed IN that other dimension!!!\"Oh my gosh!!

Big James, obviously surprised, lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't guys hold hands in your dimension?\" he asks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" replies James.  \"Why do you do it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Africans started it,\" replies Big James, \"and since they're the biggest and fattest guys - they have the best fashions! - everybody does it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Africans are the fattest?\" James replies in shock.  \"In my world Africa is full of starving people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Africa is rich, with lots of food,\" replies Big James.  \"Black guys get so big - it's cool!  I hope to get as big as some of the black guys I know - one of they, Wakil, is really huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stayed quiet and thought hard for a while, as the two of them proceeded down a hallway and into an elevator.  This building looked like the lab building where James worked, but different - the doors were bigger for one thing, and the benches were all wider.  He followed Big James into a spacious elevator and asked, \"Can I ask you, how big are you?  Where I come from, sometimes big people don't like to be asked about their size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig James chuckled and replied, \"Oh, here it's the skinny people who don't want to talk about their weight!  I weigh 411 pounds - for my, well our, height, that's...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The office was spectacular, resembling more of mansion than a doctor's office. The office was ornated by posters of beautiful slim models and decorated with erotic statues of women, all basking in the joy of their slender physiques. As they gazed upon the celebrated depictions, the girls were approached by a nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lucy Stanford? The doctor is ready to see you.\" said the nurse leading them down the lavish hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was envious of the nurse. A gorgeous blonde with a size 2 waist and a respectable pair of C cup breasts which she flaunted by leaving some buttons undone. Lisa wanted a figure like the nurse. She wanted to be thin like the world demanded of her. They arrived at Dr Hope whose appearance didn't give off the impression of a doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Ms Stanford, enjoying your desserts again .\" he said embracing Lisa in a hug \"though this time it seems you've really let yourself go. Fret not, I'll give you some pills that'll fix everything.\" Dr Hope stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear I could change the world. I have many abilities. If it is wealth you desire, I can grant, if it is physical perfection you want, I can give, if you want fame, I can bestow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you have that kind of power?\" Emily awed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to be thin.\" Lisa urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Take this pill and absolutely follow the directions. Failure to do so could result in global catastrophe \" Dr Hope warned handing Lisa a diet pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes uh-huh.\" Lisa eagerly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls left the enchanted building and drove off. Lisa read the directions which stated: SWALLOW PILL AND DO NOT EAT FOR 1 HOUR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple enough.\" Lisa said popping the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant Lisa swallowed the pill, she was blasted with a relentless hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so hungry!!!\" whined Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Lisa, just hold out for an hour.\" Emily pointed at her car's clock \"See 2:00, at 3:00 you can eat all you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls drove to the mall to do some shopping to pass the time. Lisa clutched her hungry stomach, envying all the skinny women walking around her, anxiously waiting to shop at all of the alluring clothing shops that never carried anything larger than a size 8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally 3:00!\" Lisa rejoiced ordering a huge meal from the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa fervently shoveled food through her mouth. Greasy burgers, salty fries, thick milkshakes, chicken strips, and onion rings in moments stuffed Lisa's stomach. However, unbeknownst to the fat girl was that the car's clock was 10 minutes to behind and she had just monumentally shattered the pill's directions.<br>\r\nLisa became dizzy and past out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa Lisa\" echoed Emily's voice \"Lisa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was uncertain how much time had past but eventually Lisa regained consciousness, Lisa finding herself on the floor. Of course her shirt rode up exposing her fat belly which still existed. Emily was no where in sight. Lisa scanned herself over. She was still fat as ever, the pill failed. Heaving her fatself up Lisa reasoned she should stroll the area in search of Emily. Walking through the mall, things seemed off. There were a bunch of women, rather portly, sauntering through the mall. They also appeared oddly confident, exhibiting no sense of shame walking their hefty bodies around. In fact, their attire complimented their larger bodies.<br>\r\nIt was then that an advertisement caught Lisa's attention. It displayed a plus size model. The mall normally didn't advertise plus size models except at the only plussize store. Lisa suddenly realized plus sized models were on all of the ads. Not a single slender woman appeared on ANY advertisement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...What's going on?\" Lisa queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy eating a heaping of fastfood within the hour, Lisa had disrupted the magic of Dr Hope's pill and altered society. Instead of making her thin, it made society fat. No longer was skinny the ideal body that society dictated to women. In fact being skinny was loathed and ridiculed by men and women alike. Now obesity was glorified amongst the female population. Being fat meant everything to girls in this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was real. Fat is beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa found herself in the middle of a fat-positive world. Posters displayed luscious women well above the 200 pound mark, extra large mannequins draped in trendy clothes posed in esteemed department stores, food stands were plentiful and proudly boasted of their high calorie count. The thought of women being fat, let alone wanting to be fat, shocked Lisa. Lisa began to walk down the mall before quickly stepping into an automated walkway. Now being relieved of the effort, Lisa saw many other women taking the same liberty, totally unabashed by the indolence. It was then that Lisa noticed that the mall was filled with automated walkways. Women barely had to exert themselves in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa let herself be carried away, she studied each clothing store. Every last one catering solely to larger sized ladies. Bikinis sized 28 ornamented windows, lingerie graced the wideness of obese mannequins, bridal shops advertised there opulent gowns with fat women. Filled with awe, Lisa entered a store. Upon entering, Lisa's visage was graced by waves of plus size outfits. Unlike in her previous world these outfits were downright fashionable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello Ms. Is there anything I can help you with?\" greeted a hefty woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh just browsing.\" Lisa uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's eyes studied the well fed woman before her. She flaunted her weight with \"flattering\" attire. Her shirt was unbuttoned low revealing generous cleavage. The buttons that were done were strained. Her clothes tightly wrapped around her curves. She wore a very short skirt that exposed her thick dimpled thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay then you just call if you need anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa than watched as the wide woman sauntered her way to help another customer, a 400 pound woman deciding which thong to buy. As Lisa perused the aisles she exchanged friendly glances with fellow plus sized women. In the past skinny woman scoffed at others, even their skinny sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knew high fat diets had such a positive impact on women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa found herself standing before a tantalizing bikini. She never would've worn it in her old world but now that fat was good, Lisa felt optimistic. Picking it off from the hanger, Lisa took it to the changing room. Taking a space next to a woman inspecting her self in a pair of short shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. It doesn't make me look fat enough.\" groaned the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps this would suit you better. It would really compliment your cellulite.\" suggested an employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customer and attendent continued prattling as Lisa removed her clothes and donned the bikini. It was revealing. Flesh that she had never showed before was now on full display. Despite the unfamiliar breathe of air on her bare thighs, Lisa felt good, liberated in fact. A bikini was way more comfortable than any confining one piece. Lisa then turned her attention to her reflection in the mirror. Never before had she studied her physique with such optimism. Accustomed to hiding her curves in baggy clothing, Lisa never noticed just how curvacious she was. Most notably was how huge her boobs were. They were spilling out of the already large top. Her belly so huge and doughy now suddenly seemed appealing, mesmerizing in fact. Lowering her sights to her chunky legs left her intrigued. There was nothing gross about her fat legs, if anything the bumpy flesh made it interesting. Lisa then twisted around to look at her butt. It was so big and round, temptation prompted her to spank it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That felt...interesting.\" Lisa admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Lisa needed a second opinion, her fat body couldn't be that nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me.\" Lisa waved over an employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes ms?\" asked the woman waddling her ample body over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" Lisa asked baring all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee enthusiastically answered...</span></div></div>",

Lisa decided that since she was going to start to diet tomorrow, today would be her celebration and it would be an ice cream cone. She patiently waited as the kids in front of her ordered and paid for their ice cream. Finally it was her turn when a flash of light knocked her to the ground. The ice cream man bolted out of the truck and helped Lisa to her feet. \"What was that?\" Lisa asked groggily.<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just saw you fall to the ground.

She handed them a city map, a pair of bus passes, a tourism guide and a wallet with two small plastic cards.  \"You might want to go to the City Hall first and register,\" she went on, \"the doctor has already spoken to the mayor about your status and the city will help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" said Lisa, \"and what about shopping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those charge cards are tied to a city account,\" the nurse said.  \"They'll let you buy a bit - new clothes,\" she said, indicating their very plain hospital-issue duds, \"a few meals, a hotel for the night.  But you must talk to the mayor soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" said James, and the newly fattened couple continued their weighty progress out of the hospital.  The first thing they noticed was there seemed to be no stairs - everything had either ramps or elevators.  They walked down the shallow ramp from the hospital entrance to the sidewalk and saw a bus stop a few metres away.  Unlike bus stops in their old world, though, this one had a number of comfy benches about it, most occupied by one or two people - a few were smaller than James and Lisa, but most were about their size, and some were much bigger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said James, \"city hall first, or shopping?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping!\" said Lisa enthusiastically.  \"I'm not meeting the mayor wearing this old thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said James.  As he spoke a bus drew up to the stop, and threw open its broad doors.  The driver inside beamed as the other passengers boarded.  James and Lisa approached the door, and Lisa noticed that the driver was fatter than James - a lot fatter than James.  The bus was adapted to him though - the steering wheel was very small, and set off to right, so it didn't interfere with his mammoth gut.

On the other side, a towering block announced that it was 'Giant Galleria and Giant Towers phases I-IV'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Lisa got off, and walked through the huge revolving door into the Galleria, where they paused to consult a store plan.  None of the store names seemed familiar, though some looked something like a store name back home - 'Robin Baskin' ice cream, for example - and James and Lisa were both puzzled by the lack of Big 'n' Tall or Plus clothing shops.  They were about to ask a passerby when an idea struck Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, James, they wouldn't have Big 'n' Tall shops - everyone here is big!\" she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head out then!\" James said.

They were lying on a vast bed of some sort, in a dimly lit room that looked like a bedroom - but the proportions were off.  The door, for example, was too wide.  Before James can fully come, too, though, the door opens and two people come in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they're clearly people, but unlike any James and Lisa have seen before.  The man has red hair and glasses, and James thinks that his eyes might be blue, but they are buried so far back behind fat cheeks that it is hard to tell. And it is not only the man's face that is fat - he has no neck either, and his shoulders are huge!  So are his arms, hugely fat inside a loose tank top that drapes over a pair of exceeding fat pecs and droops down onto a huge gut.  The other person is a huge woman, blonde, with green eyes also buried in fat cheeks, and a vast cleavage thanks to two huge breasts that rode just above a huge belly.  Her arms were thick with fat too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're waking up!\" says the man, \"that's good!  How do you feel, are you hurt?  We'll get you help if you need it, but we didn't want to embarrass you by calling an ambulance unnecessarily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embarrass us?  What happened?\" James asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you seemed to fall out of the sky beside our picnic.  We were just having lunch outside the lab when you literally fell onto the ground beside us. You didn't seem hurt, only dazed, so we hustled you here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman added, \"If we'd called an ambulance then the photogs would have seen you and that would have been SO embarrassing for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embarrassing?\" asked Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you two are so scrawny, they would have photoing you a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scrawny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, we've never seen anybody as thin as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said James.  \"Cause you seem pretty fat to us - no insult intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, being called fat is never an insult!\" said the woman brightly.  \"Anyway, I'm Lisa and this is my husband James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing!
