However, his big star, The Werewolf, had decided to retire to some beach, and not race anymore. Dracula used a book to find out who the next werewolf was, which turned out to be Shaggy, who is a racecar driver from America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracula then sent his henchmen, The Hunch Bunch, aka Brunch and Crunch, to go turn Shaggy into a werewolf. After several attempts, which were foiled by Shaggy's best friend/pet dog Scooby-Doo, the Hunch Bunch managed to turn Shaggy into a werewolf. The Neferius Duo then transported Shaggy, his girlfriend Googie, Scooby, and Scrappy to Transalvania where Dracula makes a deal with Shaggy: If the American won the Big Race, Dracula would turn the guy back to normal, and send him, his girlfriend, and his dogs, back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy agreed to the deal, but Dracula had his fangs crossed, and ordered the Hunch Bunch to do everything they could to prevent Shaggy from winning. Despite the efforts of the Hunch Bunch, Dracula, and other monsters, Shaggy manages to win the race. Dracula however, refused to honor his deal, and soon there was game of \"Steal and Keep Away\" involving the Book of Monsters and Spells, which would turn Shaggy back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy and his friends managed to get the book and get home, where Googie helped turn Shaggy turn back into a human. However, just before the movie ended, Dracula and The Hunch Bunch showed up outside the window saying, \"We're Back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what character's view will the story be from?</span></div></div>",

Of course, once the Sun comes up, he'll turn back into a human. The trick is casting the spell that will make the transformation permanent, and it must be done when he is a werewolf, or else he'll never turn into a werewolf again, and we'll have to wait until the next candidate is born, in three hundred years, and I don't plan to wait that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood Master,\" Brunch said. \"We'll get to work on it.\" With that, the two hunchbacked monsters took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those fools,\" Dracula said as he took out a small pocketbook and began to read one of the chapters. \"I'm just glad I found the contingency spell in the 'Monster Pocket Book'. Let's see, 'Once transformed into a werewolf, the subject will always turn when the moon hits their skin. Also, there is a way to make the transformation permanent.' Now that I like. 'See page 456 of the \"Pocket Spell Book\".' What? That's just great! I don't have the spell book on me.\" Dracula then threw the book at the ground, one of the pages exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the Hunch Bunch showed up with a ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, get that thing in position,\" Dracula shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you might wish to tone it down,\" Brunch said as he and Crunch positioned the ladder. \"After all, you don't want to wake them up before we transform Shaggy back into a werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! We'll get him, one way, or another,\" Dracula said, as he saw that the ladder was in position. \"I'll go up first, and make sure that it is done right.\" With that, he took hold of the rungs, and began climbing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Master, just to let you know, we did cut a hole in the roof when we were trying to turn him the first time,\" Brunch said. \"You could use that to turn him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea Brunch,\" Dracula said, as he peeked into the bedroom window, where he saw Shaggy and Googie snuggling in a bed. \"Oh I'll get him for making a fool of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he made it to the roof, when he heard something coming from Crunch. He looked down and asked, \"What does that mushmouth want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just wants me to read this passage from this book he found,\" Brunch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go ahead,\" Dracula said, as he pulled himself onto the roof, and began to look for the disturbed portion of the roof. \"It won't do any harm to read it.\" He then spotted the disturbed portion and began to remove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Master!\" Brunch shouted, just as Dracula removed the plug, allowing moonlight to enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Dracula asked as he walked back to the edge of the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, the book says that the curse can be transferred if someone is holding onto the chosen one when the moonlight hits the other person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Dracula said, as he crept back to the hole. \"Tell me I didn't mess up.\" He then took a look into the hole and saw that...</span></div></div>",

What-her-name how did she get like this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Count panted frantically as the smarter hunchback explained. \"Umm you see sire Crunch thought he could do things on his own and used the first spell on her hoping it would turn her into a werewolf and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now Dracula was really mad and annoyed as he threw a bit of a temper tantrum. \"No, no I can't do anything with a female werewolf much less a girl's who fifty feet tall it has to be Shaggy himself you numbskulls! Now our plan is ruined completely what are we going to do now?\" He pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm put her in a circus and make a lot of money perhaps sire?\" Brunch asked \"You never know sire this could be better than a dingy ole werewolf yes Shaggy's girlfriend could join our...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dracula whispered harshly \"Shut up fool she's looking this way! Quick hide don't let her see you no telling what she will do to us!\" As again he turned into a bat and flew away as the Hunch Brunch also high-tailed it out of there as for Googie once she got over her shock of being a giantess she thought. \"Maybe this isn't as bad as it appears I could get used to this!\" With that she begins to head towards the sparkling outline of the nearby city but what is her current personality? </span></div></div>",

Googie started to worry, and tried to reason with them. It's not every day that a giant good natured woman is in a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said \"Wait! I'm not going to hurt you! I just need help!\" The people didn't listen and the running and screaming continues. She is now wandering, doing her best to not step on any cars, and good for her she isn't stepping on any people. She tired to reason with everyone. But people are still scared of the big giant. She said \"Wait! Please! I'm friendly, I swear!\" But then she got hit by missiles. \"Ow! Please! I'm not a threat!\" She tried to reason, but the army keeps firing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy arrived just in time to see a giant 50 ft Googie.

She said \"Please...I'm not going...to hurt you...\" the fires kept gong and going and the army got a big net and caught her. She said \"Please...I'm just trying...to get help...I...need...help...\" then she finally fainted. The army sighed. The general said \"Phew. Well thank goodness that's over. Come on, boys. Let's take her Area 51.\" Then the city cheers as the army took away the giant Googie. The boys were too late, they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy cried \"Googie! No!\" Scooby and Scrappy said \"Googie!\" Then the boys went back to the house and started to think where she could be. Shaggy said \"How did she get so big? Like, that's so not normal!\" Scooby said \"Ruh? Raybe ra ronster rid ris? (Uh? Maybe a monster did this?)\" Scrappy said \"Maybe Uncle Scooby. But we need to help our friend! Come on!\" Then they got to their red van and drove to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Dracula and Brunch and Crunch started to follow. Dracula said \"Hurry! We can't lose them!\" They went to their car and started to follow the red van all the way. Brunch said \"This wouldn't have happened if you just listened, Brunch!\" Brunch said \"Oh yeah? Well what were you doing?\" They argued and argued and Dracula sighed. Dracula said \"This is going to be a long night.\" Then they drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the gang finally arrived at Area 51. The boys made sure they would not be seen in the area. They put their red van in invisible mode, which was added during catching the 13 ghosts saga. Then they got in, and went to find their friend. They started to worry their going to keep her here forever, since this is Area 51. Then they got to the section saying \"Big 50 ft Woman\". The boys cheered. Shaggy said \"We found her!\" Scooby and Scrappy said \"Let's go!\" Then they went in the doors. They now see her laying on the ground in a container. Googie was now in tears as she layed down. She still had her clothes on, but her skirt was noticeably different, there was something she was wearing underneath, it was a big diaper. They must have put it on her, to make sure if she needed the bathroom, it wouldn't be a big accident. Then the boys turned off camouflage mode and Googie opened her eyes as she smiled to see the boys. She got to her knees and got to them. She said \"Boys! Thank goodness you came!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they got her out of there and out of Area 51. But not before getting the other giant diapers, as they had their red van cuffed on two big cars. One was Googie, and the other a big pack of big white diapers. And it worked as they were all in invisible mode. Then they got to a forest, where they were safe. Then the boys turned off invisible mode. They got to Googie as she picked them up and hugged them. Googie said \"Thanks for saving me. But now what do we do?\" The boy smiled as did she. Scrappy said \"Don't worry Googie. We'll find a way to get you back to normal.\"</span></div></div>",

Daphne had all of her sisters look over the world to find him, since they were popular, sadly, there was no sign of the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred and Velma went over to Daphne\u2019s room, they found her very sad, looking at a picture. It was the gang when they were chasing the 13 ghosts, there was Scooby and Scrappy, Shaggy and Vincent, and there was Daphne, holding Flim-Flam, enjoying the child\u2019s company. She started to sob again, wondering if the poor boy was kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred and Velma went over to her and conformed her with hugs. Fred said \u201cIt\u2019s ok, Daphne. We\u2019re not going to give up.\u201d Velma said \u201cWe\u2019ll find him someday, Daphne. We\u2019ll get him back, we promise.\u201d Daphne said in tears \u201cI hope so. The boy was so sweet, how could he suddenly vanish?\u201d She hugged her friends for a few minutes, then she wiped her tears as they heard their phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma got up and answer it \u201cHello?\u201d Shaggy said \u201cVelma! Is us!\u201d Velma then smiled \u201cShaggy! Scooby!...and Scrappy...what\u2019s up?\u201d Scooby said \u201cRe Reed Relp! Rome Ro Ra Rorest rand rell rexplain ronce rour rhere.\u201d(We need help! Come to the forest and we\u2019ll explain one your there.) Scrappy said \u201cHurry, Velma! The military and monsters are after us!\u201d Velma said \u201cDon\u2019t worry! We\u2019re on our way!\u201d She hanged up and ran to Fred and Daphne. Velma said \u201cWe need to help the boys! They\u2019re in some trouble! The military and monsters are chasing them!\u201d They shocked those two, just as much as it shocked Velma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne said \u201cThen let\u2019s get to the Mystery Machine! What trouble did those boys get into now?\u201d Fred said \u201cI don\u2019t know, Daphne, but by what Velma just said, it\u2019s serious! Come on!\u201d They left Daphne\u2019s house and drove off in the Mystery Machine, then when they got to the forest, they saw the boys. Fred and Velma said \u201cShaggy!\u201d Daphne said \u201cScooby!\u201d They hugged their friends, happy they were still alright. Shaggy said \u201cFreddy! Velma!\u201d Scooby said \u201cRaphne!\u201d They smiled as they nervously chucked. Shaggy said \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll show you what our problem is.\u201d They led them over to a giant diapered Googie, giving Scrappy some hand rides, he was enjoying them. When he saw the boys came back with their friends, the other 3 blushed as they saw the thing before them. Googie said \u201cHi guys. Nice day isn\u2019t it?...\u201d she laughed nervously. Daphne said \u201cGoogie what happened to you?\u201d Scrappy came down to explain. \u201cMaybe it was Dracula and his monsters? They meant to turn her into a werewolf, but they did something wrong.\u201d Then, Fred, Daphne and Velma got a nervous feeling, they recently got a little rough around Scrappy. Shaggy and Scooby took him in and they were dealing with him just fine. Let\u2019s just hope they do the same too, anyways, they understand and Fred prepared some traps for the military and monsters, while Daphne and Velma did some research on how to get Googie back to normal.</span></div></div>",
