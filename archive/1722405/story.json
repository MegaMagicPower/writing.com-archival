When they held it up to the sunlight streaming through the open windows, they saw it sparkle and shoot off every color.  Around the edges were strange symbols, and at the center was a large swirling design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Melissa admired the pendant, James plucked the small notecard that had been included in the packaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this pendant brings you joy and peace.  Use it well.  Directions on flipside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames flipped it over, and read about how the pendant worked.  When he started to explain it to Melissa, she wanted to test it right away.  The happy couple was supposed to depart for their honeymoon in three hours, and Melissa wanted to take the trip as each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames eyed the silky gown, and suddenly pictured how beautiful Melissa had looked last night.  Didn't she deserve to see her own beauty?  Placing the pendant around his neck, James held the dress up to his body.  As heat started to pulse through his body, James gasped.  He felt his skin stretching and his muscles contorting themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the warmth went away, and James looked down at himself.  He could see Melissa's breasts pushing out his t-shirt, and looked over to see Melissa's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it actually worked!\" Melissa cried.  She then began to dress him.  James was surprised when Melissa didn't hand him a bra, but she explained that the dress looked and fit better without it, and how there were cups built in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, James looked at himself in the mirror.  Melissa admired the dress, and the way her twin looked in it.  She picked up the shirt that James had cast off, and grabbed the medallion off the bathroom counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked back in, James was fondling himself, and Melissa smiled.  \"I never knew how good this felt,\" James exclaimed, pushing his breasts up as if to show her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was changed into her husband, Melissa looked at the clock in dismay.  They only had thirty minutes before their cab came, and neither of them were dressed.  The sight of James made her testosterone rage, and she felt her cock grow hard.  Shifting uncomfortably, James noticed and laughed at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd really like to take care of that, but we just don't have time. Before we switch back tomorrow, we'll try a little something.\"</span></div></div>",

Is there anyway that we could get it at a destination?\" James queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes softening, the guard promised that he would try his best, and asked for their itinerary.  After looking through, he promised that it would be waiting for them on the ship at their second destination, Martinique.  Once they were assured they would get their necklace safely, Melissa and James raced to their terminal just as the gate was closing.  James ran awkwardly, his breasts hurting as they jiggled up and down.  \"How do you do this without a sports bra?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't.\"  When they stepped onto the plane, they found that they had been upgraded to first class by a relative as a wedding gift.</span></div></div>",

James settled his head onto Melissa's shoulder, drifting off to sleep in no time.  Melissa tried to relax, but the events of the day kept running around in circles in her mind.  Trying not to disturb James, Melissa quietly pulled out James' iPad and began to play around on it.  Around thirty minutes later, James woke up, and as he looked around during his stretch, he noticed that nearly all the first class was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had a hard-on, and James couldn't help but notice.  Smiling, he decided to do something about it.  \"I've always wanted to be a part of the mile-high club, haven't you?\"  Melissa's eyes grew wide as she realized what James was suggesting, but her cock was throbbing so much that she couldn't ignore it anymore.  How did guys do this? \"Sure sweetie,\" Melissa agreed.  \"I never thought I'd be doing it as a guy though.  What's it like?\"  \"I'll show you,\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to see if the coast was clear, James slipped into the bathroom, motioning for Melissa to follow in a minute. She was excited to have sex for the first time as a guy, but she was worried that James wouldn't orgasm.  She never came quickly when she was herself, and she knew they had to be quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa hoisted James up on the counter, and seeing James grimace, she realized she had squeezed his waist too hard.  She was so strong! \"James, I want you to come with me, so this might take a little longer, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure the door was locked, Melissa slid James' skirt and panties down, and began to kiss him.  She was surprised by the way her body acted, because she wasn't lesbian.  James really got into the kiss, almost forgetting that he was a girl until Melissa began to squeeze his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so sensitive! His nipples were growing hard, and Melissa began to rub them, trying hard to ignore her persistent cock, eager to get in on the action.  James felt himself getting wet, and pulled Melissa to him, sliding her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa gasped.  It felt so good, and James' eyes were closed. She hoped that he was close to coming, because she couldn't hold off any longer.  Melissa came right into James...or herself, panting from the exertion.  That had been amazing, Melissa thought.  No wonder James wants to do it all the time. When she had caught her breath, Melissa looked at James and could tell from the disappointed look on his face that he hadn't orgasmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so close, I think.  I could feel something building up, but then I lost it.  Tonight?\" James pleaded, his eyes begging.  Melissa agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A bus was waiting from the cruise line, and the happy couple was whisked away to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, they were all settled in when James started unpacking his, or actually Melissa's suitcase.  At the top, he saw some incredibly sexy lingerie that he had never seen before.  Deciding to surprise Melissa when she got back from getting checked in, James pulled out a corset, but when he saw all the hooks, he was overwhelmed and decided to go for a tight white bustier with no straps or hooks, and matching white panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was dressed, James felt incredibly sexy.  How can I feel like this? What am I doing? I shouldn't want to have sex with a guy, even if it's really Melissa, James thought.  Why did he feel like he needed Melissa and all that came with her, her hard abs - NO! His hard abs, his pecs, his lips, his cock.  James was incredibly confused as he admired his wife's body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had generous breasts, long blonde hair that he had to keep flicking out of his face, and sparkling blue eyes.  The white fabric made him - her, seem tanner than usual, and James thought of how many times he had told Melissa she was beautiful.  Did he tell her enough.

We wouldn't have any fun now.\"  Sighing, Kate shared that she had always wanted to take the kids to Disney, but had never had the money too.  Now, she added, brightening up, she had just gotten a raise at work.  Also, while the office was moving, she had three weeks off to go wherever she wanted for vacation that summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already bought the tickets, so we're going.  I'm sure you'll have fun on the roller coasters, and I won't make you go on the Dumbo ride,\" Mom promised.  As she finished, the doorbell to the house rang.  At the door was a delivery man, who simply handed her a package, adding a warning of \"Have fun\" as he hopped back into his truck.  Kate opened the package, lifting out an intricately carved silver charm hanging off a necklace.  Puzzled, she turned the box over to see if there was a note.  While there wasn't a note, there was a small card, printed with instructions for the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your life is changing.  Inside this package is a silver charm.  This charm has magical properties that allow people to transform their bodies by touching pieces of clothing to their bodies.  Simply wearing the amulet and holding a piece of clothing will change the person's entire body into whoever wore the clothing last.  Touching the charm and a piece of clothing to a corresponding body part will transform only that matching body part that the clothing goes with.  Each user gets one use every 24 hours.

Probing into the Disney trip, she mused out loud, wondering whether the kids would have had a better time as little kids.  Hearing this, Laura responded, \"Off course we would have liked it when we were little.  But we're sixteen and seventeen now, not six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate had an idea, but didn't share it out loud this time.  Pretending her phone was ringing, she went up to her room to test out the amulet before bringing up her idea with the kids.  As she searched through her closet, Kate came across a bikini that she hadn't worn since she was 25, just before she had her kids.  Kate looked in the mirror and sighed, her 43 year old face lined and wearied.  Placing the charm over her neck, Kate stripped down, wanting to see the changes.  As she picked up the bikini to put it on, she began to tingle.  She grew warm all over, and felt her body squeezing and contracting.  Fascinated, she watched as her wrinkles disappeared, her sagging breasts perked up again, and her stomach grew slimmer, among other changes.  Just a minute later, all of her changes were complete.  In just sixty seconds, Kate had lost eighteen years.  She felt healthy and strong, and confident that her plan would work, she began to rummage through the hall closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is she looking for?</span></div></div>",

At first, the two didn't look up when their mom entered the room, but when they noticed her bikini, they were shocked.  \"Mom!\" Laura exclaimed.  \"You look like twenty years younger! What HAPPENED?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Mom, you were hot when you were younger,\" Rob sheepishly commented.  Mom started to explain the charm, and the kids had to believe her in light of her recent transformation.  When she brought up her idea of turning them into their younger selves, Laura immediately agreed but Rob hesitated, until he saw how happy it would make his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura decided that she wanted to go back to when she was five, and Rob decided to be six, keeping the same age differential as they'd always had, about a year.  Examining the clothes she had brought down, Mom recalled that those clothes happened to be last worn when those two were exactly those ages.  Happy she didn't have to go back upstairs, Kate placed the amulet around Lauren's neck and handed her the sundress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating for a second, Laura decided to go for it, and grabbed the dress from her mom.  Upon contact, Laura began transforming.  Her clothes grew baggy and then began to fold in completely as she shrunk.  Laura stared in wonder at her changing arms as she regressed, until suddenly she stopped.  Her jeans had completely fallen off and dropped to the floor, and her bra was now sliding down her legs as her t-shirt flopped about.  \"I feel so little!\" Laura exclaimed, as her mom began to untangle her old clothes and dress her.  When Laura was all dressed, she admired herself, continually exclaiming how adorable she looked and felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate picks up a piece of Rob's old clothing, and Rob...</span></div></div>",

Dolls were scattered about the floor in various modes of dress, and she clutched one in her hand.  Robbie was banging two trucks together while dressed in his Batman costume, making sound effects.  She couldn't believe that her sixteen year old daughter, who yesterday had been obsessing over a new pair of shoes she got, was now happily playing dolls, and that her seventeen year old son, who had been only concerned with girls yesterday, was currently smashing trucks together while making crashing noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys having fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom,\" came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how much fun I'm having with this,\" Laura said, gesturing to the scattered toys.  \"I didn't want to play with them at first, but then I really wanted to dress them up.

When they were finally in bed, passed out cold, Kate packed her bag, and then went to bed as well.</span></div></div>",

In seconds, memories of yesterday came flooding back.  That beeping was really starting to get on her nerves.  When she got to her dresser where her alarm was, she realized she couldn't reach it.  Frustrated, she walked around to the back and tugged hard at the outlet, unplugging the pesky alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sprinted to her mom's room to wake her up, pouncing on her bed when she got there.  Kate simply smiled at Laura, and got dressed.  When everyone was ready to go, they went out to the car to drive to the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Robbie struggled with their boredom for a few minutes, when finally they fell asleep and Kate was able to read her book.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Please use proper grammar, spelling, etc.  I will make edits, but mostly just grammatical corrections or fixing inconsistent stories or facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a person that finds a necklace that had magical properties.  Are you:<br>\r\n1) A newly married couple<br>\r\n2) A single mom with teen kids<br>\r\n3) Single woman<br>\r\n4) Single male<br>\r\n5) College kid<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules of the charm:<br>\r\nOnce the charm had been used, the changes are permanent for a whole day, or 24 hours.  The way the charm works is that when you touch a piece of clothing while wearing the charm, you become the last wearer of the clothes (those who wore the clothes to swap do not count, since they immediately became the last wearer as well).  If you touch the charm and the piece of clothing to a certain body part, only that part transforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the character doesn't know, but the writer does: If a character remains in a body for over a week, they start to adapt to that body.  Say a thirty year old man becomes a 14 year old girl.  After a period of over seven days, he would start to think more like a 14 year old girl than a thirty year old man.  You keep your memories, but you have emotions and feelings, as well as desires and needs, that the body you are in would naturally have.  However, if you change back, you will regain everything in the same amount of time you were in the other body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf someone becomes pregnant while in a body, that body must be continually occupied to carry the baby to term.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are in the body, the body ages as normal.  If you stayed in a 20 year old body for a year, then at the end of the year, you would be 21.</td>",
