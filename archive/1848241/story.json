By now, the twenty-three year old was used to these very early awakenings, since she needed all the time she could get if she wanted to have every task she was given complete before the end of each day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHauling herself up into a sitting position, the rough covers dropped to reveal a slightly too-thin frame, but one that still supported a pair of hefty breasts (easily in the FF-range), shoulder-length strawberry-blond hair on an oval face with petite nose and well-formed lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bedroom since the age of fourteen had been this one, a small attic room set in the single tower of the chateau that was the Tremaine household.  Sparsely furnished with a small wardrobe, two desks, a chest and her bed, whose covers and pillows she\u2019d made herself out of whatever she\u2019d been able to scavenge and repurpose from the throwaways of her stepsisters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up properly now disturbed the sleep of the other inhabitants of the room, three small lizards she kept with her for companionship, by the names of Donald, Mickey, and Daisy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d  She asked them, knowing they couldn\u2019t voice an answer to her, though the way they turned to look at her and softly hissed told her that they understood what she said.  \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but you know what they\u2018re like.\u201d  Referring to her \u2018family\u2019.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I do think we have time enough for a little story.\u201d  She addressed the others now in site as she slipped on her simple maid\u2019s outfit.  Four small mice and a pair of bluebirds.  \u201cWhich one should it be though?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squeaks from the mice were almost unintelligible, but she got the jist of what they were saying, having spoken to them before.  \u201cThat one then?\u201d  A series of nods confirmed her suspicions as she took a seat.  \u201cVery well then.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they took their places, she began her story:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was ten years ago, the day my father died.  And the day that my Stepmother made her true colours known.  Cold.  Bitter.  Visibly jealous of me.  And grimly determined to advance her own daughters at all cost.  Something she hid from my father very well, he never noticed, not even once.\u201d  She paused to let them take it in, even though she had told them this story before.  \u201cAll the servants in the house were fired, their tasks falling to me.  My old bedroom they now use as their Music Room as I was sent here within a year of his Death.  I\u2019ve had no good clothes in years, just whatever I can make out of whatever\u2018s thrown away.  Then five years ago, after cleaning out the fireplaces, they came up with the name of Cinderella to call me by.\u201d  Ella Tremaine finished off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did look dejected as she recited this part of the tale.  \u201cOh, no need to look down, if nothing else it did allow me to meet you all, and for that reason I keep on going.\u201d  She rose up and made for the door.  \u201cNow I really must start with the chores, otherwise it will be after nightfall before I am finished.\u201d  </div></span></div></div>",

Twenty-three years of age, with hair that drifted between golden-blond and soft brown, dressed in a luxurious blue silk dress with crystal tiara and glass slippers.  Her name, Cinderella.  Returning home after a truly wonderful night at the ball at the King's Palace, but home was where she needed to return to.  And with good reason.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Dream to be able to get away from her torturous existence - where she had been reduced to a Servant inside of her own home, since her Father had tragically perished 16 years before, forced to live in the cold attic, with only the barest of rags to wear, always at the beck and call of her Stepmother and her Stepsisters - had been exactly that.  A dream.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was under no illusion.  The Carriage was a Pumpkin.  The horses, mice that she'd secured from a trap.  The Footman, a lizard that she had managed to secretly keep as a pet.  The Coachman, Major, the Horse kept in the Stables.  Her dress, made out of possibly nothing since they had torn her dress off of her, piece by piece, leaving her with nothing to wear.  All made possible by a Fairy Godmother who had taken pity on her, and allowed her a chance to spend the night at the Ball.  And only the night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the night ended and dawn broke, the spell would fade, like the dream.  As such, she had been forced to slip out without anyone noticing her absence, the lack of anyone chasing them suggesting that either she had succeeded or they weren't bothering, yet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window, she could see that the sky wasn't quite as dark as before, and the interior didn't feel quite as fine and soft as it had been.  Turning to see the Footman - the lizard she'd named Donald - she could see him giving her a toothy smile and nod of appreciation, with a face that had started to crack and sharper teeth.  The Magic was fading.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she faced a choice.  They could leave the road and try to go through the forest on a more Direct Route to get back sooner, and avoid being seen as everything return to as it had been before.  Or the carriage could be abandoned and they'd head back on foot through the forest.  But since this part of the road would be clear, with no other houses in view, it could well be safer sticking to it and going faster.  In any case though, she didn't believe that she should stay inside the carriage in the event it reverted to a pumpkin early.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why she'd already slipped out of the carriage, letting Donald see her do so, to be at the front.  Sliding carefully onto Major's lap, who gave her a wider smile with a face that had pushed out ever so slightly as he shifted himself a little bit to make her more comfortable.  Her legs over to the left side, she looked forwards and up to see a sky that was less black as she made her decision on the course of action to take.  </div></span></div></div>",

That way, we should be able to reach the house sooner.\" Cinderella suggested, eyes aimed ahead, towards the upcoming turn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in approval, Major flicked the reins to speed them up a bit, one of the horses having sprouted mouse\u2019s ears, another sign that time was against them.  The resultant left turn towards the wood\u2019s natural path allowed Cinderella one last look at the city before the treetops blocked out not only that, but the moonlight, the lightening sky as well, the small lamp on the left of the carriage their sole light source.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt, was\u2026nicce\u201d  Perhaps the darkness, combined with the great many hours she had been awake for, was the reason for the slowed, slightly sluured speech as Cinderella leaned into her transforming coachman.  \u201cA nice\u2026nnight.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething Major was about to agree with when his longer, fur coated face began to turn beetroot.  Looking at her, he could see her dress shrinking down her breasts, first one, then the other nipple peeking out, hardening against the cool breeze.  Already, he could feel his penis becoming uncomfortably erect in his tightening trousers at the sight, something he hoped his beautiful mistress didn\u2019t notice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as he slowly shifted himself - to open his legs a bit - he did notice something else a quick look confirming that his shoes and socks had fallen off.  That his feet were once more hard black hooves however, was what had startled Major.  The magic was clearly fading away, not only that, it seemed to be speeding up when he risked a look behind to see that the golden carriage was now green and orange, the bald scaled head of the reptilian footman peeking over the top.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he wanted to warn his mistress about this, one look confirmed to him that she had since fallen asleep in his arms, dress still shrinking down her slim frame.  So rather than awaken her, Major decided he could let her get her much-needed sleep while they could still use the carriage to continue the journey home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next twenty minutes or so proved to be rather\u2026uncomfortable\u2026to say the least as far as Major was concerned, his growing frame digging painfully into his clothes.  Furthermore, since before they had even first arrived at the Palace he had been holding something in, his own need to relieve himself, and now his bladder, and his bowels had become rather painfully full.  And as much as he wanted to just let it all out, he knew he couldn\u2019t do that while they were moving, especially while his mistress was sitting on his lap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally some relief came, a tear coming from his back, and the feeling of his breathing becoming easier.  His shirt had been ripped open by his widening form, the scraps of material sliding down, revealing his thick, chiselled, dappled grey fur-coated chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after this, his legs were freed when his trousers were torn down the seam, flopping away to show off his trunk-like legs, his re-grown tail that could now swish freely beneath his tailcoat, and his swollen horse cock that brushed against Cinderella\u2019s legs each time the carriage bounced.  That she was still asleep at this time was the only reason the now completely horse-faced Major could discern for her not noticing his meaty shaft slapping her, even if he had more serious concerns right now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the carriage more pumpkin than carriage, it had become dangerously unstable, each dip and bump making the organic contraption swing around, forcing him to fight to keep any measure of control, only the fact that one of the horses pulling it had since reverted to a mouse again, scurrying away (correction, two now) meant it was now slow enough to hold it together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother risked look behind confirmed to Major that Mr Lizard was in little better shape.  Now a man-sized Lizardman, thick tail swinging behind him to help balance him atop the gyrating pumpkin, his own green-and-gold-patterned tailcoat the only thing he was wearing now, his scaled cock and balls hard and pointed up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mistress herself had since lost her own beautiful dress, glass slippers now just humble slip-on work shoes.  Still blissfully unaware of the growing danger as she continued to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had become very difficult for Major to hold it all in on the other hand, as his grey-blue tailcoat tore apart, his back and thick arms exposed to the elements now.  The constant bouncing and swinging of the carriage, his massive shaft slapping against his and his mistress\u2019s legs (sending pulsating tingling pleasure through it) combined with his ever growing need to release his bodily waste all came together to attempt to cripple his inhibitions, sheer force of will all that held it in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow clad solely in his tight white drivers gloves and three-point hat, Major sank down as the seat began to collapse thanks to both his greater weight and its own reversion.  It was just as he tried to steady himself, to shift his mistress who now was pressed into him that\u2026</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">For this alternate setting for the Cinderella story, there is more than one sentient species residing in this world of Magic, of Fantasy.  A mix of lizard and human, they are known officially as Gekkota D and P (a reference to the two groups whose main difference is how they stand, D for Digitigrade and P for Planitgrade) and more derogatively as Lizards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally 150-165 cm, the Gekkota D legs have very short shins with elongated feet that stand behind the main body, counterbalanced by the long flexible tails they have.  Long jaws, sharp teeth, and clawed hands and feet of a predatory species, though they are generally a caring group with a strong concept of family.  Usually a dark to medium green for their scales, with a paler green-white underbelly, and slitted eyes that can have their irises rounded for improved night visibility.  Intellect is generally lower than an equivalent human, their IQ ranging from 70-80% that of a human\u2019s in most cases, though this is enough for them to learn what they need to get by.  They are also more vulnerable to temperature extremes, and need to use their environment to aid in temperature regulation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGekkota P are physically built a little more like humans in the superficial sense, in that the leg design is identical, save for the slightly wider waist to allow for their tails (which are generally slightly shorter and thinner than their Type-D counterparts), and ranging from 160-180 cm in height.  Their scale colour usually ranges from blue-green to teal-green for the main body, with amber-yellow to green-yellow on their undersides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn both cases, they are not an egg-laying species, giving birth to live young with said young having a dependency on their parents for the first few years of their lives.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually habituating the more Southern regions of this world, many travelled further North for work, or rather, they were travelled North to have their, \u2018services\u2019, put to use by the populace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOften seen working the low-end jobs that others don\u2019t want, or as low-level servants within households, and for little more than some food and a roof.  It is not unusual to see even a lower-income household have at least one Gekkota residing to perform the menial tasks that leaves both parents free to work for money.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWealthier households will oft-have several Gekkota in their service, with only the Topmost Elite employing paid human servants, a means of displaying their wealth and power by being able to afford such help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time, this enabled a burst of growth in the wealth and prosperity of the Northern Kingdoms, for a time, it was good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the good times were not to last.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Economies built on slavery of a race faltered as the influx of cheap labour stifled growth, and discontent set in.  Wealth went into decline, and the enslaved race began to push for recognition.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came slowly, tentatively, but bit by bit, they began to attain a few rights.  Little more than to make what they already had a requirement, and enough loopholes to keep the pay down to an absolute minimum, but it came nonetheless.  Enough to quell the unrest and allow a small recovery to begin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came the invention of Steam.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it, carriages could carry far more than before, delivering goods and people across greater distances.  Ships that once needed sails and the wind could now power their own way across the seas and oceans.  On special rails, carriages could takes hundreds of tons, hundreds of people from one end to the other.  Roads smooth enough for use complementing this, some of sufficient money or rank able to own personal transport.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still - with a handful of exceptions - the Gekkota were Second-Class Citizens in the Human-Ruled Lands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how does Cinderella fit into this story now?  She could be human, living in this world with her own beliefs and sense of right-and-wrong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she might be Gekkota?  Which opens up a whole can of possibilities to be explored.  </div></span></div></div>",

When she asked, her adoptive father, Albert Tremaine would only answer that he and his wife found her mother dying with her in her arms, begging them to see her safe with the last minute of life she had left in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough illness from which she never fully recovered from, Catherine Tremaine could no longer bare any children of her own. Childless, they decided to take her in as their own, naming her Eleanor (Ella for short) after his Aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tremaine Household had been merchants for generations, but Albert had seen the opportunity afforded by the High-Pressure Steam Engine, its applicability for the transportation of goods and people, creating a number of Road-Going Steam Locomotives powered by a compact engine of his own design. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo such designs had proven to be particularly successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tremaine Steam Carriage. A three-wheel carriage suitable for four passengers, one driver, and one boiler man. Tall yet stable, its four horsepower engine and condenser making it well-suited for the well-off to travel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was known as the Tremaine Steam Coach. Significantly larger and with a twenty-six horsepower engine plus condenser to haul not only the four-wheeled coach along, but up to three tons towed behind it. This permitting its use for goods haulage where rail was impractical, or many passengers in a separate coach behind it. And thanks to its own passenger compartment, ahead of the boiler and behind the driver, could and did see use as personal transport for the wealthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of each Albert had to his own name, residing within his chateau a good couple of miles (twenty-five) from the nearby city where the country\u2019s monarch ruled. The outskirts of which held the factory where his Carriages and Coaches were constructed under his watchful eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the chateau that Ella spent her early years, tutors hired to teach her as best as they were able, her own willingness to learn perhaps the greatest aid they had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tragedy was to strike. Aged seven, Ella witnessed the first sign of cruelty in the World, when her adoptive mother\u2019s illness eventually took its toll on her. Before her death, she was able to speak with Ella:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen closely, dear Ella.  The World outside might well become a harsh, and cruel place for you to live, but I know you will rise above it all.  For you have shown to everyone, the kindness, the compassion you have within yourself.  You have, more kindness in just one finger, than many will have in their whole bodies.\u201d Catherine was able to speak, barely above a whisper. \u201cHave Courage little Ella, and be Kind. For where there is Kindness, there is Goodness. And where there is Goodness, there is Magic.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla took this lesson to Heart, always remembering her adoptive mother\u2019s last words to her. Sometimes outside to help with feeding the animals they kept, and never one with a bad word to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert though, was rather more affected by her passing, using his work as a means to distract himself from his grief for a while. So even as he improved his designs and made better coaches and carriages, the time he spent with Ella became less. Something that did not go unnoticed, and he was made to confront. Slowly, he began to restore his work/life balance, and though he continued to care deeply for his adopted daughter, did come to feel that she still needed a mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that shortly after she turned nine, that Albert finally remarried, choosing for his second wife, one who was recently widowed herself, with two daughters of her own of eleven and thirteen years. She too, had known grief. But she carried her grief in a manner unlike that of Ella and Albert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTragedy, however, was fated to strike Ella again, and this time the effects would strike her directly.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">It was a night Eleanor Tremaine would remember, for every remaining day that she lived.  It had begun months back, the odd cough and wheeze from Albert, initially dismissed as just a bout of illness that would pass, it instead grew worse.  His appetite became less, his weight fell until he became very gaunt, and his energy seemed to be sapped away from him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Ella enter her adoptive father\u2019s bedroom to wake him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later following his funeral, things began to change in the Chateau.  Ella found herself being given tasks to perform for the step-family that the late Albert had brought into the household.  They were small, at first, delivering tea and snacks, feeding the animals, some dusting work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt changed as the years passed.  At thirteen, she noticed that the staffing levels had become less, her own workload increasing to plug the gap.  Also not escaping her attention was the fact that the tutors who had been there to teach her were no longer around, the chateau feeling emptier without so many people around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she asked this of her step-mother, her answer had been that without a solid income, she had been forced to economise, to make the money they did have last long enough to allow a future.  Of course, what she meant was that she was trying to make it hold out until she could marry off at one of her own daughters into wealth to secure their futures, and thus her own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the age of sixteen, when she entered adulthood, Ella had spent the past year living in the attic room, Anastasia having been moved into her old room on the grounds that they were grown women and now needed their own space.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had also been during these few years that Ella had noticed something occurring with her body.  As her species birthed live young, and reared them, breasts were something they developed, usually a relatively small pair as so not to hinder their mobility, but by seventeen she was already sporting a very large pair, pushing out almost the depth of her chest with an areola matching her main scales.  Very easy to spot too as for the past few years she had been forced to cut and re-sew her old clothes to provide her with some form of decency.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she lost her father, she had a range of dresses to wear, and good footwear.  Neither had been replaced over the years by Lady Tremaine (as she insisted on Ella addressing her as) forcing her first to go barefoot as she outgrew her shoes, and then try to provide cover for her enlarging breasts as they became more and more pronounced.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy nineteen they had fallen into too poor a state of disrepair to serve their role anymore, and she now worked in the Tremaine Household, a naked Gekkota \u2018Lizard\u2019 Servant.  Only given sufficient food to make sure she could do her work and nothing else.  It was at the age of nineteen that she realised what they had reduced her to, barred from even leaving the Chateau grounds, at the beck-and-call of her increasingly vain and selfish step-sisters who continued to have luxuries squandered on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only ones she could relate to were four small mice who had retreated to the Attic to keep from the cat Lady Tremaine had brought with her, and replaced, and two small mundane lizards that had managed to work their way into the small room.  Their names, Jacqueline, Octavius, Matilda, Teddy for the mice.  Donald and Mickey were the names she gave to the lizards.  With them, she found solace, those she could talk to and let out her frustrations, lightening the load on her soul enough that she could make it through the long hard days.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at the age of twenty, having endured nine years of this increasingly degrading treatment Ella found herself inside the fireplace of the dining room, the long brush reaching up to pull away at the soot and cinders that had built up there over time, much of it landing either next to or on her bare body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough witnessing this, Anastasia and Drizella began experimenting with names to call her by.  From Lizard-Wench, they moved to Dirty-Ella, Lizard-Dirt, before they arrived at \u2018Cinderella\u2019.  With the approval of their mother, the name they had settled on became the name they used to brand her.  Cinderella.  </div></span></div></div>",

Not only was he coated in light-grey fur, he was also possessing quite and athletic build, good thick muscles that spoke of endurance and next to no body fat.  While his feet were clearly longer than a human\u2019s, and he moved around on the balls of his feet and not the ankles, they also weren\u2019t long enough to be digitigrades, sitting half-way between the two stances.  Short black claws ended his fingers and toes, and were sharp as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all he had to hide this was a silk dressing gown (soft black with red outlines) that he had tied shut around his torso, a pair of reading glasses that lacked the ear supports, instead using a large nose grip to support them, a cap to cover his pointed ears with, and a pair of slippers that he couldn\u2019t fit his longer feet into properly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018No matter.  It only has to last long enough to get the job done.\u2019  He consoled himself, his back to the window so that the chair itself could hide him had the curtains been open.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more thing he needed to keep out of site was his lupine cock, currently shielded by the silk dressing gown, but could be spotted if he wasn\u2019t careful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long later, and he heard a rapping at the door, it could only be one person, the 22-year old Riding Hood that he\u2019d met once or twice before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on in Dear, the door is open.\u201d  He called out in the most feminine voice that he could manage.  \u2018Just a few moments more now.\u2019  He added to himself with a quiet chuckle.  </div></span></div></div>",

It was making him hot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome closer dear.\u201d  He continued with his ruse, knowing how much she enjoyed it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, what big hands, you have.\u201d  She exclaimed softly, seeing their powerful grip and sharp claws.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe better for me, to hold you with.\u201d  The Wolf replied as he began to laugh, the act causing the cap to slip and show one of his ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, what big ears, you have.\u201d  Red directed his attention to them, starting to feel kinda naughty now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe better for me, to hear you with.\u201d  He aided in maintaining their game as he pulled it off, the glasses knocked away by this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, what big eyes, you have.\u201d  Her speech was slowing down, as one hand worked its way under her skirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe better for me, to see you with.\u201d  The sight of Red was so alluring to him, he could now feel the blood pumping into his member, which began to thicken and swell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, what big arms, you have.\u201d  She had come closer, and tugged at the silk dressing gown, his right shoulder and part of the arm in the open now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe, better for, me, to, hold you with.\u201d  His reply was faltering this time, as one hand played with the top of her dress, more and more of the breast peeking out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, wh-what, big, legs, y-you have.\u201d  She\u2019d moved down to the legs, kneeling as she pulled the dressing gown to the sides, running her hands gently down one of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe, better, for, for me, to, to, stand with.\u201d  He moaned out, his penis now very erect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour feet, how big they are.\u201d  Red\u2019s wording was off now as she de-slippered the wolf and put one of them to her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo walk with.\u201d  The wolf too, was getting his words wrong, as the belt around his waist was prised loose before he stood, picking her up as he did so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding now, he was quick to pull open Red\u2019s dress, bringing it down to her waist where she pushed it the rest of the way down before stepping out of it, leaving only her red cape and shoes to cover her.

I promise to you that WILL contribute more to yours and others stories that I've been a part of in the future.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flock of blue jays nesting in the nearby trees fled from their homes as Rapunzel burped in glee.  She removed her yellow shoes, allowing her to feel the grass crunch under her feet as she ran around. The sun shined much more intensely outside, Rapunzel being able to see it at its peak for the first time ever. Another new sight was the backside of the white-stoned tower. Viewing it from a distance, she could see that it had a cylinder shape. The foundation was a firm red brick circle resting on hard dirt. Her room was 30 feet up, judging from the placement of the window. There didn\u2019t seem to be any other means of getting inside. No door or other window of any kind.  No wonder it was so difficult to ascend to the top.  The diameter was estimated to have reached 15 feet across. Its scarlet-tiled roof capped off the top like a hat, bringing the total height of the tower up to 45 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing!\u201d She screamed, cocooning herself in her elongated hair as she rolled on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel smiled softly at her new friend\u2019s elated state. It must\u2019ve been horrible having to endure being essentially trapped in your own home for who knows how long. She watched as the blonde skipped and laughed and burped without a care in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. It\u2019s so cute!\u201d Rapunzel gushed, spotting a duck swimming in a pond just at the edge of the clearing where the tower resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel scooped it up her hands, water dripping between her fingers, and brought the bird to her face. Watching it flap its wings, sprinkling drops of water on her face, the young woman\u2019s green irises lit up ever more. She petted it on its head with her right index finger, dislodging some ivory feathers that were scattered by the summer breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHazel, look what I found!\u201d She turned to her new friend, showing off the duckling. \u201cI wonder what it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The brunette asked in momentarily confusion. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a duck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Rapunzel shifted her focus to the avian again for a bit before returning to Hazel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but no.\u201d She revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel\u2019s eyes widened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. You really haven\u2019t been outside before.\u201d Hazel muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel frowned sullenly, pointing her gaze at the wet ground. Just how much did she not know about the rest of the world? Hazel realized the unintentional pain that her choice of words carried and stood there in silence, an awkward aura filling the air between them. Then, the brown-haired lady walked up to the recently freed woman and gave her warm, comforting embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not to blame for this.\u201d Hazel assured. \u201cYou just need someone to help you learn about the world around you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel\u2019s lips curled up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Hazel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was such a tender, wholesome moment. This was the kind of moment that only friends like these could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>*GGGRRRRROWWWL!*</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And it was promptly ruined by a loud grumbling from Punzie\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel back away quickly from her, wondering if the noise really did come from the feminine blonde. Rapunzel blushed and cradled the duck in her left arm, using her right one to rub her inverted abdominal area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops. Guess I haven\u2019t eaten much in a while.\u201d She apologized meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d The cream-clad woman replied. \u201cI know a place where you can eat some decent food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Where <u><i><b>IIIIISSSSSS</b></i></u> it?!\u201d Rapunzel belched in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tavern on the other side of the woods.\u201d She explained, extending her left index finger to the north. \u201cWe can ride there on my horse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a horse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel took a deep breath. Explaining the world to her was going to take awhile. Then, she whistled to her equine companion hiding behind the trees. It trotted to its human equal, the odd-toed ungulate\u2019s lengthy silver mane flowing in the wind. The quadruped halted a few from Hazel, Rapunzel shielding the duck in fear of this foreign creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a horse.\u201d Hazel smirked proudly, petting its forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve been raising her for 10 years. Come touch her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel treaded slowly towards this unknown animal, stretching out her right head to make contact with the beast\u2019s white muzzle. It felt moist, like she had just finished drinking from a nearby body of water. Moving up, Punzie noticed the texture shifting to a smoother one. The horse locked eyes with Rapunzel, and she returned the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer name is Gin. She\u2019s a mare, a female horse.\u201d Hazel explained. \u201cShe\u2019s very docile, so you don\u2019t have to be scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel leaned her head forward, touching the horse\u2019s, and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s so soft.\u201d The blonde commented. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Gin is docile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you.\u201d Hazel responded. \u201cNow let\u2019s get some lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette mounted her ebony steed and helped Rapunzel up. Then, with a slap on the flank, Gin galloped away. Clutching the duck (which she now dubbed Solomon) in her left hand and clinging to the horse rider with the other, the blond maiden took another look at the tower that she had spent the better part of her life dwelling in. Hopefully, she\u2019d never come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Hazel?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d The brunette replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a tavern?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took 120 minutes, but the foursome finally arrived at their destination. It was a modestly-sized building with a rectangular shape. The roof was lined with green tiles and a crimson brick spouted out of the right end. The walls were a dark-brown wood and the door was a shade of violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the place?\u201d Rapunzel questioned, getting off of Gin. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look the way that you described.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Hazel replied, pulling Rapunzel and Solomon into the tavern. \u201cThe inside is much livelier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, the tavern\u2019s interior was far more energetic than the exterior would suggest. Patrons slammed chairs at each other, splashed frothy beer down their backs, and slept on hey-covered floor. The aroma that filled the room reeked of shit from the horse, bull, dog, and pig variety. That didn\u2019t bother the two women through. Their burps were much more grotesque. Regardless, Rapunzel found the sharp contrast jarring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that the food here is good?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. You probably don\u2019t have money, so I\u2019ll pay for whatever you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a seat at the bar, Rapunzel trying to calm down her new bird friend who was squawking in response to all of the chaos surrounding them. A bartender showed up and they made their request. Hazel wasn\u2019t particularly peckish, so she simply ordered a glass of water. Rapunzel on the other hand, had a much more extensive appetite and ordered six pies filled with bread, cheese, beef, pork, fish, and chicken. Each pastry exceeded two feet in diameter. For a beverage, she received a literal barrel of red wine. Hazel stared at the blonde in shock, to which Rapunzel giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I haven\u2019t eaten in a while.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Neither of them were too repulsed by it, Hazel having lived with emitting smells like these her whole life and Rapunzel having quickly developed a tolerance for the odor that was slightly less repugnant than her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can just talk to each other.\u201d The Maiden in the Tower suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Hazel agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visitor and Rapunzel took on seat on Rapunzel\u2019s large bed. It was 30 inches wide and 74 inches long, had a blue fitted sheet and a red cover sheet, and its pillow case was orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you live in this tower?\u201d The brunette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel twiddled her thumbs, shifting her jade orbs from Hazel to the hair-covered wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d She answered, \u201cI\u2019ve been here since I was twelve years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? How?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mother sent me to live here and as for how, she used magic to get me in here.\u201d Rapunzel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic?\u201d Hazel inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Rapunzel confirmed. \u201cMagic is also how my hair is so long and why I can\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a moment, taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i><b>~*DDDDDOOOOO TTTTTTHHHHIIIIIIISSSSSSSS!*~</b></i></u>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful wind knocked Hazel off of the bed. Fortunately, the overabundance of golden follicles surrounding the room meant that her landing wasn\u2019t too rough. Rapunzel blushed and concealed her lips with the red tips of her right index, middle, and ring fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d She offered a rare apology for her gaseous expulsions, \u201cI guess I went too far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel slowly returned to her feet, a bit dazed from taking a point black shot of the blond\u2019s burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d She replied, partially disoriented. \u201cSometimes, I have trouble controlling my farts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel\u2019s frown returned to its usual smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Punzie began. \u201cHow did you get so gassy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Hazel\u2019s lower face reddened in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve always just had it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you got it from your mother too.\u201d Rapunzel theorized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette let out a quiet giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might be.\u201d She grinned. \u201cHow are you so content with belching?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel thought about it a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably because there\u2019s no one around for me to humiliate myself in front of.\u201d The maiden responded. \u201cIt\u2019d likely be different if I spent more time outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Hazel thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go outside?\u201d The new girl mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel\u2019s eyes widened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d She stated, her corneas beginning to moisten. \u201cMy mother put me in her to protect me, saying that the world was full of scary monsters, awful people, and dangerous places!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s awful.\u201d Hazel commented. \u201cI know that the outside is great, and you can too if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel weighed her options. If she left with this woman who she just met, then who knows how her mother might react? However, if she stayed, she might never know what the outside world was like firsthand. Taking a breath to calm her nerves, she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go. We can use my hair as a rope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel gave Rapunzel a strange look. Yeah, her shining locks were said to possess supposedly mystical properties, but being able to descend a 40-foot tower using them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive my doubts, but that sounds preposterous.\u201d Hazel objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does, but if used my hair to help my mother climb the tower before.\u201d Rapunzel explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a hook on the right side of the window where I can it so I don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel turned to the window to see that a large hook in the wall was indeed nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel wrapped her hair to the hook before throwing the rest outside, creating a soft landing spot for them. Then, Hazel gripped it like a pole and slid down. She was going a bit too fast for her liking though, so in a fit of fear she broke wind with enough force to let her float slowly to the ground. Rapunzel saw this and giggled immaturely. But, then she got an idea. Untying her hair, she leaped out of her home and dived into the grass. Hazel clasped her hands over her mouth  in suspense, but then Rapunzel smirked and summoned another powerful eructation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>~*BBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!*~</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFueled by an intense self-preservation instinct, this belch\u2019s power was increased to decrease the speed of her descent and like Hazel, she landed with a grace that was belied by her gassy emission. Without thinking, Hazel brought Punzie into a passionate embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Then she realized what did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I-I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She sputtered, quickly breaking up the hug. \u201cI was just\u2026 just scared for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapuzel paused for a bit, then started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d The blond assured, her green eyes glowing. \u201cEven I wasn\u2019t sure if that would work. All that matters is that I\u2019m safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel let out a sigh of relief.

After dusting herself off, she shook the blond maiden\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a nice burp.\u201d The new woman complimented. \u201cBetter than any other I\u2019ve heard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Rapunzel blushed. \u201cIt\u2019s not often I find someone who respects my talent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, anyone who can\u2019t see something good in what you can do is an idiot.\u201d Amy added, then changed the subject to talk about the elephant in the room. \u201cSo, why are up in this tower anyway? It seems pretty inconvenient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunel took a moment to think about her response. It would definitely sound unusual to someone unfamiliar with her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mother, Dame Gothel, sent me here when I was 12.\u201d She answered. \u201cShe said that it was to protect me from the dangers of the outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s jaw dropped in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense.\u201d The ginger scoffed. \u201cThe world isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s still a great place. Let me show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunzie pondered her possible choices. Her hands shook in fear of the unknown world. She debated if she should accept the word of a woman she just met over the woman who\u2019d raised her all her life. There was a great feeling of doubt, but also of excitement. This woman appeared to have had an adventure or two and she was fine as far as Rapunzel could tell. This \u2018Amy\u2019 also had more experience in the outside world than her, by virtue of not having been stuck in a 40 foot tower for years. Eventually, she made her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d The Maiden in the Tower agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it just because I suggested it.\u201d Amy advised, putting her arms out in front of her. \u201cIf you leave, it should be of your own volition. So, do you really want to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel took a deep breath and responded the way that only she could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i><b>~*YYYEEEESSSSSSSSSSS!*~</b></i></u>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the scarlet-haired tomboy found herself swept off of her feet by one of the host\u2019s beastly belches. Thankfully, She caught herself just in time by grabbing onto a hook near the window. Realizing her error, Rapunzel actually blushed in response to her usually proud burps and went to check on her guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my.\u201d She exclaimed. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly dazed, Amy staggered to walk on her own again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She replied. \u201cBut next time, try not to blast me out your window.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of them shared a quick laugh at Amy\u2019s somewhat dark joke. Then, Rapunzel tied her lengthy locks around the hook and threw the rest down to the wet grass below. Amy gripped the superhumanly strong follicles and fearlessly descended, taking long hops on the tower like future rock climbers will on mountains. After two minutes, she reached the ground safely. Seeing her new friend uninjured, Rapunzel breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to get down?\u201d Amy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d The blonde replied just as loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoosening the hair a bit on the hook, Rapunzel slowly walked onto the windowsill and gazed at the ground. Looking at it from so high up made her disoriented and slightly nauseous. Then, she took a moment to recompose herself before diving off of the edge.  Amy wrapped her hands around her end of the makeshift rope, gradually letting it go to lower Rapunzel to the tower\u2019s base. In about four minutes, Rapunzel\u2019s yellow-clad feet met the soft grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m outside. It\u2019s really happening.\u201d She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunzie paused to take in the outdoors. She removed her shoes and wiggled her toes in the dew covered grass. It was an odd but not unpleasant feeling. Next, a cool summer breeze bushed up on her from behind, making her giggle. The 17 year old shielded her corneas as the Sun\u2019s rays shone on her from its position in the blue noon sky. From a nearby apple tree, tiny birds were heard singing a melodious tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d Amy inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a calm grin, Rapunzel took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i><b>~*GGGRRRRRRREEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTT!*~</b></i></u>\u201d</span></div></div>",

After dusting herself off, she shook the blond maiden\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a nice burp.\u201d The new woman complimented. \u201cBetter than any other I\u2019ve heard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Rapunzel blushed. \u201cIt\u2019s not often I find someone who respects my talent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, anyone who can\u2019t see something good in what you can do is an idiot.\u201d Amy added, then blushed as well. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s kind of\u2026 attractive in a way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the golden-haired girl\u2019s blush intensified. To her, belching was a lot of things; namely loud, smelly, unmannerly, and entertaining. But to say that it was attractive? That was something that she never expected to be an adequate adjective for it. As she looked at the ivory-clad woman who gave the odd compliment, both of their face grew redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Amy finally broke the awkward silence. \u201cI might\u2019ve given you too much praise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel\u2019s mouth morphed from an embarrassed frown into a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, you shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d The golden-hearted girl repeated. \u201cThough, I suppose saying my burps are attractive is a strange statement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I\u2019d better explain.\u201d Amy said, her blush starting to fade. \u201cFirst off, I should say that I have certain \u2018feelings\u2019 towards other women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel\u2019s cheeks were once more tinted crimson at the proclamation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s also another reason that I traveled here.\u201d Amy continued, a cold sweat forming on her thin arms. \u201cWhen I heard rumors of your incredible belching abilities, I genuinely hoped that it was true. Ever since I could remember, people have ostracized me for my masculine behavior and my\u2026 er, preferences toward others of my gender.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can stop trying to imply that you\u2019re homosexual. \u201cRapunzel suggested bluntly. \u201cI can tell that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paused for a bit, momentarily stunned by Punzie\u2019s surprising showing of bluntness. Then, gulping nervously, she resumed her abridged autobiography.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026 Well, the other reason I came here was because I have a certain\u2026 reaction to females belching.\u201d Her blush returned, exceeding the shade of red that her locks had. \u201cWhenever, I hear a girl let out a fierce eructation, my\u2026 southern extremities get excited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she spent a good chunk of her life essentially trapped inside of a tower, even a sheltered maiden like Rapunzel expected what the tomboy was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn\u2019t expect though was said tomboy cranking her head forward and planting a thin-lipped smooch on her lips. The blonde\u2019s eyes widened further than she thought possible, a swarm of conflicting emotions blotting the clarity in her mind. Part of her wanted to shove the girl off for her actions. Who would do something like this after telling a story like that?! Another felt too much sympathy for her to do that. Amy had said she was often the source of ridicule just for being who she was, so maybe this was just an emotional impulse on her part. A third consideration was that this wasn\u2019t all that bad. It was a rather unorthodox way of continuing a story, but not in and of itself detestable. While Punzie was facing mental conflict, Amy was enjoying herself more than ever before! Getting to express all of the sexual desire that society forced her to bottle up for so long was without a doubt exhilarating. But in a way, she also felt a bit guilty. After spouting out her life story to this girl, she decided to take advantage of her unfocused state just to vent off some simmering lust. It was a sensation that each found to be both pleasurable and painful in a certain way. Rapunzel in particular found it to be rather exciting, having not figured that she\u2019d play that proverbial side. One could say that she found it just a tad too exciting, given what was to follow:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i><b>~*BBBBBBEEEEEEELLLLLLCCCCCCCHHHHHHHH!*~</b></i></u>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of their eyes shot open as Rapunzel launched her regurgitated oxygen down Amy throat, expelling so much that the redhead\u2019s cheeks had to puff out just to create ample space. Though muffled, the belch still carried enough power to echo in the room. Amy\u2019s taste buds were bombarded with tastes of garlic, onions, cheese, and pork, all wrapped in a coating of stomach acid, as the eructation reached its end. Afterwards, Rapunzel ceased the locking of lips, leaving a single strand of saliva to connect them. Hot tears cascaded down her face as she clasped her hands over her mouth. For the first time in her life, she was ashamed of her burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she noticed something. Looking down at the grime-encrusted pants of her guest, she could see a large dark stain in the middle of the crotch area. The owner of those pants was still out of it, trapped in a perverted bliss that she\u2019d be unlikely to experience again. Quickly though, she was snapped back to reality by a soft push to the stomach by the tower\u2019s host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,  wuh\u2026 Ugh.\u201d The redhead mumbled. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were telling me about your past before kissing me on the lips.\u201d Punzie recapped with tear-swollen eyes. \u201cThen, I belched long and hard into your mouth and when it ended, I saw you have a big stain on your pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Amy took a quick glance down at her clothes and gasped at the moist area that had drowned her undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my!\u201d She exclaimed. \u201cRapunzel, I am so sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond began to get misty-eyed again before getting a hold of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I should apologize for getting so caught up in it. This probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten like this if I had stopped sooner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the spent the next couple of minutes exchanging apologies and taking the blame for what happened. Eventually, the absurdity of their situation got them to start laughing. And with the laughter came tears from each girl. It was Rapunzel\u2019s tears that were especially important, because as they dripped from her nose, a few drops rained on Amy\u2019s calloused hands. The somewhat painful reminders of her long escalation to the room vanished instantaneously. The giggle fit was cut short as they took a gander at the weird phenomenon that had transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can heal with your tears?\u201d Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know that I could.\u201d Rapunzel replied. \u201cThis has certainly been one eventful start to my day.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Cracks aligned most of the massive bricks as large trails of vines and other greenery were creeping their way up the sturdy surface. Just by the sight alone, it was obvious to tell that the whole place must've been abandoned for quite some time. It was actually quite a oddity, especially considering all the wondrous sights beheld around such a kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange...\" Jack mutters as he soon stood before the massive drawbridge of the castle. Whether it was luck or some different unforeseen force, the massive wooden frame of the bridge was descended firmly upon the grassy ground, giving Jack a clear way into the castle. Undaunted by the sight, Jack quickly scampers his way onto the wooden surface and straight pas the bard gates of the castles entrance. \"Huh...this actually should be easy.\" Jack chortled to himself. With an abandoned castle this size, there was no telling what kind of leftover wealth reside within the vast interiors of such a royal residence. Little did Jack know of the true inhabitant of the vast establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within the dark corridors of the castle in a rather regal room, a black wet nose wiggled up and down as an odd scent managed to creep it's way up it's nostrils. \"Wha?\" the voice of a young woman stammers in a surprised if not shocked tone by the sudden discovery. For years she has been in solitude in this prison she used to call home. But now, in the most unexpected of moments, a visitor has come to her very home. \"I...Is someone finally here?\" she mumbles to herself unsure if her sense of smell was beginning to play tricks on her after several moments of false hope. After giving one more deep inhale, a sudden gasp and flutter of her heart resounded from her form. \"a visitor...\" she stammers in a quivering, overjoyed voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez...I didn't expect this place to be so huge.\" Jack mutters as he soon finds hi way within the main corridor of the gigantic castle. All about his surroundings, regal furniture stood against the walls rivaling that of the homes back in his very home town. As Jacks eyes scan about the area, it seemed as if every single thing that looked of worth was either way too big to carry, or on the floor scattered into hundreds of pieces. \"Just what could've caused all this...\" Jack mutters as his curiosity over the odd sights begin to dwell even more in his mind. As he returns his gaze straight back to his walking path, an odd sight soon came to view. With all the candles and lanterns blown out, the whole castle had to rely solely upon cracked windows and broken walls in order to sustain light within. Despite this worn down way in retrieving lights, deep within the shadowy recesses of the hallway were what appeared to be two large golden orbs high above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Jack mumbles with a scowl on his face over the strange view. 'Just what could those strange balls of gold be?' he thought to himself. As his eyes soon narrowed to a squint in hopes of catching a more better glimpse of the odd objects, to his shock and disbelief, the yellow orbs quickly vanished and reappeared once more almost as if they were blinking. It didn't take long to notice that those two circles actually belonged to some sort of creature within the castle. With heart pounding and a nervous sweat dripping down his brow, Jack was on the verge of making a run directly towards the castle entryway straight back down the beanstalk. The creature, obviously took notice of the prepared movements as thunderous BOOMS and tremors sounded off directly from the darkness. To Jacks horror, the creature was making it's way directly towards him.</span></div></div>",
