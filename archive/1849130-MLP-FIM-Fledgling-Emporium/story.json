That being said there are a few rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This should obviously be focused on the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic World<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Contributions, unless 'bridge' chapters (chapters there just to add more choices to a scenario), should be multiple (at least 5) sentences long <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. It's understandable that the English language is very complex (there are at least two variants of it American, and British) each contribution should be made to demonstration that you are aware of the basics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Spelling, unless you have a legitimate reason such as being legally blind, is expected to have effort put into it. (90% of it correct)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. These rules may seem serious but in this past when people haven't shown these qualities the stories are shown to fail at least 90% of the time the readers were discouraged to read on. have fun</td>",
