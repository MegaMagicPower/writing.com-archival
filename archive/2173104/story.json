This explains why so many choose to customize theirs in the shape of modern era tools. Christopher happened to stumble upon Grell doing his job. At first the scarlet reaper was confused as to how Christopher saw him. But then began to panic as he realized this was quite the conundrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher ended up being dumped onto Sebastian at Phantomhive Manor. What will happen when Ciel realizes he's got a man who can tell him about the future and endless knowledge that would be unobtainable elsewhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstory 2: Christopher after dealing with unbearable PTSD for so long...commits suicide. And as such is doomed to become a grim reaper as penance. All reapers were once humans who committed the sin of taking their own lives. He is taken under the wings of Ronald Knox, Grell Sutcliffe and William T. Spears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps being a reaper won't be so bad...especially if he gets his own custom scythe like those three!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The scarlet reaper had screwed up yet again, he'd encountered a human and accidentally warped back to Reaper Dispatch with him. He informed Ronald and William of the situation and they came to an agreement that they'd plop him off on 'Bassie' and his brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher had at least seen some combat overseas, so he might fit right in with the 'personal soldiers' of Phantomhive Manor. Though they'd definitely have to do something to make him not stick out like a sore thumb in terms of appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been quite a normal day in the Phantomhive household. Sebastian had gotten everyone up, Ciel had his breakfast, Mey Rin knocked over the china cabinet, Finny cut up some flowers... nothing out of the ordinary happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really was the epitome of a normal day. Sebastian was preparing lunch for the household when he heard loud voices from outside and a knock on the front door. He let out a light sigh of annoyance, cleaning off his flour-dusted gloves and shrugging his tailcoat back on before heading over to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened it calmly, frowning when he saw who was there. \u201cGrell, is there something you need?\u201d He asked, his eyes trailing around the small party in front of him. He paused for a moment in surprise when he saw the newcomer. He stuck out like a sore thumb. He obviously wasn\u2019t a reaper- and his clothes... what was he wearing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d He looked at the man with a suspicious expression, obviously not trusting him. Who would? And why had Grell and Ronald decided to bring him with them to the Phantomhive manor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrell smiled, batting his lashes. \u201cBassie, we have a favor to ask of you~\u201d The annoyance on Sebastian\u2019s face only grew, and he rubbed his temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrell, I apologize, but I am busy. I do not have time for your antics. Perhaps later, but my master is awaiting his lunch.\u201d And you did not want to hold Ciel\u2019s lunch off too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh lunch! We can join you! I'm sure you and the kid won't mind!\" Grell was rubbing up against the pale butler at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem! Mister Sutcliffe...remember why we're here...\" Ronald tried to snap his superior out of their love struck stupor. \"Yeah, otherwise I could just go back to my place...\" Chris interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Ronald refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay then why ARE we here? And didn't you at least tell them we were coming?\" The future boy complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the four servants were hiding around the corner eavesdropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Bassie...this lad is from the future year 2020. It is my mistake for bringing him here, and since I know you love me ever so much...I was wondering if he could stay here? Perhaps as a servant or something?\" Grell declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's an expert at combat, he'll fit right in I'm sure.\" Ronald chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian pushed Grell back, not enough to seem terribly rude, but enough to make a point. \"I think that my young master would, in fact, mind if there were intruders during his lunch hour.\" He said, his voice still icy calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBard glanced around the other servants. \"What does he mean, the future year 2020?\" He muttered towards the others. \"I have seen them around, but are they mental patients? Jeez, explains why Sebastian dislikes that redhead so much...\" He rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMey Rin stood on her toes to get a better look. \"There definitely is something wrong, yes! I'm not sure what, though. But poor Sebastian!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised an eyebrow. \"Of course you're irresponsible with your abilities. Why should I take in a new servant?\" They just took in Snake, for god's sake! He could easily sense and hear the servants, glancing back towards the corner that they were hiding behind. \"I'm afraid that you will have to take him away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, of course, the wait woke the lion. \"Sebastian, where's my lunch!\" Ciel whined, coming down the stairs only to get an eyeful of two reapers and a strange man wearing... what was he wearing? Whatever it was, it looked cheap and gross. \"Sebastian, why are they here?! Make them leave, at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon sighed, beginning to try to usher the three away. \"You heard him, he doesn't want you here.\" He said blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this worked out great! Any more bright ideas, red?\" Chris sarcastically addressed Grell.</span></div></div>",

There had to be some way to convince the Phantomhive brat to listen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scarlet reaper suddenly felt a lightbulb go off as he glanced to Ronald and gave a look to imply he had a plan. Sighing loudly, Grell turned away. \"Oh what a pity, our dear future lad's knowledge of what's to come will go to waste! But i suppose if that's what you wish dear lord and Bassie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel blinked at that, the future? \"What in the bloody hell are you talking about, this man looks like you just pulled him from the gutter!\", Christopher felt a cloud over his head as his casual clothes apparently were consider scraps here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scarlet reaper began to sway as he put  a hand to his forehead. \"Oh it was a simple mistake, i had taken my work to the far years of 2020. Our dear lad here saw me take the latest soul from my to-die list, unfortunately i could not take his soul so he is stuck here. I must say the philosophical words he told us were mesmerizing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris blinked at the dramatic retelling. \"I told you what yolo meant-\", the boy was silenced as Ronald quickly put his gloved hand over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrell smiled sharply as he gestured to the brunette. \"So you see lord Phantomhive, we have quite the lad here that could serve you, tell you riches of the world yet to come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel brought a hand to his chin, the reaper bringing a person from a different time was possible as he heard of their time traveling abilities. Also if it was true...a person who could give him knowledge not know, knowledge that could set him and his corporation ahead of the literal times. It was a feeling that he couldn't describe, far more gifting then the happy Christmases he onced had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming the lord walked to the door besides his loyal butler, he gave a serious look to the three. \"If this is all true then it could be very beneficial to me. However, i wished to hear it from this...future lad himself.\", looking directly into Christopher's green eyes. \"Prove to me that you come from future times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher blinked at the boy's sudden order of demonstration, looking up he saw Ronald giving a nod and Grell giving a winking thumbs up. Chris sighed before opening his large camo backpack, he needed something that didn't exist now, an item that could wow a person of high status in this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the four servents have snuck closer to watch, anticipation collided with tension as Chris began pulling an item out of his bag....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher gave a serious look as he pulled out a wizard mouse toy with plastic tendrils on the top. Everyone blinked in confusion at the toy, how on earth was this supposed to convice them? Pressing a button however made everyone gasp in surprise as not only did the toy begin to make music but the tendrils began to light up and spin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinny looked amazed as it appeared like a colorful halo appeared over the mouse. \"Wow its so colorful!\", he gushed as the spinning lights moved fast. Mey Rin eyes felt as if they would pop out from her glasses. \"I-is this some sort of magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBard grinned as he scratched his scruffy chin. \"Hey those look like some of the fireworks back home!\", Snake blinked as he watched the display, a snake head flicking its tongue as it sat up on his shoulder. \"It's beautiful, says Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel slowly came back from the surprise coughing into his fist as he began to walk up to Christopher. \"It appears these two were telling the truth, and i do have to say you have caught my attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two reapers and human looked in anticipation of Ciel's next words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe.....</span></div></div>",

Christopher here has lots of combat experience! He's a war veteran!\" Grell called out, the duo of Reapers were already halfway gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBard grinned, \"Another soldier, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! He hasn't even said yes, yet!\" Christopher yelled at the retreating reapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're hired. But we'll have to do something about your clothes, your hair, and make sure you don't stand out too much. Sound like something you can handle, Sebastian?\" The young Earl turned to his dark butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian sighed exasperatedly, \"I have quite enough duties as it is...but if so ordered I suppose I have no choice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel pointed at Sebastian and said with authority, \"This is an order: Teach Christopher how to be a Phantomhive servant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian bowed, \"As you wish, my lord.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the crew!\" Finny said cheerfully, gripping Chris' hand and shaking it. \"Gaah!\" Chris yelped as it felt like his hand was about to be crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finny! Be careful!

The butler looked the part of barber, even sporting his apron and having shed his tailcoat. \"So I take it that's not what you usually look like?\" Chris said, making conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever do you mean?\" Sebastian inquired as he continued cutting hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The redhead wouldn't stop talking about you. So I already know about the you-know-what and you being a you-know-what. I'm just saying you look normal to me, no offense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I don't actually look like this...but one must keep up appearances and so I am a butler until the contract is fulfilled. I trust you can keep a secret?\" Sebastian smiled slyly as Chris felt the scissors grow dangerously close to his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure...you got it.\" Chris gulped as the demon went back to cutting his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of it, Chris had a lot more hair on the floor than he did on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/LpsxOS3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/LpsxOS3.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the hand mirror that Sebastian gave him, Chris looked himself over. \"You did a good job. I like it.\" Chris smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now to see to the matter of your clothing.\" Sebastian<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Chris would meet the overzealous Phantomhive commissioned tailor: Nina Hopkins. She quickly took his measurements in a whirlwind and despite her more creative side seeking to make something extravagant...Sebastian stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We merely need some traditional outfits suited of a Phantomhive servant. Work clothes and personal wear shall be fine for now.\" Sebastian sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! Fine, anything I suppose is better than the rubbish he's wearing now. Where on earth did you find this chap?!\" Nina bluntly insulted Chris' wardrobe..paying no attention to the man with the cloud over his head for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina departed soon after, leaving Chris dazed. She didn't much enjoy designing for grown men and Chris could imagine her being a suffragette in a few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...now what?\" Chris inquired of Sebastian. \"I must tend to the young master's dinner. You may take this time to go meet your coworkers.\" Sebastian departed as well.</span></div></div>",

Not only was he out of place in being in a earl's mansion but he was literally out of time as well. He began walking down the pristine hallway, stroking the uniform he was given, servent's uniform or not the vest felt like it cost more then his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How am i supposed to help out here, they said what i learned in training would help but why would a Victorian earl need me?\"</i>, Chris internally struggled with all of this. One on hand he was across time and continents in a place he didn't know. Then again... what was back home? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA broken family, dealing with bad memories, or the occasional shaming from ignorant people. Would it truly be any better here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a little, Christopher was about to pass a door when a sound caught his attention. It sounded like a sizzling yet more...intense. Slowly opening the door Chris's jaw dropped as he was greeted by a stream of fire being blasted at a stove. The brunette boy could only blink in shock as the flames dissipated, it soon showed Bard, goggles up and haired poofed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright lord Phantomhive, lunch is ready!\", pulling down his goggles Bard grinned before narrowing his eyes at the charred food (and wall). \"Hmm, must've overdone it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his hair back to it's shape, the blond man soon spotted the new servant still gaping in shock. \"Ah hey there rookie, Christopher right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, Chris awkwardly nodded. \"U-um yeah that's me! Sebastian said i should meet up with you guys. Were you...forging something in here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBard tilted his headat the question, slightly raising the flamethrower. \"Huh no i was cooking. I figured busting out this beauty would get the lord's lunch, dinner and tomorrow's breakfast done all at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher froze as his eye bulged. <i>\"Cooking!? Just what kinda time did i end up in!\"</i>, the brunette nervously sweated. \"That's um...very innovative!\", the newbie awkwardly smiled trying to make a good impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBard grinned as he put aside his \"cooking contraption\" for now.  Pulling up a sack of potatoes and some vegetables, Chris blinked as the blond chef held out a knife. \"Care to help me while we talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded and took the sharp object. Laying down a carrot he began to slowly chop it up, cautious as he hadn't had much experience with cutting like this. Bard scratched his cheek as he began looking over the charred stove. Had Sebastian been here the thing be fixed up in a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's definitely a nice change having someone like here.\", Bard said glancing over. \"Having someone who's been out in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled slightly as he picked up the carrots and put them in a pot. \"Are you from the states to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i miss em sometimes but being here serving the earl is like a second home. Me and the others never get bored around here, especially when Sebastian helps out with any mistakes.\", the chef fondly said beginning to gather other ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris listened, interested in the fellow American's thoughts. \"What was your fighting like, did you hold a high position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Bard picked up a potato and began peeling. \"I was a solider, hoping one day i get to be a general. But my last day in the army was when i went to work for Ciel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette could sense some tension in those words. Hesitantly he continued. \"Were you discharged?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Bard picked up another potato gazing at it with a melancholic look. \"There was a issue between states, an argument about the laws and taxes our neighbors had to pay. Unfortunately my group turned out out to be outmatched and i watched the people i befriended get gunned down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris grew quiet, he felt an uncomfortable twist in his gut as he heard that. The experiences he went through...he thought at a time where the military wasn't as prevalent perhaps there be more peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut atlas the pain and fear that cane with fighting always existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christopher, you ok?\", Bard asked looking concerned at the brunette as he shook slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris...</span></div></div>",

There's a major conflict coming our way in this era. It's called The War to End All Wars. But is later referred to in the history books as World War One.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaldroy's eyes sparkled with interest, \"Sounds pretty intense! Tell me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sweatdropped, <i>\"You're being pretty intense yourself there, pal.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, basically a global conflict breaks out after alliances were formed between countries.  Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire form the Central Powers. Against Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Romania, Japan and the United States Allied Powers.\" Christopher recited, thank goodness he remembered all that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBard quite literally looked like a kid at Christmas. \"Woahhhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all I've told you countless times that the kitchen is NOT the place for your heavy artillery. And second...\" Sebastian's voice suddenly cut through the air, making Bard's mood turn from wonder to nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris turned around and was met with Sebastian smiling sweetly at him, \"That is quite the information, thank you for sharing it. I shall be sure to pass that along to the young master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He certainly knows how to appear innocent when he wants to.\"</i> Chris thought to himself as Sebastian fixed the mess Bard had made of the stove in a jiffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now don't let it happen again, Bard.\" Sebastian said over his shoulder as he donned an apron and rolled up his sleeves. \"Uh...what are ya doin'?\" Bard questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I do every day, Baldroy.

Looking around he would realize he was sitting in some sort of waiting room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from him was another bench with two people sitting on it. He didn't have long to take in much of his surroundings when he was waved over by a blond woman behind a window. Chris stood up and wandered over. \"Name?\" The nasally voiced woman asked without looking up from her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..Christopher Waller? Hey, do you know why I'm-\" Chris began to ask, only for the woman to interrupt him. \"Take a number and have a seat right over there, sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris blinked but took a small piece of paper with a number printed on it: 845. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this like a doctor's appointment I didn't know I had?\" Chris tried once again to get an explanation out of the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sit right over there, we'll be right with you.\" The woman replied, still not looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on the bench once more, Chris started to talk to the other 'patients'. \"Do you guys know where we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dentist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenue Office?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed no one else knew where any of them were. His number was called before he had more time to think on it. He stood up and proceeded through the door, almost as if on autopilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him was an almost courtroom setting. There was a row of bespectacled men glowering down at him from their seats. He stood there before these 'judges' waiting for one of them to explain what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christopher Waller. Age 23. Committed suicide on January 2020.\" The one in the middle recited in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Chris began to suffer a very severe migraine. Flashes of his own apparent suicide by gun flashed in his brain...and then the pain seemed to subside as he looked up in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...where am I?\" He was starting to piece it together, this was some sort of afterlife. Hopefully he wouldn't be going to a certain fiery torture in a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are hereby sentenced to serve as a Reaper in the Retrieval Division of the Grim Reaper Dispatch. You will reap the souls of humans and review their cinematic records until such time as your final sin has been forgiven. May God have mercy on you.\" The row of stern men recited his 'sentence'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris blinked in confusion, \"Uhh...what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher's vision of the far away 'judges' went blurry. Holding his hand up to his eyes, he would realize that he had somehow become near sighted within the span of the last few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell....?\" He muttered, before he felt a pair of glasses being perched on his nose. \"Uhh...\" He would see he was definitely NOT in that oppressive courtroom anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks will not be necessary. They are merely the same as we give all reaper trainees.\" A snide and stoic voice said from behind him. Turning around, he would see a man wearing a dark suit with slicked back hair. The man was wearing spectacles and had chartreuse phosphorescent eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is William T. Spears. I shall be overseeing your training as a reaper.\" William pushed up his glasses with his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small wooden sickle was placed in Chris' hands. \"Wait...is this it? I was expecting a reaper's scythe to be more...intimidating.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore William could address that, a familiar chainsaw was revved. \"Oh yes! The newbie must've expected to get something like this!!\" Grelle Sutcliff waved his chainsaw around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher's eyes widened and he grew excited. \"Woah! How come you got a chainsaw as yours?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Custom scythes require filling out the necessary paperwork. Trainees such as yourself will have to work with what you are provided.\" William sighed as he dragged Chris away from Grelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought grim reapers were skeletons wearing hoods. Where'd that myth come from?\" Chris questioned Will.</span></div></div>",

Instantly the scientists realized he wasn't exactly the 'taking orders' type. He was lazy and childish and the type who would tell the superiors to 'piss off I'll do it later'. Besides, he wasn't going to kill for them...nor anyone. Busting out of his cell while awaiting 'disposal', he went into hiding until he was sure he was safe. Which happens to be after the defeat of Father. Now he runs into Alphonse during his travels to Xing with Zampano and Jerso. The adventure begins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Abilities:</b> Renard can control a sort of self-generated blue flame, strangely it only seems to burn who and what the foxboy wills it to. They are a bright glowing blue, and Ren can do fantastic things with it. Ren can also transform into a normal looking fluffy orange fox for more 'discreet' things...like pranks! Renard can also turn into a battle form like most other chimeras like Zampano and Jerso etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenard's battle form pictured here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/OLY4nyB.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/OLY4nyB.jpg</a></span></div></div>",

The fox trotted away suddenly, Alphonse following behind it and whining for it to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...guess we've got a fox to catch...\" Zampano sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just make sure poor kid doesn't get himself bit.\" Jerso groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse chased the fox around a corner and looked around...the fur was so soft and since he just recently was able to feel things again...it was nice to pet what normally would be a skittish animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Alphonse frowned as the fox seemed to have disappeared. That was when he suddenly got bonked on the head by an apple which fell from the above tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!

Renard went on his way, wanting to go visit this 'big brother' of the affectionate young Elric who he'd heard about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStowing away on a train, the fluffy passenger hopped off discreetly once it arrived in Resembool. Trotting through grassy fields, he came to a homestead that had a sign outside that said: \"Rockbell Automail Repair\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...this must be where the older blondie lives..\" Renard thought in his foxy head. Trotting up onto the porch, he spotted Den. The Rockbell family dog was looking at him curiously and gave a small 'ruff'. Ren wagged his tail and pawed at the dog with the automail front leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround Renard's fluffy neck was a letter in a pouch addressed to Ed and Winry. It was from Alphonse and was meant to explain the fox's situation and how he had no where to go...so the fluffball would have to stay with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a step-up from Al bringing kittens and pleading with Ed to keep them certainly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenard had convinced Alphonse to leave out the part about him being a 'chimera'. The foxboy was mischievous and wanted to surprise them when he transformed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping a paw on the door in a sort of 'knock', Renard waited around the corner of the door for the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later a young man with blond hair tied back in a ponytail answered the door. Looking around in confusion, Edward saw no one and murmured: \"Must've been nothing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt something soft and fluffy brush past his leg and into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd had no clue what this could be, Den was right there so...what on earth...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IDIOT BEANSPROUT!

The fox stood down the hall and tilted it's head as if amused. The blond man chuckled as he brought his hands up and started stalking towards the animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright furball, just stay still....and there will be no- ACK!\", just as Ed was about to snatch the fox, the vulpine jumped and bounced off Ed's head and hurried off in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRH...COME BACK HERE!\", the blondie started running after Ren throughout the halls and in and out of rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudible yells of frustration and the sound of pounding feet echoed throughout the Rockbell house as Ed chases after the fox and attempted to grab the nimble creature. Every time the fox was cornered, it cleverly found an escape route rather it be between Ed's legs or crawling through a small opening of space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd panted as he ran out of the room he almost caught the fox on his fifth failed capture. The little mischief furball wasn't even running, it was simply watching him with that smug look! With renewed spirit, Ed launched himself forward with a battle cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in another room, Winry Rockbell groaned as she woke up. Last night had not been pleasant with her throwing up and feeling hot. But these thoughts were forgotten as she smiled at the cause for them, a notably round lump at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and ran a hand over the lump while humming. Despite all the side effects, Winry was grateful for the child of her and Edward living and soon to be born. These tender thoughts were interrupted as a loud THUD came outside her and Ed's room alongside familiar laughing. Slowly getting out of bed, Winry wasn't expecting the scene outside to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was laying on his stomach, looking as if he had slid across the floor. Tightly grasped in his hands were a....fox?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA, got you now furball!\", Ed smirked at Renard who now simply looked up with a lazy expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well he was more stubborn then others.<br>\r\nYou've got some interesting family, that's for sure blondie.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly....</span></div></div>",

Opening it up, Ed recognized his brother's handwriting. \"It's from Al!\" Ed said, happy to hear from his bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make some coffee...it's too early for this.\" Winry groaned as she walked past.

Renard caught Ed and spun him around as the young man was clearly freaking out. \"Alright get in there and hold her hand, lay her down on the couch. I'll heat up the water my own way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was confused but he didn't argue, the foxboy was right...the best place for him to be was with his wife. Ren took the pan that Ed had filled up with water and pulled it into his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foxboy brought it into the living room where Ed was holding Winry's hand, he placed it on the floor with a washcloth and ignited a blue flame under it to make it start heating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your chimera ability can use fire? BLUE fire?\" Ed commented. \"Don't worry, it only burns what I want it to..it won't even leave a scorch mark on your floor.\" Ren answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor is going to be awhile...\" Pinako reported as she came back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ed blurted as Winry squeezed his hand and screamed a few choice words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time...we're going to have to do this.\" Ren stated seriously. \"Wait...YOU know how to deliver babies?!\" Pinako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but we've not really got a choice!\" Ren said as he crouched down at the other end of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they had arranged a sort of makeshift area on the floor with some pillows and couch cushions. Ed was seated next to Winry and she was nearly breaking his hand with her grip. Pinako was on the opposite side of Ed and using the cloth to hold on Winry's forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAaaAAAH!\" Winry screamed in agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep pushing! I see the head!\" Renard said from below. \"GrraaAAGGh!\" Winry let out an almost feral roar and panted...then they heard the sound of a baby crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations you two, it's a boy.\" Ren smiled as he passed the now bundled up in cloth infant to Ed and Winry.</span></div></div>",

Winry slowly took her child and made sure he was properly supported with a hand beneath his tiny head and the other cradling him to her chest. The mother's eyes began to tear up as she took in all the baby's features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby was slightly red from the agonizing ordeal and his eyes were squeezed shut as he wailed with the air in his lungs. He had short locks of golden hair matted to his head and chubby cheeks with healthy baby fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd stared wide eyed at the small baby in his wife's arms, the child soon relaxed and fell asleep against Winry's chest. He slowly raised a hand before bringing it to his....son. Gently he rested his palm on the baby's cheek and felt his warmth, it fully hit him that his son was here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over, Ed pressed his forehead to Winry who leaned into his touch as tears rolled down her cheeks and she choked out with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed...h-he's here, i... feel him, our baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward smiled as he let out a chuckle. \"Hehe yeah, it's hard to believe but I'm glad.\" Cradling the baby's face Ed softly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there...son. I'm gonna look after you and your mom. You got nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenard and Pinako watched smiling at the tender moment between the new parents. This was interrupted as a loud knock came from the door. The elderly Rockbell groaned as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They decide to take thier time and show up at the best part?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pinako went to answer the door, Ren looked back at Ed and Winry. The two blond parents where looking at the foxboy with a smile. Ed slowly retracted his hand and moved closer to Renard with a grateful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren...I don't know how to express how grateful I am. Thank you.\" , Ed warmly smiled as he held out a hand. The foxboy gave a toothy grin as he grasped Ed's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I'm just glad everything worked out. Speaking of...\", Ren suddenly rummaged through his pockets and pulled out a small blanket. The green blanket had a small sewn in picture of a small fox made out of orange thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone gave me this a long time ago, now I think I outta give it to someone who needs it.\", Ren closed his eyes and smiled as he ran a hand over the soft cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding it up, Ren placed the blanket on the infant's chest. The babe stirred slightly before feeling around with his hand, touching the blanket he clutched it tightly and relaxed. Winry blinked away her tears and smiled at Renard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Ren, I can see why Al wanted to sent you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen's ears stood up as a blush painted his cheeks. The foxboy awkwardly grinned and crossed his arms. \"W-well I mean blondie was a pretty smart guy so I don't blame him!'<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nWinry was brought to a hospital, just to ensure she and the baby were in top condition. Now lying on a hospital bed surrounded by her family and fox friend, she smiled up at Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ed, what should we name our son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gained a shocked look as he scratched his head. \"Uh well.....how about.....Edwin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry hummed as she looked down at her sleeping son. \"Edwin huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elric grinned toothily as he leaned down. \"Yeah, and we can call him Eddie. How to you feel about that son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin slightly shifted and let out a coo before resting again. Everyone laughed at the baby's approval as Winry kissed Edwin's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edwin it is then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well everyone's in a good mood....almost.\", Ren groaned as he shifted uncomfortably. Going out in public he had to wear a big coat and hat to hide his fox features so that no bad attention was drawn. It was this or waiting outside since pets weren't allowed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was next?</span></div></div>",

I'm adorable.\" Ren replied as he nuzzled the infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pop your arm out of its socket patting yourself on the back.\" Pinako snarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came at the door, \"Who could it be?\" Ed grumbled as he gently picked up Edwin and placed him safely on the couch and got up to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Ed?\" Ren said as he could tell what was coming as Ed went out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin desperately reached his chubby little arms out towards his dad's back and started to whimper as his father left his sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd answered the door and came face to face with none other than: \"Al!\" Ed smiled at the sight of his younger sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAaaaaAAAAH!\" Erupted from the room Ed just left.</span></div></div>",

Al smiled warmly as he saw his brother reflected in Edwin, he was determined and relishing in his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat meowed grumpily as Edwin scooped up water and poured it on his fur to clean it. Using some soap, the child carefully scrubbed of any dirt and watched the cuts littered across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully clean, Edwin picked up the kitten and wrapped it in a towel while gently drying the grey fur.

I managed to get it but Frieden had already memorized the transmutation and already crafted one. So....he went back and I followed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grounded fear began to rise up in everyone's chest.

Why would I wanna do that?! And don't call him-\" Edward snapped, still the cocky teenager he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, one better told by Hohenheim....seeing as it involves him.\" Edwin stated seriously as Al brought in the map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you remember how Envy told you guys you were important sacrifices? Right now the Homunculus known as Sloth is digging a tunnel going all around the country.\" Edwin lay out the map and began to 'connect the dots' to make the Nationwide Transmutation Circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was stunned, \"The Homunculi are planning on using the entire nation as a giant transmutation circle to create a giant Philosopher's Stone for their boss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?!\" Winry gasped in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I'm not finished. Selim Bradley and Fuhrer Bradley are Homunculi. They're in on it..\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three looked to Edwin with clear shock. All of this seemed unreal the humoncili plans, the giant transmutation circle, and the leader of the country along with his son were in on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-brother maybe we should contact colonel Mustang.\", Al nervously spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd clenched his fist and shook his head. \"We can't do that Al, if this information gets leaked who knows what will happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The phones one thing but what if you met privately.\", Winry suggested trying to keep calm in the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad when could we catch a train to Central?\", Edwin asked leaning towards his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked in thought. \"We can try tommarow, hopefully everything is the same as last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was set in motion, a plan to not only save the future but also the present. Hopefully they could successfully thrawd this ginormous plan threatening to sacrifice the people of Amestris. Still the thought of this \"bringer of peace\" lurking somewhere out in the span of time was a negative thought eating at everyone's mind.</span></div></div>",

He gave a friendly smile. \"Thank you Edwin, the situation at hand may be difficult but you being here must be evidence that there is a way to .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin smiled and shook his hand. Riza felt a small smile tug at her lips, the future boy and her superior weren't squabbling like he and Edward did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing hummed and rubbed his chin. \"Say Edwin...would you happen to know what the future of Xing is like?\", the prince seemed eager as he stepped up to the teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin had a thoughtful look. \"Well....you become the next emperor! And the last I've heard you only have one heir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince made a O with his mouth as he smiled and thought about the future. He succeeds in becoming Xing's ruler and has a child through the less chaotic means as his father and half-siblings.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mustaaaang....\" Gluttony shrieked as the red energy began to crackle around his restrained form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MUSTANG KILLED LUST!\" Gluttony suddenly broke his restraints...his belly opened and a single grey eye was seen...causing Ed to be reminded of The Gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGluttony began sucking in everything in sight, including half of the house! \"What the hell!?\" Mustang shouted as Ling grabbed Lan Fan as the entire building began to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SWALLOW...SWALLOW EVERYTHING!\" Gluttony roared.</span></div></div>",

He was feeling a mix of fear and disgust as he watched the homunculus opened up and hungering for anything around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiza had one of her guns locked onto Gluttony only for Mustang to have her hold fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got no choice but to bring him down.\", the colonel said as he put on a new alchemy glove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl had argued against this, after the trouble it took to capture the homunculus. However Mustang said that survival was their priority and that Gluttony knew of them and couldn't escape alive. Edwin couldn't help but agree with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap, the colonel sent a fiery blaze onto the homunculus. The future boy couldn't help but get a sense of awe at the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd stood up helping his son stand as well. \"Are you ok Eddie?\", he asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could sigh in relief, Ed looked with everyone to see the flames swirling and beginning to shrink. It soon revealed that in fact Gluttony was eating the flames itself! The homunculus let out a sigh as he finished the HOT meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He swallowed the flame?\", Ed squinted his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon sprang into action as Gluttony launched an attack at them. The four began sprinting off into the woods as Ed shouted about the colonel useless attack. The quartet soon split into the trees, Edwin running with his dad while hearing the distance sound of shots going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward had a plan in mind, hopefully he could buy some more time with this. He held out his arm to stop his son, getting a confused grunt. Edwin was about to question his dad before he heard a clap and a sparkling glow. The future boy's jaw dropped at the wooden dummy, he couldn't question it as Ed grabbed his hand and started running again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon all regrouped as Mr.Knox urged them to get in the automobile. Mustang began to argue as he was shoved in the car only for the Elric brothers and Riza refuted his words. Edwin felt bad as he saw the downed mood of the colonel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um thank you for your time colonel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustang gained some . \"Ah Edwin, you didn't inherit all of your father's traits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Knox looked back urgently. \"Enough of that, come on get in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever to the surprise to the car's occupants, the three young men turned to each other and nodded. Ed looked to his son who seem to pick up on the thought and smile at his dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The car is full, right? Go on.\", Ed smiled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprise them and they tried to convince them but they argued back. Being children didn't affect them, they would fight the homunculus. It was silent until Riza handed Ed one of her pistols saying that it was to protect themselves. Ed had a conflicted look as he thought of Winry and how she had aimed at Scar, he thought of Edwin and imagined him with his daughter. He finally took the pistol, promising to hold onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin looked at his father concerned before he started to place a hand on his shoulder. He wasn't able to as a loud boom and red bolt came from the forest. Edwin took a breath before running with his dad into the woods, hearing the cries of Lan Fan and the vechile leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four stayed hidden as Gluttony rampaged, destroying trees while demanding for the killer of Lust. Edwin couldn't help but shuddered at the yells of the homunculus, he felt a palm on his head and looked up to Ed still watching Gluttony while subconsciously sensing his son's fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin smiled but suddenly turned with everyone as they heard a sound from a hill above. The future boy widened his eyes as he saw.....a dog. While this wouldn't be a shocking sight, Edwin was unnerved as he saw the glowing red orbs. That wasn't the last of surprises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop Gluttony!\", The dog actually spoke human words and made the homunculus cease his rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared in disbelief however Edwin widened his eyes as he watched red sparks surround the dog and the fur disappeared with red lines to reveal a humanoid body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long time no see, Fullmetal Pipsqueak~\", the stranger smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait...animal that speaks, long wispy hair, and a large smirk. That's it! The homunculus dad said was named Envy!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad that's...eh?\", Edwin was about to talk to Ed but saw a flashing outline of where he was. \"Where did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO ARE YOU CALLING A SHRIMPY, FLEA SIZED PARAMECIUM?!\", Ed yelled as he attempted to deliver a raging kick to the unsuspecting Envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin sweatdropped at the action. \"Umm is dad ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl leaned over and whispered. \"Brother doesn't take well in being reminded of his size. By any chance does Ed grow taller in the future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin blinked as he watched Envy dodge Ed's blows and break a tree with a punch. \"Um yeah he was taller then 6 feet in his last doctor's visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl made a sound as he thought. \"Perhaps you should inform him of this later. It may calm him down more in these situations.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

SWALLOW HIM UP!\" Gluttony roared. .\"You don't get the colonel! Or the Elrics! They're important sacrifices!

Envy scowled and finally noticed Edwin. \"Who the heck are you? You look like an even shorter version of Edward.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO YOU CALLING SHORT?!!\" The elder Elric in question came bursting through the wall at Envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez....\" Edwin murmured as Ling went on the offensive against Envy...Edward and Alphonse dealt with Gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing seemed to have the upper hand, slicing off Envy's arms and a leg. \"Way to go!\" Edwin cheered, then he spotted a familiar figure near the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had slicked back blond hair, was wearing sunglasses and wore a long black coat. Edwin grit his teeth, it was HIM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you!?!\" Envy demanded of the mysterious figure. \"Can I eat him?!\" Gluttony inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That man...he's got a similar vibe as a Homunculus...but he's different....he doesn't even resemble a human.\" Ling said in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You walking talking monkeys with your primitive outlooks on things. You desperately fight to stay alive, yet you don't want things to change.\" The mystery figure said as he began to advance forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Who the hell are-\" Envy demanded, only for the man to grip the top of the Homunculus' head and literally tear the top of his skull off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush little abomination...you'll find that you're just meat and bone...like all the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!! Another homunculus?!\" Alphonse demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the man appeared to teleport in front of Alphonse, gripping the suit of armor by the wrist. \"Do not compare me to them! I am superior! They are NOTHING!\" Friedon tore Alphonse's arm off effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AL!\" Edward cried out and rushed to help his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all puppets...\" Frieden spat and threw Al to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what does that make you?!?\" Ling rushed to attack with his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieden smirked, \"I am a puppet who can see the strings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore this could go any further, Gluttony began inhaling things directly in the path of Frieden, Edwin, the regenerating Envy, Ling and Edward. In an instant they were all sucked into the belly of the Homunculus.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The figure above him cleared and revealed his father with a relieved look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie your awake!\", Ed slowly pulled his son intill he was sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...dad where are w-!\", Edwin snapped out of his grogginess as he gasped at the environment around him. It was if they were in a whole other world, one more terrifying and dark then the previous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was covered in dark liquid, its smell confirmed it as blood. There was a assortment of different architects, debris, and the most unnerving of all was the decayed corpse of a man. There were beacons of fire on top of the pillers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where are we?\", Edwin's voice shook as he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd tched and shook his head. \"I don't know, Al and Ling are no where in sight. And on top of that Envy and that basterd could be here as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his frustration Ed noticed how Edwin put his head down as he mentioned the newest enemy. \"Eddie you seemed to recognize that guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin clenched his teeth as he stood up. \"Dad hes from the future and saw himself above you and the homunculus. Theres one guy I know who fits that description.\", the young boy spoke in a quiet voice laced with bitterness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd widened his eyes. \"Then that guy was....Frieden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather then confirming this, Edwin ran a few yards forward and looked up into the dark sky with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you came here huh? WELL THEN STOP STALLING AND SHOW YOURSELF BASTERD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin began sprinting away while yelling, Ed widened his eyes and chased after his son. \"Eddie wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy didn't stop. \"YOU WEREN'T SATISFED TAKING AWAY THE ONES I LOVED THEN SO YOUR DOING IT NOW HUH?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL TEAR YOU INTO SCRAP AND SENT YOU STRAIGHT TO HELL YOU HE-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDWIN ELRIC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Edwin to stop. The boy's shoulders were stiff as he brought up a hand to brush the hair out of his face. A dry chuckle came out, with a lack of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its been awhile since you used my full name. Heh, the last time was when I played past dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin dropped his hand to his side, Ed was unaware of his son's expression as his back faced him. Ed slowly walked up, placing a hand on Edwin's shoulder which made the stiffness cease. The son's face was melancholic as he met his father's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd frowned and diverted his eyes before wrapping an arm around Edwin's shoulder and bringing him over to a large bolder. The two sat down with Edwin pulling his legs to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite everything that happened I enjoyed spending time with you.\", Edwin quietly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd nodded. \"I never expected this, sitting with my son from the future and getting dumped in some weird wasteland. Edwin you said I went missing in the future, did i.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your asking if your dead...I honestly can't tell. When the purge of alchemists started we were afraid that you would be targeted since you were associated with it. When I was 11, you had to go into hiding alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked shocked, he had to vanish from the public and leave his family?. \"Why would I go alone, shouldn't I have taken everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin pulled his legs closer. \"You had to....you were best known for all your alchemy achievements. Me, Nina, and mom hadn't made any headlines so we were unsuspected. Not to mention you told me if we all went into hiding and were caught.....none of us would be spared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy's body started trembling as a shadow covered his eyes. \"We couldn't send letters or packages. Mom always said that you would be find and show up any day. But I felt terrified.....not knowing if your were still hiding or killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd felt his face and heart drop as Edwin put his face into his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina came into my room in the middle of the night. She had a nightmare and didn't want to wake mom cause she was getting little sleep with work. I helped her back and tucked her in, then she asked me.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"When is daddy coming back home?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin looked up at Ed with a shaky frown as tears fell from his eyes. \"I couldn't even answer her question, what do you say to that? I hoped that this was just some sick dream and when I woke up every day you'd be opening my door and smiling at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd had a shadow over his eyes as he suddenly pulled Edwin close into a embrace. The son began sobbing as he gripped onto his father, longing for the familar hug he always been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please...don't leave....me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd opened his eyes with a determinated look as he hugged his son tighter. \"I promise Eddie, I won't leave ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father and son soon separated and Edwin wiped the tears from his face. Ed smiled as he patted his son on the back and got a grin in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small grumbling came from Edwin's stomach causing him to flush in embarrassment. \"Hehe, I guess I should have had more for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd rubbed his chin for a moment before bending down. Edwin looked in confusion as his father slipped off one of his boots and held it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can eat leather Eddie.\", Ed grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin let out a GAH in surprise as his hair flashed up. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd brought the boot closer making Edwin scoot away. The father groaned as he started scooting around the boulder in circles after Edwin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie come on I don't want you hungry!\", Ed pushed the shoe only for it to be push back by Edwin who had a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe I rather eat rock then your boot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father and son soon shared a laugh. Frieden may be in this labyrinth, but it wouldn't sever the cord that connects family.</span></div></div>",

Ed was clearly excited to learn about it, like an eager child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie dipped his finger in the blood and drew a line on the boulder's surface. \"Okay, let's say this line represents what timeline we're in right now.

You're gonna die!\" Envy roared as he charged through the bloody sea at Frieden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute-!\" Ling ran after the angered Homunculus, wielding his scimitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnvy's arm transformed into a blade, the Homunculus' strike was easily avoided...and the blade was snapped off like a twig and promptly jabbed into Envy's eyesocket. \"GAaaAGhh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing's blade was caught mid swing, Frieden's hand unscathed by touching the sharp blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you?!\" Ling demanded as he jumped back. Smirking, Frieden held his palm out and green electricity shot towards Ling...zapping him and sending him flying back quite far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnvy stood up, yanking the disintegrating 'arm blade' from his bloody socket which started to heal itself. \"Hah! Didn't count on me being able to regenerate did you!?\" Envy declared cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...I already knew about that. I'm just having lots of fun maiming you.\" Frieden replied coolly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn bastard!!\" Envy rushed Frieden, but the bio-android was ready..and snapped Envy's arm off...and smacking the angry fake human off in the direction Ling was sent sailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Edwin and Edward weren't about to expect Ling and Envy to come falling from the sky!</span></div></div>",

He didn't answer the question as he simply said. \"Be on your guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone wall in front of them soon had a glowing circle carved out before it was blasted open. From the smoke emerged the tall figure of Frieden, he easily shattered a rock beneath his boot as he smirked at the other occupants in the humid subspace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my you launch quite far, good thing I didn't break your pathetic bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin growled as he started charging at the future destroyer with a battle cry. Everyone looked at him with shock as Ed tried to grab onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieden didn't move as the teen charged at him. Edwin rolled up his sleeve to reveal a large wristwatch, however rather then a clock it had a paper in it with a transmutation circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circle glowed and as Edwin jumped, pulling his fist back the environment around him turn a shade of purple as everthing around him flowed. His fist connected with bio-mechanical being's face, right between his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the world return to normal, Edwin gasped as his arm was tightly gripped and he was held in the air. Frieden's shares soon broke and feel to reveal his dark eyes. The mechanical man smirked at the teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why look at that, the little pest broke my favorite sunglasses.\", the power house didn't even flinch before with a simple swing Edwin was sent flying a wooden structure with a yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd widened his eyes in horror as he saw his son being manhandled. \"Eddie!....you basterd!\", The alchemist narrowed his eyes at his opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edward be careful, I don't know what he is but he's not even fighting seriously!\", Ling shouted as he tightly gripped his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human or not I want to make this freak to bleed!\", Envy growled morphing his arm into another blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieden simply chuckled and he formed a ball of sparkling green energy in his hands. \"Such sour words from a disgusting creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb fired at Envy, though the humoncili managed to dodge. Getting thrown down as the explosion obliterated the pillars behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say your lack of empathy for life draws ties with the humoncili.\", Ling said getting Ed to look at him a look of shock. Was he trying to angry this ruthless being?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieden's eyes glowed red as he growled. \"Do NOT compare me to those sniveling creatures! I am above them, above YOU, all of you are just a stain to erase from this world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ruthless destroyer held his hand to the sky as he started forming a large yellow orb. Frieden looked up as he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The future wasn't enough! In order to achieve a peaceful and beautiful world I must eradicate live sooner, before the hairless monkeys taint it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing looked to Ed and Envy before nodding his head towards Edwin. They seem to pick up as they started sprinting away from Frieden. Ed quickly picked up his barley consious son and threw him over his shoulder before running as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieden stopped his monologue as he saw the flashing outlines of where the three used to be. The mechanical man growled before smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then little sheep, run away from the slaughter. It'll only make it more fun when your erased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yell, Frieden brought the large energy orb, and a large wave of energy began exploding from the area to be seen miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleeing humans and Humoncili heard the explosion and looked back to see the approaching wall of green. Ed widened his eyes before seeing a large stone wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there!\", the Alchemist ran behind the wall with the two following. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd held on tightly to Edwin as the ground shook and the Ray's of green light shot past the stone wall. Thankfully it was sturdy enough to shield them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, Frieden was out there and it was going to take the four of them to have any chance of stopping him.</span></div></div>",

If this hell was what he thought it was then the humoncili must have been to Xerxes.

Before the alchemist could question Frieden, the bio human held up and caught the large arm blade as Envy attempted to stab him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieden opened his eyes and childishly frowned. \"Hey don't surprise me like that Mr. Palm Tree!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnvy bared his teeth at the unintentional insult. \"ERRH SHUP UP YOU FREAK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin hummed as he walked over and picked up one of the fake human's wisps of hair. \"You know it does look like a palm tree!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humoncili growled as he snapped his head to the young Elric, getting him to hold up his hands and quickly back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnvy yelped in confusion as he was soon held up by his hair.

Ling placed a finger on his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While he has no chi, I can see the complete lack of malicious energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin nodded his head and concentrated on the change in the menace's behavior. \"Maybe....when he attacked earlier he accidentally restored the Law program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alchemist and prince looked to the young boy in confusion. \"The Law...Program?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin hummed and had a thoughtful face. \"When Frieden was near completion, the military created the Three Laws of Robotics. It was a set of standards for any future creations to follow. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward was fully entranced and beaming as his son told him all the information. He imagined what scientific development would come from these guidelines! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing sweatdropped as he gaped at the long explanation of the unfamiliar concepts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Law Program was installed into Frieden's mainframe so that he would always stick to the rules.\", Edwin frowned as he saw a flash of the red eyes. \"But when undergoing maintenance a virus infected his body and his mainframe grew corrupt. So much that he could bypass the program's function, though he couldn't remove it himself as it would damage his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three humans looked back to Envy finally tearing himself from Frieden, losing his arm as it was torn separating. The bio human only looked in amazement as the humoncili regenerated and looked at him with body murder.</span></div></div>",

Although it took time to settle in, Adrien grew close to his new family. His brother Katsuki shows his soft side when with him, though he can be violent if someone else comes into a five foot radius of Adrien. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Adrien is very much a introvert.

Sure enough, his friend Katsuki Bakugou came trodding over. However, he was pulling along another boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child contrasted Katsuki in almost every sense. Not only was his hair dark and eyes blue, but his presence was that of someone shy. He had on a navy hoodie and attempted to hide in it as they approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kacchan!\", Izuku smiled before bringing his attention to the other boy. \"Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired boy hid behind Katsuki as attention was put on him. The ash blond looked behind him with a \"huh\" before frowning and pulling the newcomer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Adrien! He's my new brother.\", Katsuki said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuky awed at the news. His mother had said that Kacchan was going to be a brother. He was confused though, shouldn't he be a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting those thoughts aside, Izuku smiled and held his hand out. \"Hi I'm Midorya Izuku, I hope we can be friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrien looked at the hand as his fingers fiddled with the hem of his hoodie. Izuku could hear strange words being mumbled out of the boy's mouth. Finally, he placed his pale hand onto Izuku's and lightly squeezed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...ice..to..et..you\", the boy said quietly as he shook Izuku's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the awkwardness, Izuku remained upbeat. \"Nice to meet you too En-Kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey En show him your quirk.\", Katsuki said using the boy's new nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded before looking around the park. Spotting a lone ball on the ground, Adrien grabbed it before turning towards the other children. Taking a breath, Adrien tossed the ball as high as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy then brought his hands up in a flaring motion. The meaning of the movement showed when the ball began to fall slower. It's as if someone turned the speed down on it, causing the ball to take fifteen whole seconds to pass Izuku's head and land on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah wow that's so cool!\", Izuku beamed at Adrien. The shy boy smiled slightly all while Katsuki grinned proudly.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"Is was great meeting you!\", Izuku yelled as he said goodbye and waved at the retreating figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrien played with the sleeves of his hoodie. A smile graced his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Suki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh yeah?\", Katsuki said turning towards his new brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......I like it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuki grinned and patted Adrien's back as they made thier way home. <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nWhere were they now?</span></div></div>",

One young boy was coming for a life changing experience in a opportunity of a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr Braginsky was sitting at the window of his row in the airplane. In his hands was a open pamphlet with a famous school of Japan, but more on that in a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing straight from his homeland he was dressed in a long brown coat with a red scarf, underneath he wore a white button up shirt and brown trousers with his brown boots reaching his knees. His elbow length blond-white hair was tied in a low braid and his fringe fell to the left side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's grey eyes sparkled in awe as he looked at the plamflet of the Japanese hero school U.A high. He couldn't believe he was leaving his snowy home and going to make friends in a new country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giddy mode was interrupted as a man next to him was shuffling around. In his movement the man's elbow ended up colliding with Aleksandr's side making the boy grunt in surprise at the sudden contact. It wasn't the last as the middle age man continued making jabs at the Russian boy's side and it started to grow some annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me sir?\", Aleksandr asked getting one of the man's eyes opened. \"Could you please stop moving so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man tched. \"Who the hell are you tell me what to do huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need some damn foreigner brat being up tight just cause his daddy didn't get him first class seats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr rather then get angry, smiled. A childish smile as he placed his hand on the man's shoulder. However, the confusion on the disruptive man's face turned to shock as he let out a yelp of pain, as the blonde boy gripped his shoulder tight enough that he swore his shoulder blade dislocated. The grip was like that of three grown men and pressed against bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn aura of tension was emitted from Aleksandr as a shadow fell over his eyes. A cold air filled the air like that of a freezing winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to polity ask you to stop nudging me. Of course, you wouldn't be able to do it if you were missing an arm \u0434\u0430~\", the boy spoke in a sinister voice with a childish tint to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shook at the boy's terrifying aura before hastily nodding. The aura seem to disappear as it was replaced with a sunny smile and a happy Aleksandr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah thank you for understanding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to his pamphlet, the Russian teen continued reading like nothing happened. The man rubbed his sore shoulder and tried staying still and sleeping, but Aleksandr's dark smile and voice did their work in keeping him awake.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAleksandr smiled in awe as he stepped off the plane. The sun hit him as he took in the new area of Musutafu from the airports viewing area. As he walked towards the lobby and grabbed his luggage, he scanned the entrance to look for who would be picking him up and taking his to U.A's dorms. Soon he saw a man with long shaggy black hair wearing black clothes and a long white scarf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa Shouta looked at the teen approaching him, well looked up as the blond head went almost a foot taller then him. He reassembled the boy from his file and even had on a childish grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aleksandr Braginsky<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge:15<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomeland: Oymyakon ( Russia )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuirk: Blizzard, has the ability to create powerful snowstorms.

Tommarow you start classes and I don't want you holding back anything you hear?\", Aizawa sternly asked after managing to get his hands out of Aleksandr's strong grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr nodded and followed his teacher outside of the airport and into the city of Musutafu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext....</span></div></div>",

Right now, he stood in front of the door to 1-A and smiled as he heard Aizawa talking. The teen was at first concerned since his height often played an issue in buildings, such as all the marks he got on his head from hitting doorways. But luckily the door was tall for an assortment of different students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Aizawa was giving the brief on Aleksandr. \"As you know we're receiving a tranfer student today. I trust you'll all get along with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA certain electric and grape boi internally cried as they remembered thier shattered fantasy. Mina and Sero smiled as they remembered the Russian boy, he was eager to get to know them but had to get everything in his room set up so there was no time to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa turned towards the door. \"Alright come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched as the tall student walked in, wearing the uniform with an addition of a long red scarf. At first glance he'd be mistaken for a adult with his height, but his childish face gave away his youth. The boy lifted his hand and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440, I am the exchange student Aleksandr Braginsky. I hope we can be friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of \"nice to meet you!\" rang out before Aizawa hushed them and pointed to where Aleksandr would sit. The back row of seats had been spaced out to make room for a extra empty seat placed next to a boy with split red and white hair. The Russian boy thanked the teacher before humming and strolling back to the designated seat, and sat down while wearing a happy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, today we're gonna be-\"? Aizawa had begun to speak when the door to his class suddenly slammed open to reveal his colleague Present Mic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Eraser, theres an issue and I need some help!\", the hero with gravity-defying hair asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scruffy hero groaned before turning to his class. \"Talk amongst yourselfs, and don't destroy the classroom while I'm gone.\", with that class 1-A's teacher exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began chatting and looked over to Aleksandr unpacking his back. The blond boy saw a shadow on his desk and looking up he saw a boy with blue hair and glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, my name is Iida Tenya and I am the class rep.\", Iida gave a fast bow before holding out his hand. \"I would like to welcome you to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr suddenly bolted up and grabbed Iida's hand with both of his and began to wildly shake it like he'd done with Aizawa. Iida yelped as his body was thrusted and the Russian boy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Privet, it is nice to meet you! Will you be friends with me?\", Aleksandr stopped shaking Iida's hand and allowed the boy to readjust his glasses before clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh well...of course.\" , as soon as the class rep said that Aleksandr ran around his desk and embraced Iida while humming. Iida slightly blushed as the taller student hugged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling away, Aleksandr smiled down at Iida. \"Thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIida nodded and smiled. \"Of course, now I should introduce you to everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr hummed as he nodded and followed Iida over to two other students. A freckled boy with curly green hair and a brunette girl with a bright round face. The two looked over and smiled as they saw Iida with the new student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midoriya and Uraraka I would like you to meet Braginsky Aleksandr.\", Iida said gesturing towards the blond boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka smiled as she bowed. \"It's nice to meet you Braginsky-san, my name is Uraraka Ochacko!\", she then looked towards the freckled boy. \"This is Midoriya Izuku.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku nervously looked up as the Russian boy suddenly walked up to him. Aleksandr put a shadow over the boy who began mumbling as the boy reached out and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarted rubbing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr closed his eyes and hummed. \"Your very adorable Midoriya \u0434\u0430~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku became flustered and started waving his hands. \"Uh umm thank you! T-that's very kind of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr tilted his head and smiled. \"So, will you two be my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku blinked at the question before growing a smile. \"Y-yes of course Braginsky-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka brightly smiled. \"We be very glad to be friends with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were cut off guard and became flustered as Aleksandr pulled them both into a big hug and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was next?</span></div></div>",

As Aleksandr approached the explosive-quirk wielder he got a glare from the boy as Katsuki snapped: \"I ain't interested!! If you're here to be all buddy-buddy with everyone you're here for the wrong reason!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr stunned everyone by not only not flinching at Bakugo's anger, but giving off an intimidating aura of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful who you yell at...\u041c\u0443\u0434\u0430\u043a.\" Aleksandr said with a smile..yet the aura he was giving off was anything but cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you just call me!?!\" Bakugo yelled as he jumped out of his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe in your language it's pronounced shithead.\" Aleksandr chirped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY YOU-!!!\" Bakugo yelled as he was now being held back by Kirishima. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow...I've never seen anyone stand up to Bakugo like that before...\" Denki whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...come on Kacchan...give him a break?\" Izuku said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa slid open the class door forcefully and yelled: \"Alright that's enough!

We'll spent some time seeing where your results stand now. After that, you all will do a quick sparing match. Now get changed and meet me outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr hummed as he thought of using his quirk. How was he gonna use it, in fact how was he going to measure it? The Russian boy was giddy as he followed the boys to the locker rooms. Opening his locker, Aleksandr smiled as he saw his gym uniform ready to be worn, he began to strip off the top of his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirishima seeing Aleksandr grinned as he made his way over. \"Hey Braginsky-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall boy hummed as he turned to the spiky red head. Kirishima's eyes widened as he saw the bulky muscles of the Russian boy. \"Woah, you have such manly muscles dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr giggled and scratched his cheek. \"Oh \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e! There aren't many people from my village, so me and my brothers often did a lot of heavy lifting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirishima had tears in his eyes as he clenched a fist. \"I never knew the new student would be such a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr closed his eyes and giggled. \"Kirishima was it, thank you for approaching me. If you wish, you can call me Aleksandr.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired boy gave a sharp grin and nodded. \"Of course, can't wait to see your quirk in action!\", Kirishima made his way out of the locker room, leaving Aleksandr to happily change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the students of 1-A made their way out to the training field to meet Aizawa. Aleksandr stood next to Iida enjoying the comfortable gym uniform. A obstacle course was laid out with walls and combat robots currently not moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then to start off you'll be making your way through this course and attempt to finish as soon as possible. Starting off are a group of five Midoriya, Ojiro, Sato, Yaoyorozu, and Braginsky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first five lined up at the start, Aleksander smiled as he patted Izuku's head getting a flush in return. Aizawa gave one of his grins as he started a counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember go all out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3, 2, 1!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five students sprinted from the starting line, Aleksandr's eyes became sharp as he put his energy into his legs. The first obstacle was a large metal wall going up 15 feet, Izuku powered up a portion of One For All into his legs and hopped to the top. Izuku yelped as a thump shook the metal and looking down he saw Aleksandr climbing the wall by sinking his fingers into the metal and crunching it. Izuku blinked shock and gasped as the Russian boy threw himself onto the ground with a thoom. The blond boy grinned as he got up, before Izuku continued as everyone eventually made it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo battle drones stood and activated as Aleksandr approached. He looked in awe at the robot's before the familiar dark aura surrounded him and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must pass so......\u043e\u0442\u0434\u044b\u0445\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloudy substance surrounded Aleksandr's hand as he threw it forward. A strong wind blasted the drones back a few feet as ice started to form around their joints and soon immobilized them. Throwing his hand forward in a fist, Aleksandr hummed as he punched and shattered the head of the drone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green blur passed him and Aleksandr saw Izuku pass him. He looked surprised before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah Midoriya is very determined, he reminds me of Lukyan.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the end was reached and Aleksandr came in second. After receiving the results he walked with Izuku and ruffled his hair from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ver very impressive Midoriya.\", Aleksandr beamed to Izuku sheepishly smiling and flushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah thank you were really cool too Bra...breg... \", Izuku panicked as had trouble saying the Russian name. He knew a good amount of English but the slavic language was completely different!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr looked confused at the short boy's mumbling before catching on to the issue. Giggling and crouching down, Aleksandr warmly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your having trouble with my name you can call me Sasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku looked up in awe at the offer. \"Sasha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleksandr ruffled the green hair again as a sunny aura surrounded him. \"It is a nickname my family and friends use. I believe your worthy in using it little \u0431\u043e\u0431!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku blushed, but smiled as he nodded. \"Well thank you then...Sasha!\"</span></div></div>",

He was told the family's reputation was true and to approach any members with caution. The boy may be young but the blood of a assassin runs through him just like 84's.

Looking forward, they saw a young man in front of them taller and gazing at them with serious voidful green eyes. Besides his serious face a notable sight was the large bandage on the back of his head. Gon looked in confusion at the mysterious suited male while Killua narrowed his eyes at being called a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua was cut off as the blimp arrived and it was time to depart.

If you still insist on getting off here then I suggest you take this seriously or you'll end with more then just no sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua felt his teeth clench as the man talked down to them as if they were babies.

The door was cracked and they heard 84's voice speaking to Genko. \"You should've known you wouldn't get away with it forever..not my problem you were wanting to enter the Arena.\" 84's voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're gonna just kill me when I'm telling you I can pay you TRIPLE what that old geezer is?!\" Genko cried out, his voice sounding hysterical. As Killua peered through the door he saw 84 holding a picture of a young girl in Genko's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever future you envisioned for yourself you threw away when you brutalized a young woman and slit her throat that night. Consider this karma if you like...either way I'm getting paid.\" Gripping the back of Genko's head, 84 plunged the murderer's head down into the toilet water filled with his own puke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon and Killua heard Genko's gurgles and saw him flailing madly to escape...but with one final spasm...he went still and the  bubbles stopped.</span></div></div>",

To those who came across this unsavory sight they would assume the man had got gotten drunk and drowned himself while vomiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n84 cleaned the back of the deadman's head to ensure any possible fingerprints were erased. His 'borrowed' uniform had some staining, maybe he should clean it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creaking of the bathroom door made 84 quickly stand and reach for a knife he'd concealed. The hitman grunted as at the entrance stood the Zoldyck child and his friend.

While the reasons are unknown I can say he didn't give her mercy, and so I didn't to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hitman slowly walked up and looked down at the boys.

It ended however when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hitman placed his hand on Killua's head and ruffled his hair. The two hunters stared in surprise and a light blush formed on Killua's face. As 84 exited the room he called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you both in the arena and you better not hold back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were alone, Gon chuckled at his friend's face.

What it is is that you take the human's hand and have them face their palm up towards you. Then the vampire will take his fingernails and dig them into the tips of the human's fingers. There's blood...lots of it...but when the vampire seals the wounds with his saliva the person is a half-vampire officially.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Yato blinked curiously, they sure were learning a lot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'that's it'?\" Xavier raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it doesn't seem so bad...\" Kofuku giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like the halfie can go back to a normal life...all their human attachments have to be severed.

Those closest to them. A newbie lacks the know-how to do it quietly and doesn't know how to show restraint...all they'll know is they need blood and are mad with the desire to drink.\" Xavier said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't just go around making half-vampires willy nilly.

The truth about vampires may be different from what they percieved but it still had many darks to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukine's eyes found thier way to his feet. His chest felt heavy as he thought over everything. Becoming a vampire was much  like him when he became a shinki, having to live a new live when the old is gone. A child halfie could turn into a uncontrollable blood thirty monster just like he could've turned into a phantom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukine felt a soft grasp to his hand he didn't know was clenched. Looking up, he saw Hiyori had come over and was looking at him with a gentle look, Yato was looking over with a soft look as well. The Shinki felt relief as he remembered how he was saved and expelled his sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier grew a small grin as scooped up more rice. \"Then again, Halfies can learn control when thier masters give them care and teachings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukine smiled as the silence ended as everyone laughed. The blond boy looked over to Renard who was slurping up the rest of his noodles and passing the bowl over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does a Totem do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen leaned into his palm and and closed his eyes. \"My duty ended a long time ago kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYato felt his curiosity gripped. \"How does a spirit lose it's duty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen's eyes opened and seem to hold a seriousness not seen before. \"It wasn't just my duty, it was me and my tribe's task to watch over the land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Yukine gave the foxboy his new bowl, Ren hesitated in moving his chopsticks. Ren sighed before finally placing them down and looking at Yukine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you my story, but I got to warn all of you it ain't happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKofuku slowly nodded. \"It's ok tell away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it started 1000 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"1000 years!?\"</i>, everyone but Xavier thought.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<i>\"My tribe was known as The Creek, we were tasked with using our power to protect the human tribes who resided in our area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the trees ran two foxes at fast speeds jumping over roots and rivers. After coming to a clearing the foxes suddenly glowed and took the form of humans with thier vulpine ears and tail. Ren was one of them dressed in brown loincloth and shaw, the other was a boy similar in looks except for longer hair. The two laughed as they layed on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and my brother weren't finished with our training so we'd spent time goofing around. It was peaceful....but not for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Foxboys looked up in confusion as the sun was blacked out despite the cloudless sky. Ren and his brother gasped as they saw blackness filling the sky, strange demonic creatures were flying through the sky armed with red spears and swords. One had seen them and immediately shot at them, only to let out an unholy screech as Ren and his brother incinerated it with thier blue flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two quickly changed into foxes and began sprinting back towards thier tribe's home. As they reached the large lake that was the halfway point, a demonic creature like that of a large bull emerged with a red axe appeared and took a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evil spirits known as Malice were attacking all the spirits tribes. As without them in the way, the Malice could corrupt humans no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen's brother looked at him in fear, before he was pulled into a hug. The brother teared up as Ren signaled him to flee without him. Ren watched his brother in fox form leave before looking at the malice with a smirk as he rushed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put up a good fight but in the end I lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen looked down shocked at the bull had stabbed him with the point on his ax. The malice then threw his body into the lake and the last thing the foxboy saw was the surface going furthur away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miraculously hadn't died but was put into a healing sleep that took it's damn time as I woke up a few hundred years later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen's eyes shot open as he laid at the bottom of the lake. Shooting towards the surface the Totem collapsed onto the grass before getting up to limp back to his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hundreds of years may have been kind to me.....but not my tribe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen looked around his tribal home in confusion. Usually everyone was running around full of energy but now it seem deserted. The foxboy smiled he saw his hut and rushed to pull open the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother manage to escape my encounter with the malice. But he and the rest of my family weren't so lucky for the second encounter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen's eyes were opened wide as his pupils shrunk. The walls of the hut had darkened stains and in the corner two large Skeletons were wrapped around a smaller one as if hugging it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen covered his mouth as he backed away.<br>\r\nStreaks of liquid fell down his cheeks as he dropped to his knees. A loud anguished yell echoed throughout the village as Ren concluded the reason for the desertion.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"After that, I wandered around and saw how much humanity changed. The humans my tripe protected either left thier homes or weren't around anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen finally moved his chopped sticks and slurped up the noodles before grimacing. \"Damn now it's cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You've thoroughly pissed me off!\" Xavier's voice rang out...but it was tinged with a sort of demonic reverb. Yato got an intense feeling of darkness as the figure was revealed to be a tall man with ghost-white skin and long black hair. The figure wore black armor and a red cape that resembled wings.  Renard rushed to Larten's side and hoisted him up.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">The three looked in shock at the new arrival, he had Xavier's face and voice with a hard edge.

But...with all the damage he's recieved he'll need a boost.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone relaxed slightly at the foxboy's words. Yukine quirked an eyebrow as Ren brought out a vile of what seem to be blood. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping the lit off, Ren opened Larten's mouth. \"Some Xavier's blood, it can help speed up the healing factor and coming from the king of vampires should replenish Larten's stats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the liquid before poured into the servent's throat and unconsciously swallowed, a groan came from Larten. His shoulder wound began to close and reform lost tissue and the scratches on his face disappeared. Larten suddenly gasped as his eyes shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen playfully nudged his shoulder. \"Nice to see you up sleeping beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarten began to pat his face and body before a sparkling aura surrounded him. \"Ah my lord's blood has saved me!\", the servent then turned to Hiyori with tears forming. \"Miss Hiyori your ok!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiyori smiled but yelped as the vampire suddenly latched on and cried onto her. The Hanyou chuckled and awkwardly patted his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukine sweat dropped at the exchange, before turning to find Yato focused on Xavier and Murloch approaching the vampire king.</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As while a quiet day suited others fine, the family of Fairy Tail preferred more ....chaotic mornings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi ice stripper what was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was your fault the pay was deducted flame head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the guild hall as per tradition, the mages Natsu Dragneel and Gray Fullbuster were butting heads. Fire and ice pressed together as the two faced off. The cause was a matter of the reward for a mission being lessened due to some complications completing the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you cut it out!\", a firm and feminine voice ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Natsu and Gray stiffed as they turned and quickly nodded. Their guild member Erza Scarlet watched humming as the formerly clashing rivals were now acting buddy buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of you two are at fault for the reduction. The map we were given from the guard was outdated and failed to include the new trails crafted in the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth wizards nodded quickly, not wanting to agitate their guild mate. Although as soon as Erza turned a spark of clashing flew between Natsu and Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed as she leaned on the bar counter. \"Honestly can't those two ever take a break?\" The blond's eyes suddenly blinked as she looked around the guild hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ne Natsu, where's Happy? He's been gone since we got back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu snapped out of the stare as he hummed and turned towards Lucy. \"Hmm, he said he wanted to check out the new import of fish. He has been gone pretty long though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the guild suddenly opened, the exceed in question came flying in. Happy smiled as he waved his paw in a welcoming gesture. \"Ne ne in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu raised an eyebrow at his cat friend. \"Eh Happy what's up the fish that good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was! But everyone I got someone who may want to join!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got the guild chatting as they saw a figure walking in from the bright outside. Confusion struck everyone as the outline of this stranger didn't seem completely human. Surprise soon echoed as the doors cleared and the stranger was revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/fudge1999/art/Mitsue-804744183\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/fudge1999/art...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man had longish blond hair, accompanying them was a pair of light orange fox ears. From the back of the red kimono, nine fox tails lightly swished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red eyes held a friendly grin as he walked up behind Happy. \"Ah you were right Happy, this guild hall is rather nice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy grinned as he floated and placed a paw on the man's fluffy ear. \"Nyeh I told you! Everyone this is Mitsue, he wants to join!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue chuckled as he flapped his ears. \"I said my answer was undecided, I still need to think things over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you should join, if Happy wants you to join then that must mean your cool!\", Natsu grinned walking up to the foxman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue smiled at the words before Erza placed a had on her chin. \"How exactly did you meet Happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newcomer hummed as he looked to Happy. \"I believe you should tell them, in the meantime would you mind if I had a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza nodded and gestured to the bar, gaining a small smile as Lucy looked at the numerous tails in awe as Mitsue sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy cleared his throat as he took a nice fish out of his green knapsack. \"Hm well I had just got the perfect fish when....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<i>Happy happily hummed as he carried the fresh fish back to the guild. He wanted to gobble it up now but reminded himself that this fish was quite rare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the trip back had a delay as one of the fish fell out of his knapsack and flopped into a alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyeh! No come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever upon flying into the ally, Happy found himself being pressed against a wall. The cause being three hoodlums all looking at him with devious faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An exceed eh, but you make some good jewels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy struggled against the hand and attempted to use his Aera. Finding he couldn't fly away from the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could be ensnared, Happy and the others heard a clanking sound coming from deep within the alley. Approaching them was a figure, a unsettling feature were the beady red eyes glowing in the dark not blinking as he only produced the clanking sound of his wooden sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oi don't just stand there gut him!\", the one holding Happy barked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly charging the figure, the goon took out a dagger and with a yell raised it to strike the figure. Within a second, the figure slammed the goon into the alley wall with a backhand slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show of strength and unblinking red orbs installed more fear in the hoodlums. With one more steps the three fled the alleyway, trying to outrun the terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy let out a breath as he finally could freely fly again. The feeling of anxiousness left Happy as the red orbs finally revealed a concerned face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, they didn't harm you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exceed couldn't answer as he gawked, suddenly seeing the ears and tails of the stranger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsue helped me and he isn't going anywhere so I asked him to join!\", Happy exclaimed taking a bite of his fish.</span></div></div>",

His eyes widened as he saw the kimono wearing Mitsue, looking at him in awe. Walking up, Ren observed the other foxboy, taking in every detail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue suddenly sweatdropped as Ren reached forward and lightly squeezed his ears. Humming Ren suddenly smiled. \"Yep their real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He was concerned about the ears?!</i>, everyone thought as Ren took to observing Mitsue's tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov took a sip of a offered drink, courtesy of Mira. \"It be difficult for them to be siblings Natsu. Whatever being Mitsue is I doubt he is that of a totem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza looked in slight awe as she looked to Ren. \"A totem, I thought they were mere legends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got the guild chatting as they discussed the presence of a mythical figure among them. Lucy hummed as Ren was resting his head against Mitsue's numerous tails, the kimono man grinning as he drank his sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is a totem Ren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen opened an eye. \"I basically helped groups of people find their way and give protection. As long as they feed me I'll help them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats....honorable.\", Lucy sweatdropped.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Short answer is, I'm not exactly human anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue's tone and eyes seem to gain a melancholy tinge as he looked down at the bar counter.

People join our guild as we all faced hardships, were all like a family, now you and Ren are too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue blinked, taking in the words. All the years he spent wandering, meeting amazing people only to watch them grow and peacefully pass. Yet again he seem to find an amazing family.

Would you like to join us on a quest to help me pay my rent?\" Lucy asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are laying it on thick.\" Happy snarked, getting a glare from the blond girl. \"Am not, pussycat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we need to get our feet wet and show what we can do.\" Mitsue smiled toothily. \"Alriight!

This'll be a piece of cake...and I'll be riich!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon getting stern looks from the others, Lucy corrected herself. \"I-I mean WE! We'll be rich! I'll just have enough to pay my rent for a long time!\" Lucy laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at that very same village...it was a massacre. The job request was fake alright, but the village was in danger...or rather danger had already arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA villager lay under the rubble of their house, a shadow falling over them. \"P-please...why have you done this?! What did we do to you?!\" He asked a shirtless and heavily tattooed man with a braided beard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to make it seem authentic, get their blood boiling upon seeing what this 'dark guild' has done.\" The mysterious figure stated casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but what dark guild do you belong to?!\" The village wheezed as he was hoisted up by the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...that's the point.\" The figure responded coldly before choking the life out of the poor innocent.</span></div></div>",

Hakobe, traveling by foot will take too long.\", Erza explained putting her heavy bags down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy hummed as she looked at everyone. Erza was looking the other way checking her luggage so that gave the two elemental rivals a chance to but heads after Gray made a remark about the train and Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train's whistle alerted everyone, the train was leaving soon yet the two foxes of Fairy Tail had yet to arrive. Lucy nervously looked at everyone else boarding. \"Oh what's  holding up Ren and Mitsue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the delay!\", a apologetic voice yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue came running up, fast clanks from his shoes as he let out a breath while stopping in front of the group.

Yelping, the celestial wizard adjusted the fluffy creature before giggling and his soft fur. Ren meanwhile had a small blush as his head was resting on a....pillowy area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're all here let's set off!\", Erza called as she and the others began to board, all while Natsu cringed at the stomach irking ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the train departed and the Fairy Tail members were on the way to their supposed mission. Natsu layed on the seat, knocked out curtsey of Erza so he wouldn't be suffering from the dragon slayer weakness. The scarlet haired swords women sat looking closely at the location given of the village all while Happy relaxed and ate some snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seats ahead were filled by Lucy, Gray, and the two foxboys. Ren snoozed on Lucy's lap while she stroked his back humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray hummed as he leaned back and crossed his arms. \"Ne Mitsue, I don't wanna seem pushy asking this but if Ren's a totem...then what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue looked at the ice mage, the two intensely looked at each other as a aura of tension seem to form. Finally Mitsue looked away with a flustered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...what happened to your shirt Gray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice age looked down in shock as an article of his clothes had vanished. \"Damn not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue chuckled as the air became cheerful and warm. \"I believe I should tell you, wouldn't want to remain a enigma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond boy closed his eyes and hummed. \"I suppose in order to tell you about what I am I must first tell you about the origins of my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"This tale of my family is said to be one of truth, a common saying in my family is that we were a clan of kitsune. It was said centuries before I was born a marriage occured between my ancestor Tsunayashi and the fox spirit who guided him named Akari.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man emerged from the dense woods, looking worn as he stumbled from his trek. Besides him emerged a large glowing fox, a red and white scarf adorning its neck. Tsunayashi fell to his knees breathing relieved as his trek to reach the land away from the group of dark wizards who attacked his village while preaching of their dark lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft bump came from the mystical creature, it had aided him by showing Tsunayashi the way to safety and protecting him. The man smiled warmly as he stroked the kitsune's head. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature hummed before suddenly glowing and shifting it's shape. The light soon died down and it's place was a beautiful woman with long platinum hair flowing around her ears and tails, the red eyes of the kitsune woman slowly looked at Tsunayashi before she smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the hands of Tsunayashi, Akari helped him up before both of them looked into each others eyes warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were soon bounded in love and gave birth to the clan of Fudo. While descendants did inherit her hair, they didn't possessthe other kistune features. I was the first one to grow the ears and tails hehe.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy listen in awe at the story as Gray had a look of thought. Ren blinked as he heard the story, thinking over everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how come you were the first to pop the fluffy features?\", Ren asked as he morphed into his human form and took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue looked off a tad nervous. \"Well that-.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitsune stopped his sentence as the train whistle sounded, signaling their arrival. Quickly, Mitsue stood up and held a shaky grin. \"I can tell you all another time, but for now let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizards looked confused at the kitsune's sudden attitude, Ren sighed before shifting back into his fox form and hopping into Mitsue's arms.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What's that smell?!\" Natsu covered his nose and mouth with both hands. \"Whatever it is, it stinks...\"  Lucy coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where was this village supposed to be?\" Happy asked worriedly. There was a pause, before Erza's eyes widened, \"Everyone! Hurry!\" She raced off towards the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erza! Wait!\" Lucy called before they all raced after the S-Class mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed Erza until they were within the boundaries of a ransacked village. The huts were demolished and most had been torn apart and used as kindling on a massive fire. Most horrific of all was that the smoke billowing from the fire...was from a stack of the burning corpses of the villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what happened here...?\" Lucy whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenard and Mitsue's ears twitched, the foxboys had a bad feeling about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Was wondering when you'd show up!\" A jovial voice said, coming from a man seated beside the flames. He was casually roasting the leg of some beast he'd killed, over the grotesque pyre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, the meat half cooked...but to their disgust he tore off a chunk with his teeth, blood dripping down his chin into his braided beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross!\" Happy and Lucy cried out together. Erza grabbed the hilt of her sword. \"Who are you?! Are you the one who did this?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stepped forward, tossing the meat hunk over his shoulder. They saw he was shirtless and his entire torso was covered in rune-like tattoos. \"And what if I am? If you don't like my answer what are you going to do about it?!\" In a blur of motion, the man's words were uttered through laughter...as he was in front of Gray in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's elbow struck Gray in the solar plexus, sending him flying backwards through a tree. \"So fast!\" Erza gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen's eyes were wide with horror, this guy...he seemed familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu engulfed his fists and struck the man in the jaw, the stranger hit the ground. \"Hmph! You ain't so tough!\" Natsu snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger turned to Natsu as he began to stand up, to their surprise the scorch mark on his cheek was healing itself. \"Y'know, my dead grandmother can hit harder than that...so I wouldn't be acting so cocky!\" The man was gone and reappeared behind Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NATSU LOOK OUT!\" Lucy, Happy and the two foxboys yelled out. Blocking a flaming elbow to the face, the stranger smirked. \"You know, this was a trap. You walked right into it and sprang it better than I could've ever hoped!!\" Natsu got a chop to the ribs, causing him to gasp out before he was kicked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should consider yourselves lucky, the All-Father doesn't just deem any old losers a threat...but once he does, he wants your petals plucked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?!\" Erza demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain chuckled as Mitsue went to attack, which was dodged with that unfathomable speed. \"As I said before, you lot are getting a bit too big for your britches. So you need to be erased. Nothing personal. However, there is one selfish reason I took this errand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsue brandished his Wakizashi, to his surprise, the stranger gripped the blade and sliced his hand down it. Blood seeped onto the ground and down the man's arm...but he seemed unfazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna hurl...\" Happy had turned green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" The wound healed as the man laughed insanely, \"I CAN'T FEEL ANY OF THIS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man delivered a palm strike to Mitsue's face as it finally clicked in Ren's head who this man was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baldor....\" Ren gasped quietly.</span></div></div>",

The kitsune soon cried out as he was thrown back into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erza, Mitsue!\", Lucy cried out in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyeh this is bad, he's really strong!\", Happy shook his head distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza stood up and rose her sword. \"Even if he is strong...what he's done is unforgivable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, the redhead looked in confusion as Ren stepped forward, a shadow covering his eyes. \"I know this sounds crazy but I'm gonna go in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren what are you talking about? You've seen how strong he is we can't attack him alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen looked up his lazy face holding a glare. \"I know hes strong, I've encountered this strength before. But i have unfinished buisness with him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden burst of blue fire enveloped Ren, spreading out around him. Holding out his hand a stream of blue fire soon molded into that of an ax with a large blade. A sword soon appeared in his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and so does my clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh those flames, something about you rings a bell.\", Baldor narrowed his eyes as he saw Ren walking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you remember!\", Ren growled as he twirled his axe.</span></div></div>",

The trio of male demons sensed it, a magical presence that was not human but not demon either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car pulled up into the parking lot of the apartments, the driver was the source of the magical energy they were feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou came over to the window by Lucifer's area and peered out to see a boy with reddish orange hair talking to the landlady Mi Kitty. He popped the trunk and two movers (obviously hired by the landlady) began to unload boxes and bring them up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't look like a threat...\" Maou commented. \"Appearances can be deceiving, sire.\" Ashiya countered as the movers were now in the hallway following the landlady to the previously unowned room across from Maou's and his two former demon generals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more odd, was that the person had driven up with a car. Making Lucifer shift his gaze away from the screen of his Laptop, over to near the window. Who did they know that had a car, that would drive here? No one. Right? Or at least, no one to their knowledge yet... When Maou came over, near his spot, to peer out the window, Lucifer didn't bother to at first. Boss had it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, upon hearing the comment's between Maou and Ashiya's comment's, Lucifer's purple orb's finally drifted enough to gaze out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then, he could see what they were talking about. Some man, with Reddish orange hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy definitely isn't all human. And wait...what's that other presence I'm sensing?\" Ashiya came over as well, and sure enough the men rolled out a rather long black crate that one would swear resembled a coffin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, don't tell me we're getting vampires.\" Maou said half joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things quieted down and the ginger haired man's luggage and furniture was moved up into one of the other one room apartments, the trio of demons started to calm down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the doorbell rang for the Maou household. \"Hello! It's your new neighbor!\" A cheerful, young voice declared from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshiya stood up and opened the door to reveal the man they'd seen earlier and just been discussing standing there with a bright smile. \"Oh hello! My name is Richard Morrigan! I've just moved to Japan from America, a pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven just standing in front of the guy, Ashiya could tell this was no ordinary person...the amount of magic he was exuding was more than any of them had managed to conjure up this whole time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like an overflowing well of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is mine, I am Shiro Ashiya.\" Ashiya bowed politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would notice that the man was carrying a small cardboard box. \"Oh, the landlady told me it is Japanese custom to give gifts to new neighbors. I wanted them to be unique to each individual so I inquired to her what your preferences were.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, come right in!\" Ashiya stood out of the way and Richard took notice of the shoes in front of the door, slipping his slip-on sneakers off as that Japanese custom he'd heard about was now confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our new neighbor Richard Morgan.\" Ashiya introduced the ginger haired boy to the room...jumping a bit when the boy excitedly waved a big book of coupons in his face. \"Here ya go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing what it was, Ashiya proceeded to embrace Richard and start bawling: \"Truly you are a WONDERFUL neighbor to consider our grocery expenses!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after, Ashiya bowed quickly to Sadao and proclaimed he was going out shopping...and was running down the street shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou on the other hand causally took the movie. Not knowing what it was right away, he scanned over it. \"Thanks! This will be good if we ever have a movie night or something like that!.\" If one could ever get the entire gang up for it. And a certain one away from the laptop of his. Still, Satan himself was thankful for this gift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucifer glossed over the PC game. Eager to be able to play it later today. By far, this had to be the best gift given. \"Thanks, I've been wanting to play this one, actually. Guess I got lucky, huh?\" He mumbled a little. The purple haired NEET looked up to the man. \"You said your name is Richard, right?\" He asked, to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He kind of didn't care, but, one should at least know the other person's name. \"So, you're staying in the place next door?\" Normally he didn't exactly care too much to strike up a conversation with many others... But he'd be lying if he said the amount of power coming from Richard wasn't intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard nodded, \"Yeah, I am! Me and my roommate actually. He's uh...asleep...he works nights.\" Richard said with a sheepish chuckle.</span></div></div>",

Lucifer glanced at Maou before sighing and putting his chin in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright your a pretty cool neighbor so far, but who are you really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard blinked confused at the question, Maou crossed his arms as he looked over the seemingly human person. \"If your attempting to hide your magic, then your doing a poor job at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired male blinked once more before sighing, after clearing his throat Richard's voice now had a more tired tinge as his eyes dropped as well. \"Well this happened quicker then planned. Guess the gig is up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, thd strands of hair on Richard's head began to fluff up soon having two big fox ears grow, giving his hips a little swing a big poofy tail popped out as well. The foxboy hummed flicking his ears. \"I use Richard as a human name, the real name is Renard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon lord and fallen angel stared in surprise at the site, such power and form must mean this individual is from Ente Isla. But out of the numerous races, a humanoid with fox features wasn't one seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You..are you from Ente Isla as well?\", Maou firmly asked on guard should Ren try anything. Lucifer stood up watching closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen chuckled, throwing his arms behind his head. \"Relax there mighty lord, i actually live here. I just use Richard when dealing with regular life crap, I'm not gonna try and usurp you or any crap. I'm here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got the two confused. \"Huh, how the hell are you gonna help fox head?\", Lucifer asked raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen hummed suddenly extending a finger, a small blue flame sprouted from the tip. \"Unlike your world me and some other paranormal buddies found out how to harness magic without making humans miserable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou felt his eyes widened, a way to gain energy with the negative energy of humans, such a thing was possible? A way for his kind to survive that doesn't involve the suffering of others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foxboy clicked his tongue as he started exiting the room. \"I'll be back in a second i have someone else to join my TED talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucifer grunted in confusion as he thought over the Fox's words. Clearly this couldn't be true, the negativity of others was the only way he and other dark beings could become stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen soon came back in, carrying the coffin from earier in one hand. Standing it up, Ren sighed rubbing his chin. Suddenly the foxboy took a large bite out of his palm, Mauo and Lucifer were surprised by the sudden act of harm. Waving his arm in front of the coffin, it began to shake soon the door to the coffin opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door soon creaked open reveling a black haired pale boy with bat pajamas </span></div></div>",

NO SMUT. This isn't a fetishy story like I normally write. Romance and fade to black sex scenes are fine...but keep in mind this is NOT erotica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Please try to keep the canon anime/etc. characters as in character and as believable as possible. Accuracy to their personalities and lore is KEY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Please write coherently and show some effort. No one liners!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. More than one OC can be introduced! By anyone! Just try to flesh them out and they can be introduced at any time during the plot! If you want you can message me or include a short description of them within their intro chapter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
