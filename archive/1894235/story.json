Your name is David Hansen, you went into the virtual reality center with 2 friends who are a bit of medieval war buffs. Their names were Marvis Halem and Rena Leud, which descriptions of any of them would be pointless since they are going to wear helmets and their personalities would be reflected with the class they are paired with, alright lets go! Also by the chance that their helmets fall off or they have to take off their armor for some reason, then you can describe them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all spawned into a medieval server. The sounds of warfare rang out throughout the battlefield and battle cry's filled the sky with as much steel and blood spilt. You saw that your friends were wearing blue armor with the traditional insignia of which side they belonged to, which was blue with a yellow and blue checkered shield on their chest armor. Marvis was wearing heavy knight gear with a massive axe, mace, and shield on him and Rena wore light-leather armor with a bow, two daggers, and some sort of pot on her hip, in which you could see her cute-little white face with gleaming brown eyes that was about to be wrecked by the bloody battle. You checked your gear to see that you had some medium-armor with a spear, throwing knives, shortsword and a parrying shield which might be the death of you. <br>\r\n\"Okay guys, are you ready?\" You questioned as Rena readied her bow and Marvis had some slight issue with carring his battleaxe <br>\r\n\"I'm good\" Rena replied <br>\r\n\"This is going to take some getting used to, but I'll manage\" Marvis replied <br>\r\n\"Okay then, lets go!\" I yelled as we all moved out into the battlefield that was... </span></div></div>",

For awhile now, the virtual reality facilities has spread all over the world and has become the greatest technilogical innovation in the world for entertainment. I have seen people come in and out of the facilities day and night for quite a while and for some reason I was never interested because I was busy walking the earth alone. This is basically the day that I try out the facility just out of curiosity. My name is...well actually I have forgotten, the wanderer, the loner, the nomad, I have many names, but all I do is survive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was saying, it was nighttime and snowing so there weren't as many people as there was normally, but there were still a couple people going in and out. When I entered the facility it was very futuristic with all the white and screens and whatever the moving floors are called, it looked very impressive aesthetically, but what I really want is how great the system works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scoped out the different signs to decide where I could possibly go to. After contemplating and looking at the different screens for a little bit of time, I decided to enter the zombie room, just because they are a classic and I just want to experiance a true survival horror.

To be more exact, on the long dirt road with very few trees in the surronding area and more of a plain view of the country grasslands, very perfect for spotting zombies, but I kind of worried about some douche hiding somewhere with a sniper rifle waiting to kill an unsuspecting, soon-to-be-dead man and steal their equipment. I checked myself to see that I still had my backpack with me, the black and blue medium-sized backpack that had some standard supplies and the always reliable crowbar, the weapon of a freeman, and a OTs-33 (9X18mm russian machine-pistol) which I still question why I have this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look in one direction to see that there was a nearby barn out in the distance, which would take a short walk through a large cornfield which is just asking to be ambushed, but there might be some useful gear at the farmhouse, that is if it hasn't been ransacked or burned to the ground. In another direction I see the dirtroad leading to a small country town which may include some generic stuff like a diner, gunshop, and psychotic rednecks in jeeps shooting their guns all day long. Although I doubt there would be anything left useful since it was a zombie outbreak, but you never know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to choose fast as I noticed the sun was setting very quickly, so what would it be...take the risk of encountering zombies in the cornfield or take the risk of going to the town to get shot up by some random bandits and probably not get no loot at all. Now that I think about it, either way its more like a, choose my death, sort of way.</span></div></div>",

Something goes wrong and the dinosaurs run amok  devouring anyone they see, get out or become their lunch. Which leads to this, \"GET TO THE CHOPPER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrimal Carnage: Basically humans vs. dinosaurs. Just survive longer than the opposing side or one of two conditions. For the humans, either destroy the dinosaur nest/ Blow the entire island skyhigh or get out using some form of transportaion such as a chopper and boat. For the dinosaurs, devour all the humans on the island or somehow get onto the mainland, reproduce, and take over the mainland...yeah the first one seems more possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreak-in: 4 simple steps. 1. Break into the facility, 2. Get the DNA samples and research 3. Get out 4. Profit. You know the plan seemed alot more easier, but someone seemed to forget to mention the heavy security measures and the fact that someone let the dinosaurs out! </span></div></div>",
