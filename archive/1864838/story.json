            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah is probably what most guys want and what most girls envy. She is very smart. She was the top of her class from preschool to college. She even held the world record for youngest woman with a PhD, earning it at 21. Now twenty five. She has earned a PhD in every science possible. She is scary smart. But that's not what most people focus on when they meet her. Sarah is also incredibly beautiful. She was born with naturally vibrant white hair and her eyes were a dazzling crimson. Most people ask if she dyes it. But its all natural. Her face is stunning as well, with a smile that could cheer up anyones day. Her body is what everyone admires though. Even though she is smart, she still exercises regularly. Altough she was born with a good body, with her workouts, she looked like a goddess. Her hourglass figure did well to accentuate her long sculpted,sexy legs. She also had abs too. But one place on her body refused to lose fat. Try as she might. Her breasts were always big. She was a 36DD and it got her many stares. Sarah also is a ninth degree black belt in karate, tae kwon do, jiu jitsu,and mixed martial arts. Sarah plays seven different instruments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you must think that just hearing all that, sarah has the best of everything. But there is one thing that has always gotten in her way. Sarah is cripplingly shy. When she was a child, the other kids used to make fun of her for her hair and eyes. So she drew into herself. She wanted to show them that she could do just as good as them despite looking like \"a demon\" as they used to say. She dove into her studies, trained herself, to perfection, and mastered everything she tried. But it came at a cost. She barely talked to anyone and avoided everyone, which only got harder for her when puberty hit. Soon every guy. Was trying to hit on her and sarah didn't know what to do. She always wore very conservative clothes, and bury herself in her knowledge, determined to be the best. She now only has a few friends and almost never leaves her nice and beautiful house. But that all changed when she got pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's were this story begins. Sarah was at her house, just finishing up a workout and a training session. She was wearing nothing but workout pants and a training bra. Her long whit hair was in a ponytail and she had earbuds in, listening to AC/DC. \"You've been........THUNDERSTRUCK!\" She sang to the tune. She was always her most happy when she was working out,or anything that helped her get smarter or stronger. In fact, she was almost like a normal person. When she finished, she was covered in a fine layer of perspiration. Sarah looked in the mirror to see the results. \"Yes! I finally finished it!\" She said in pure joy, looking at her well defined abs that could now be called a six pack. \"Now to take a shower and finish my report.\" Sarah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through her shower, she heard her doorbell ring. Sarah quickly got out and put on her favorite outfit. Baggy jeans to hide her glorious chest and a big hoodie to conceal her big breasts. She went to the door and opened it to see........</span></div></div>",

John was in his 70's and lived alone at the farm, his wife having passed away several years ago. From time to time, he's claimed to see lights in the sky over his farm, but not many people believed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his claims, people liked John for his kind nature and life stories. He was always open to people visiting his farm. Sarah visited the farm a number of times, and the two of them were friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I'm surprised to see you here.\" Sarah said. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn frowned. \"Yes. Something arrived at my farm last night. I want a scientist to see it. And you've always been a good friend.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at him. \"Really? You actually have proof of aliens this time?\" She asked. When John nodded, she sighed. \"OK, let me see.\"<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\nAs the two of them walked up to John's farm, John was explaining what happened. Apparently, he had been tending to his chickens when something entered his barn. Going over to check, he saw something he couldn't quite explain. Deciding not to touch it, he tried to call the military, but he couldn't get through, so he came to Sarah instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked up to the barn doors. John grabbed the latch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" He asked. Sarah nodded. John pulled the latch and opened the barn door. That's when Sarah's eyes went wide. Inside was...</span></div></div>",

But never in a million years did she ever expect to see a real life UFO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet right there, in John's barn, was one such UFO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe UFO looked like any flying saucer Sarah had seen in fiction: a large, silver, football-shaped object. Four metallic legs were sticking out of holes in the bottom of the craft, holding it up. There were no windows anywhere on the craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't believe it.\" Sarah said, utterly stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just as amazed as you are.\" John said. \"After all these years of seein' lights and hearin' things, I've got an actual UFO sitting in my barn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah barely heard him as she walked up to the craft. Her mind was racing with all the possibilites. All the potential contacts, the new technology, the chance to work with species from beyond the stars. She was so distracted by her own thoughts she didn't even realize she reached out to touch the craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah! Wait!\" John yelled. But it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's hands made contact with the craft. And in a flash of light, she vanished.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nIt took a few moments for Sarah to regain her sight, but when she did, she was amazed at the site before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have been inside the spacecraft, because she was surrounded by technology the likes of which she had never seen. Some of it looked familiar, like computers, but much of it was completely unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noticed that, despite the outside of the ship being only the size of a large shed, the inside was somehow MUCH larger inside, nearly the size of a football field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... this is... incredible!\" Sarah said, amazed by everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you love it, human.\" A voice said behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes widened. Was that was she thought it was? Excitement filling her heart, she turned and saw...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah was expecting any type of alien to be behind her: little green men, Nordic aliens, reptilians, greys, anything really. When she turned to look at the owner of the voice, she saw that it was a grey alien. And it was also one of the sexiest beings she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey was undeniably female. She was Sarah's height, with a smooth, bald, slightly enlarged cranium, large solid black eyes, a total lack of nose or ears, and full red lips. All of that was before Sarah saw her incredible body. The alien had breasts the size of beach balls that seemed to defy gravity, a tight waist, hips as wide as a door frame, basketball sized buttcheeks, and long legs with thick thighs. The alien woman was wearing a skin-tight silver space-suit with heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you like my body, human?\" The alien woman asked. Even her voice was dripping with sex appeal. \"I used to be stick-thin like others of my species, but I decided that I wanted to be a full on sex goddess. So I used my tech and... well, the results were stunning. Even better? All this beauty is permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah did hear all that, but she barely registered any of it. She was too busy staring at the alien's insane curves. Sarah never told anyone, but she had a fetish for insanely curvy bodies. It took here nearly a minute to finally tear her eyes away from the alien's boobs and look at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-welcome to E-Earth.\" Sarah stammered. \"I'm S-Sarah. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien woman smiled and walked up to Sarah. Well, more \"sashayed\", as her hips swung like a pendulum and her boobs bounced like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Zeena.\" The woman replied. \"And I'm so happy to have met you. Just looking at you, I would love to have you as part of my little group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's brain finally reset. Group? What was she talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain.\" Zeena said. \"As you've probably noticed, this ship is FAR larger on the inside then it is out. A bit of tech my species traded for. I love to just travel the universe, going from one planet to the next, but a ship this large needs a crew. So, I've hired some women from other species to help me with the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Sarah said. \"Why would you want me to join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only accept brilliant, beautiful women on my crew. When you were teleported into my ship, it immediately gathered all available data on you. And you certainly are an incredible mind, Sarah.\" Zeena explained. \"So, I offer you the chance to explore the universe with me and my crew. And I always make sure to treat my crew with respect and love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah mused on the suggestion for a minute. This sounded a little too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a catch to this?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeena giggled. \"You catch on quick.\" She said. \"There is one little requierment to being part of my crew. Every single woman onboard my ship is pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah raised an eyebrow. \"Pregnant?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeena nodded. \"Heavily pregnant. Every crew member besides me, from the pilots to the medical crew, have huge gravid bellies. Some bigger then others. And the best part is, you don't have to worry about taking care of kids, because no one on this ship gives birth. Once you're pregnant, you remain pregnant for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And why is that? Is there some super important reason for that?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually personal preference.\" Zeena answered. \"I find pregnant women to be incredibly sexy. I just adore the site of big round bellies in skin-tight space-suits.\" She sighed. \"So, would you like to join my crew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah thought for a moment. This was definately a bizarre request. She would love to see the universe, but would she really want to be pregnant for the rest of her life? After a minute of mental debating, Sarah...</span></div></div>",

She had breasts larger than her own nearing the size a watermelons and what really took her back was the bean back sized pregnant belly and it was glowing red with the ever so small bulges that caused the rest of her to jiggle. She face was feature less only having black slanted eyes and full lips, her head was large as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thankful for that fact the alien hadn\u2019t taken notice of her being awake. it was busy taping away at a small tablet and from her angle it show her body\u2019s image.

Praying it will leave her alone, as it lean closer to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the alien reached toward her face before a blaring noise ranged out and as fast as it came it stopped.

It felt nice and warm actually thinking to herself but it then felt weird tugging as it pull away,her arm almost went with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes again she saw it\u2019s swaying rear waddle toward a door and leave.

But then she walked up to get a closer look. To Sarah's surprise, it really was an alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was around 6 feet tall. Her skin was a deep shade of purple, she had short orange hair with two antenna sticking out, six pairs of arms, what looked like hooves for feet, and a lizard like tail laying off to the side. She was clad in a tight, silver space suit. The suit lacked gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing Sarah noticed was that the woman was very pregnant. She looked to be around full term with quadruplets. Her belly was almost the size of a beach ball. Her breasts looked to be about K cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't dare wake her up or touch her.\" John said, staying near the barn door. \"Don't know what might have happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at the alien woman for a minute, before finally deciding to gently wake her up. She stood next to the alien, and gently started speaking. \"Miss, wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the alien opened her eyes. Sarah could see her eyes were solid white. The alien gently rose, placing two of her six hands under her belly, and took in her surroundings. She looked at John, then at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien opened her mouth, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth. Sarah initially thought the alien wanted to eat her, but instead a sound came out of the aliens mouth. It sounded like a cross between a pipe organ and a trumpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to speak to me?\" Sarah asked. \"I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien looked at Sarah, then pulled a device out of her spacesuits pocket. It looked like a tuning fork. She tapped the fork to her head, then spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies.\" The alien said, now speaking English with British accent. \"I've only just arrived on this planet. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled. Actual alien contact. \"My name is Sarah. Over there is John Kylan. This is Earth.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth?\" The alien asked. \"I've heard of this planet before. Surprised to be on it. My name is difficult to pronounce in any language other then mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we need a name.\" Sarah said. \"Why don't we call you Stella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien blinked. \"Is that a joke?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, how about Leah then?\" Sarah suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien nodded. \"Leah sounds good. For as long as I am on Earth, I am Leah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Sarah said. \"Now, let's get you out of this barn.\" With that, she reached for one of Leah's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Don't-\" Leah tried to warn her, but it was too late. Sarah grabbed her upper right arm, and immediatly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\" Leah said. \"Mr. Kylan, please fetch some Oxidane.\" John blinked. Leah sighed. \"Water.\" John nodded and walked to his house. Leah looked at Sarah. \"She will be surprised when she wakes up.\"<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\nAn hour later, Sarah finally came to. Looking up, she saw Leah and John staring at her. Sarah tried to get up, but felt something pin her down. Looking, she was shocked to find that her belly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah couldn't believe what she was seeing. Her belly had blown up to equal the size of Leah's belly. Her breasts had also swollen in size too, about three sizes bigger then Leah's. Though she couldn't see it, her butt and thighs and blown up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?!\" Sarah shouted, now freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to warn you, but I didn't get the chance.\" Leah said, looking sheepish. She and John then helped Sarah into a sitting position. John then handed Sarah a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please explain why I'm so bloated all of a sudden?\" Sarah asked, sipping the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit odd.\" Leah said. \"When pregnant women of my species, Muserians, come into contact with a female of another species, the other female becomes pregnant as well, with the same number of babies and at the same size. No matter the species, the babies are always Muserians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this.\" Sarah said. \"I'm pregnant with aliens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah nodded. \"There is at least one good thing. You won't be giving birth until I do.\" She explained. \"And our pregnancies aren't 9 months. And before you ask, I know the length of human pregnancies because I've studied Earth culture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I won't be pregnant for long?\" Sarah asked. Leah looked away, almost ashamed. Sarah was concerned. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah looked back at her. \"Muserian pregnancies last for 30 Earth years. I've only been pregnant for one Earth year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes bugged out. \"I'm going to be pregnant for 29 years?!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I tried to warn you.\" Leah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can believe I'm seeing this.\" John said, bewildered. \"All this time, I was right about aliens being real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah just looked at him. \"Amazing. Help me stand up.\" She said. Slowly, John and Leah stood her up. Now standing, Sarah placed one hand under her massive belly, and the other on her back. \"I need to get home. Call some friends.\" She started waddling our of the barn, before Leah stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you have to take me with you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Sarah asked, looking at her confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because once a pregnant Muserian comes into contact with a female, their souls become permanently fused together.\" Leah said. Sarah looked at her bewildered. Leah sighed. \"Muserians call psychic energy \"souls\". Your \"soul\" is now permanently fused with mine. I can tell what you're thinking and feeling, and vice versa. There's only one catch. For the remainder of our pregnancies, we must remain within 15 feet of each other. Exceed that, and we both develop extremely painful headaches until we reunite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blinked. \"That's a lot to take in.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I must sound long-winded.\" Leah said. \"Good news is, once out pregnancies end, we no longer must stay together. Our souls will be fused forever, but at least we can part ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Sarah said. \"Well, then, I guess I'm bringing you with me.\" She then turned to John. \"Bye, John.\" With that, Sarah and Leah waddled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stood there for a moment. Then he looked up at the sky. \"Eileen, if your up there watching, I'm just as confused as you are.\" He said.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\nThankfully, Sarah and Leah were able to take back roads to avoid being seen. Eventually they reached Sarah's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, home sweet home.\" Sarah said. \"So, can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Leah said.<br>\r\nSarah then asked...</span></div></div>",

I'll tell you many things.\" She said. \"Let's get inside and sit first. My legs are tired from carrying all this bulk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah agreed and unlocked the front door. Opening in, she walked in, her massive belly just barely fitting through the door. Leah followed suit. Sarah led Leah to the kitchen. As Leah sat, the chair creaking under her pregnant weight, Sarah waddled to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a drink? Or rather, can you drink Earth drinks?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just go with water. And first Muserian fact: we have water on our planet.\" Leah said. Sarah nodded and grabbed two water bottles. She passed one to Leah, and sat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly are Muserians?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah smiled. \"Muserians hail from the planet Dennick XV.\" She started, pronouncing the XV. \"We share it with about 20 other alien species. Muserians are long lived, have a lifespan in the thousands. The males actually look almost exactly human, save the purple skin. Females are more exotic looking, like me. We can consume the food of other species, but not tomatoes. Those are toxic to us. As you've probably realized, I can breath this atmosphere. Dennick XV is surprisingly like Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'So if needed, humans can go there.</i>' Sarah thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>They can. But we prefer studying them.</i>' Leah's voice said in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was shocked. \"How did-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're bonded, remember?\" Leah cut her off. \"I can hear your thoughts, and you can hear mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Muserian culture is interesting.\" Leah continued. \"We base our culture on music. To non-Muserians, our speech is like instruments. We've devoted much research to new music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating.\" Sarah said, intrigued. Muserians sounded so artistic. \"Now... what about this?\" She motioned to Leah's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Muserian women get pregnant through skin contact with non-related Muserians or other species. Though only adults. The one who impregnated me is a lovely Muserian woman who's name is, like mine, hard to pronounce. We remain pregnant for 30 years, then give birth.\" Leah explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Sarah said. \"And you're having quads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah blushed. \"Um, no actually. Don't hate me for saying this. I'm only in my first trimester... with 12.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blanked for a moment, trying to process what Leah just said. Finally, she found her voice. \"...12?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muserian pregnancies are fairly large.\" Leah said. \"And they aren't done growing. They don't stop growing until the beginning of the third trimester, which starts in 4 months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>We'll be huge by then!</i>' Sarah thought, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Sorry. I wasn't planning on meeting you.</i>' Leah mentally replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need to get used to the whole mind reading thing.\" Sarah said. Leah just grinned.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Leah first impregnated Sarah, our young human hero didn't have the opportunity to feel what it was like to have her womb swell and expand, adding a dozen alien embryos to her otherwise unused uterus. At Leah's first touch, Sarah lost consciousness and had to be carried back to her home to grow in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just now, as Sarah was talking with Leah and expressing her discomfort with the mind-bond she and the Muserian woman shared, there was a sudden thrust from inside her enormous belly. With a small groan, Sarah shifted in her seat and placed one hand on her bare belly, feeling it get tighter and tighter. Her hand was pushed back as Sarah expanded right before her very eyes, becoming rounder and larger. Her legs spread to make room for the growing pregnancy, now reaching out past her knees. With Sarah's long fitness regiment, she had the flexibility to handle such an unexpected increase but it was still shocking to see herself get so much larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, Sarah was preposterously big. It was like her belly was a whole separate part of her body, pulsing as her heartbeat made a few blue veins on its surface throb until it settled down, making her belly still as smooth and unblemished as the rest of her pale skin. In the midst of the confusion, Sarah didn't notice the uptick in her breasts either, now the size of volleyballs. As she shifted forward to accommodate her new weight, she could feel her butt grow as well, nearly trapping her in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Sarah yelped. As she looked over herself, she turned her head to Leah to see, surprisingly, the purple woman was now equally as big as she was, with a nervous look on her face. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried this might happen,\" Leah sighed, petting her gigantic belly with her left three hands, right two hands, and stroking her chin with the remaining sixth. \"I mean, when I saw you, I had a feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A feeling? What feeling?\" Sarah gulped. Suddenly, fears from her childhood flooded back, when people called her a freak and a demon for her white hair and red eyes. Could they have been right? Was she, like Leah, not...not human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nothing like that</i> Leah communicated through her thoughts. While Leah's speaking voice was pretty, her mental voice had a soothing, cooing quality to it. Sarah still didn't like her thoughts being read but if anyone had to do it, Leah was one of her better options. \"No, all I meant was you are very...fertile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blinked once. \"Fertile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, knowing human biology, your body type suggested that you were, well...\" Leah's hands gestured an exaggerated hourglass shape. \"So your natural fertility kicked in and is increasing the number of Muserians you're carrying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you bigger too?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah smiled. \"Our souls are linked, remember.\" She waddled over to Sarah and placed one hand on her guest's belly. \"We're in this together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, be careful!\" Sarah shouted, trying to back up but ended up picking the chair up with her as it stuck on her larger rear. \"You don't want to get me pregnant again, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work that way, Sarah,\" Leah smiled, taking Sarah's hand in her own. \"The link is already formed. I can't re-impregnate you.\" She chuckled. \"If anything, you're the one who just impregnated me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Sarah squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Muserians love being mothers,\" Leah sighed, looking down at her belly and wrapping all of her arms around it. She was tall and had a long reach but even she couldn't get around quite all of her expanded womb. \"I've never actually...been pregnant before so to carry this many for the first time is exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never been pregnant before? You made it sound like this is an everyday thing for your species,\" Sarah said, straining the pull the chair off of her butt, flexing her thick arms. \"You've had thousands of years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's mouth dropped and her antennae perked up. \"How rude. I don't look that old, do I?\" Sarah blushed, not meaning to offend Leah. If anything, she looked the same age as Sarah, though the purple skin made that a little tricky to judge. \"Thank you for the apology,\" Leah said, clearly scanning Sarah's mind again. \"I'm only 101 years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look a day over a century,\" Sarah sighed, putting both hands on her hips and trying to stretch out. \"Why did you wait so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I had to find the right partner</i> Leah thought. This time, Sarah picked up on it and looked perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Right partner?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah sighed and nodded. \"Guess I shouldn't try to hide anything from you. See, Sarah, humans may not travel beyond their own planet much but in space, hundreds upon hundreds of alien races interact all the time and Muserians are born from all kinds of different peoples. But I...I didn't want to bond my soul with just anyone. Space is so serious and dire and then I learned about humans.\" She turned to Sarah and smiled. \"I had never heard such beautiful music from any other species, aside from other Muserians. And while you're mostly primitive and, on the whole, not that bright, I thought a quaint little planet might be just the place to settle down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you came here looking to get someone pregnant?\" Sarah said, feeling a little uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I just wanted to do a survey here,\" Leah said quickly. \"But I should have taken more classes on ship maintenance. I had engine failure when I got hit with too much solar radiation from your yellow sun on my last trip and couldn't take off. I thought that barn was a quiet place to rest and wait but...apparently not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently not,\" Sarah sighed and nodded. \"Well, we're here together now. How much do you know about humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned a lot of biology and enough of your language to be able to translate myself,\" Leah said. \"And I love listening to music. Other than that, I don't know much about society.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both,\" Sarah mumbled, pressing one hand into the small of her back to push her belly out. It touched against Leah's equally big stomach and the purple woman grinned. \"So, make yourself at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Leah said, now looking a little confused. \"Why do you say that now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go into work at the lab,\" Sarah said, waddling toward her bedroom to get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm coming too,\" Leah said, following Sarah into her room. Sarah quickly covered up her naked chest as Leah stuck her head in. \"We can't be more than 15 feet apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...right,\" Sarah repeated, pursing her lips. \"Huh...how is this going to work?\"</span></div></div>",

And people wouldn't react well to an alien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that.\" Leah said. \"I can fix that.\" On that, she reached into her pocket and pulled out what looked like a flute. Playing a short melody on it, the air around Leah rippled. It ended quickly, but Sarah saw the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah now appeared human. Her orange hair turned dark brown, her white eyes gained blue irises and pupils, her antenna and four of her six arms vanished, her hooves became feet, and her skin became tan. Her clothes also shifted to a silver tube top and baggy jeans. Her belly, though remained the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" Sarah asked, amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camo flute.\" Leah replied, holding up the flute. \"It lets me disguise my appearance. But only for 5 hours at a time. These things don't hold much of a charge. And before you ask, I have this so I can study Earth culture without people screaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible technology.\" Sarah said. In her mind though, she thought '<i>Wow. She's hot as a human!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Why thank you.</i>' Leah replied mentally. '<i>I felt an asthetically pleasing form would help me blend in better.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never going to get used to that.\" Sarah said. \"Just, if we do go out, don't touch anymore women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah laughed. \"Don't worry. The touch only works once. If I touch another woman, nothing will happen.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Sarah said. \"One last question. Could I use that thing to disguise my belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah shook her head. \"Nope. Only works on Muserians. Sorry. I'm sure you'll find a way to explain this behemoth.\" She said, placing a hand on Sarah's belly.<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" Sarah said. \"Well, I'll show you the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that, Sarah and Leah waddled off to the lab, Leah deactivating her disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\nFor the next few hours, Sarah and Leah stayed in the lab. During that time, Leah proved very helpful, having a great knowledge on many sciences. Though actually working was tough with two enormous bellies getting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two left the lab. As they walked down the hall, the phone rang. Sarah waddled over and picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Sarah asked. \"Oh, Maria. What's going on? Wait, really? Now? But I- Maria, I'm kind of tied up at the moment, can't- Alright fine. See you in an hour.\" Sarah then hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" Leah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria Bennet. My supervisor.

They think I'm flighty or not serious or too weird to actually keep on. So I end up working in a lot of little labs in the back by myself to tinker away on projects no one else wants to take. They look at me like a...\" Sarah dropped her head and touched one hand against her oversized belly. \"a freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah sighed and placed one hand on the back of Sarah's neck. \"I think I can sympathize. I'm an outsider here too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why my work with Maria is important. She sees me as a real scientist and if our work goes well, I could start getting some real assignments and get grants to start on things that interest me and try to do some good for the world,\" Sarah said, struggling to get out the door. \"Now, let's hurry. Maria's lab is on the other side of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't take an hour for humans to get from one side of a city to the other,\" Leah chuckled. \"I know you don't have teleportation or hover vehicles but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but most humans aren't slowed down by all of this,\" Sarah said, pushing her hips out to emphasize her pregnant gut. \"I'm sure that's more common on Dennick XV but you must have noticed it's rare here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I forgot,\" Leah sighed, smacking her forehead lightly. \"Researching humans and trying to work in human society are two very different things.\" As Leah stepped outside with Sarah and looked for the nearest bus stop, she let out a little laugh. \"And yes, on Dennick, the streets are crowded with bellies, many a lot bigger than we are now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed. \"That must make it hard to get around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, we've gotten used to it,\" Leah said, glancing over at the bus stop's crowd. \"Our pregnancies must really be unusual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sarah laughed nervously. \"Why do you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone is staring at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's blush got even darker as she crossed her arms against her chest and tried to make her body smaller. \"T-that's not the only reason they're staring,\" Sarah whispered. She was all too used to people looking in disbelief at her hair and eyes, and as she got older, her voluptuous body. She knew this strange, alien pregnancy would take some time to get used to but Sarah was definitely not happy that it was giving people a new excuse to stare at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah silently scanned Sarah's mind, their linked souls making it easy, and she responded inside Sarah's head. <i>You are uncomfortable with being sexualized</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's a long story</i> Sarah said, whimpering even in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm sorry, I did not mean to add onto your burden with all of...this</i>. One of Leah's human-disguised tan hands traced her belly, slowly stroking her curves. <i>They are staring at me too if that makes you feel better</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah cracked a small smile. <i>I told you your human look was hot</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if it would be unethical for me to have sex with a human while I'm here</i> Leah wondered, suddenly looking surprised and turning to Sarah. <i>Oh...right...you can hear that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not so fun when it happens to you, huh?</i> Sarah thought, smiling and raising an eyebrow just as the bus pulled up. Even with its large doors, Sarah and Leah had trouble squeezing their way on, resulting in groans from the bus driver and some passengers, as well as a few gasps. There were enough empty seats for both super-pregnant women to sit down and their tops rolled up as soon as they did. Sarah got flustered and tried unsuccessfully to pull her shirt back down over her bare belly while Leah was content to show off her tan stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend isn't as shy about her belly,\" a middle-aged woman said to Sarah with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's common on my...where I'm from,\" Leah said with a big grin back. \"But you're right, my friend has not been around expectant women as much as me.\" Leah reached over to give Sarah's exposed belly a light rub before trying to help pull her shirt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have very nice skin. You shouldn't be afraid to show your stomach off,\" the woman said to Sarah again. \"When I had my children, I had so many stretch marks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss having my abs,\" Sarah said. \"I worked hard for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed. \"Well those will make it easy when it comes to delivery, trust me. And that'll come before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow it feels like I have a long time before then,\" Sarah sighed, patting the top of her stomach as she turned to Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, it feels that way too sometimes,\" the woman smiled, standing up as the bus came to its next stop. \"Good luck to both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" they said in unison, Leah looking happier about the interaction than Sarah. \"What are stretch marks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When pregnant women's stomach expand, their skin gets marks sometimes as it struggles to grow and stretch out,\" Sarah replied. \"They don't have that with Muserians?\" Leah shook her head. \"Lucky you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter multiple stops, the bus stopped at the university where Maria Bennet worked. Both women wobbled and waddled off the bus steps as they made their way inside. Sarah tried to be fast and hide her enormous pregnant middle behind desks and tables whenever she got near a receptionist or other employee who would recognize her. She noticed quite a few stare directly at her breasts and scoff and once, Sarah heard a clerk turn to a friend and whisper. \"I knew they had to be fake. She just got another upgrade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah got to her locker and put on her lab coat which no longer covered her chest or reached beyond the increased bulge of her butt; wrapping around her pregnant belly was a hopeless cause from the start. Leah had to settle for some backup clothes Sarah had in her locker to make her look a little more professional. They went into the main lab, thankfully empty, and Sarah got started on her work while Leah flipped through some textbooks and folders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See anything interesting?\" Sarah chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. This is all very basic,\" Leah said frankly, putting the notes down. \"But I'm trying not to be judgmental of human endeavors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice of you,\" Sarah said, adjusting her eyes in a microscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah,\" Maria said in a booming voice. Sarah quickly whipped away from the microscope to look at her supervisor standing in the middle of the lab. Maria Bennet was in her mid-30s, with dark brown skin, long black hair, thick red lips, and a pair of onyx eyes that could look right through anyone's heart. She was fair but very, very tough and with that gaze, no one could stand up to her or give her any bullshit. \"I see you brought a guest to a classified lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, Dr. Bennet,\" Sarah stammered, slowly making her way off the stool and making her gigantic belly shake in the process. \"This is...Dr. Leah. We met at a lamaze class and...w-well I was on the way back and she was with me and we share a ride and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm, keep going,\" Maria grumbled, putting her hands on her hips. Sarah felt a bead of sweat travel down the back of her neck, feeling Maria's scrutiny fall on her. \"I wasn't going to ask about the pregnancy either since that's your personal life but now I feel like I should find out a little about that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Sarah started to say before Leah waddled forward and stuck out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Leah Muserian, PhD in astrophysics and non-organic chemistry,\" Leah smiled. \"I thought you had some interesting work here. Had you considered this too?\" Leah scribbled something quickly on a sheet of paper and handed it to Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate your interest but this is a closed lab and...\" Maria stopped in place when she looked at the paper. \"This...this is a formula to make triple-bonded lithium. That's impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah shrugged. \"Eh. Look through it and see what you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was quiet as she read, pacing over to her own desk. \"Very interesting, Dr. Muserian. Though that hair is against university dress code.\" Sarah turned and flinched. Leah's hair was back to its short orange look. \"But, Sarah, we should get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Sarah squeaked, waddling over to the white board as Maria wrote out the day's work. \"Oh, I had some ideas to unlock this problem here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where, with the heat loss issue?\" Maria said, pointing one formula on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, well that too, but I meant over here,\" Sarah said, reaching over. As she went to point, she accidentally touched Maria on her bare arm and-</span></div></div>",

That happens with some members of various species where one member seems to be more compatible with our kind than others. You will still look the same but you gained my kinds abilities including that one. Needless to say she is now in the same boat as ours and she should be about to show right about... Now.\" As she finished that Maria suddenly started growing to the same size as Sarah and Leah in a matter of minutes. Maria said, \"Sarah! Did you-\" before being cut off by Sarah's voice suddenly started resonating in her mind, \"No I did not inject you with some sort of chemical that caused your body to do this. Sigh might as well come clean since you're in the same boat I'm in now.\" And explained what happened. Afterwards Maria was in shock. She calmed down quick and said, \"I'm surprised that Leah is an alien and hmm? That flute, looks like its made of another material. Leah would you kindly hand that to me?\" And Leah did so. Maria decided to take a close look at it and noticed an area that could be improved on it. Leah was confused at first but when Maria finished she decided to play the flute and discovered it sounded better now due to the improvement. Maria said, \"Knowing we are on the same boat now I have a bad feeling if news of you leaks out you will likely become the target of unwanted people.\" Leah was confused but after an explanation of what would possibly happen realized that things could be disastrous if news of her not being of this world came out.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah had so far accepted the fact that she was pregnant because she touched an alien. It seemed like something straight out of Star Trek or Doctor Who, but she accepted it nontheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened now just plain baffled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her arm brushed against Maria's, Sarah grunted and clutched her stomach. Looking down, she saw her belly was expanding again. Slowly but surely, it grew, gaining a few more inches. Sarah's breasts grew too, gaining about two more cup sizes. Her butt also blew up too, gaining about five more inches.<br>\r\nEventually, the growing stopped. Maria looked at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I-\" Sarah started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growth spurt, huh? My sister had to deal with those when she was pregnant. Said she was the size of a whale when she was done.\" Maria said. Just then, her pager went of. \"Crap. I'll be right back.\" On that, she left the lab. Sarah looked over at Leah, who had also grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leah, what the HELL just happened?\" Sarah said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah, however, had a look of confusion. \"I... I don't know. I've never seen this happen before.\" She said. \"I think we just got a set of twins on top of all the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Sarah said. \"Wait, are we bonded with Maria too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah closed her eyes, then opened them again after a few seconds. \"No. I can't sense her thoughts or feelings. And she just left. If she was bonded, she'd clutching her head in pain. Also, if we were bonded, wouldn't she be pregnant too?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah agreed. Then she realized something. \"Leah, how long do you have left on that disguise?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah pulled out her Camo Flute and checked. \"About an hour. Though this thing's always been glitchy. Didn't you notice my disguise was back on even though I turned it off before we went into your home lab?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't.\" Sarah said. Then Maria returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, there was a fire in Lab 4-H. Mira's got it under control now.\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed when Maria mentioned Mira's name. Mira Crane was one of the medical researchers in charge of tissue regrowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>You are attracted to this Mira?</i>' Leah asked Sarah mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Um, well, yes. You see-</i>' Sarah started to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SARAH!\" Maria's yell pulled Sarah back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.\" She said. \"I got distracted. So, um, let's get back to the project. I'm concerned about the plasma discharges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>We'll discuss Mira and figure out this growth spurt thing later.</i>' Sarah told Leah mentally.<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, just past The Moon's orbit, a small ship was flying. It resembled a silver football. Inside was another Muserian. This one had green hair, solid black eyes, and lilac skin. She wasn't pregnant, but instead had an exaggerated hourglass figure, with enormous boobs and huge butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can't believe she went this far.' The Muserian thought. 'I knew she wanted to study humans, but I didn't think she'd actually go to Earth. Well, don't leave yet. Your big sister's coming to get you.' She leaned forward to get a better look at Earth, only for her boobs to press against the panel. 'Geez, I wish you two would stop growing along with my ass. At this rate, I won't fit in my ship!'<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nBack on Earth, in the lab, the three were just finishing up. Leah proved helpful, earning Maria's respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Dr. Muserian, I'm glad you came after all.\" Maria said. \"I'm a hard woman to impress, and you've managed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah started to say something, but stopped when she saw...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She already reverted back to her short orange hair but now, two antennae were starting to stick out of Leah's tan skin. Panicking, Sarah looked around the lab until she found a scrap of cloth that could work as a handkerchief. In a flash, Sarah fashioned it into a headband and slipped it over Leah's head, slicking her antennae back and hiding them from Maria's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch,\" Leah winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Sarah said with a wince of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Maria asked, turning to look at both of them. Leah wasn't sure what to said and stuck with stroking her pregnant belly, which had grown twice that day already and now made her and Sarah look almost perfectly round, with several feet of smooth stomach jutting out from their bodies. \"You're having contractions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's face flushed. It was bad enough having everyone see she was pregnant but at her size, questions about her due date were bound to come up soon. \"N-no, just a little cramp,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria narrowed her eyes. \"Can't she tell me herself if she's having a cramp or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped. There was Maria's bullshit detector again. \"N-no, I mean yes, but I just know what she's going through.\" Sarah started to rub her own belly in exaggerated, wide strokes now. Since her latest growth spurt from touching Maria, all of her belly from the navel down was now exposed under her work shirt. \"At this size, it's all very tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few investigative glances, Maria's face relaxed and she broke what could almost be considered a smile. \"I see, I'm sorry. Never had the <u>privilege</u> of carrying a child myself,\" Maria said, a hint of condescension in her voice. \"But congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, thank you,\" Sarah started to say. \"But I'm actually a...a surrogate!\" <i>Good one, Sarah</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're right!</i> Leah mentally replied. \"Yes, she's a surrogate. She's carrying my babies,\" Leah said with a big grin. The air was practically sucked out of the room as Sarah and Maria both looked bewildered at Leah. The red-eyed beauty was so stunned and worried she didn't even have thoughts for Leah to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Maria eventually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's smile started to fade as she read their expressions. \"Oh, what I mean is, I'm working on a research trial for women who aren't able to conceive and Sarah here agreed to be part of the study.\" Leah placed one hand on each of their bellies and gave them a light pat. \"I call them all 'my babies' as a bit of slang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute,\" Maria chuckled. Leah laughed back, flashing her full set of sharp teeth. \"Dr Muserian...\" Maria started to say, squinting before Leah closed her mouth. \"Sorry, you must just have braces. I thought I saw something odd in your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just braces,\" Sarah said quickly, giving Leah's belly a fast rub as she guided her out of the lab. \"Anyway, good day's work, I think. These cramps are getting awfully tight so we should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked at her phone for the time and nodded. \"Very productive. Dr. Muserian, I don't fully agree with your methods but I'd welcome you back in the lab to talk about some of these ideas of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I think you'll be seeing a lot of me,\" Leah smiled, wincing again as she clutched her head. \"Ow, that really hurts Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Headache and cramps on your belly? You should get home,\" Maria nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure thing,\" Sarah said, using her strong arms to lift Leah once they were out the door and hurried down the hallway. \"Leah!\" she squeaked. \"Y-your disguise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, running out of time on the disguise,\" Leah said, looking at the back of her hand as her skin started getting darker and darker. \"I can feel my hooves starting to return. These shoes aren't going to fit much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get you to the car and go back to my home,\" Sarah said. \"Nothing's stopping me from getting there.\" Just as Sarah said that, Mira Crane stepped around the corner and was nearly bowled over by Sarah's big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira, half Japanese and half Irish, looked over the scene in front of her with her glinting violet eyes. Her co-worker, Sarah, who was a shy but brilliant scientist with washboard abs just yesterday, was running down the hall with a pregnant belly the size of blue ribbon pumpkin while carrying an equally pregnant woman with weird hair and what looked like purple-tinged skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" Mira said as Sarah skidded to a stop and put Leah back down. \"Um...hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's face turned as red as Leah was purple once she saw eye to eye with Mira. \"H-hi Mira,\" Sarah said, breathing quickly. \"This is just...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Less talk, more walk</i>, Leah pleaded, the sides of her shirt starting to bulge as her other arms grew back. <i>What's the story with this woman?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mira</i> Sarah thought back, frozen in place. <i>Mira</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There's that human dopiness I've seen so much</i> Leah sighed, putting one arm around Sarah's shoulders and guiding her out of the lab. \"Sorry miss, we've got a doctor's appointment we can't miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, okay,\" Mira said with a little chuckle. \"Sarah, maybe you can give me a call later if you want to explain what exactly this was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Sarah squeaked, burying her face in her hands as Leah got her back around the corner. \"I can't believe that. Mira saw...me...all of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know when you said, or thought, you'd talk about Mira later?\" Leah said as she helped Sarah into her car. \"I think you should make that tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as Sarah and Leah were having their own discussions, Mira Crane was back in her home, sitting alone at her kitchen table with a warm mug of tea in her hand. She was listening to the music bump on the radio in between interviews and twirling her long black hair in her hands. Every now and then, her arm and elbow would bump against her swollen breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Sarah, Mira was blessed with an abundantly curvy body, though without Sarah's unique eyes and hair, nor her athletic physique. Mira wasn't as busty or bottom-heavy as Sarah but then again, few were. A few people had joked with Mira that she was working in \"tissue regrowth\" because that's how she got her chest as big as it was but that was all genes. Mira wanted to use her scientific know-how to really help people...though she'd be lying if she didn't have a rapid cosmetic growth formula in the back of her notes somewhere, thought up as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pouted out her pink lips, looking down into her mug, she heard a sudden bang in the sky. Mira looked up just in time to see a ship, shaped like a large metal bullet streak through the night sky and land in her neighborhood. As Mira walked out to see whatever it was and where it landed, she saw it was in-</span></div></div>",

Heading back into her house, Mira wondered what she saw. Was it a meteorite? Space debris? Or maybe a UFO? She'd have to ask around tomorrow to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a few miles away in the woods, the craft had crashed. It's side opened, and Leah's sister staggered out before falling on the ground, her boobs cushioning her fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, you girls are good for something.' She thought. Shakily, she stood up and looked around. 'OK, so now I'm on Earth. Hopefully, finding my sister won't take long. I should probably translate to the local language first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that, she pulled a tuning fork out of the pocket of her silver spacesuit. She tapped it on her head, then put it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing, testing. I am an alien.\" Leah's sister said in English with a Scottish accent. \"Good. Now, time to find my sis.\" On that, she walked off.<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\nRewinding a little bit, and going back with Sarah and Leah, the two of them pulled up to Sarah's house and, as quickly as they could, waddled into the house. They just barely managed to squeeze in when Leah's disguise turned off, and she reverted to her normal Muserian appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too close.\" Sarah said as she and Leah waddled into the living room. The two of them sat on the couch, the poor piece of furniture creaking under the combined pregnant weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Leah replied, rubbing her belly. \"I really need to fix my Camo Flute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more worried about that growth spurt earlier.\" Sarah said, placing both hands on her giant belly. \"Why did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah frowned. \"I wish I knew. There's never been a record of this happening with Muserian's before. So probably best you don't touch anyone else, unless we both want to end up all belly.\" She said. \"But let's not focus on that now. I'd like to know more about Mira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. \"Mira's a year older then me. She's working on tissue regrowth. It's mainly to help soldiers who lost limbs or other body parts in war. I first met her the day I joined the lab.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you fell in love with here there?\" Leah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed. \"It honestly felt like love at first sight. Mira's the one who helped me understand the lab. She's always so nice, and understanding. I never worked up the courage to ask her out. And now, with this...\" She said, patting her belly. \"I don't know if she'd ever date me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah set one of her six hands on Sarah's belly. \"I'm sure she would.\" She said. \"Now, just one last question, and don't be embarrassed: are you Bi?\" Leah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head. \"Full lesbian.\" She said. Then she glanced at the clock. \"Oh boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah cocked her head. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late.\" Sarah said. \"I need to shower and go to bed. And I'm wondering how to do that, since I've got a wrecking ball for a belly, and can't be more then 15 feet away from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah frowned. \"Are the shower and bed big enough to fit us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at her, and said...</span></div></div>",

Leah tried using a few of Sarah's workout equipment but, with six arms and hooves, her musculature was very different and she'd need to rethink any future exercises. As Sarah tried to go through her usual routine, she was disappointed to see how much more sluggish she was. Sarah's arm strength was basically the same, with her bulging biceps bulking up as she lifted kettle bells and other free weights but her legs were much slower. She tried both lifts and some kicks but having an enormous pregnant stomach in front of her cut down on her mobility. And any kind of ab workout was essentially impossible with her belly. Even her jump rope kept smacking Sarah on her gut, which made Leah flinch each time it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize you needed to be in such tough shape for scientific research,\" Leah observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not for my work,\" Sarah said, breathing in quick bursts as she bent her knees, carrying a heavy barbell over her shoulders. As she started to stand back up from her squat, Sarah neglected to factor in how much more weight her body already carried and groaned to get back up. \"I like being in shape is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah puckered her lips, watching Sarah with intrigue as she wiped her sweat off with a small towel. \"You seem to be in a little bit more than 'shape' for a human. You're almost like a warrior bride from Wakabida.\" Sarah turned to ask Leah a question but Leah mentally intercepted it. \"Another planet, don't worry about it. They don't travel much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back at night, Sarah was still sticky, sweaty, and tired from her workout. Whether she fit or not was immaterial \u2013 Sarah needed a shower. She stripped down to her sports bra and underwear as she waddled to the bathroom, picking at the tight strap cutting into her enlarged chest. \"Did you want to wash up too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I didn't take one this morning, same as you,\" Leah shrugged with a smile. Before Sarah could reply, Leah already took off her clothes, standing in front of Sarah in her full, naked Muserian glory. Aside from the small differences such as her feet, extra arms, and antennae, Leah looked like any other pregnant woman, just with a belly size that surpassed any medical records, plus purple skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Sarah covered her face with her hands, feeling her cheeks burning against her palms. <i>Leah!</i> Sarah thought to her housemate. <i>You're naked!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah chuckled. <i>Unless I'm mistaken, just like my showers back home, you need to get naked to take a human shower</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>B-but you don't have to be naked <b>in front of</b> me</i>, Sarah whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aside from a few cosmetic differences, we're two very pregnant women, and ones with a unique bond</i>, Leah replied, sounding a little disappointed. <i>I would think you and I could at least be nude in front of one another</i>. Sarah's eyes were still closed but she could feel Leah step forward and press their bellies together. Their skin felt warm rubbing up on the other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Sarah dropped her hands. Sure enough, Leah was touching her enormous pregnant middle to Sarah, her swollen breasts resting on top of her stomach with wide dark purple nipples. Leah was smiling as all six of her hands stroked her belly and Sarah eventually smiled back, although she was still blushing. \"Okay,\" Sarah said, nodding. \"Let's try this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Sarah's surprise, they could both fit in the shower but there was only enough room to let the two switch positions. Actually washing would be impossible. But at least the closeness meant Sarah could somewhat hide her own nakedness from Leah. Seeing her nude was one thing but Sarah had never let anyone see her naked, aside from her parents when she was a very little kid and a doctor here and there. Once Sarah hit puberty, she tried to hide her body away from other people as much as possible. Though Leah was...Leah was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we might have to wash one another,\" Leah said, her hands going to the shower knobs and turning them on. A spray of icy cold water rained down on them and Sarah let out a yelp. \"Ah, that feels nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you like c-c-cold-\" Sarah said with chattering teeth, unable to get the full sentence out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, don't you? It's so soothing,\" Leah said with a wide, sharp smile. But seeing Sarah shiver, Leah sighed and placed one hand against Sarah's chest. That made Sarah almost as nervous as the cold shower, with Leah's hand pressing between Sarah's swollen breasts. \"Let's try...this.\" Leah began to hum loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sarah felt relaxed by the shower and her shivering stopped. \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brought out a little of the Muserian in you,\" Leah replied, putting a little dollop of soap on Sarah's nose. \"It won't last long but it'll hopefully let you enjoy the water.\" Sarah smiled back and got some soap and shampoo to begin lathering and washing off Leah. Her orange hair was wonderfully soft; Leah's skin was smooth and tender; her belly felt just as tight as Sarah's. As Sarah washed her fellow pregnant woman, she looked down to see Leah's hands cupping her breasts, moving them around as they got soapy and shimmering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Sarah began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a lot of sweat here,\" Leah said. \"Not surprising, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks,\" Sarah gulped, turning her attention to wash off Leah's belly. Then she stood up quick with surprise again as she felt Leah's bottom two arms touching her butt. \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah,\" Leah sighed, touching her antennae to Sarah's wet forehead. \"Relax, please?\" Sarah met Leah's eyes, and although they were solid white, she could still feel Leah's gentleness through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sarah nodded, untensing and returning to clean off Leah. They got their soap off and pushed out of the cramped shower to towel and dry. \"Cold showers are probably better for me anyway. And it'll save on energy costs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoyed it. I'm turning you into a real Muserian,\" Leah laughed. \"Maybe next I can get you singing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno about that,\" Sarah giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the shower was tight, the bed was almost as close. Both women had to lay in bed facing one another, their bellies pressed tightly and their faces only inches apart. Sarah was pulling her blanket up to her chin, trying not to tremble. <i>What's wrong?</i> Leah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I-I just...I've never shared a bed with someone else</i> Sarah thought, her eyes dipping down to Leah's chest. Her alien friend had opted to sleep in the nude as well. <i>Do Muserians have a term for virgins?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah chuckled. <i>Sex works a little different for us but I think I understand what you mean</i>. She reached forward to brush some locks of Sarah's white hair. <i>Maybe that Mira woman can be your first</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, if she doesn't mind me being a whale</i>, Sarah scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe it's the Muserian in me but pregnancy looks very good on you</i>, Leah thought. <i>And you have other...features humans enjoy</i>. Her eyes turned to Sarah's chest as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bit her lip and let a laugh sneak out. <i>Do any other species have breasts like this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah shrugged. <i>The Junasians get pregnant in their breasts so they get quite big</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sarah said out loud, putting her hands over her bosom. \"Ouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't have a problem with it,\" Leah replied with a giggle, still looking at Sarah's chest. \"Can I...touch them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sarah was really blushing. \"I-I suppose so,\" Sarah said as Leah put two of her hands on Sarah's breasts, her thumbs just over her nipples. \"O-oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say, even among other alien races, these are...something else,\" Leah said quietly, her face getting closer and closer. \"Sarah, you are truly a one-of-a-kind person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks,\" Sarah whispered back, her bottom lip quivering. \"You're...special too.\" Leah smiled wide and was about to say something back when there was a loud, banging knock on the door. \"Who could that be this late?\" Sarah groaned.</span></div></div>",

Sighing, Sarah opened the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door was Karen Fieldbrook, Sarah's neighbor. Karen had olive skin, green eyes, and black hair with red tips. Karen was currently 8 months pregnant with triplets, her grey hoodie barely holding her volleyball sized breasts, and not even barely covering her beachball sized belly. Her black sweatpants were tight around her inflated butt. She was wearing red sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sarah.\" Karen said. \"Maria called. She said you were taking part in a surrogate program?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. \"Uh, yeah.\" She said. Then she motioned to the disguised Leah. \"This is Dr. Leah Muserian. She's helping me with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Karen replied. \"Well, guess the three of us are in the same boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was a professional surrogate, usually helping any family she could. Sarah couldn't recall a time she didn't see Karen with a huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked down at Sarah's belly and chuckled. \"Geez, you're huge. How many are you carrying? 8?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blanked. \"Uh, yes, 8 for now.\" She answered. \"So, is that all you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you mind if I come in?\" Karen asked. \"I'm a professional, so maybe I could give you a few pointers on what being a surrogate is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at Leah, who just shrugged. \"Sure, if you want.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Karen said, before squeezing her way into the house.

One hand was still stroking her exposed stomach as she giggled, looking at her white-haired neighbor. \"For someone so new to being a surrogate, I'm surprised how big you got your first time. I didn't think I would ever see someone bigger than...oof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was interrupted as she began to feel a tightness along her stomach skin. With a light moan, Karen leaned forward and pressed both hands against her olive-toned stomach. Sarah felt a strange twinge in her womb as well and started to rub her belly while she helped Karen inside. Leah was also stroking her middle as she watched the new woman enter the house. Before their eyes, Karen's middle started to grow, at a much slower pace than Sarah and Leah's spurts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grey hoodie gradually rolled up, now threatening to expose her large breasts with her belly already as out as it could be. The string in her sweatpants began to retreat into the waistline as her body made it a tighter and tighter fit and Leah could hear a tear starting to form between Karen's butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" Karen said, working through quick breaths occasionally cut off with a groan. She turned to Leah and winced again. \"Y-you're a doctor, right? Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Leah said, glancing over at Sarah who just shrugged and darted her eyes to Karen. \"Right. Let's try...\" Leah reached one hand down to Karen's belly before hesitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Karen panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Leah said, hurrying to Sarah's closet and coming back with a pair of winter gloves. \"Just...better safe than sorry.\" She placed her hands on Karen's belly and started to rub it in slow circles, moving to different parts of her enormous sphere. \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just giving me a belly rub,\" Karen whimpered. \"That's not doing anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think she knows what she's doing,\" Sarah said. \"Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening and feeling vibrations. Think of it as the 'music' of your womb,\" Leah said, giving Karen a small smile. When Karen didn't smile back, Leah turned her attention back to the expanding pregnant stomach. \"Well where I'm from, that phrase makes more sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me what's happening to me!\" Karen yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Humans are so rude</i> Leah thought, glancing at Sarah. <i>Present company excluded</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's fine. You're right for the most part</i> Sarah thought back as Karen let out another grunt. \"You're doing okay, Karen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so tight,\" Karen said, continuing to clutch her belly. \"Tighter than it's ever been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming to an end,\" Leah said, patting Karen just above her navel. \"But I can feel more fetuses inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women sighed and looked down at Karen. Before, Sarah and Leah were clearly much larger than her but now the gap was closed, with Karen almost as wide as she was tall, while remaining perfectly round and smooth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised there are more,\" Karen said. \"How many more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah whistled nervously for a few seconds before giving Karen her answer. \"Triple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence in the room. \"9? I'm pregnant with 9 babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all appear to be healthy,\" Leah said, smiling and trying to look positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...maybe I can get paid three times as much,\" Karen mumbled. \"How did this happen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah and Sarah looked at one another, communicating silently instead of telepathically. \"Maybe you should just try and rest first,\" Sarah said, patting Leah on the shoulders. Karen nodded and tried to steady herself on her feet and waddle around Sarah's house. Her enormous belly shook and jiggled as she tried to pace around, pushing her hands into her lower back to make her middle stick out even more. Karen's legs, which were like little twigs compared to Sarah's thick quads and calves, wobbled like noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What exactly happened?</i> Sarah asked her other-worldly friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't know. You're already proving to be an outlier for Muserian pregnancy experiences. But Muserians touching species that are already pregnant and having some change happen is unheard of</i>, Leah responded. <i>If I could get to my ship, I could get some instruments to study her</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Might be worth it</i>, Sarah shrugged. <i>We're both scientists after all</i>. Leah left the room to wait for Karen to leave, switching her disguise off. Sarah got Karen a cup of tea. \"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think I'd be used to cramps and heaviness by now,\" Karen said with a weak smile, taking the tea and continuing to rub her middle. \"But this is new to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. Feeling out of control of your body is...something I'm used to,\" Sarah said, biting her top lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sweet,\" Karen smiled, looking between the two of them. \"I always thought you were a nice girl, even if you were a little quiet. And now we're both pregnant! How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sarah chuckled. \"I know you were trying to say when you came inside that you didn't think you'd see someone bigger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not me. I meant someone bigger than Gina, the boss of the surrogacy company. But looking at you up close...I think Gina's actually bigger,\" Karen said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sarah said, her red eyes getting wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, she gets all the best clients,\" Karen smiled. Sarah tried to smile back but let out a sudden sigh and touched her belly. There was that strange twinge again she felt when she touched Karen's belly. \"Something wrong with you too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Sarah said, narrowing her eyes as the feeling subsided. \"No, I'm...fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'd be nervous if you started growing too,\" Karen sighed, looking down at her inflated middle. \"Are you sure you're carrying octuplets? I mean...you're bigger than me and I've got nine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah cleared her throat. \"I think we should try and relax. After tonight, maybe you need to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Karen yawned, stretching out. \"Mind if I spend the night here? I'm so tired and I don't want to try waddling back to my house with...all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...\" Sarah said, feeling her cheeks get red as Karen pressed against her, their breasts pushing together and Karen's lips dangerously close to Sarah's neck. \"S-sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled and hurried to the couch, curling up and rubbing her belly as he eyes closed and she drifted off to sleep. When the coast looked clear, Leah waddled back in with her full Muserian look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fast sleeper</i>, Leah said. <i>Let's go to my ship. Can't leave without you, after all</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Leah hurried to her ship in the barn and Leah pulled out a piece of technology Sarah couldn't understand at the moment.

Waddling up to her, Leah pulled out the device, which looked like a purple metronome. Leah placed it next to Karen's massive belly and started it. At the same time, she began humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah cocked her head in confusion. '<i>What in the world are you doing?</i>' Sarah thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>The device will allow me to check the DNA of the babies.

After a few minutes, she stopped humming and stopped the device, looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The babies are all human.\" Leah replied. \"What I don't understand is why she grew in the first place.

She sighed and shifted in her large chair, feeling the edges of her pants start to dig into her skin some. \"Maybe I have kept away from exercise for too long,\" Maria grumbled to herself. She switched the TV off and stepped out of her seat, still feeling a bit sluggish and encumbered by her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way to the bathroom, almost waddling, and stripped down to her manila bra and underwear. Maria turned in the mirror to inspect her middle. If she was getting fatter, then at least it was staying close to only her stomach. She patted it and felt how firm it was, very unlike folds of fat. She was taking on a pear shape, with her hips curving out some more too and her thighs looking thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better sleep this off and let my metabolism take over,\" Maria said, heading for her bed. \"Or maybe this is just a sign that I'm getting older. It happens to the best of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Maria nodded off to sleep, not noticing that her stomach was continuing to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen continued to sleep, Sarah and Leah got ready for their night together \u2013 the first real one since Sarah awoke and realized all of the changes her body went through thanks to her first ever encounter with a Muserian. She was unsure what to wear since she was sharing a bed with someone else. Well, more than just \"someone else.\" She and Leah shared a unique bond and were both extremely pregnant women, both carrying Leah's babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stuck with a sports bra, a pair of sweatpants that still covered most of her butt, and a white t-shirt to go over top. It didn't do anything to hide her pregnant stomach and it didn't do much for her breasts either but it was something. Sarah sat on the edge of her bed, stroking her belly and feeling all the babies inside. Leah's, and possibly even a few extra from the growth spurts she experienced. Maybe Maria and Karen's babies were in there somewhere too? Or even...a few of her own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of being pregnant with her own actual babies made Sarah shiver a bit and rub with more vigor, hoping if that was the case, her young wouldn't go through the same awful childhood she experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, I am ready to go to sleep,\" Leah said from the bathroom. \"It's been a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure has,\" Sarah smiled, turning to face her alien guest. Then, her jaw dropped. Leah went the opposite route of Sarah, taking all her clothes off and standing before Sarah in all her nude, pregnant Muserian glory. Sarah could see every inch of her glistening, purple skin, her six toned arms and thick legs, her swollen belly and breasts, and her eager smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, something wrong?\" Leah said, her sharp smile still there as she waddled over to the bed on her hooved feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...I didn't expect you to dress like...that,\" Sarah said, her face turning as red as her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed more comfortable. I only wore my space suit in the barn because of the temperature. But it is very warm in here,\" Leah said, tucking into bed and getting close to Sarah. \"Mmm, it's even warmer now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped and tucked into bed, her pregnant stomach pressing against Leah's, their belly buttons tickling. \"I-I guess it's okay then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah frowned and touched one hand to Sarah's cheek. <i>I can't read your thoughts right now but you seem upset.</i> she thought at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked away in shame, her eyes going to her own chest. <i>I feel...funny. I don't normally share a bed with another woman</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But you told me you are a lesbian</i>, Leah replied. <i>Did I misunderstand what that means on your planet?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, it's just that...I'm a lesbian but I've never been with another woman</i>, Sarah thought, now almost in tears with embarrassment. <i>And you're so...so pretty!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah sighed and smiled, pulling herself a bit closer. <i>Would you like to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Sarah shouted out loud, quickly putting one hand over her mouth in fear she'd wake Karen up. <i>I mean...I don't think I'm ready.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's fine. But can I show you how Muserians like to share affection?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Share\" affection?</i> Sarah said, confused by her verbiage. Leah leaned forward and touched her antennae to Sarah's forehead. They both gasped, as their emotions and feelings transferred between the two of them. In a fit, both started kissing, Sarah's wide, soft lips sucking and pulling on Leah's gentle purple mouth. The flurry lasted a few minutes before Sarah stopped, her heart racing more than when she runs a 10K. <i>Wow</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow indeed. We don't...do that</i>, Leah said, adding a small chuckle. <i>But I see the appeal</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What...what do you do?</i> Sarah asked, biting her lip. Leah smiled and cuddled close to Sarah, touching her antennae again. Leah began to hum softly, creating a small, gorgeous song. Sarah felt warmth well up in her chest as they both closed their eyes and went to sleep in each other's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Sarah woke up to her phone ringing.

After fully standing up, they waddled over to the bathroom to wash up and change. They had to go in one at a time, since their bellies proved too big to fit at the same time.

Then she and Leah waddled out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren turned back to her breakfast, only to feel a flurry of kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, you guys.\" Karen said, patting her belly. \"I'm eating as fast as I can.\"<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a few miles away, Leah's sister, after a bout of her Camo Flute shutting off and turning back on, had made it to John's farm, and located Leah's craft. She was checking it for damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No external damage.\" She said to herself. \"Engine's shot, though. Overload of solar radiation. I told sis she should use Quantum Fusion engines, but she never listens. Alright sis, where'd you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello?\" A voice behind her said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Leah's sister came face to face with John, who was on his way to his hunting camera in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you own this farm?\" Leah's sister asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded. \"Been in my family my whole life. Except for that big ship behind you.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's sister looked at him. \"The owner of this ship. Where is she?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The alien? She went with a family friend. Sarah. Why?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's sister sighed and deactived her disguise. \"Because I'm her sister and I'm worried about her. Where does this Sarah live?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn told her, and Leah's sister, thanking him, reactivated her disguise and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" John asked. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's impossible to pronounce.\" She replied. \"But I have read up on human female names for one that will fit, so for now, I am Jade.\" On that, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at the sky. \"My farm's become an extraterrestrial magnet, Eileen. And I've never seen an alien with implants.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEY'RE REAL!\" He heard Jade shout back.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nBack with Sarah and Leah, they had made it to Maria's house. Sarah knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's open!\" The two heard Maria yell. Sarah opened the door and the two squeezed in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, where are you?\" Sarah yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My room!\" Maria yelled back. \"Upstairs, third door on the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Leah waddled up the stairs, and located the door. But they didn't open it right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, Leah's with me. What's wrong?\" Sarah asked through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" Maria said. \"It's my belly and breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sarah and Leah's eyes went wide. \"What's wrong with them?\" Leah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night, I felt a little bloated. I though it was my metabolism, so I brushed it off. But this morning, I woke up, and I was huge. I looked nine months pregnant with twins. So I tried calling you a few times Sarah, but you didn't pick up. My belly won't stop growing. And there's... something else.\" Maria explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is like Karen.' Sarah thought to Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, but Karen stopped growing eventually. This is bizarre, even by my standards. And what does she mean by something else?' Leah thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, we're coming in.\" Sarah said. She didn't get an answer. Slowly, Sarah opened the door and she and Leah looked inside. They got a huge surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, overnight, Maria had grown to Karen's size. She was sitting upright, and her belly filled her lap. Her breasts were also swollen to Karen's size. And surprisingly, she was still growing, slowly but noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut amazingly enough, that wasn't what shocked Sarah and Leah the most. What shocked them the most was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah and Leah were not quite sure what to say. Maria was sitting in her chair, a new, big pregnant belly in her lap, and her skin was purple-tinged. It was not quite as robust as Leah's skin when her disguise was down and she was in her full Muserian form but it was definitely not human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening to me?\" Maria grunted, stroking her purple belly, her maternal hormones making her skin shiny and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you think I would have any ideas,\" Sarah stammered, reflexively worried Maria might be implying this is her fault. After all, she <u>did</u> mysteriously show up with an extremely pregnant belly just the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know I don't say it, but I know you're the smartest woman at the lab. Hell, you're probably the smartest person any of us have ever met,\" Maria said, her voice still anxious and a little angry. \"So use that big brain of yours and figure out what is happening to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, right,\" Sarah said, waddling over to inspect Maria's belly. She already grew once when they touched but, given her interactions with Leah, she did not think there'd be a risk to touching her again. Sarah placed her hands on Maria's stomach and started to move it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well?</i> Leah asked telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It feels like she's still growing,</i> Sarah replied. <i>It's slow but she is definitely ballooning. By the end of the day, I'll bet she gets as big as you and me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind her back, Leah pulled out the same device she used to inspect Karen when her belly started growing. \"Hey Maria, did you eat anything unusual last night? See anything out of place in your kitchen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My kitchen?\" Maria said, turning her head to look back toward her kitchen. With her head turned, Leah did a quick scan without the scientist looking and hid the contraption back behind her. \"No, nothing out of the ordinary. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checking everything, trying to be thorough,\" Leah said with a smile. \"Excuse me, I need to make a phone call.\" She walked around a corner, making sure to stay within the distance range of Sarah and Leah, and checked the device. <i>This is odd</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is it?</i> Sarah asked, her hands still on Maria's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her genetic sequences have changed. She is...half-Muserian and half-human somehow</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So she is like the babies I'm carrying?</i> Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, we don't reproduce the same way. Your babies will be born 100% Muserian. There is no record of hybrids ever existing</i>, Leah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We had better take her to the lab and run some tests to learn more</i>, Sarah said, helping Maria to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes...and we should run some tests on you too. Somehow, you are a little...different also</i>, Leah said, a little wavering present in her mental communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Maria, let's get you to the lab to check you out,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lab won't have anything to run pre-natal testing,\" Maria grumbled, stroking her belly and shifting her hips to accommodate her pregnant weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed. \"I didn't want to tell you but...I have more than one lab, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Sarah's house, Karen was still sleeping peacefully, one hand stroking her naked belly as she cooed to herself, feeling her customers' fetuses shift around inside her belly. Then, she was suddenly awoken by a banging on the door before it broke off its hinges. Karen yelped and sat up straight, clutching her belly tightly. \"Who are you?\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the corner waddled a very tall pregnant woman with dark tan skin, long curly brown hair, and a very annoyed look on her face. \"Is Leah here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leah?\" Karen said, noting the similarities. \"Oh, you must be her...sister or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned. Camo flutes had a way of making relatives take on many of the same traits. \"In fact I am. My name is Jade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jade, I don't know where you're from-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you probably don't,\" Jade chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-but around here it's customary not to break down someone's door. You could have put me into labor you startled me so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade glared back at Karen's frown. She wanted to inspect the woman's belly to make sure she wouldn't go into labor but knew the risks. Jade slipped on a silvery glove and placed it on Karen's firm bump. \"You feel healthy. I know a thing or two about pregnancy.\" Jade stopped, sensing through the readings in her gloves that Karen was carrying fetuses with a Muserian signature. \"Have you...always had this belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the past eight months or so, of course,\" Karen said, rolling her eyes. \"Sure there was a growth spurt but that was just the little ones shifting into place to get ready for delivery. I'm probably going to drop soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, of course,\" Jade said. This human clearly didn't know about Muserians. Or much of anything, for that matter. \"Listen, I'm sorry about the door. Do you know where I could find Sarah to apologize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to find your sister?\" Karen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade sighed. \"I want to find them both. Look, would you just tell me what you know, since you seem to be living in her house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren shrugged. \"I dunno. She works at a chemistry lab in town. Ask around there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Jade said with an exhausted sigh, slowly getting back to her feet and waddling forward, rubbing her belly as she balanced it on her hips. \"And you should try humming to your babies. They like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, good idea!\" Karen said, beginning to hum loudly and off-key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, never mind,\" Jade grumbled. \"Only thing we hate worse than no music is bad music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" Karen said as Jade picked the door up and jammed it back in place. \"Wow, she's almost as strong as Sarah.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back with Sarah, Leah, and Maria, the three of them were making their way to Sarah's house. In the time it took them to get there, Maria's belly grew another few inches along with her breasts and butt, her skin became a darker shade of purple, and her eyes turned a solid onyx color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to Sarah's house, Karen had left. Sarah also discovered her door was broken. Deciding to worry about it later, Sarah led Maria and Leah to her lab. Maria was cradling her belly, and looked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, were you ever going to tell me about your home lab?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I had private projects and didn't want interference.\" Sarah replied. \"But right now, we need to focus on what's happening to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's mainly my fault.\" Leah said. Then she dectivated her disguise. \"Because I'm not human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's eyes got wide. \"Sarah what's going?\" She asked, now scared. Sarah had never seen her boss frightened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lot to take in, I know.\" Sarah said. \"Leah is an alien called a Muserian. She came to Earth to study, and found me. I touched her and... this happened.\" She motioned to her belly. \"Me and her are now \"bonded\". We can't be more then 15 feet apart. And the two of us won't give birth for 30 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we're going to try and find out.\" Leah replied. \"This has never happened in Muserian history before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the three of them entered the lab. Sarah had Maria sit in a chair nearby, then started up several devices. She then put several nods on Maria's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to take a while. So, what do you want to know first?\" Leah asked Maria.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nBack with Jade, she managed to locate the lab Sarah worked at. Still in her human disguise, she walked (well, in her disguise, waddled) up to the reception desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can help you with?\" The receptionist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Jade replied. \"I'm looking for a woman who works here. Her name is Sarah...\" It was then she realized that she never learned Sarah's last name. \"Um, she's with my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your sister pregnant too?\" The receptionist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Jade replied. 'And the sooner I find her, the sooner I can turn my Camo Flute off. Tried of lugging this belly around.' Jade thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but Sarah doesn't come into work on Thursdays.\" The receptionist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade frowned. \"Thank you.\" She said, before waddling away from the desk. She almost got to the door when she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, you're looking for Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade turned to look, and saw Mira standing behind her. She was holding a clipboard with different equations on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Jade answered. \"She's with my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she isn't here. But she might be back home.\" Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just there.\" Jade replied. \"She wasn't home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might be now.\" Mira said. \"We can go together. I need to talk to her anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade shrugged. \"OK then. Lead the way.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira nodded and went out the door, Jade following.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nBack with Sarah, Leah, and Maria, Leah had just finished explaining as much as she could, from her species, to what happened with Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible.\" Maria said, rubbing her still-swelling belly. \"An actual alien. So, why am I turning into one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't. Well, not completely.\" Leah answered. \"You've become only half-Muserian. You'll still retain a number of human traits. I just wish I knew why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Maria said. She then hefted up her belly a bit. \"And this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a complete mystery to me.\" Leah replied, placing one of her six hands on Maria's belly. \"I've never seen this happen before. Although, to be honest, your belly does feel nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria frowned. \"Well, I'd like to know why I have a belly in the first place.\" She said, annoyed. \"Though I will admit I like the breasts. Just hope they don't start-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muserian's don't start lactating until after they give birth. So you and Sarah don't need to worry about that for a while.\" Leah interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Leah.\" Sarah said, staring at a monitor. \"You might want to see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah waddled over to Sarah and looked at the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know a lot of things, but these readings are beyond my comprehension.' Sarah thought to Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is worse than I thought.' Leah thought back. She then turned to Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I should explain something.\" Leah said. \"Something I forgot to mention to Sarah a while ago. When a Muserian gets pregnant, their aging process is stopped. That way, the health problems of aging don't cause issues with the pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you only bringing this up now?\" Sarah asked, a little annoyed that she wasn't told this earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me put it this way: Maria, you might stay your current age for good.\" Leah said. \"Because you might be pregnant permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Maria screamed. \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a very rare problem Muserians have.\" Leah said. \"The current Muserian queen has been pregnant for 600 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm going to spend the rest of my life with a gargantuan belly, giant tits, and a huge ass?\" Maria asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely. But you will stop growing. Eventually.\" Leah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable.\" Maria muttered. And as things weren't bad enough...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Maria was stroking her enormous pregnant belly, faced with the possibility that she might have to carry around this round, heavy burden for the rest of her life, something took her attention away. Sarah and Leah began to grow in front of her, their bodies jutting forward as their stomachs expanded. It was a steady growth, with their curves becoming even more pronounced. They had the same size belly but Sarah was outpacing Leah greatly when it came to her butt and bust. Once her belly got to a point where it was four times longer than her arms, her shirt burst open and her naked breasts hung out, still shaking a little from the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Sarah, this was at the same time her belly stopped growing so she could focus on covering up her chest. Her cheeks burned red and she looked at Leah in fear. Leah's limited clothes were still intact but they were now stretched to impossible limits. The outline of her nipples were clear against the tight fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what was that?\" Maria asked, moving one finger between the two of them. \"Sympathy growth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" Sarah whined, turning around to hide her nakedness, exposing her bare butt in the process. \"Uh, Leah? Care to explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a tough one,\" Leah sighed, all six of her hands now rubbing her gigantic purple bump. \"This is also a...new development for us. I do not know of any records in Muserian history where these growth spurts occur with this much frequency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on now. We're three scientists. We can figure something out,\" Maria said, groaning as she tried to get out of her chair. Leah used one of her hands to take Maria's wrist and give her some support. \"Thanks. Guess you two have gotten used to sitting and walking already, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leah more than me. Muscles only get you so far,\" Sarah sighed, finding a blanket and wrapping it around herself. Her huge belly still stuck out but it at least hid her breasts...for now. \"She was pregnant when I first met her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were? How did you get pregnant?\" Maria asked, stroking her stomach as it rubbed against Leah's. \"You said you got Sarah knocked up when you touched but...how about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah chuckled, her sharp teeth flashing. \"At a certain age, Muserian women become fertile and our uteruses swell with genetic material that then waits for another being to help us conceive. I wasn't 'pregnant' in the traditional sense that you humans would use when I met Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't have sex to get pregnant at all,\" Maria sighed, looking Leah up and down. \"I was hoping you could give me some pointers. Dating with purple skin is going to be tricky enough as it is but with a belly full of babies, that's going to be really hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure there are people who are...into that sort of thing,\" Leah smiled, trying to be polite. \"Sarah would know more about human mating customs than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about it Sarah? Want to be my wingwoman?\" Maria said, letting out a grunt as she felt a hard fetal kick. \"That'll take some getting used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-w-wingwoman?\" Sarah gulped, nearly dropping her covering blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's the least you could do after getting me knocked up,\" Maria said, hitting her belly hard and making a smacking sound for emphasis. \"And you must clean up when you go out. You could help me find someone too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...let me...think about it,\" Sarah said, her legs trembling from more than just her pregnant weight. \"In the meantime...get some rest back at your home for now. You've had a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess so,\" Maria nodded, tugging on her clothes to try and make sure they still fit in a way she was satisfied with. \"But you better expect a call from me tonight asking whether you're going out or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Looking forward to it,\" Sarah stammered as Maria waddled out, her whole body shaking and bending as she tried to adjust to her body. \"What are we going to do with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do with both of us?\" Leah said, gesturing to their bellies. \"Something very weird is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you're saying it's weird, that's really something,\" Sarah murmured, noting Leah's antennae, skin, arms, and hooves. \"Where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only my sister was here. She's a leading biologist on our home planet and she'd figure out what's up,\" Leah nodded. \"But she's kind of a bitch too. Maybe better she isn't here. We can do this on our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we?\" Sarah gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I can tell, you're the smartest one on this whole, culturally-deficient planet,\" Leah smiled, one of her antennae touching Sarah's forehead. \"I think I'm in good hands.\" Sarah gave a little smile of her own and waddled back to her scientific equipment. \"Now, let's get crackin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud knock at the front door. Leah groaned and Sarah straightened back up, removing her chemistry goggles. \"Bad timing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad timing,\" Leah agreed, nodding. She pulled out her camouflage flute and instantly went into her beautiful, dark skinned pregnant woman disguise. \"Let's see who it is and hopefully they'll leave soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women slowly waddled to the door, hearing more loud knocks as they moved. When they finally opened it up, Mira and Jade were standing on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi, Sarah,\" Mira said, trying not to stare at Sarah's middle. \"This woman was hoping to talk with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm not telling her I'm from another planet!</i>' Leah thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say.\" Jade said. Then she looked at Sarah. \"Now, you, Sarah. My my, you are gorgeous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I should mention my sister and I took the same human research course in college, and she developed a fetish for pregnant women from Earth.</i>' Leah thought to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Of course she does.</i>' Sarah thought back. '<i>She'd love Maria right now.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind if I... feel your belly, do you?\" Jade asked. Sarah shrugged, and agreed. Jade grinned and placed a hand on Sarah's belly, rubbing it. \"Oh my. It's beautiful. So firm, and warm. Not a stretch mark in sight. And it's so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, may we come in properly?\" Mira interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded and looked at Jade. Jade got the hint and removed her hand. All four of them walked into the living room and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Sarah,\" Mira started. \"When did you get pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, about 4 months ago.\" Sarah lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that big in 4 months?!\" Mira asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a surrogate program.\" Sarah replied. \"They just overdid it a bit. But it's to help many other families.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Mira said. \"But your still bigger then most people would think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not everyone in here is fully developed yet. So it will take some time.\" Sarah answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Mira replied. \"What happened to your clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at herself, only now remembering she was wrapped in a blanket with her massive belly exposed, and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a growth spurt, and nothing's fitting right now.\" Sarah answered. She then patted her belly. \"This behemoth doesn't know when to quit. If I'd know you were coming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine.\" Mira said. Her gaze travelled to Sarah's exposed belly. \"You look really sexy right now, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room went completely silent. Mira's eyes went wide when she realized what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ineedtousethebathroom!\" Mira quickly said, before rushing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ok.\" Jade said. \"So, sis. Explain to me the events leading up to now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Leah started.<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\nA little ways away from Sarah's house, Maria was waddling as fast as she could down back streets to get home. She could feel that her belly was still swelling, though it seemed to have slowed down a little. She was incredibly unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still can't believe it.\" Maria said. \"I might never give birth? What happens when I get so big I can't move? Or can't go through doors? This is a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she made it home. Squeezing her massive belly through the door, she waddled up to her room and sat on her bed, making it creak under her weight. She placed both hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you little ones are calm. Haven't kicked up a storm.\" Maria said. The she hefted up her breasts. \"And these boobs aren't too bad. Maybe I could get used to this. Probably should shower now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly getting up, she waddled to her bathroom. When she entered the bathroom, she saw a problem: her belly was bigger then her shower stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" She said.<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\nSo, now who should we follow in the next chapter?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria pouted in her bathroom \u2013 alone, naked, and pregnant. Very, very pregnant. The go-to descriptor for large pregnant women was always some kind of ball. Volleyball, basketball, and then beach ball right near the end. For Maria, they would need to invent a new sport to properly reference the size of her pregnant swell. It also was not totally spherical. It was round, for sure, but as it took on an increased size, it started to become more of a \"torpedo belly\" and was more focused on growing long instead of wide. In a way, that was a blessing for Maria because if it got any wider, she would start looking pregnant from behind and it might spread her apart more than she could bear. Maria already was too wide to fit inside of her shower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much else in the way of options, Maria got a few cloths wet in warm water and began rubbing them over her. This was a little humiliating for Maria. Here she was, a PhD scientist and a top researcher at her prestigious lab, a six-figure salary making her very comfortable, and she was forced to clean herself with a rag. And when a nicely furnished shower was right there next to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one big upside to washing herself this way, aside from the amount of water it probably saved. Maria found it very soothing to rub her cloth over her pregnant swell. Something about it was so calming, especially when coupled with the warm water. There was not a lot of movement inside of her womb but when she ran the cloth over her bump, she could feel the fetal bodies inside start to get cozy and not stir as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this is common for all pregnant women,\" Maria said to herself with a sigh, ignoring the obvious uncommonality with her own pregnancy. Maria was now purple and had just been told that the alien babies inside of her might be there forever. She already did not like being pregnant but the possibility of being this way long past nine months or 40 weeks was very unappealing. And Maria was far removed from wrapping her head around what \"forever\" would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, feeling sad about her current state once again. But who could she talk to about all this? Maria was now half-alien and ultra pregnant to boot. The only people who knew were Sarah and her own baby mama from another planet. And they were currently occupied with something, plus Maria did not want to confide in them. Sarah was nice but she was too...strange. She had always felt very distant, from her quiet nature to her monstrous hair and eyes to her ridiculous physique. Sarah had the shape all women wanted and the muscles all guys wanted. And as for Leah...well, Maria was not ready to fully accept an alien just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Maria needed to talk to someone. Wracking her brains, she only came up with one name for a nearby neighbor. \"I'm going to regret this,\" Maria said to herself as she dialed the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Karen waddled up to the door and rang the bell. \"I came as soon as I could!\" Karen called through the window. \"Just takes me a little longer now, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Maria called back. \"Don't freak out when you come in, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freak out? About what?\" Karen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, don't freak out. Okay?\" Maria took a deep breath and opened the door, taking a few wobbling steps away to make room for her super surrogate neighbor. In struggled Karen and, as promised, she did not freak out when she saw her friend now enormously pregnant and purple. But her jaw did drop and her eyes did bug out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few silent minutes passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Maria finally said to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a...costume?\" Karen choked out, hands on her belly, which had also gotten a lot bigger in recent days thanks to Sarah and Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a costume. Something is...happening to me,\" Maria said, guiding Karen to the living room for the expectant mothers to sit down and take a load off. Though Maria was not sure if she counted as \"expectant\" since she was not \"expecting\" these babies to come soon if ever. \"Something big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big is the word I would use, yeah,\" Karen said eyes on Maria's naked stomach. \"I thought I was getting huge but you make me feel better my comparison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I could help,\" Maria sighed. \"I have a...special doctor looking into it and they also say I may never give birth. Just remain like this forever, except I may also be getting bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren leaned back in her chair. \"You're going to hate me for saying this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Maria shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a little jealous. I love being pregnant. I feel so fortunate to be a surrogate but I know it will not last forever,\" Karen said, rolling up her tight shirt to caress her pregnant belly. \"If I could be like this for the rest of my life...that would be perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd trade if I could,\" Maria grumbled. \"Being pregnant is no walk in the park. I was actually hoping for some advice from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like it? It's such a magical time in a woman's life, as long as there are no medical complications,\" Karen cooed, waddling over to sit next to Maria. \"I feel so full of life and energy and femininity. I have never felt more alive, more...sexual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have sex with all this in the way?\" Maria said with surprise, gesturing to their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...not yet. But I would like to,\" Karen purred, brushing a lock of Maria's hair away. It was starting to take on a slightly orange hue. \"You don't think pregnant women are attractive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gulped as she and Karen were inches apart from one another. \"I think a self-confident woman is attractive by herself. And if it's her pregnancy that makes her feel that way, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then?\" Karen said, smiling and showing a little bit of her teeth. With that, Maria and Karen moved in to kiss. But just before their lips met, Maria reached out to touch Karen on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both women snapped back and felt a strange energy running up and down their bodies. \"I feel funny,\" Karen said, her words slurring as she started stroking her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Me too</i> Maria thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, how did I hear you say that?</i> Karen thought back, both their faces looking confused before they passed out on the couch, falling into one another's arms as their pregnant middles began to expand quickly. </span></div></div>",

As soon as Leah finished, Jade began to ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is strange.\" Jade said. \"Never heard of this happening to other Muserians before. Maybe there's something in Sarah's genetics that's doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah nodded. \"I have considered that. Tomorrow, if you don't mind Sarah, I'd like to run a few tests on you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. Just then, Mira finally came back from the bathroom and sat in a chair next to Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for taking so long.\" Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah chuckled. \"It's fine. We were just talking.\" She said. \"Now, Jade, this might seem forward, but Leah tells me you have a... I'll be blunt, pregnancy fetish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade blushed hard. \"She told you that?\" She asked. \"Well, guess that's the topic now. Yes, I do have one. When me and Leah were in college, we both took a course on cultural study. I was assigned to reseach how different cultures treat pregnancy. As I did, I just fell in love with pregnant women. Eventually, I started looking up art and fiction of pregnant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Sarah said. \"What do you prefer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The internet calls it hyper-pregnancy.\" Jade replied. \"I just adore stories and images of women who are enormously pregnant. They can't just be the size of nine months. Oh no. I love seeing them massive. Like, bellies at least as big as the person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at Sarah's belly. \"And you, Sarah, are just gorgeous. I mean, a perfect sphere of a belly, no stretch marks to be seen, an amazing set of breasts. And the size. Oh wow, you are enormous. You are truly beautiful.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed and placed a hand on her belly. \"Oh... um... thanks.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira looked up at the clock. \"Well, I should probably head home. Need to get up early for work tomorrow.\" She said, getting up. \"Jade, do you want to stay at my house for tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" Jade replied. \"I'd actually like to catch up a little more with my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira nodded and headed for the front door. \"See you at work tomorrow, Sarah.\" She said. \"Unless your on maternity leave.\" On that, Mira left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were sure that Mira was gone, Jade and Leah deactivated their Camo Flutes. Sarah watched as Jade's belly deflated, but her breasts and hips stayed the same size. Sarah could help but stare, which Jade noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, they're huge.\" Jade said. \"But they sometimes get in the way, and they won't stop growing. In fact, my doctor says they might never stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry to hear that.\" Sarah said. \"Sorry, got off topic. You want to stay the night? I do have a guest room you can stay in. But why do you want to stay? Besides the obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if what Leah told me is correct, then something's not right. I want to make sure that you and my sis are all right. That and I'd kind of want to be here in case you grow again, Sarah. I'd love to see that.\" Jade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her eyes. \"I'll show you where the guest room is so you can get settled in.\" She said, before getting up with Leah. The two of them waddled over to the stairs, Jade following behind them, staring at Sarah's butt the whole time.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nLater that night, after Jade had been fully settled into her bed, Sarah and Leah were lying in Sarah's bed, doing their best to get comfortable with their giant bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade seems like a nice person.\" Sarah said. \"At least she was honest and up-front about her fetish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you haven't grown up with her.\" Leah replied. \"I will give you that she's nice, but we were just like any other sisters. Jade's older, so she would often tease me and one-up me. Heck, I think she's jealous of us. I got pregnant before she did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't find someone?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she found MANY. She was very popular with both boys and girls back on Dennick XV. But she hasn't gotten the genetic material yet.\" Leah explained.<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Sarah said. Then she stroked her own belly. \"Changing the subject, what kind of tests will we run tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genetic, DNA, the usual stuff. I have all the equipment in my ship. After you get out of work, we'll head over. Jade will come with us.\" Leah said. Then she placed a hand on Sarah's belly. \"I'm just as worried as you. This has never happened in Muserian history. But I hope things will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded, and the two of them fell asleep rubbing Sarah's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the two of them had...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah and Leah were together in the middle of a large, empty field. It was not unlike the farm field where Sarah first found Leah. It was only days ago but it felt like a lifetime had passed since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Leah were standing together, naked and pregnant. Both rubbed their aching middles, the size of a jacuzzi each. Small moans escaped from each of their lips, watching their twitching, strained stomachs. \"I had no idea I would get this...big,\" Sarah whimpered. \"I know I'm not normal but this is too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you have it tough? Look at the rest of your body,\" Leah said, pointing with one of her six arms at Sarah's rippling muscles and toned waist and hips. \"You can actually support all this stuff. Me, I'm just an average woman, at least where I'm from. This is hard on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you were the one with a big belly when I found you in that farm house! You are used to this kind of pregnancy...stuff!\" Sarah squeaked out, jutting one finger at Leah's belly. \"And it was you who got me pregnant in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asleep when that happened. You were the one who touched me and started this whole thing!\" Leah shouted back. \"And if it was a normal Muserian pregnancy, I would not be this big! That was something to do with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's place face blushed almost as red as her gleaming eyes. \"Wait, you are blaming me for making us more pregnant? How did I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How else do you explain it all? Look!\" Leah said, all six of her hands pointing at their pregnant stomachs. As she noted, both women were getting bigger and bigger, another strong growth spurt hitting. In no time, their bellies were pressing up against one another. \"Stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't!\" Sarah shouted, soon being more belly than woman. But they did not stop there, continuing to expand until their vision was blocked by nothing but breast and belly. \"Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand it either! I can't help!\" a now-panicked Leah shouted back. \"It feels like we're getting the whole population of Dennick XV in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Add the population of Earth to that while you're at it!\" Sarah groaned, cramps running up and down her body as her pregnant stomach continued to grow. \"Help! <b>Help</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women snapped awake, drenched in sweat. Without any hesitation, they pulled the bed sheet away and checked their pregnant bellies. To be sure, both were still extremely large, especially by human metrics. But they were no bigger than when they started that night, with one of Sarah's hands and five of Leah's still held tight against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what, what?\" Jade asked, hurrying into the room. She was mostly naked, save for a shiny metallic bra and underwear that did not stop her own huge breasts from bobbing and jiggling all around. When she came in, she saw the two of them caressing Sarah's pregnant belly and Jade scowled. \"Sis, you never fail to piss me off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss you off?\" Leah stammered, still worked up from the nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a pregnancy fetish too? No wonder you came to Earth, a planet filled with reproductively-rich women and tried to find a womb to fill up,\" Jade said, crossing two of her arms against her purple bosom. \"No fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I dont have a pregnancy fetish!\" Leah said quickly, pulling all of her hands from Sarah's middle. \"And getting Sarah pregnant was a total mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that you have, you get to touch her all you want. Me, I have to keep my hands to myself unless I want to start a second family inside her,\" Jade said with a sigh. \"And I have thought about it too...having babies with someone as beautiful as Sarah would be a dream come true. But my children cannot grow up side-by-side with their cousins. Doesn't seem fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...a little uncomfortable with all of this,\" Sarah said, batting big red doe eyes at Jade. \"Could you please give your sister and I some...privacy, early in the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade flicked her eyes between the two of them and scoffed. \"I'll figure something out. I'm not done with you yet, Sarah.\" As she waddled out the door, the two pregnant women from opposite sides of the galaxy turned and looked into each others' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do you have a...a pregnancy fetish</i>? Sarah asked telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! At least...I don't think so. I can find a pregnant woman attractive but a fetish</i>? Leah replied, her thoughts trailing off.<i>And that nightmare...do you really blame me for all this</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No</i>! Sarah said, putting one hand on Leah's belly. <i>No, of course not. It has all been a weird kind of accident</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, that's what it is</i>, Leah thought, a little melancholy hint in her thoughts that made Sarah frown. \"Anyway, we need to get you tested,\" Leah said out loud. \"C'mon, up and at 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah squeezed into some pajamas that were once very baggy but now clung so tightly that it was a little hard to breathe. She waddled along with Leah into the living room where Jade had some technology laid out. \"It's funny. I have an MD but the idea of actually having a medical test creeps me out,\" Sarah said, shuddering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All perfectly normal Muserian equipment,\" Jade said. \"Now, take off your pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes bugged out. \"Um, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for science. I'm not just turned on by you,\" Jade said, rolling her eyes. \"If it makes you feel better, my sister can do the tests instead.\" Sarah looked at Leah and the purple alien nodded with a little smile. Sarah sighed and pushed her sweatpants down her wide hips, showing her naked lap to Leah. Picking up a long clear tube, Leah gently pushed it inside of Sarah's birth canal. That made Sarah wince and close her eyes, never feeling anything go that deeply inside of her. She was a lesbian and had barely gone far with any woman, let alone a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it done yet?\" Sarah asked quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, getting some results,\" Leah said, showing the accompanying screen to her sister. \"Try just rubbing your tummy and relaxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said than done,\" Sarah pouted, stroking her pregnant stomach and feeling her alien fetuses kick and swim around in her womb. After a few minutes of silence, Sarah got impatient. \"Well?\"</span></div></div>",

This tech is beyond your species understanding, and yet it's still crap.\" Leah said. \"Guess that's what happens when you buy cheap, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Jade said. Just then, the monitor beeped. \"Alright, diagnosis. So it seems-\" Jade's words died in her throat as she looked. \"Um... so, I have three pieces of good news and three pieces of bad news. What do you want first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Give us the good first.\" Sarah said, now slightly worried. She looked at Leah, and saw that she was a little worried too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the first good news is that you aren't turning into a Muserian, Sarah. You're DNA is 100 percent human.\" Jade said. \"The second piece of good news is that you'll stop growing. Not for about 2 months, but you will stop. The last piece of good news is that you'll actually be able to be more then 15 feet apart much sooner. Instead of 30 years, it'll be just about a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least work will be much easier with only one belly bumping into things.\" Sarah said. \"So, we're ready. What's the bad news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jade began. \"Bad news number 1: until the month is up and you can be more then 15 feet apart, you will share pain. If Sarah gets hurt, Leah will feel it, and vice versa. It'll stop once the month ends.\" Jade said. \"Bad news number 2: if Sarah comes into contact with another human female during the two months until you stop growing, the other woman will become pregnant with no less then 20 fetuses. Touching another Muserian like me is fine, I won't get pregnant. Unfortunately. And bad news number 3...\" Jade sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you can't give birth. Ever. You'll both be pregnant for the rest of your lives.\" Jade said. \"Same with any woman Sarah touches in the next two months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Leah were silent. Slowly, they sat on the couch, making it creak under their combined weight. They looked at their impossible bellies, then at each other. Neither were rather happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... we're stuck like this? Forever?\" Sarah asked. \"I... I...\" She couldn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah looked at her sister. Or rather, glared at her. Jade sensed the anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me.\" Jade said. \"I'm not the one knocked up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything about why this is happening?\" Leah asked, venom in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade blushed. \"I... um... don't have the tech for that. It got stolen when I visited Pleasure Station 88112.\" She said. \"I wound up sucked in by the slot machines, and my ship was ransacked. They only took what they thought was shiny. So, unless you have that tech, we're at a dead end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah and Sarah looked at each other, fairly upset. \"So, now what?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know.\" Leah said. \"I don't believe this.\" Just then, the sound of a cuckoo clock was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Sarah said. \"I need to get to work! What do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade sighed. \"Go, but be extremely careful. And sis, make sure your Camo Flute is charged.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!\" Leah yelled. Then she and Sarah got up. \"Come on, let's go get changed.\" Then the two of them waddled upstairs. Jade looked rather upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable.\" She said. Then she looked at the monitor. \"I need some genetic sampling equipment. That lab won't have it. Humans haven't mastered sub-atomic genetic code checks yet. There's only one space station that has it in this sector of the galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Sarah and Leah waddled down the stairs, fully dressed. Sarah sighed. \"Well,\" she said. \"Today's going to be a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\" Jade said, then looked at Leah. \"Sis, I need to go to Orion 119. They'll have the equipment to check Sarah's genetics. Hopefully, we'll get answers then. With warp drive, I can be there and back in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah nodded. Then, both sisters turned on their Camo Flutes. Ready, the three of them squeezed out the front door, Sarah and Leah heading for the lab, and Jade heading for her ship.<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\nAt the lab, Sarah and Leah waddled into the lobby. They could just feel eyes on them as the waddled through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Everyone's staring.</i>' Sarah thought to Leah. '<i>I expected it, with, well, how we look, but it still feels weird.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I know.</i>' Leah thought back. '<i>Let's just hope we get through today without incident.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them made it to Sarah's workstation. Gently sitting down, Sarah saw a file on her desk from the nanobot department. She opened the file and looked at it. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sarah. Maria called in sick. Something about a stomach flu. But she was supposed to help with the neural upload links in the nanobots, and requested you take over. If you aren't getting ready for maternity leave (yes, I heard about the surrogacy. News travels fast here.), come to lab 9. Signed, Ivan Drake.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neural upload links?\" Leah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a pet project of Ivan's. He thinks it's possible to upload a persons mind into a swarm of nanobots, and then reform the body. Wants to be a superhero with it.\" Sarah answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like the Gem Beasts on my planet. Their bodies are made of millions of tiny gems.\" Leah said as the two of them got up. They only got three feet away from the workstation when someone approached them. That person was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leah could feel the emotional information spread back to her through the shared telepathic link and couldn't help but blush as well, her head filled with various, warm images of Mira throughout Sarah's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Sarah,\" Mira said quietly, crossing her hands behind her back. \"Did...everything go okay with you and Leah's sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, yeah,\" Sarah mumbled, nodding while not keeping her big red eyes off of Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed kind of...tense between the two of them,\" Mira said, leaning in to whisper. Sarah leaned back, careful not to touch her skin against Mira's. One errant brush or bump and Mira would be in the same boat as Sarah: huge, pregnant, and stuck that way forever. The reality of her situation had yet to really sink in for Sarah but she knew she did not want to put that burden on anyone else. She had already done it to Maria and maybe even Karen too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sarah pulled away, Mira pulled back as well and looked disappointed. Sarah saw the change in her expression and sighed, stroking her aching, enormous pregnant stomach. \"Things are okay. They're sisters so they fight. You know, typical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, really. I'm an only child,\" Mira said with a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Sarah said with a grin back. When she heard Mira's laughter, she couldn't help but crack a smile. \"I guess I'm just making assumptions. But I didn't know you were an only child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't know you were either. There's a lot we don't know about one another,\" Mira said, laughing again. \"Like I never would have guessed you would become a pregnancy surrogate. How long until you hit your due date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue date. Sarah gulped and felt her heart sink. \"Um...still need to check with the doctor but it can't be too long.\" She looked down at her stomach, so large it filled her field of vision, and gave it a slow, somber rub. \"But it's so big, it feels like it may never go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I'm sure it's not that bad,\" Mira smiled, starting to reach down to touch it. \"Talk like that and you're making me curious about what being pregnant is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped and stepped back again, avoiding letting Mira touch her belly. If she had been a few seconds slower, Mira would have learned first hand what being pregnant is like. \"Sorry,\" Sarah squeaked out, scratching her forehead. \"I'm just a little tired and cramped. I don't feel like having my belly rubbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I should be saying sorry,\" Mira said quickly. Now she was the one blushing brightly. \"I should have asked to touch. Just because you're pregnant doesn't make your stomach public property or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, being a mother-to-be has its own blessings and burdens,\" Leah said, putting her hands on Sarah's shoulders and leading her away from Mira. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;Better be more careful. As a Muserian, I'm used to making sure not to touch unsuspecting women but you are new to this&lt;/i&gt; Leah communicated to Sarah secretly. &lt;i&gt;Let's get you out of here&lt;/i&gt;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;I'm sorry. Mira just...disarms me&lt;/i&gt; Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira, it's good to meet you again,\" Leah said with a big, phony smile. \"But Sarah and I are late going to lab 9 so we will have to chat later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lab 9? Oh, are you working on Dr. Drake's nanobots too?\" Mira said, gesturing between the two of them. \"Great, we can all be in the lab together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Leah looked at each other with surprise. &lt;i&gt;Did you know about this?&lt;/i&gt; Leah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mira...I thought you were just in the chemistry department,\" Sarah said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I may not have your many PhDs but my chemistry degree included a focus on liquid physics and that has a lot to do with how the nanobots are supposed to be transmitted,\" Mira said, giggling and leaning in to whisper again. \"But between you and me, I think Dr. Drake's plan isn't going to work. He's bringing you in to clean up his mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled, feeling warm between her huge, heavy breasts with Mira complimenting her know-how. Most people either brought up her immense intellect as a way to call her different or only complimented her looks. But Mira was always special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, let's get to work,\" Sarah said, turning and slowly waddling down the hall. Sarah and Leah's stomachs wobbled and bounced with each lumbering step, taking them off course constantly and forcing the two women to pivot their wide hips to stay on track. Sarah could already not fit into hardly any clothing but she was feeling her pants and shirt get tighter and ride up her smooth, firm skin more and more as she moved. By the time she got to Lab 9, half of her nipples were starting to show. Luckily for Leah, her camouflage flute meant the fake clothes she created always remained in proper condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab was empty save for the three of them. Mira found a note on the main table and read it out loud. \"'Sarah, everything with the neural links is ready for your inspection. I am in a meeting and cannot attend. Ivan.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's just us,\" Leah said, glad no one else would come in and increase the odds Sarah might impregnate them by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such typical bullshit from him. He's in a high enough position that he can skip or attend any meeting he wants and he knows the schedule way in advance. Like I said, he wants you to do all the hard work,\" Mira scoffed, turning to Sarah. \"You need to stand up for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah froze for a moment. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, you let people walk over you way too much. I know you work out like crazy but you are way too timid. Just tell people what you want, and more importantly, what you deserve,\" Mira said, her eyes glowing with passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;What I want...&lt;/i&gt; Sarah thought to herself, alerting Leah immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;Not a good time&lt;/i&gt; Leah interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira, for a long time, ever since we started working together,\" Sarah began to say, her voice trembling, \"all I've wanted is...oof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah doubled over, clutching her pregnant belly. Leah winced and did the same, feeling her disguise start to fluctuate. Mira looked at the two of them with concern until Sarah's belly began to expand. At first it just looked like a big exhale but it continued, pushing her to get rounder and wider, making Sarah and Leah's bodies bend back to hold it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Sarah!\" Mira finally snapped. \"What's happening to you?\" She looked at Leah and saw the tan skinned brunette flash between having purple skin and orange hair. \"And what's happening to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira, urgh, I can...explain it all,\" Sarah said, trying to stand tall. Then, another growth spurt hit, this one far less gradual. As Sarah's stomach shot forward, it hit the shelf in front of her and knocked down a large jar. \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the nanobots and it smashed on the floor, sending up a cloud of the tiny robots that entered the body of-</span></div></div>",

Sarah tried to call out, but could only grunt as her belly continued to expand. Eventually, the entire cloud vanished into Mira's mouth as she coughed. At the same time, Sarah and Leah's bellies stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Leah stood up fully, their bellies now only a few inches above the ground. Shakily, the two of them waddled over to Mira, who was coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira, I'm so sorry.\" Sarah said, worried. \"I didn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize.\" Mira wheezed. \"You can't control growth spurts. But what happened to Leah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed. \"Well, guess I should tell the truth.\" She said. \"You see, Leah's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get to finish as Mira suddenly clutched her arm. Pulling up her sleeve, Mira was shocked to see her skin was turning silver. It continued to spread all over her body very quickly, with even her hair changing to a sliver color. After just a few seconds, Mira's entire body was silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Sarah said, worried. \"This can't be good. We need to get Mira to the medical lab, fast!\" Suddenly, she felt somthing cold and metallic on her hand. Looking, she saw that Mira had grabbed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira, no!\" She yelled, bracing for Mira's belly to swell. But surprisingly, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Mira's not growing?</i>' Leah thought to Sarah. '<i>But didn't Jade say-</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Her hand.</i>' Sarah interruped. '<i>It feels like... metal.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Mira.\" Sarah said, \"We'll figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that, the three of them hurried out of the lab.<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on Orion 119, Jade had just finished up her shopping. She finally had all the tech she needed to scan Sarah properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright, just need to head back and set this up. Maybe we can finally see what's going on with Sarah.' Jade thought. 'This could be a scientific breakthrough in Muserian history. And honestly, it doesn't hurt that Sarah looks amazing now. That gorgeous belly... and she gets to keep it forever.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade reached her ship and got in. She looked at the dashboard and saw that she had a message from Leah. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis! Problem with Mira! Get back here soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's eyes widened and she started her ship. She had to get back to Earth now!<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\nBack on Earth with Sarah and Leah, the two of them were sitting outside the medical office, waiting while they examined Mira. Both of them were very worried for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked down at her massive belly. She couldn't even see the floor past it, and she could feel her belly was touching it. And it was popping out of her shirt for everyone to see. Surprisingly, there wasn't a single stretch mark. Sighing, Sarah gave her belly a slow rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah, who had managed to get her Camo Flute working properly again, looked at Sarah. She knew Sarah felt like this was her fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah,\" Leah said. \"Don't beat yourself up. This wasn't your fault. We can't control these growth spurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was still my belly that knocked down the jar.\" Sarah replied. \"These behemoth bellies are causing us nothing but trouble. And worse, we're stuck with them forever. How are we going to explain this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\" Leah said, rubbing Sarah's belly to calm her down. \"Right now, Mira's the one who needs help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door opened and one of the doctors stepped out. Sarah and Leah slowly got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how is she?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she stable now.\" The doctor said. \"But we'll need to contact Ivan to check the nanobots. But for right now, all we do know is that her skin has completely converted to metal. She still has her sense of touch, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. At least she's OK right now.\" Sarah said. \"Is there anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is one thing.\" The doctor said. \"You see...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am not an expert in robotics by any means but your friend...she has more nanobots inside of her than when she came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blinked, registering the news. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nanobots are so small, they are a part of her body now and she appears to producing new ones, almost as if they were blood cells or blocks of protein,\" the doctor said. \"All of the robots are still circulating around her body so it does not look like she is in any danger from them but as I said, I am not an expert. She will require further check-ups or, in her case, a maintenance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped, one hand slowly stroking the side of her belly. She knew what it felt like to have something suddenly moving around inside of your body but at least with Leah's fetuses, it was something she could wrap her head around. But lots of nanobots crawling around inside of her cells...the idea made her skin crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we talk to her?\" Leah asked, interjecting since she felt Sarah begin to zone out from discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better yet, you can take her home,\" the doctor said, gesturing into the surgery room. \"But someone should be with her the whole time. We don't know when her condition will take a turn for the worst and I'd want someone there to call an ambulance or take her in personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Sarah said with a nod, waddling in with Leah to the surgery room. She stopped in her tracks immediately as she saw Mira start to put her clothes on. She was not fully naked, with a modest bra cupping her generous breasts and a white lacy pair of underwear around her hips covering her flowery lap. It had been so long since Sarah saw a non-pregnant woman up close that she almost got confused at how small Mira's stomach was. She did not have Sarah's physique so it had no definition but it looked soft and inviting. Her hair fell playfully around her shoulders and back and Mira tucked a lock behind each ear when she saw Sarah. \"S-sorry,\" Sarah said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you're sorry, you should probably look away</i> Leah telepathically said, elbowing Sarah a bit. <i>With those big red eyes, it's easy to tell when you're staring.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay. I am just about done,\" Mira said, buttoning up her shirt and pulling the zipper on her pants. Her skin was still a bright silver color and her body was exhibiting more changes. Each eye was much whiter than before, her iris turning a milky color. Also, her hair was starting to turn an even darker shade. \"Would you be okay taking me to my place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's fine,\" Sarah gulped. As she tried to awkwardly turn with her huge belly and butt, Mira glided past her, touching Sarah's exposed skin with the back of her arm. Again, there was no change in Mira's body the way Jade said there would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is going on? Can I touch women after all?</i> Sarah asked Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It must just be the nanobots. It's given her a filter or something</i>, Leah replied. <i>I called Jade and she might have some answers or some gear to examine Mira. The two of them are friends of some kind, by the looks of it</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole car ride to Mira's place, Sarah's secret crush slept the whole time. And she was out cold, with no amount of noise or music waking her up. Sarah and Leah could talk out in the open without worrying about her hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she is the only woman who I can't impregnate forever, then...\" Sarah started to say, her voice drifting off. \"I have to do it. I have to tell her how I feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how will you explain the 'pregnant forever' part? You don't know how long your lifespan has been increased either,\" Leah said. \"And she is not the only woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still touch...Muserian women,\" Leah said, using her camo flute to hide her blushing. Sarah did not have that luxury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...I guess that's true,\" Sarah said, her hands trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hurried to get Mira back into her home, using their collective strength to carry the sleeping scientist into her apartment. Sarah watched her tranquil face for a minute, rubbing her belly and wishing she could crawl into bed with Mira. Leah watched this and had to stroke her own stomach slowly, lingering on each pass of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Mira bolted upright and made the two pregnant women shout. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you,\" Mira said, wincing and rubbing her head. \"That was...sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure was,\" Sarah said with a nervous laugh. \"Bad dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was kind of like a dream. My mind was coursing through all this electricity and I felt it retreat back into my body...\" Mira said, her voice drifting off as she raised one arm, looking at her metallic skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably just because you've had a long day,\" Sarah said. \"Get some rest and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mira's skin started to change color. It shifted through dark brown to pale white to green and blue and polka dot until she settled on her original tone. \"There we go. Actually...\" She added a small tan to it. \"There. I might as well beat the Summer season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Mira?\" Sarah said, looking at Leah nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm getting the hang of this,\" Mira said, getting out of bed and walking toward the two women. Mira looked at Sarah's chest and, gradually, her own breasts expanded to Sarah's cup size pre-pregnancy. \"There. I always wondered what this would feel like. But it's heavy enough already. I don't know if I can go as big as you are right now. At least not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I think these nanobots are starting to have an effect</i> Leah messaged to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mira narrowed her eyes and gestured between the two of them. \"Wait a second...Leah, you are vibrating at a different frequency than Sarah. And you have this strange energy around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see all that?\" Leah asked, her voice sinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nanobots are doing amazing things with my vision. It's like having a super computer at all times,\" Mira said, pointing to her pale eyes. \"But it's weird. Are you feeling alright?\"</span></div></div>",

Then she turned to Mira. \"Are you feeling alright? You seem more... busty then last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira grinned. \"It's the nanobots. I can change how my body looks with them.\" She said. \"Watch.\" She then proceded to decrease her breast to their original size, before inflating them again to Sarah's pre-pregnancy size. Then she lengthened her hair, and increased her muscle size a bit, looking more athletic. \"Pretty neat, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking this very well.\" Jade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is freaky, but still cool.\" Mira said, then she yawned. \"Sorry, I need to take a nap. I think my change drained a lot of energy.\" On that, Mira laid back in her bed and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the other three left the room. Once they were downstairs, Leah and Jade deactivated their Camo Flutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least she's fine for now.\" Leah said. \"Mira grabbed Sarah's arm, but she didn't expand. We're guessing the nanobots are creating a sort of barrier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds it.\" Jade replied. \"Look, I managed to get the gear I need. I just need to run one test on Sarah with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of test?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to draw a blood sample. The device can scan your blood on a sub-atomic level. Any genetic deformites will be found.\" Jade said. She then pulled out what looked like a orange scalple. \"Hold out your arm please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah did as she was told, and Jade pricked her arm with the device. Then she put the device in her pocket and started for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that's it?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade nodded. \"This thing is like a syringe, only it has a built in freeze unit. It will keep the blood chilled until I can run the tests on it. I'll have results by tomorrow. I hope.\" She said. Then she walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Leah sighed and waddled over to the couch. Slowly, they lowered their immense bulk on the couch, making the poor thing creak. Their bellies were touching the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has not been the best day.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it hasn't.\" Leah said. \"But, Jade's got the tech now, so hopefully we can find out what's wrong with us. And Mira's doing ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Sarah said. Then she yawned. \"We'd better get to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah nodded, and the two of them drifted off to sleep in their sitting positions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Sarah and Leah felt asleep, they settled against one another's bodies. Leah's big belly touched Sarah's and her antennae perked up and touched Sarah's forehead, a light glow emanating from the tips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dreamed as one unit, finding themselves sitting in massive thrones, their bellies now grown to truly unbelievable sizes. As it stood now, the two women were big enough that it looked like they were carrying two fully grown pregnant women inside them already, and pregnant women near the end of their terms. But in this dream, their bellies were the size of trucks and the two women were sticking out of it on the end, a pair of relatively small arms, legs, breasts, and a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir maternal stomachs were glistening and glowing, both from being polished and adorned and also from their naturally beautiful skin. Their heads lolled back and forth as they cooed and rubbed the kicking young inside their wombs, occasionally helping one another by reaching the short distance to touch the firm round skin of the other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to me,\" Sarah whispered in a breathy voice, holding one of Leah's six arms against her swollen size. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Leah said, sighing and leaning in with her hand, exploring more of Sarah's bump. \"I would have never known this joy back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Sarah, Leah?\" Karen's tiny voice squeaked up. Sarah turned back, her eyelids heavy over her bright red eyes. Her frightening white hair was done up in a series of buns, held in place and decorated with gold bands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move closer, my child,\" Sarah purred, running her hand slowly up and down the top of her pregnant stomach. \"Let me see your face.\" It was not just a power move on Sarah's part. She couldn't see her knees, her thighs, or really anything in front of her for a few yards. Her belly was just too large. Slowly, Karen made her way up the steps of Sarah and Leah's dais, her middle also swollen and rounded to new proportions and sizes. \"Hello Karen,\" Sarah said with a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Karen said, giving a polite bow, clutching her belly as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for that. You know I treat you all as my friends...and lovers,\" Sarah chuckled. \"Now, how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren gulped. \"Maria sent me. As we expand our facilities past the asteroid belt, we are running into complications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it in proximity to Jupiter?\" Leah asked, leaning her head forward to see Karen. Not only were their bellies a hinderance but each of their breasts was now as big as their bellies when Leah first grabbed Sarah in that barn so many years ago. \"This is what I told you about, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have planned for this,\" Sarah said, grabbing a long writing implement. Quickly, she scribbled out a large formula on the side of her pregnant belly. \"Show that to Maria. It should at least put you on the right path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Karen exclaimed, struggling to genuflect with her enormous middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, don't do that!\" Sarah laughed. \"You do not need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I don't need to...but I want to. We all do,\" Karen said, kissing Sarah on the belly. Not in a sexual manner but out of respect. \"We owe you so much. All of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen scurried off, Sarah sighed and turned to Leah, shaking her head. \"A small price to pay for giving our help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah smiled and took Sarah's hand, letting their fingers interweave. \"You carry the burden well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Mira's voice cooed as Sarah felt a pair of hands grip her shoulders and begin to massage. \"Long day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Sarah snap awake and Leah flinched in bed as well, their telepathic connection disturbed by the strong and sudden alertness. \"I think you were more in control of that dream than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was sweating and trembling in bed, one hand touching her forehead and trying to push the strands of white hair out of her face. \"D-d-do I act like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that,\" Leah said. At first, Sarah looked at Leah in surprise but then relaxed. \"Yes, we dream together. You can't be shocked by now with everything going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Sarah said, touching her hand between her breasts to feel her heart rate and settling herself down. \"But that was so strange. I'd be less disturbed if it was another nightmare but that was...nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's your brain's way of telling you to relax,\" Leah said, cuddling against Sarah and touching her head. \"If...if we can't reverse this permanent pregnancy and extended life span, that means more time for you to use your amazing mind to help people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah scoffed. \"If they didn't listen to me when I was just a little curvy, they won't listen to me when I'm a pregnant battleship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or they will</i>, Leah said telepathically. Their eyes met and Leah's lips quivered above Sarah's. But they did not go the final distance. <i>Do you still love her</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah did not need to ask \"who.\" <i>Yes</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then tell her</i>, Leah sighed, touching antennae again. <i>Everything is changing so fast, you better do it now or who knows what might happen</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded and got out of bed. She thought about getting dressed but decided against it. She wanted to make this statement directly. Sarah waddled into the living room, with Leah testing out the distance of their connection, peering around corners so Mira could not see her too. \"Mira?\" Sarah called, trying to get her houseguest to come to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, and awake,\" Mira called back. \"It's weird. My brain is so much more efficient now. I didn't need very much sleep so I used the rest of the night to try and see what else I could do to my body.\" She walked in to the living room, her skin with even more of a glow than Sarah's. Her hair was bright red with orange and yellow tips near the end. Her muscles were more defined and shaped than even Sarah's, especially her abs. Mira's eyes now had a slight golden ring around her iris and she was smiling as if nothing had happened to her yesterday. \"What is it?\" She giggled. \"Need help getting dressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, um, Mira,\" Sarah started to say. \"I...</span></div></div>",

I can't hide it anymore.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira raised an eyebrow. \"Hide what?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feelings.\" Sarah said. \"When I first started working at the lab and met you, I fell for you hard. You're so beautiful, and smart, and nice. I knew I wanted to be with you, but I just couldn't work up the courage to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira looked at her for a moment, then grinned. \"Sarah, I already know.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not very good at hiding your feelings.\" Mira said. \"I've seen the way you look in my direction during meetings, you always want to work with me on projects, and don't think I can't tell when your staring at my butt when I walk down the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled. \"Well, I would like to try a relationship. But, I'm not sure you'd be ok with... this.\" She said, motioning to her collosal belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, I have nanobots flowing through my bloodstream, and I can reshape my body. I think I can get used to your belly.\" Mira replied. \"Besides, I think it looks nice on you. And before you ask, no I don't have a thing for pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled, and was about to say something when Leah walked around the wall, back in her disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Sarah. I knew you had it in you.\" Leah said. \"Now, sorry to interrupt this lovely moment, but we need to go see my sister. When we get back, you two can have all the time you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira nodded. \"OK. Sarah, I would like to try a relationship. When you get back, we can work it out.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded happily, and then she and Leah waddled out the door. A few seconds later, the waddled back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can we borrow some clothes?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Sarah and Leah were now dressed and waddling down the street, bellies bouncing constantly. Both women were excited. Hopefully, Jade would have some good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I really hope we can undo this permanent pregnancy.\" Sarah said. \"I'm strong, but this belly is starting to get heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you feel.\" Leah said. \"But you know something? I'm glad I'm pregnant. I can't explain it, but I feel so sexy with this massive belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled. '<i>You're right. You make it work.</i>' She thought to Leah. '<i>I can't wait for the next growth spurt.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Yeah, I-</i>' Leah started to think, before fully processing what Sarah thought. '<i>Wait, what did you just think?</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes went wide. '<i>I... want another growth spurt.</i>' She thought. '<i>I can't explain, but... at first, I was worried about the spurts, but now, they feel amazing. Almost... addicting.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I... I'm feeling the same way.</i>' Leah thought.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Sarah and Leah waddled down the sidewalk, they passed by three women walking the opposite way. One was a young Asian woman with model good looks wearing gym clothes, her arms and legs bulging with muscles (though not as much as Sarah). Another was also a young woman, wearing very trendy clothes that exposed a lot of her pale body, with her feathery blond hair tied in a loose ponytail. The third woman was a middle aged Latina woman, walking slowly with a thick green dress on that covered up most of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah clutched her enormous stomach tightly, side-stepping the coming women and being careful not to bump into them. After all, now she had a responsibility to avoid contact with any other women or else they would be stuck in the same \"permanent pregnancy\" situation that she and Leah were in. Then what? Leah similarly showed caution in avoiding these women but she was not as skittish as Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is it bad that I'm thinking what I'm thinking?</i> Leah asked Sarah telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is it?</i> Sarah asked back, stroking her bump as she felt Leah's alien babies stirring inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It would be...kinda hot if these women got pregnant too. They are all so beautiful and seeing them with big swollen bellies would be amazing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bit her lip. She and Leah had only just now been revealing how they were starting to get \"addicted\" to their pregnancy and the increasing jumps in belly size. But getting turned on by other women getting pregnant? That was a lot different. And, Sarah hated to admit, was equally hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah...it would be</i>, Sarah admitted. <i>But...we shouldn't. It wouldn't be right to get them knocked up and stuck in whatever situation we may be in</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're right</i>, Leah nodded, waddling along with her partner here on Earth. But as they passed and both women turned to check out their fellow women on the sidewalk, they saw something shocking. All three women let out a grunt and gripped their stomachs. Each of them screamed with shock as their bellies began to expand, getting rounder and wider. For the one young white woman, her clothes did little to hide the progression of her increasingly pregnant-shaped stomach. The other two had to wait as their maternal bulges tore through their clothes. The rest of their bodies grew in tandem, with breasts straining the straps of their bras and their asses getting wider and wider to accommodate the new balance of weight on these women's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started to approach unnatural sizes, looking overdue with quadruplets and getting even bigger, their grunts of pain started to turn into low, steady breaths to manage the weight and sensation. The older Latina woman started directing the other women. \"It's Lamaze breathing, just like I did with my kids. Follow my lead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian woman, with her obvious athletic background, followed through much easier, her cheeks puffing out with her breath even as her forehead contracted with a painful scowl. The girl in hip clothes had a harder time, both hands struggling to rub all over her growing belly as she looked at it with panic. Her once petite, trim waist was now over-inflated and her popped-out belly button looked like a tab that was threatening to let all the air out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as their size slowed down to octomom-levels, none of the women looked comforted by the stoppage or seemed to even notice that they were no longer growing. They just looked scared and confused. Finally, the athletic girl turned to Sarah and Leah. \"Whoo, whoo...you two are even bigger than us? How do you get through it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Sarah stammered, her red eyes getting big with panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's get out of here!</i> Leah shouted psychically. Sarah agreed and the two ran away awkwardly, their bodies shaking and jiggling in every direction. As they ran, women who were unfortunate enough to be in their way felt their wombs start to swell as well, falling to their knees or crouching down to support their sudden pre-natal increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they made it back to the meeting point with Jade, Sarah counted 30 new women with big pregnant bellies. They couldn't tell for sure that it was because of them but...it seemed likely. \"Why are you two out of breath?\" Jade asked, all six hands on her hips. \"I know your pregnancies last a long time and you can't exactly hurt them but I wouldn't recommend sprinting all over the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ran into...a bit of a...problem,\" Leah gasped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant...women...\" Sarah replied. She may have been at the peak of physical training but running more than a mile while being <b>this</b> pregnant would exhaust anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, pregnant women,\" Jade nodded with a smirk, motioning to both of their enormous bellies. \"I noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, all over the place,\" Leah said, gulping a big breath of air. \"When we passed by women on the way here, they became pregnant. Much more than normal. They were bigger than we were when we first...met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep coming to me with new problems,\" Jade sighed, shaking her head. \"Though a few more pregnant women wouldn't be so bad, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed, finding herself agreeing with Jade deep down. She had adopted Leah's sister's pregnancy fetish. \"B-but putting other women in this position is not good,\" Sarah blurted out, half trying to convince herself. \"You have to admit that at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. I want my pregnant humans well cared for,\" Jade grinned. \"Give me your arms. I can run a test.\" Both women agreed and Jade gave them a quick scan, looking over the results in her Muserian computer. \"That didn't take long. I've got your answer right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" both women asked in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nano bots,\" Jade said. \"You've got a lot of them.\" They looked at each other in shock. \"Not as many as Mira, of course, but lots. In fact...\" Jade did a scan of the air around Sarah and Leah and came back with the same results. \"Yep, they are replicating and creating a small cloud around you. I'll bet if you check those lovely pregnant women you passed by, you'll find the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why?\" Leah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah already formulated an answer. \"We must have still inhaled some at the lab. And because of our mix of Muserian genetics, the nano bots must have picked up on your urge to reproduce. Now they're going into other women and, well, doing what they're programmed to do. Get them pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what?\" Leah said. \"This is a bigger problem than just us being pregnant maybe forever, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Sarah nodded. \"We need to act now.\"</span></div></div>",

Hence, 25 or older.\"<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Sarah said. She then looked down at her titanic belly. \"So, everyone will end up like us: hugely pregnant forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not forever.\" Jade said. \"I made a mistake. If you touch a woman, she will become massively pregnant, but it won't be permanent. I misread the reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's one good thing.\" Leah said. \"But something good always seems to be followed by something bad.

No way this is escaping the news.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at Mira's house, she was sitting on the couch watching a movie. Suddenly, a news reporter popped up on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We interrupt this program to bring you an emergency report.\" The female reporter said, hands on her desk. \"Unexpectedly, all across the city, women 25 and over are becoming pregnant. And not just pregnant, but extremely pregnant.\" The report then got up from her desk, revealing a beach-ball sized belly. She waddled over to a large screen with numbers on it. \"At least an eight of the adult women in the city have become pregnant. Scientists and city officials have been called to look into this. We will keep you updated as this develops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira was concerened. \"That isn't good.\" She said. Then she thought of something. \"Does this have anything to do with Sarah and Leah?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mira headed out the door, looking around frantically to see what might be going on. Women were getting pregnant out of nowhere for unexplained reasons and her recently impregnated friend Sarah had to be part of the cause. Mira still did not totally understand all that was going on with Sarah in terms of aliens and pregnancies and she had her own problems going on with nanobots and things as well. But by putting their heads together, Mira figured there had to be some scientific explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mira went down the street, her mind was racing. The nanobots that flooded her body, mingling with her blood stream and nervous system and muscles tissue were buzzing, all able to work at her command. With a little bit of focus, Mira found that she was able to exercise some level of control over these microscopic robots and was getting better and better at it as time went on. She dedicated her mind to finding Sarah, using every memory she had of the buxom, white-haired genius. Her smell, her heat signature, her individual body's vibrations, everything. Quickly, these thoughts kept intermingling with her images of Sarah smiling, laughing, doing anything that made Mira's heart fluttered. She did not know why she had put off her feelings for so long: she was in love with Sarah, and based on the red eyed scientist's confession, she was in love with Mira too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kept distracting Mira and she was unable to use her nanobots to locate her friend and possible lover. With a frustrated huff, Mira kept walking, eventually making it to the commercial part of the city. To her surprise, she bumped right into the, well, bump of a pregnant woman. It was not especially unusual to see a pregnant woman in the city but one as big as her was definitely strange. Mira ran into a middle-aged woman with pale skin and brown hair in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" the woman said with a smile, rubbing the side of her swollen middle where Mira bumped into her. \"You'd think after having three kids already, I'd be better about knowing there this tummy is going. Then again, this is a lot bigger than I ever was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Mira said with a nervous smile, darting around the pregnant woman. Then she saw, behind her, the whole city was filled with pregnant women. No woman who was out, save for some teenagers and some elderly women, were sporting enormously swollen stomachs. Each of them had pregnant middles that were bigger than the rest of their body and had either burst out of their clothes or the women had given up and rolled up their shirts and lowered their pants and dresses to make room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, mom, do you have to rub it so much?\" a teenaged girl asked her heavily pregnant mother as they both walked past Mira, her mother's bare brown belly on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush, your brothers and sisters are kicking up a storm inside me,\" the girl's mother replied with a chuckle. \"Trust me, when you get this big, you'll be caressing your womb all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira saw the hugely pregnant reporter on the TV but to actually see the city in a sea of impossibly large pregnant bellies was something else to behold. None of them were as big as Sarah or Leah but it was no less shocking. As she gawked and looked around, a woman around her age approached her, her tan belly oiled up with some kind of skin cream as the woman ran her slick hands all over her glistening middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how did you avoid being pregnant?\" the woman asked, pointing to Mira's flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I...um, I'm not quite sure,\" Mira gulped. \"When did this all start happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hours ago, I guess,\" the woman shrugged, pushing one hand into her lower back to arch out, accentuating the size and shape of her maternal middle. \"I was scared at first but seeing how everyone else is in the same boat, it's okay. I kinda feel like we can support one another. And to be honest...\" She leaned in to whisper to Mira. \"I kinda like being pregnant. The kicking feels fun and I think my belly looks sexy on me. It makes my boobs and ass bigger too, though not as big as yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira looked down at her chest, recently using her nanobots to give her a pair of breasts as big as Sarah's. She blushed and tried to shrink them down a little, making the young pregnant woman really look confused. As Mira was about to leave, her new mechanized body whipped into action and she felt a small electrical signal coming from the woman. \"Excuse me...would it be alright if I touched your belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch my belly? Sure, why not?\" the woman giggled. \"I'm letting everyone get a feel.\" Mira nodded and placed one hand on the woman's wide curves, sensing the presence of a few nanobots inside of her. Her stomach sank with fear that she might have caused all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you have nanobots, then that means...\" Mira said, theorizing that Sarah might have gotten some inside her too. Quickly, Mira's body snapped into action. Her eyes turned a white milky color and she began to sense out the next largest concentration of nanobots. She found a strong signal and assumed it had to be Sarah and Leah. In no time, she changed the muscles in her body, making her calves the size of basketballs and her back muscles as thick as an elephant's hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! I thought growing a pregnant belly out of nowhere was weird but you are intense!\" the young pregnant woman said just before Mira took off running, moving at speeds no other human could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, Mira was able to make it across town and to the secret location Jade was using to test Sarah and Leah. She was panting and dripping sweat, looking frantically for her love Sarah. The two spotted one another and hurried together, hugging and kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry!\" Mira sobbed. \"First you worry about me with the nanobots and then I do all this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this?\" Sarah said, then gulping. \"You saw the...pregnant women, I'm guessing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I do it? I did not mean to knock up all those poor ladies,\" Mira said, shaking her head. Sarah sighed and kissed Mira on the cheek, wiping away her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault. It's mine,\" Sarah said. \"I...my body is trying to make other women pregnant and the nanobots are spreading that out. All over the planet, by the looks of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This more of that alien stuff?\" Mira asked, getting Sarah to nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Alien stuff?'\" Leah sighed, turning to her sister. \"You hear that, Jade. We're just 'alien stuff.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't mean it like that,\" Mira said, blushing. Sarah giggled and kissed her again. \"This is just a lot to take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I have not gotten used to it either,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we should put our heads together and figure out how to fix all this,\" Mira said. \"Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, but I am just so tired and so frazzled,\" Sarah said, gripping her head. Mira let out a deep sigh and took Sarah by the hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...let me help you,\" Mira said, slowly pulling her toward a nearby bed. \"Let me help you the best way I can.\"</span></div></div>",

As they laid in the bed, letting their bodies rub together, Leah waddled in, her footsteps heavy from her own massive swollen pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sarah...telekinetic link, remember?\" Leah said, her voice trembling. She could feel everything her human partner was experiencing. Sarah and Mira stopped, looking up at Leah's naked body in front of them. Her purple skin was glistening, her fat breasts were resting on top of her baby bump, and her six hands were rubbing it eagerly. Leah's sharp teeth were biting her bottom lip as her antennae quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can share that link if I want too, thanks to my nanobots</i> Mira projected at both of them. <i>Let's see what this is like if we're all using it together</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>D-do you want me to use my camo flute to get rid of all my alien looks?</i> Leah asked, touching her orange hair and hooved legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Leah, shut up and get in here!</i> Sarah projected with a giggling laugh. <i>You are beautiful, just like Mira</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just like you,\" Mira said out loud, nuzzling against Sarah's belly and kissing her on the bump. <i>I think I love pregnant women.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And I think I love being pregnant</i> Sarah moaned, feeling Mira's tongue against her sensitive maternal skin. <i>Use your nanobots on me</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To do what?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Make me bigger</i>, Sarah groaned. <i>Make Leah and me bigger</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira did as she was told, touching her hands to both of their large pregnant middles and letting the robots flow through their bodies. With a groan, both women felt their wombs expand. Mira's nanobots could truly do anything to their bodies, with a mix of human and Muserian codes inside of it thanks to her proximity to both of them. More and more babies were added to their bellies, making them grow and grow. Sarah and Leah groaned and howled with pleasure, rubbing their stomaches eagerly as they got bigger and bigger. It was not long before they forced Mira to move somewhere else, lest she be crushed by their increasing size. The bed creaked and broke under their weight but Mira kept rubbing their stomachs, feeling her energy flow through them and expand their wombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they came to a stop and Sarah let out a deep exhale, letting her orgasm wash over her. \"W-why did you stop?\" Sarah panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira giggled. \"Any more and you wouldn't be able to leave this room,\" Mira said, climbing on top of Sarah's belly and sucking on her breasts, each now the size of Mira's entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to leave this room. Everything I need is right in here,\" Sarah smiled, kissing Mira on the forehead and taking one of Leah's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Sarah and Leah were about to kiss, Jade hurried into the room. \"Oh god,\" Jade moaned once she saw her little sister and Sarah. \"Am I having a hallucination? If so, I never want to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's real,\" Sarah smiled, patting her big belly. \"Looks like you aren't the only one with a fetish for pregnant women anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade grinned before shaking her head. \"Wait, no, I came in here for a different reason. Your friends Maria and Katie are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't seen them in a while,\" Leah said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, me either,\" Mira moaned, removing her lips from Sarah's nipples. \"What's up with them now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with me? Is that how you talk to your boss?\" Maria snapped, making Mira nervously hurry off of Sarah's belly. She may have been enhanced with nanobots but her boss's voice still scared her. Maria laughed and shook her head. \"Sorry, just a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Mira said with a chuckle. As she climbed down from Sarah, she saw Maria and Katie and gasped out loud. Both were hugely pregnant now. Not as big as Sarah and Leah currently but they were the runners-up. Maria's skin was still a light purple while Katie was huffing and puffing, both hands stroking her belly like crazy. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems the whole planet's pregnant. Everyone with a womb who's in the right age range, that is,\" Maria said, patting Katie on the back. \"And we got a double dose of whatever's going around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and since I'm a surrogate already, my body's processing it a little differently,\" Katie panted. \"I-I think it's making me...too horny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No such thing as 'too horny,'\" Jade chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a bad feeling about that,\" Sarah sighed. \"We have some tech here that can give your bellies a scan and we can try and figure this all out and make sure your babies are okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not about that anymore,\" Maria said. \"Sarah...you need to take over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take over the research?\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Take over the world,\" Maria said, bowing as much as she could with her pregnant belly touching the floor. \"You're the smartest person on the planet and somehow, all this preggo stuff involves you. If you were to start talking...every woman with a belly full of babies would listen and obey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Katie squeaked, stroking her impossibly round belly. \"W-we need a real leader. And I will do anything you want.\" She stepped closer and touched her stomach against Sarah's. \"Anything.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay,\" Sarah nodded, puffing up her chest with a big breath. \"I-I guess we should give it a try.\" Getting her and Leah through the doorways of Sarah's house took a lot of effort and even more lubricant but they were out in the open, waddling with help from Mira's nanobot-assisted super strength. They made it to downtown where newly pregnant women were looking at one another in shock and surprise, stroking their new swollen middles with gasps and coos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as they saw Sarah and Leah, they stopped. They had become instantly pregnant with far more fetuses than was normal and here were two of the biggest pregnant women they had ever seen, waddling right up to them. It had to be more than just a coincidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what is going on with my belly?\" a Latina woman in her early 30s asked Sarah, both hands running up and down her swollen belly, pushing far out from her waist and ripping her shirt apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no,\" Sarah said, gulping. She was still nervous talking with other people from her years of being shy and judged based on her appearance. \"B-but I think we might have some answers. If I could just get everyone's attention...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sell yourself so short,\" Mira said, squeezing her new lover's hand. \"Tell them you can fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know human biology better than me,\" Leah shrugged. \"Start talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah took in a cautious breath until she saw everyone looking at her. She had spent so many years being stared at, first for her strange hair and eyes as a kid then for her incredible figure as she got older. But these were not those same kinds of stares. These women were looking at her as an equal, as someone to look up to. They were all the same: pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everyone, please listen!\" Sarah said, her voice booming. Years of exercise and training strengthen her diaphragm and increased her lung capacity. \"I am a scientist who has been dealing with my own...unusual pregnancy. And as the result of a lab accident,\" Sarah started to say, looking at Mira. Her girlfriend gave her a little smile and Sarah powered through. \"As a result of a lab accident, all fertile women are pregnant.\" There was a chorus of gasps and murmuring. \"T-they may even be my biological babies. We do not quite know yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do about it?\" one woman, a Chinese woman in her 40s, shouted back. She was very short so dealt with a disproportionate amount of pregnant weight. \"I already have four babies of my own. I don't know what to do with however many more are inside of me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs some other women started to complain, Leah opened her mouth and let out a mighty cry. It stopped everyone in their place and rang out across the city. She tapped her tuning fork against herself and dropped the camouflage. Now people really looked shocked, staring at a purple pregnant alien. \"Those singing pipes come in handy at a time like this. Everyone, grab hands.\" Reluctantly, the pregnant women did as instructed and the hands eventually linked back to Mira, Sarah, and Leah. Then her two antennae began to glow and they could all communicate telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It is not Sarah's fault. She has been mistreated by you humans all her life but she has always tried to help. And now, you really need her. She's the smartest on this whole planet and you should be thankful you get to even hear her speak to you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled, glad to hear her new friend from another planet stick up for her. <i>N-now, I have some equipment to do check-ups so I can make sure I know what is going on right now. But in the mean time, please spread the word about what we are trying to do because there are women like you all over the world right now who are scared and confused</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Leah's little pep talk seemed to work. In no time, Sarah not only had a few pregnant women to help her out and inspect them to confirm her hypotheses, but word spread all over the planet, in every language. It did not take long for television cameras to go in front of Sarah so she could broadcast her message and solutions across the globe. There was no way to reverse the pregnancies but she had a method to dull the nanobots, ending the growth of their pregnancies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Sarah worked up a storm, designing new medical procedures for multiple baby delivery that was healthy and safe for all involved. She also examined the brain of her and Leah and found ways to quickly transmit telepathic messages worldwide, provided they were brief. Mira aided her, using her scientific knowledge where it was applicable and using her nanobot-enhanced powers everywhere else. Jade's extensive knowledge of pregnant women also came in handy as Sarah looked for ways to care for the expectant women of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer work took Sarah far and from the confines of her laboratories, all authority on the matter was ceded to her. The nanobot pregnancies required the women to be pregnant for an additional year, giving Sarah plenty of time to roll out some other ideas she had been thinking about on how to get water and food to everyone, since the global population was about to see a big boom. And she had worked on some ways to set up colonies on the Moon and Mars too, y'know, in her spare time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sarah knew it, she was essentially the Queen of the planet, her off-handed suggestions being carried out by everyone. By the first few months, poverty and starvation were gone and there was quick headway on rolling back climate change and other forms of environmental degradation. The emphasis put on pregnant women not only ended most institutional misogyny but the telepathic communication Sarah developed helped more people talk with people of a different nationality or culture and everyone came close together, ending war and conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sarah was oblivious to much of this as she just kept working, keeping her new friends by her side. Maria and Katie took care of the details of Sarah's new position, not wanting to burden Sarah with the day-to-day of being an empress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've made good progress on this,\" Sarah nodded to herself after three months. \"I haven't heard any complaints from those women impregnated by the nanobots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, think they're mostly taken care of now,\" Mira chuckled, finding it cute how humble Sarah was. \"But there's still another problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah said, her voice squeaking. \"T-they aren't still mad that it turns out they're pregnant with my and Leah's babies, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not that,\" Mira chuckled, rolling her eyes. In fact, most people were thrilled at that idea, hoping for genius babies of their own. \"No, you and Leah are still supposedly pregnant forever, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, immortal preggos,\" Leah sighed. \"But...the way things are going, I think we'll have a cure for that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll take a lot of time and work but I think we have plenty of time,\" Sarah chuckled, patting the top of her enormous belly. With the past months, Sarah and Leah were now carrying pregnant bellies the size of a coliseum, the new Earth capital/laboratory being built around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in the meantime, you probably need some company,\" Mira smiled, holding up a small vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll stop my nanobots, but only for a few seconds,\" Mira said, injecting it into her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would you do that?\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this,\" said Jade, walking up behind her and clasping Mira on the arm. Both gasped as their bellies expanded, turning into perfectly round pregnant bulges, with four alien fetuses inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Mira huffed, stroking her new baby bump. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I think?\" Sarah said, smiling wide with tears welling up in her eyes. \"I think I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mira kissed Sarah on the lips, Leah leaned over. \"Actually, I could hear her telepathic thoughts and she had another idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm? And what's that?\" Mira cooed, pressing her forehead against Sarah's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said 'not a bad start but it could be a lot bigger.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End</span></div></div>",

Jade, can you see if you can contact your race and tell them what is going on here?\" Jade crossed her arms and said, \"Why?\" Then it dawned on her, Sarah wanted the Muserians and humans to actually live together for real and possibly see what the other races were that coexisted with them. Jade said, \"You want me to have my race mingle with your race? Well I suppose I can do that especially since our homeworlds are definitely very similar. But first I'll need some proof about how our worlds are very similar or they won't believe me. Got anything I can use as proof?\" Sarah pulled out a camera without saying a word. She asked the various women to do various things so she could take pictures of them and the surroundings. Jade said, \"That should be enough evidence. I'll see you all when I return and see how they respond to how your world is very similar to ours.\" And they saw her leave. Maria said, \"Why did you do that when you could just take over the planet with how things are rather in your favor?\" Sarah said, \"This is because our technology seems rather dated compared to the Muserians and by doing this we can get to their level and possibly have good relations with a new race and possibly get some trade routes between our planets.\" Maria said, \"That makes sense seeing how their technology looks far more advanced than ours. Plus it can allow us to possibly be able to finally do things we could only dream of before like moon bases, colonizing Mars, and more.\" She was clearly drooling. Sarah then noticed Jades ship return with a bunch of others behind hers. She knew this meant that the Muserians understood what was going on. Leah saw there being one other ship that looked different from the rest. Leah said, \"Oh my! Looks like the Muserian queen got involved. I can tell that ship over there is hers.\" Out came the fleet and the special ship the queen had its door open and out stepped the queen. The queen said, \"So youre Sarah, the one who can be considered the leader of Earth at this time. What you call Jade told me about what happened here and how this planet is very similar to our own. I am very interested in this planet being a potential secondary home world and if you agree to allow us to colonize this planet we will grant you all our technology.\" Sarah agreed to this and the Queen said, \"Wonderful! You can just call me Magasame and don't worry we are peaceful and from what I can tell, you and Leah started the process of getting your planet used to this already. Leah, I hearby promote you to Head fertility scientist due to how you played a big part in this.\" Leah squealed with joy at being given a promotion of that size. She said, \"I won't fail you my queen!\" The Queen said to Sarah, \"So where should we have our first colony at?\" Sarah knew of the perfect spot which is the Amazon Rainforest. She asked them to at least have it be off the ground but ensure they can still easily explore to preserve its beauty. The queen obliged. How much time has passed since this occurred?</span></div></div>",

They had large green eyes with red hair. What seemed like a male was wearing a tunic of sorts as his hair was like that of Nicolas of the Lord of the Rings. The female had long hair that dragged along the ground. She wore a long white gown as she his behind the male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe what I'm seeing. Real aliens.\" Sarah said as she gasped in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Told you they was real! But I wonder if they can speak?\" Said John as they crept closer. Sarah wanted to reach out only to find a forcefield of sorts. She pulled her hand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What planet are we on?\" Asked the male. This shocked John and Sarah as it knew how to speak their language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Earth. May I know your names?\" Sarah asked them polietly. She saw a disgruntled look on the female's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should say your name first! Don't you know your manners?\" Yelled the female. This somewhat irritated Sarah but took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm Sarah and this John. John is the owner of this barn you hid in. So your technically trespassing.\" Sarah said blantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are sorry for that. We have escaped to your planet and seek refuge here.\" Said the male<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.. Your names please?\" Sarah said as she crossed her arms beneath her breasts and tapped her left foot impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Salle and she's Vera. We come from a planet whose name you cannot pronounce in your language. Our planet was on the verge of destruction so we cane here to seek refuge as I said before. I apologize if we are being hostile, we are not allies yet and you might experiment on us as the stories have been told about you.\" Salle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry not all of us are like that. Sarah here is a lead scientist in the field of alien life. As well as many other things. I'm sure she'll be glad to help you out. Right, Sarah?\" John said as he nudged Sarah who looked at him with a worried look in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is exactly as he says.\" Sarah said as she showed them a couple of her IDs. The couple looked at them then at each other and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll trust you but first you must help us find our other family members. We got separated when we made our decent on your planet. We cannot locate them even with our locater.\" said Veda in a sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah knows a lot of people. She's the best person for the job... Hey wait!\" John said as he was pulled back a bit by Sarah who whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? If words get out that they're aliens. Who knows? What the government will do to them? You get it?\" Sarah whispered to John with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you suppose? We keep it a secret?\" John said as Sarah nodded. \"Fine, not like everyone believes me.\" Sarah sighed at his remarked they went back to the alien couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you out by finding a place you can hide and your missing family members. So turned down this shield and come with me.\" Sarah said as she tapped the forcefield. She saw a worried look on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,Sarah. The problem is we cannot move from this spot since we may be exposed to whatever sickness your planet may have. We luckily to make it in here before our suits ran out and deployed this shield.\" Salle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't stay here. People might find you here. The ones who aren't like me or John.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one way we can move with you without the shield. But you may not like it.\" Veda said with embarrassment. Sarah looked at them puzzled but shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is, just do it. The government might be here any second to get you guys.\" Sarah said as she looked around. Salle tossed a metallic bracelet in which Sarah caught. \"What's this?\" She asked. It was titanium in color and had multicolored gems on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wear it.\" Vera said as Sarah wore it on her left forearm where her watch was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah saw they were fiddling with something and a bright light flashed which caused Sarah to stumble backwards to John who caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! You alright, Sarah?\" John said to Sarah who turned to John and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm okay. They startled me. I wonder what they did..\" Sarah said only to see John stare at something on her body. She looked at the direction she was looking to see a large bulge beneath her T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to he kidding me... Don't tell me I'm....\" Sarah said as she traced her belly. She looked overdue with twins! Her breasts jumped 3 sizes as her pants were very tight. Then she heard a voice in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you she wouldn't like it.\" Sarah recognize the voice that was Vera's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, give me the heads up. I wasn't expecting this.\" Sarah said with a sigh as she cradled her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the only way we can go with you. We haven't adapted to your planet's atmosphere. We can communicate telepatically with you as long as you have that bracelet we gave you. \"Salle said. Sarah rubbed the spots where the moved as she bit her lip to prevent herself from moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how do we find your other family members?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There should be a locater by your feet.\" Salle said. John picked up a cellphone like device and gave it to Sarah as she examined it. It was definetly out of this world but it had a display and two buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should pinpoint when a nearby family member is nearby. It should pulsate.\" Salle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, got it.\" Sarah said as she took a step forward only tone thrown off balance by her new weight. She arched her back. \"Damn, this going to take sometime getting used to..\" She mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, John.\" Sarah said with a smile as John waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take good care of them. You're welcome here anytime, Sarah.\" John said as Sarah got into her sports car. She had to readjust her seat due to her belly touching the steering wheel. She placed the locater on her passenger seat. She revved it up and sped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seems that's all my current equipment can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had the most advanced equipment available to her. Most of which she helped develop due to partnerships with the companys involved. Neverless it was a breakthrough. Sarah was able to take a sample of the outer layer of the egg and place it a electron microscope as well as subcell defracturing of the specimen. Sarah toiled the night away wait became day. Taking breaks for food and coffee, calling in sick so she could study her subject. The egg didn't move at all but scans showed it was alive and well. Sarah could actually feel it pulsate with life somewhat. But with all the study and experiments there was one problem Sarah had with all this. It had been 28 hours since the discovery of the alien egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yawn* It seems none of my instruments can't pierce the egg. The cellulite is protecting it. Very interesting.

I feel so revitalized!\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah slowly got up as she sat on the side of her bed with her feet planted on the floor. She looked down at her body as she remembered she had the egg in her suit. She slowly got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. Why do I feel heavier? You didn't grow did you?\" Sarah said to the egg as she cradled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah went to her bathroom and stripped herself to her underwear. There she stared in awe and disbelief at the figure in the mirror. Sarah explored her body. She rubbed and examined where the egg was supposed to be but was now a part of her body. It was smooth and round but taut with no stretch marks, no veins showing. It was also her skin color. Her breasts had also grown larger but still remained perky and round. Those were the only features she noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening! I know! To the lab!\" Sarah said to herself in panic. She wore her nylon shorts and tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran as fast as she could in her pregnant state to her lab. There she frantically scanned her body and tested herself. Her scans and test proved her worst fear, she was now pregnant with the egg that had fused with her in her sleep. She sat in her lab chair as she rubbed the sides of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well it was a possibility since it was an alien and we don't know it's genetic structure of how it was capable of doing this. Since it was protected by it's outer shell. Well human pregnancy develop a similar egg shape when the fetus is inside the womb.</i>\" Sarah thought to herself as she went into a thinking gesture, her elbows resting on top of her belly. \"<i>Maybe it needed a body, that's one theory I could think off. This is most likely hopefully this isn't the last of it's species, wherever in the universe it came from.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rubbed her belly. She thought to herself again, \"<i>Well I can't let anyone at work know about this so I'll stay and work at home. No way anyone will believe I got instantly pregnant through experimentation or immaculately.</i>\" Then another thought came to mind, \"<i>Just what am I pregnant with?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her chair she was sitting on to where she placed a portable ultrasound. She struggled setting it up and interfacing it with her diagnostic computer. After successfully setting up, she lifted her tank top and placed the gel around her belly as she shivered at how cold it was. She then placed and glided the transducer around her belly to see what was inside of her. What she found was..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah opened the door and observed her visitor.  He was a slim, grave looking man in his mid thirties.  In his right hand he held a sturdy metal briefcase, and in his left he held his jacket over his shoulder.  His black shoes were heavily scuffed and in need of polish, and his black pants had traces of mud around the ankles.  His white sleeves were rolled and his arms had smudges of oil; his whole semblance gave the impression of car trouble.  On his torso was a mahogany vest over a black tie, loosened in the heat of day.  What stood out the most, which gave Sarah pause, was the man\u2019s head.  His hair was white, his eyes were purple, and he had a pale complexion.  She suddenly realized that she had met him briefly, but only once before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mr. Mallory.  What brings you here at this hour?\"  Sarah asked.  She had recently hired a company to do her DNA profile; Lawrence Mallory was an employee there.  Sarah hadn't known much about her family history, and her only living relatives had passed away several years ago.  It was only with a vague curiosity that she submitted for the test.  Her appearance of white hair and red eyes suggested a form of albinism, but she had never had any of the associated health issues with it.  Her sight and hearing were perfectly normal, for instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have your report,\" said Mr. Mallory. He indicated the briefcase.  He held it tightly, as if his life depended on it.  \"The findings were quite interesting.  Mrs. Havisham normally emails the results to our clients, but I thought I should bring it to you in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\u201d Sarah breathed, disliking the implication,  \u201cYes, of course.  Come on in.\"  Sarah opened the door and guided Mr. Mallory to the living room.  The man seemed to be at a loss for words, so Sarah tried to make him feel more comfortable.  \"Would you like anything to drink?\"<br>\r\n\"A water, please.  My car broke down up the road, and I\u2019ve been trying to get it to run for the better part of an hour.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.  You didn't have to bring the papers tonight if you had trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" said Mr. Mallory.  There was something greatly concerning him.  When Sarah gave him his water, he drank half the glass empty immediately.  \u201cI don\u2019t mean to alarm you, Ms. Evans, but our findings might be difficult to hear.\u201d  Sarah moved to the sofa opposite of his chair.  Now it was time to hear the bad news.  Was there a genetic condition that hadn\u2019t manifested yet?  Was she related to someone wicked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me,\" said Lawrence Mallory, \"what do you think is the inherent nature of human life?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"  Sarah asked, bewildered.  \"What does this have to do with my DNA test, Mr. Mallory?\"<br>\r\n\"Everything, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d<br>\r\nThere was a pause.  He didn\u2019t seem to know how to continue.  He was waiting for an invitation.  Sarah, however, was not up for philosophical debates at this time.<br>\r\n\"Mr. Mallory.  If it's alright, I think I'll just take my report.  My work day is over, and I think you\u2019ll need some time to get your vehicle towed.  It\u2019s best to get started on that now before the sun sets.\"<br>\r\nMr. Mallory was crestfallen.  He had apparently failed at something crucial.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry,\u201d he said,  \u201cAll I meant to ask was whether you think that we are born good or evil?\"<br>\r\nSarah gave a little huff.  She wasn\u2019t in the mood for strange questions from strange people.  However, she decided to answer briefly.<br>\r\n\"Neither, Mr. Mallory.  Morality requires an application of virtues, which newborns don't have because they lack knowledge.  Thank you for dropping off the report, Mr. Mallory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah received a large stack of carefully bound folders from the metal briefcase; the weight of it surprised her.  She then ushered Lawrence Mallory to the door.  Once he passed the threshold, he turned and politely bowed to her.  As she closed the door, she heard him whisper, \u201cGod bless you, Sarah Evans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to the living room and began to examine the contents of the folders.  The very first folder, much to her chagrin, was a collection of philosophical and religious essays on morality.  \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d she wondered.  At the very bottom of the folder was a collection of essays that she had written herself in graduate school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second folder was odder: it held a collection of printed articles from several media outlets.  Their focus was primarily on alleged corruption within several religious institutions.  Some of the headlines were simply salacious and conspiratorial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third folder was a collection of printed emails between members of the DNA company that Sarah had hired.  There was apparently some argument going on about their findings.  There were so many papers, but at this moment Sarah was simply skimming through everything.  She didn\u2019t know what the employees were arguing about, specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth folder was full of references to common genetic information.  Most of the papers were centered around reproductive health and gene mutations.  The whole experience was becoming weirder and weirder.  What in the world was this company doing?  Was there anything wrong with her or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth folder was about her.  Sarah paused at the sticky note on the top of the folder, which read, \u201cNephilim.\u201d  This was a scam, Sarah thought.  She skimmed even more rapidly over these final papers, which included a diverse gentic profile.  Certain genes, such as the eleventh, apparently had mild mutations.  What eventually caught her attention was a section that said \u201cConclusion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConclusion: Client is a descendant of Nephilim.  DNA profile suggests absence of atresia; ovum were not broken down as the client aged.  High levels of Anti-Mullerian hormones.  Undefined genetic abnormalities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah didn\u2019t quite know what she was looking at.  These freaks thought that she was descended from angels and demons?  She balked.  Had she really wasted her money on some kind of scam like this?  With a new feeling of unease she went back to the door and made sure that it was locked.  Mr. Mallory was likely just up the road, and she hoped that she wouldn\u2019t see him again.  As she checked that the windows were locked as well, she saw something peculiar outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a blood moon scheduled for tonight.  Although it was still the late evening, a peak of the moon was already appearing on the horizon.  At least, she thought, she could end the day relaxing with the stars.  She went to the kitchen and grabbed her favorite bottle of wine, set some relaxing music, and moved a chair into a prime viewing position.  She was a little tired from working today, and she allowed her eyes to close as she was bathed in the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed.  Sarah made a routine out of stargazing.  She always kept so busy with her research projects that she seldom had time to relax.  This was one of the few ways that she knew how to let go of her troubles and stress.  Tonight, as the sun set and the sky turned black, the blood moon was an exquisite sight.  She felt warm and elated looking at it, her imagination wandering into sweet nothings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she felt a little nauseous and dizzy, and positioned herself more comfortably in the chair.  That wasn\u2019t enough, though, and she went to get a light blanket and a footrest.  Once more, she attempted to let her mind drift into a peaceful bliss, but something was still nagging at her.  A mild queasiness and rumble in her stomach; when she placed her hand on it the sensation went away. Regardless of her discomfort, she inevitably drifted into sleep, unaware that something unusual was occurring within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of town, Lawrence Mallory was also observing the blood moon.  He was beset by grave doubts: what is humanity\u2019s nature, what is its purpose, and other complicated thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery man\u2019s soul is as a stone.  Whether one bears the beauty of obsidian, or the strength of granite, I know that by our actions we chip away at our basic exteriors.  We do this either with care or wantonness, but each crack at ourselves creates a more clear form to be presented.  If I crack my smile, will I make friends?  We use these sculptures to connect ourselves with other men, in hopes that others can see these forms with half closed eyes.  For our outer shells, if not likewise maintained, may betray the inward desire of our hearts.  As well, the hollow men can use their shells for perfidy and deception.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s more, can I properly carve myself into an Adonis before I have the strength to bear the chisel?  In early days it\u2019s with a mentor\u2019s assisting hand that I can wield this instrument, and only with his guidance that I know where to hit the point.  If then I am led false, can I correct the error?  Even worse, what if it be as the cynic suggests, and not every soul be similar, but many as loose as sand?  Can we then understand the same tools, and does that mean that we can be predisposed to destined evil?  I pray to you, God, and beg your forgiveness for my doubt.  For my part, I can only at this time have faith that good parents will raise good children, and I pray for your blessings on this earth and its people.  I also pray that you watch after Ms. Sarah Evans, whom I fear will face many trials ahead.  I ask you to protect her from temptation, and to deliver her from evil.  Amen.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But there was one thing about this woman that caught Sarah's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was pregnant, and hugely so. Her stomach was a vast red sphere the size of a yoga ball, and her breasts were almost as big as basketballs. Her hips were incredibly wide, and Sarah guessed the womans butt was just as big. Occasionally, a kick would come from the woman's womb. Both of the woman's hands were stroking her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sarah.

You will bring this army to term, and when they enter the world... oh, I simply can't wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I... pregnant?\" Sarah asked, even more confused. \"But, I've never been with anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you have not.

There were many reasons she wanted to shrink down, the most important being that she was overdue to spawn the legions of Hell. So that was a priority in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where do I even start?\" Sarah exclaimed. \"I don't think I'm qualified to find out anything. Hell I don't think I know where to start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sat down on a chair, which caused it to creak under her weight. Her stomach groaned with little tykes inside of her. Sarah grimaced before a quick thought flashed into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandmother's photobook!\" Sarah cried. \"I know she had some addresses and notes and whatever else. There has to be something for me to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah wobbled as she got up and waddled up her stairs. It was a tight and difficult journey but eventually she got up there. Going towards her room, Sarah's search for the book was straining on the large girl's body. More in tune with a slimmer body, a five-minute search turned into a fifteen minute game of \"can Sarah make sure she doesn't fall over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah eventually found the fruits of her labor as she brought up a green book with a picture of her younger self. Her mother smiled gently in the background. Sarah opened the book and stared at all the memories inside of it. Pictures of her younger grandmother all the way to the first years of Sarah's life. A thought quickly passed through her head, that she needed to continue to fill the book out of these days. Sarah shook that thought out and continued all the way to the back. There she saw what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grandmother was an avid explorer, alongside her grandfather. Notes,mementos, and a plethora of other things one could've possibly fit in a eight inch thick book. Some mementos were easily discernible, such as a picture of France's catacombs.Others not so much, such as a picture of a blurry animal.Her grandmother never did explain what some of these cryptic things were, but the ones she did explain always delighted younger Sarah. Sarah's eyes searched for something related to her current situation but most were about how her grandmother's exploration of the world. Fearing that she would get no anywhere, Sarah soon calmed down as she saw a familiar note. It had a symbol that always frightened her when she was a young girl,so much so that she never could ask her grandmother what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a horned beast she couldn't equate to anything on Earth. Steam blew from its nose and spikes were tied around the horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its probably this one.\" Sarah thought. \"Unless there's a note about fluffy bunnies behind it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah ran her finger across it and yelped as she felt something prick her finger. She pulled her hand back shaking it in pain. Her eyes looked down though in wide-eyed shock as the note glowed briefly before opening. Behind the closed flap were the following words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dear daughter, granddaughter, or any numbered descant of my line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fear that if you're reading this that the curse of our bloodline has appeared inside of you. Hopefully this story can help you in the coming da-\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah grimaced as she saw her grandmother's explanation was etched out. Which didn't make sense seeing as that would imply someone had access to her grandmother's book. Thankfully it seemed that at least some information was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"and I hope my story will ease your mind. For further assistance head to this address.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah quickly jotted the note's coordinates down, closed the book, and read the address. Hopefully she could get some answers there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She already didn't like talking to strangers and the only thing that made her more uncomfortable was having strangers talk about her appearance. Sarah knew her looks drew...attention but it didn't mean everyone had to make their opinions known about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't have anything else to say,\" Sarah fumed, ducking her head back inside her house, prepared to slam the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" one of the men said, holding out his hand, catching Sarah's attention. She stopped just before the door hit the latch and looked back out. \"I apologize, we were not clear before. We do not mean you any harm. In fact, it is very important that we talk with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah crossed her arms under her heaving breasts. \"Alright, fine. What do you want to say to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are supporters and clergy of the ancient diety, Olania,\" another man said, stepping forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped. \"Oh, you're door-to-door religious preachers. Well, I don't want any pamphlets or newsletters, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not here to preach or convert to you,\" the first man said. \"We are part of an order that reaches back through the millennia and we must keep our task in order to keep the chain of our works unbroken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starting to sound a little crazy,\" Sarah said. \"And I've never heard of this 'Olania' god you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has long vanished from the memory and history of humanity, but she once walked across the globe, visiting humans and spreading fertility all around,\" another man said. \"Without her, mankind would never have made it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fertility?\" Sarah said, taking a step back. Were these nuts trying to have sex with her? Sarah may have taken martial arts as a way to exercise, but she was more than capable of taking out a small group of weirdos in robes with a few quick kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should wait until our leader arrives to explain more,\" one of the hooded men said to his companions. \"Then things will be made clear to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" the first man said, and the group took steps back, returning to the semi-circle they were in when Sarah opened the door. \"We will wait for our leader to explain all to you. Then your questions will be answered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well where's your leader?\" Sarah asked, annoyed at herself for getting so curious about all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men mumbled among one another before returning to their stoic arraignment. \"Bad traffic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just great</i>, Sarah thought, closing the door and walking back into her living room. <i>A bunch of weird cultists who carpool to young women's homes. At least they're not doing anything now</i>. After checking that the door was locked, Sarah went to her bathroom and took off her sweatshirt and bra, looking over her still-sweaty body. It was too late for a shower \u2014 they made it hard for her to fall asleep for some reason \u2014 so Sarah wet a rag in the sink and ran it over her arms. It left a wet sheen in place of the glistening left by her sweat, but at least she felt much cooler and not as gross afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach pass by the rag let Sarah feel the tone of her muscles, thick when pressed against but soft and smooth when traced. She lifted her arm to wipe the sweat from her armpit, her equally-detailed back and shoulder muscles flexing in the mirror. Sarah wasn't a very vain person. Years of being teased about her ghoulish eyes and hair followed by unrelenting flirtation and pick-up lines did away with that. But as Sarah started on her path to her numerous PhDs, she took a more positive approach to her appearance and considered her muscles to be a sign of the hard work she'd put in to both her studies and her health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah heard the doorbell ring again and groaned, throwing her sweatshirt back on and zipping it up tightly to not let the hooded guys on to the fact that her bras were now out in the open. \"Still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Sarah's surprise, there was another hooded figure in front of the rest of the semi-circle. Well, that was't the surprising thing. What was surprising was that this one had the hood down, revealing that she was a woman unlike the rest of them. She also had a pregnant belly, sticking out prominently from behind her cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" the woman smiled, taking a few slow steps toward to the door. \"Your name is Sarah, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Sarah said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Nora and I'm the chief cleric of the Supporters of Olania. I'm sorry I wasn't here earlier, but now that I am here, I think I can answer all of your questions,\" Nora said. \"May I come inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah couldn't bring herself to leave a pregnant woman outside, so she let Nora get into the house, moving surprisingly quickly for someone with a pretty big belly. \"So, what is all of this about? What does some ancient fertility god have to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora chuckled and turned to Sarah. \"They explained a bit of it to you, it sounds like. Well I should clarify one thing. Olania wasn't a fertility goddess. She was just a goddess of pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That explains one thing</i>, Sarah said, blushing a little. \"W-well, thank you for straightening that out. Now, what does this have to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe that Olania is real?\" Nora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shrugged. \"Not really. I'm not going to cast aspersions on anyone's religion, but this is the first time I've heard about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should give you some more background, then,\" Nora said. \"Imagine the first humans. No written history, no knowledge beyond what they can immediately see. Now imagine one of them starts to get a growing belly. That would come as a shock, wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you didn't know what pregnancy was, it would come as a big surprise. Imagine going through childbirth without knowing what's going on. Imagine being the first woman to give birth to twins and the confusion that would entail. There were many things humans couldn't have known about pregnancy, but that is why Olania came to us. She taught humanity about pregnancy and, through her magic, pregnancy has remained with us,\" Nora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's not here anymore,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and that is where you come in. To maintain her magic, Olania reincarnates among humanity every few centuries. And that's who you are, Sarah,\" Nora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at her, confused. \"I'm some sort of pregnancy goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora nodded. \"And our task is to take the final step in letting the magic continue onto you.\" She tucked her arms into her cloak, opening it up and revealing that her pregnant belly was, in fact, a stone cast of a belly. \"This was a belly cast of the first reincarnation of Olania, thousands of years ago. Please, place your hand here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah hesitated before touching her palm to the stone belly. Nora sighed and smiled, closing her cloak again. \"It is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all?\" Sarah said, raising her eyebrow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we will take our leave now, although I expect we will meet again some day,\" Nora said, bowing. \"We are now, after all, your followers and supporters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as they came, the hooded worshipers of an ancient pregnancy goddess were gone and Sarah was back alone in her house. With nothing else to do, Sarah headed to her bedroom, undoing her ponytail and shaking her brilliant white locks out before slipping into bed, clad in just her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she opened her eyes, seeing a calm sky above her and a wide, endless meadow at her feet. As Sarah looked around, she felt strong, warm arms wrap around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my child,\" a woman's voice said. Its beauty and gravitas shook Sarah to her core as she turned around to see the woman, her skin shining like bronze, holding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do I...know you?\" Sarah said. As she asked, the woman lay Sarah against a massive, soft seat. Sarah soon realized it was the woman's gigantic pregnant belly, shining and smooth like the woman's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will,\" the woman said, kissing her on the forehead. \"And I cannot wait to get to know you better. I could not ask for a better child to carry on my work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt a rustling inside her own stomach and reached down to feel. She looked back up at the dazzling woman. \"Olania?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded again and put her hand over Sarah's six-pack stomach. Her touch was electric and it woke Sarah from her dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked around her bedroom, taking in deep breaths. \"What a weird dream,\" she said to herself groggily, looking over at her clock. Seven a.m., right on time to start the day. Sarah sat up and stretched out her back, feeling strangely heavy for some reason. Then she looked down and saw the source: she was pregnant. Very pregnant.</span></div></div>",

Sarah didn't get those by just buying of the Internet either. No, Sarah was scary smart, and always went for the most practical, sensible solution, and never let her emotions cloud her judgment and her thinking processes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah screamed her head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She tried jumping out of bed in shock, but the boulder of flesh that was her once toned stomach made sure that she wouldn't be able to get out of bed without some serious effort. Sarah wasn't a pushover though, and she was getting a serious boost of adrenaline thanks to her little episode. With a little exertion, (and five minutes of panic filled flailing), Sarah managed to heave her hefty frame off her mattress, it's springs groaning in response, and waddled her way over to her mirror.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sight that greeted her was beyond belief. The body in the mirror certainly was not the the one Sarah went to bed with. For starters, she was wearing underwear when she went to sleep. This body was most definitely naked. Sarah looked back to see that her bra and panties and been ripped and popped off her body in her sleep. As Sarah turned back around to the mirror, the culprits of this heinous undergarment crime jiggled back into her view.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah's hips had widened quite a bit, and Sarah could feel that her butt had expanded enough to make her think for a second that she was grabbing a pair of luscious clouds. Further up her body, her ass's two accomplices had exploded out of their 36DD prison. Sarah guessed she had jumped up a cup size. All of this, though, wasn't what made Sarah gape. That honor was held by her belly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was <b>massive</b>. In fact. it couldn't fit into the mirror, it was so big. Her stomach extended in front of her, a mass of flesh that, despite its hugeness, stayed firm when Sarah poked and prodded it. She noticed that the belly had a distinct lack of stretch marks anywhere, but it was a small thought compared to the overwhelming sight of a giant belly where her abs used to be.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was like there was a whole other person standing in the mirror, and that Sarah was only looking through her eyes for a day. But there was no mistaking that shock of pure white hair and bright red eyes, and when she reached her hand to touch her new \"additions\", the woman in the mirror had the audacity to copy her exact movements. There was no mistaking it, this was her body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Sarah was still in denial about her condition. \"<br>\r\nMaybe I caught a virus, a bug. Maybe I have a genetic disorder I wasn't aware of. Something has to explain this!\" she said, her mind racing through its encyclopedic knowledge of medicine and disease to find anything that could explain what happened to her, but nothing was coming to her, and that was a rare thing indeed.<br>\r\n\"I just can't be, It's impossible.\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And that's when Sarah felt a kick within her womb, and another on the opposite side, and a third kicking her in the ribs, and she screamed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">__________</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took an hour for her to calm down enough for the rational side of her mind to take over. Once she was in control, Sarah started to take stock of her situation and figure out what she could. Her PhD. in Obstetrics and Gynecology told her that, judging from the fetal movement, there seemed to be three children within her womb. But she looked bigger than any woman pregnant with triplets she had seen. Sarah guessed that, that since most Triplet pregnancies are full term at 36 weeks, the three little stomach invaders inside her must have somehow developed beyond full term. She guessed she might be full term with triplets.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, more than full term my child. You are quite overdue. 42 weeks, in fact.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sarah turned around as fast her gravid body allowed, uttering a shriek as she did so, to see the woman sitting on her bed. It was the woman from her dream last night.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Olania\", Sarah said, the name escaping her lips without her even thinking of it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The goddess smiled, \"Yes, my child.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The voice the was the exact same one Sarah had heard in her dream. It was still just as beautiful, melodious, and dignified as she remembered. That would have been okay, if that voice hadn't just come out of Sarah's body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In her Dream, the goddess had been beautiful, but, she couldn't exactly remember what she looked like. Now here she was, right before her, and Sarah saw that Olania looked exactly like her! She felt as if she was looking in a mirror, only the mirror was behind her, and this body in front of her did not copy her movements like that bitch in the other mirror. Olania had every little feature identical to Sarah, right down to her snowy hair and devilish eyes. But there was something different that set Olania apart from Sarah, a certain...Fullness. She had a natural glow about her, and she seemed to radiate contentment and confidence as she stood up from the bed effortlessly, and somehow managed to proudly, and sexily, strut and waddle at the same time over to Sarah. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah had finally had enough, and just before Olania was about to speak again, she let loose. \"You did this!\", Sarah said, pointing to her belly,\"you made this way! I have had enough of this morning! I am not ready to be a mother, I can barely deal with small conversation, let alone raising three kids! This can't happen, Its impossible! I demand that youuUUGMPH!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sarah's ranting and steam venting was cut short as Olania suddenly dove in and kissed Sarah. And oh boy, what a kiss! Sarah had never been kissed like that before! It was intense and reserved at the same time. Her lips were supple and soft and everything Sarah could ever want in a kiss. As soon as the God's lips met hers, Sarah melted into the sweet curves of the woman in front of her, as much as both of their pregnant bellies would allow. All troubles and worries were out her mind, and the only thing left was that kiss. The rational side of her mind was now questioning her sexuality, the emotional side only craved more of this kiss, and the immature side giggled at the thought that this could be considered masturbation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Their lips parted, and all Sarah was capable of saying was, \"Wow\".<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Goddess giggled, a sound that instantly made Sarah feel at ease and comforted, for apparent reason. \"I'm glad I can still deliver, even after all these years. But, don't get too excited there honey, it was a one time deal, I, or You, or Us, don't swing that way. Although I am glad to see that those People are getting more support out there today. I may not be a goddess of love, but that doesn't mean I can't support all forms of it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sarah blinked, the Goddess's voice changed. It wasn't that it  sounded any different, but that instead her tone was different. She was using modern terminology, making references to current issues, even being sarcastic and cracking jokes. All things an \"ancient\" goddess usually didn't do.  Sarah questioned her about this, and she smiled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You didn't think I kissed you just because did you? No, that was to catch up. I kissed you so I could see your memories and knowledge to learn everything you know about this new time and everything I have missed before, and my must say, you humans have been busy! I also must know how to act accordingly in this new time. A goddess has to stay in touch with her worshipers if she wants to be worshiped, and that means staying current with their lives and problems, so you can answer their prayers correctly.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah was surprised, and little hurt, though she couldn't understand why, that that kiss wasn't for pleasure. And Olania did seem to talk like a normal person now, no more, \"my child\"s and whatnot. Sarah opened her mouth, but she was interrupted by a horrible realization. A quick look at the clock confirmed her fears. \"Oh my god, I have to go to work!\" she exclaimed, \"But I can't go in like this!\" she looked down at her expanded gut, one of the children moved within her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Olania glared, \"and what's wrong with 'this'?\" she said, rubbing her own fleshy orb.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The problem is that I wasn't like 'this' yesterday! I gotta call in sick!\" Sarah replied as she waddled to the phone. Luckily, Sarah had plenty of personal and sick days on account that Sarah was Incredibly healthy and had next to no social life. With a quick call, Sarah was free for the day to figure out what was going on, whatever that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah waddled her away over to her closet to find what could fit her new physique. She was dismayed to find that her favorite outfit was the only thing that fit her, and nothing else, not even any of her undergarments. The reason the big hoody and baggy sweatpants were her favorite was because they hid her rather gorgeous body from onlookers and gawkies, and the hood and some sunglasses hid her more noticeable facial features. But now the prized out fit was the only thing that fit her, and it barely did that, the sweatpants were pulled tight over her new hips and bigger butt, outlining them perfectly in the garment. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The hoody was stretched across her new stomach very tightly, and she could feel a small strip of flesh poking out from underneath the overtaxed article of clothing. Her breasts didn't help either, as for them to be comfortable, she had to unzip her hoody to reveal quite a bit of cleavage, something that was not good considering she had no bra on, and was a jiggle away from revealing quite a lot of herself.  After a long battle with said outfit, Sarah managed to get to clothing on and make it look as conservative as it could, Sarah looked at her new self in the mirror, and sighed, already tired even though she only woke up two hours ago.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell am I going to do?\", Sarah said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah wrapped her hands around her belly and felt the three babies \u2014 her children \u2014 kicking inside her. Sarah had never thought about having any kids of her own because the idea scared her too much. She remembered being a little kid on the playground and having others tease her about her other-worldly looks. If she had children, would they get tortured the same way? Then again, Sarah's parents and relatives didn't have her icy white hair or burning red eyes. Maybe her children would look normal and be afraid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of having her own children feel alienated from her made a shiver of panic run down Sarah's spine. Standing up as straight as she could, which was certainly restricted by her pronounced curves, Sarah took in a deep breath, feeling it travel down her throat and fill her entire body before slowly discharging it. Years of learning martial arts helped Sarah learn these kinds of relaxing techniques when her social anxiety built up. Now after a few deep breaths, Sarah broke down what she needed to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first things first: I don't want to be pregnant,\" she said, putting her hands on her belly and looking down at it, getting an eyeful of her cleavage at the same time. \"And if I'm 42 weeks pregnant, I could go any minute. I should have my mucus plug checked but...I'd better stay away from any doctors or laboratories aside from my own. It would be hard to explain my sudden maternity, and even harder to explain how I got <u>this</u> far along with triplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned back to her bed and saw that the mysterious woman, Olania, was gone. Whether she was even real or not, Sarah had a hard time concluding. She did look exactly like Sarah, after all, so it could have been an out-of-body experience or a hallucination triggered by seeing her unfamiliar body in the mirror. In all of this, there was only one real, consistent factor: the cult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last people Sarah met were the cultists, the Supporters of Olania, and they talked an awful lot about pregnancy and their pregnancy god. One of them, Nora, even said that Sarah would have to take on her role and showed her a fake pregnant belly cast. Sarah felt her own belly enough to know that it wasn't a fake, but figured they could give her some answers or at least put her on the right path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how to find them?\" Sarah thought, crossing her arms and finding to her slight annoyance that her belly made for a good shelf. \"Sarah, you are a smart woman. You can figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the tricky part. To look for these people, Sarah would need to...go outside. A difficult enough task for someone as startling in appearance as Sarah, but with her new features, it would be even more shocking. She put on a pair of thick sunglasses and tied her white hair in a ponytail to make it less noticeable. The belly, the breasts, and the ass she couldn't do much about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, Sarah headed out the door and waddled toward the city. It took some getting used to for Sarah to waddle and found just walking around with a belly her size was a workout on its own. Sarah knew she'd gone through more rigorous exercise, though. She'd earned a black belt in kenpo, was working on becoming a seventh degree black belt in karate, won an amateur boxing tournament when she worked on her neurology degree at Johns Hopkins, and was even offered a prajiad by her muay thai instructor. No magical pregnant belly was going to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly wasn't easy, though. Her belly wasn't just weight. The squirming little ones inside her kept pressing against her bladder and pelvis, adding some particularly sharp bursts of discomfort. Her hoodie also rolled up every now and then, leaving Sarah to struggle and try to pull it down, lest too much of her bare stomach be revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlenty of her skin seemed to be revealed already, as she got lingering looks everywhere she went. Most people were too slack-jawed to give her any cat-calls as they looked at her humongous belly size, her ample, inviting chest, or her pronounced ass barely tucked into her sweatpants. A few guys managed to jeer and tell her to stop by after she had her kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't believe it,\" one man said as she walked by. \"Doctor? You...you wrote practically half the articles in the last New England Journal of Medicine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed and tried to waddle more quickly. She got plenty of attention for her looks, both the demonic side and the curvy side, but Sarah was also a near-celebrity in the scientific community for her work in so many disciplines. Doctors, physicists, chemists, mathematicians all knew about her. \"Sorry, you must be thinking of someone else,\" Sarah managed to squeak out as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sure it's you,\" he said, easily catching up to her in a few steps. Sarah underestimated how much this belly was restricting her. \"Please, your paper on the possibilities of vertical endoscopic suturing was brilliant. I'm the head of surgery at-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, sir,\" Sarah said, turning to him aggressively. \"This doctor you think I am: does she have a big, fat belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, eyes moving between her breasts and belly. \"W-well, no, I hadn't heard anything about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she's not me,\" Sarah said. \"Goodbye.\" It wouldn't be long until people knew that the super-genius, multi-PhD holding Sarah was, in fact, hugely pregnant. Word about her traveled fast and she saw enough people snapping pictures of her on her walk to know that word would get out. Sarah had similar press everywhere she went. Scientific websites included updates on her latest papers and degrees, martial arts websites detailed her latest belt achievements, and other, sketchy local forums had people collect photos of the \"Sexy Monster Woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah started rubbing her belly, feeling kicking starting up again. \"You'd probably get sick of seeing your mom's face everywhere on the internet, wouldn't you?\" she said to her hugeness, her cheeks blushing again as she realized that she was talking to her swollen uterus, full of children that weren't there the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Sarah was at the city's main library branch, sweat accumulating all over her sweatshirt and on her forehead. \"A little hot for those clothes, isn't it dear?\" the woman at the desk said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only thing that fits,\" Sarah said with a deep breath, fanning her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet,\" the woman said, adjusting her glasses at Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah went through the archived newspapers and city documents, looking for any information about the Supporters of Olania or any similar cult. After a while of getting up slowly, stretching her back, and even bumping her bump on the table a few times, the librarian started bringing books and newspapers over to her. Sarah smiled and thanked the middle-aged woman. In college she always had guys and girls running over one another to get her a pen or a beaker, but this felt much nicer. The librarian, who was in a \"Boston marriage\" in her younger years, enjoyed helping Sarah too for her own reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's monstrous intellect let her draw an assuring lead and she waddled back out the door, checking out a book on lamaze the librarian snuck in with her newspapers as well. A small blurb on a few papers pointed to a cult in the area and some other photographs let Sarah spot Nora. What she didn't notice was that the librarian's belly had gotten a little bigger and rounded since Sarah walked in the door and was slowly growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah waddled onto the West Street Co-Op Farm, walking through the accompanying market and feeling a strange twinge of hunger for very odd, very specific foods, until she got to the well-sized farm in the back. More like a garden with food, really. Lots of different fruits and vegetables were growing all around, with women of varying ages picking and cultivating the plants, wiping the sweat from their foreheads. \"Hi,\" Sarah said to one woman. She turned, only seeing Sarah's belly thanks to her crouching position, and turned her head up until she could also see Sarah's breasts. \"Is Nora here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman silently pointed to a pear tree where Nora was standing on a ladder. \"Nora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora turned around and gasped when she saw Sarah standing there, belly prominently on display. \"Oh my God, the prophecy was true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it's real alright,\" Sarah said, patting her tummy. \"And I think we need to talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora got on her knees. \"I am honored...may I...feel it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed. \"I-I'd really rather you n-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, my lady,\" Nora said, bringing her forehead to the ground. \"To touch the womb of the incarnation of Olania would be...what my whole life has been for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I let you touch my....my belly, will you promise to talk to me about all of this?\" Sarah said, looking around at all of the other women in the field looking at them. \"In private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Nora said, bringing her head up and resting her hand on Sarah's belly, not daring to rub. \"Incredible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rested her hand on Sarah's belly, Nora's own belly began to swell every so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we need to talk,\" Sarah said before a strong kick rolled her sweatshirt up some more, giving Nora a full-frontal view of Sarah's bare skin and popped-out belly button. \"And fast.\"</span></div></div>",

She didn't even let her closest friend get this close to her, let alone someone she just met yesterday. For most of her life, when people got this close to her, she was either mocked and, in extreme cases, shoved and hurt, or, when she got older, flirted with and, in extreme cases, groped. Yet here she was, letting said stranger touch her newly expanded stomach.  Nora was rubbing her hands over every inch of her fleshy orb, as if desperately trying to  find some hidden section of flawless skin that she hadn't yet placed her hands on. All in the name of finding the answer to why she has suddenly become a mother to be of triplets, and how NOT to be an actual mother of triplets.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is truly glorious!\" Nora said in a tone that one usually reserves for when they see a truly breath taking sight, like the Grand Canyon, or the Aurora Borealis. Sarah looked to to see that the woman had tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am actually touching the womb of Olania! Oh the children that must have been brought into the world from this womb, the lives it has given us! I can receive no greater gift than this. Thank you my goddess!\" Nora said, resting her head against her idols' belly and feeling the children within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oookay, I let you feel me up, you can get off now\", Sarah said, her anxiety finally winning out over her need for answers, \"this is a public place and people are staring.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And staring they were. As Sarah looked around the field, she saw that every farmhand had their eyes on her. Sarah once again wished she had managed to get that human turtle hybrid experiment funded. That way, she could give herself a shell, and hide in it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You'd think that an experiment that could actually make the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would rake in the grant money\", Sarah thought to herself as the, now steadily growing, cultist in front of her struggled to her feet, \"stupid science ethics code, getting in the  way of my anxiety and all that.\" Sarah giggled at her own little private sense of humor. If she would ever bother to say them out loud without her fear of being rejected, she would realize she is actually quite funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You shouldn't try to hide your body in a shell, you are beautiful and, more importantly, fertile. Be proud of your womanly body\", Sarah heard her voice say, even though she hadn't said the words, \"besides, you don't look good in green, or a blue, red, purple, or orange mask for that matter. I see you as more of a 'little black dress and glasses' type of gal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sarah looked towards the source of the voice to find herself standing behind Nora, stark naked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Olania?\", Sarah asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cowabunga\", the goddess replied, wiggling her thumb and pinky in a surfers' salute. Sarah waddled her way over to the look alike, strutting past a confused Nora.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why do you have my voice now? What happened to your godly vocal chords? One minute, you are sounding soft, melodious, you know, like a god would sound. And now, I feel like I'm talking to myself. What gives?\" Sarah asked. The Sarah impersonator tilted her head, a notion the original was fond of doing when puzzled, which only served to enrage her more. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because I am you, of course I would sound like me.\"  Olania said, like she was completely dumbfounded as to why she shouldn't sound exactly like Sarah. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, you are you\", Sarah said  pointing a finger at Olania, \"I am me.\", pointing the finger back at herself.  Olania nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Exactly, you are me, and I am you\", she said, mimicking Sarahs' finger pointing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's not what I said and.. errrgh!\" Sarah was almost to the point of pulling out her hair, or maybe Olanias', if it would get this goddess or whatever she was to talk straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My goddess, do you always talk to yourself, or are the unborn speaking to you?\" Nora chimed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah did actually have a habit of talking to herself, but this was one of the few times she wasn't. Didn't Nora see the exact clone of Sarah right in front of her, in the nude?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course she can see me, I'm standing in front of her in an ill fitting hoodie and sweatpants\" Olania said, now apparently able to read minds, and she still thought she was Sarah. If it was physically possible, steam would have been coming out of her ears at this point.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Once again, I was not referring to whether or not she could see me, but you.\", Sarah gritted through her teeth. She turned to face Nora. \"Nora, do you nooOOOH MY GOD!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah turned to face Nora, only to find that, while she and whatever is next to her were arguing, Nora had been growing. A lot. Her farmers overalls had long since come undone, and the dirty, white t-shirt had bunched up to reveal a pregnant belly that was bigger than Sarahs'! When Sarah looked back at this incident later, she realized that, while she didn't know how, she had somehow known that Nora was carrying quadruplets in her womb. But that was the furthest thing from her mind at that point. It wasn't for Nora, she looked down and apparently noticed her growth spurt for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god!\" She exclaimed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am so sorry! Did I do that? I am terribly sorry!\" Sarah frantically apologized. Noras' reaction, however, was not what Sarah expected.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" What are you apologizing for? The Goddess has blessed me with children for my undeserving womb! I shall cherish these infants long as they reside in me! I thank you for your kind gift!\" She said, tears now pouring down her cheeks. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did I give you those children? How in the world could I have done that?\" Sarah said, exasperated. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, she did rub our belly\", Olania said, \" that's just begging  for her to get impregnated, and all she really had to do was be around us.\" Sarah turned around back to the goddess.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what, I'm pregnancy radioactive? women get pregnant just by being near me?\" she screeched. Olania nodded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pretty much. That is one our most basic godly powers I'm so glad I am manifesting our powers so early! I am really adjusting to this new form!\" While she babbled on. Sarah was lost in shock. How many people had she impregnated just traveling to this place? How many lives had she forever changed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is just too much! I gotta have some answers\" Sarah said, turning around quickly to face a potential source of answers. Nora was eagerly rubbing her own expanded stomach, too focused on it to notice the Goddess \"talking to herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah may have turned a bit too fast, as her newfound center of gravity, and lack of vision on anything below her stomach, made it very easy for her foot to trip on a root. As she stumbled, Nora temporarily managed to break free from her daze and catch her patrons' fall. Sarah managed to grab hold of Nora as well, with one hand on the cultists' shoulder, and the other falling upon her pregnant stomach, unaware of the consequences.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a sudden jolt of energy, Sarah cold suddenly feel herself growing. A quick look down confirmed her suspicion. her stomach was indeed expanding. Fast. It slowly fought the battle against her hoodie, claiming inch after inch of battlefield on its unstoppable march to full nudity. All was not well on the southern front, either. Sarah felt her sweatpants riding down, forced into a retreat by her rapidly growing rear. When all was said and done, the Sweats had lost Clothes War 2. Her pants were almost on her thighs, with a good portion of her dairy aire in the air. Her once baggy hoodie was now completely unable cover any of her stomach, and now served as a makeshift bra. One that, even then was stretched quite remarkably over her now expanded bust. A later measurement would reveal that she was now a 36GG, but the strangest transformation wasn't even on her body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah looked up to see that Nora was as flat as a board . Other than the fact that her Overalls were undone, she showed no signs of ever being pregnant. Looking at her flat body, and her own, now humongous, and almost indecent, body, using the messed up logic of the day, Sarah could only assume one thing; she had somehow put Noras' children into her own womb. Using that information, Sarah once again did the sensible thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah screamed her head off. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OhmygodohmygodohmyGOD!\", A hysterical Sarah screeched, \"I just stole the children I gave to you! I'M FUCKING HUGE!!!\"<br>\r\nNora, on the other hand, was quite calm for someone who just had her children snatched.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's for the best I suppose. What use is a womb as unworthy as mine, when children can be brought into this world by a Goddess.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't wanna bring them into this world! you take them back!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wouldn't dare take away those children from a womb so sacred, they are yours now.\" \"I dont understand how this could happen! WHY ME?!?!\" Sarah screamed. \"I'm sure you have many questions, my goddess, and I am grateful for your presence and the greatest honor of touch the holy womb, but I cannot answer your questions.\", Nora said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WHY NOT!?!\", Sarah screamed, on the verge of tears. \"Because\"' She replied' \"I still a long time to work these fields. But tomorrow I will be free. I will see what I can answer then. In the meantime, consult the Guide, and the unborn, they may provide you with answers far better than I can. Goodbye my goddess.\" Nora said as she turned to work the fields again, leaving Sarah alone, vastly overdue with, now seven, children who could decide it's time for labor at any moment, almost naked, and in the middle of a field with every farmhand staring at her, slack jawed and bug eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Man, you should really try these blackberries! UMMMMPH! I have had the biggest craving for these, and they are to die for!\" Olania said. Sarah turned and gave the Goddess a look that could have melted those blackberries.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah waddled as quickly as she could out of the community farm, hands awkwardly clinging to her sweatpants' waist to keep it from falling down. As she grew up and \"matured,\" Sarah repeatedly ran into the problem of having her chest get in the way of her fitting into clothes, but she never had to deal with an ass so large that it made certain pairs of pants not fit. Of course, the part of her body that was currently making her wardrobe the most difficult was her septuplet belly, jutting out of her body majestically, capturing the attention of everyone in its vicinity: a fact Sarah was horribly embarrassed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah left the farm, not noticing that bellies were starting to grow for all of the women working there. \"I guess I can't 'give' these babies away to people, but I can take them back if I accidentally make someone else pregnant,\" Sarah said to herself, looking up and down the streets to decide where she should go. \"I shouldn't get too close to anyone from now on. Not that that's a problem for me. The only person I talked to besides Nora was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian. Sarah felt her heart sink at the thought of that nice woman swelling up because she spent too much time around Sarah. \"Well...the only fair thing to do is take her pregnancy back,\" Sarah sighed, hurrying back in the direction of the library. Her belly's weight and size made her own sizable hips sway with each step, only drawing more attention to her largely bare rear, save for her gray underwear. At least her conversion of her entire sweatshirt to a bra got rid of the ample cleavage her low zipper was showing, but her breasts were many times larger now and drew their own attention and caused their own discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the library, Sarah looked around in a panic as dozens of men and women dropped their books in shock. She waddled her way to the counter, identifying the same woman who helped her. \"E-excuse me, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're that nice young woman from before,\" the librarian said with a soft smile. She walked around the counter and revealed her own pregnant belly: not nearly as large as Sarah's, but she looked around 8-9 months pregnant with one. \"You've gotten bigger too, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bit her lip, feeling awful. \"Yeah, a-about that. I made a horrible mistake and I need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm going to be 50 in a few weeks and my husband died so long ago. I never thought I'd have children of my own but...\" the woman began to cry softly. \"Somehow...somehow you did this. Thank you...thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed and gave a little smile. \"You're...welcome, ma'am. I just wanted to make sure you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? This is a rewarding job,\" Oliana whispered in Sarah's ear, wrapping her arm around Sarah's shoulder and jutting their bellies out. As Sarah got bigger, so did she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah didn't say anything as she tried to push the nude vision of herself as she tried to make her way to the door. But blocking her way were several men and women. \"E-excuse me...do you think I could feel your belly?\" one woman said, her eyes wide as she reached down one hand to touch Sarah's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't!\" Sarah said, but it was too late. The woman swelled up in an instant, looking overdue with one. With a groan, Sarah put her hand back on the woman's new belly, feeling it deflate as she swelled up. The zipper on her hoodie-bra slowly came down as Sarah's chest reached new heights, her belly throwing her slightly off-balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's even bigger now,\" one man said, hands shaking with anticipation as he reached out. Taking a deep breath, Sarah pivoted on one foot and kicked rapidly at the shins of the library's patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back!\" Sarah barked. \"I d-don't want to hurt anyone, but even with this big belly, I can kick a lot faster than any of you can step forward.\" Sarah's red eyes flashed as she readied another kick and the crowd gasped, all moving back quickly. Sarah made a few awkward waddles to the door, looking around, before hurrying out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight already?\" Oliana said, marveling at her own totally-naked belly. \"And it's only Day 1. You may be my best incarnation yet, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, shut up, shut up,\" Sarah panicked, turning to her smirking doppelg\u00e4nger. \"This is insane! Who would want to be this big? Everyone's staring at me, everyone wants to touch me, and it's hard to even walk around. This is a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliana gave a little sigh and tapped Sarah on the shoulder. \"You'll come to love it, I'm sure. And if you really don't want to be this big for now...here's an opportunity to 'slim down.'\" Oliana pointed to a group of women walking perpendicular to Sarah, ready to cross the opposite street. \"They're infertile and they've built up good karma. You can pass some of your children onto them,\" Oliana said, patting Sarah's huge belly, knocking her off-balance a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Sarah said eagerly. Oliana stopped Sarah from walking and put her soft hands on Sarah's temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes...picture yourself as the goddess you are. You're hugely pregnant, even bigger than this. You're naked \u2014 no, you're in a golden bikini studded with gems. And you're standing on top of a stone ziggurat and you hear chanting and cheering. Down below, it's your people. Men and pregnant women, all here for you. Feel your belly swell with their energy and give that energy back out to the world. Think of those women and their lives with pregnant bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pictured all of this and let out a long, smooth sigh. When she finished her breath, she opened her eyes to see the women crossing the street now had round, full bellies of their own. She grinned widely, possibly the most she'd ever smiled in public, until she felt a kick inside her. Then a few more. Looking down, Sarah still had an unbelievably big belly, although it was technically \"smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I still pregnant?\" Sarah said, hurrying forward again, pulling on her pants to get them around her now slightly-smaller ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you didn't give away <u>all</u> of your children, of course. There were only four women there and what kind of pregnancy goddess would have an empty womb?\" Oliana chuckled, following Sarah along. \"I preferred us when we were pregnant with octuplets, but I suppose four full-term babies is respectable for our first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get this covered up,\" Sarah said, waddling toward the line of boutiques in town. \"There's got to be a maternity clothing store in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure they get a lot of business from women 42 weeks pregnant with quadruplets,\" Oliana laughed, following Sarah, who was obviously ignoring the goddess's voice. \"But if you're shopping for clothes to fit your pregnant body, try to get some lingerie too. This frumpy look you're rocking now is cute, but I'd rather see you in something sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Sarah said a little too loudly, trying to block out Oliana's voice. The store clerk looked at her in shock. \"I'm looking for some...fitting maternity clothes. Do you have anything in my size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk thought Sarah was some sort of prankster in a fake belly, but as a few feet and elbows made their marks on the otherwise smooth surface of Sarah's belly, it was clear that this was the real deal. \"I-I'm not sure if we have anything to fully...fit you. We do tailor some specialty clothing and we may have to do that with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped and put her hands on her hips. Having to order specially-made clothing. She had a flashback to when she nervously had to tell the clerks at the store that, while she was barely a teenager, she didn't fit any of the training bras they offered her. \"Fine, that works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means we'll need...measurements,\" the clerk said, waving in an employee with a tape measure, which was immediately dropped when the employee saw Sarah. \"You can go in the back for privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt her chest tighten with anxiety. \"A-actually, I'm not sure if I want to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you prefer a female employee did the measurements instead?\" the clerk asked. Sarah knew that if that happened, the employee would have a belly as big as hers by the end of the fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...could I have a woman sit in on the fitting?\" Sarah said, face getting bright red. The clerk nodded and led Sarah into the back. She stood up, spreading her arms, body shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax, they're professionals,\" Oliana said, looking directly at Sarah as the tape measure was pressed against her side for the first measurement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can...\" Sarah said quietly, tears starting to well up in her eyes. A life of trauma and anxiety made this whole thing even more terrifying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes again,\" Oliana said, her voice changing from Sarah's to the original, powerful voice Sarah first heard her use. As Sarah closed her eyes, the glowing, fiery bronze form she took in her first dream appeared. \"Breathe, my child. You do not need to be afraid. You are strong, you are brave, you are glorious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliana brought her hands to Sarah's cheeks, and even though it was just a vision, Sarah could feel her warm embrace. \"We're done, miss.\" Sarah opened her eyes and saw the two employees standing a few feet away from her. \"Are you doing alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'm fine,\" Sarah said, wiping one eye and hurrying back to the counter. Paying for her custom clothes, Sarah was back out on the street, no Oliana in sight. \"Why can't you be that helpful all the time?\" Sarah grumbled as she headed back to her house.</span></div></div>",

Here, she was free of those who wished her harm. Here, she was free from the catcallers and the overly flirtatious. Here, she was alone. But it looked like that was no longer the case these days. The four invaders of her womb started to squirm inside her to prove her point. Sarah shuttered. Years of medical training and Countless PhD\u2019s told her that this was completely normal, and in fact cause for celebration, but the only thing Sarah could think of was the \u201cAlien\u201d movie, and how the xenomorphs would burst out of the host\u2019s stomach. It felt unnatural to her, that these living things are <i>inside</i> of her. Of course, it didn't help that the children were, in fact, unnatural, and it was all <b>her</b> fault.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if her name was Beetlejuice, Sarah found the Goddess splayed out on the couch, her belly in her lap, flipping through her TV channels, and casually pleasuring herself. Upon seeing Sarah\u2019s look of incredulousness, Olania shrugged.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dHey, I have needs too. Just because I am a goddess, doesn't mean I don't get hot under the collar every once in awhile.\u201d She said, rising from the piece of furniture without any trouble and gliding her way to the baffled woman.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dIt is nothing to be ashamed about dear, it is a part of the human body. In fact, it can actually help alo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRUNCH!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah\u2019s fist connected with Olania\u2019s nose much harder than she was going for. A blow like that would have caused a concussion on a normal human being, and would have easily broken her pretty nose. Olania, though, merely stumbled back and clutched her face. She didn't care though, as she was blinded by pure, seething rage. Sarah was done.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dShut up! I don\u2019t care!\u201d she screamed, \u201cI am finished with you, with your cult, with these\u2026.these\u2026.things inside of me, and with this whole goddamned day! I have had my body stolen from me, oogled by the entire damn city, had someone elses grubby little hands all over me, and talked to a loon who thinks I am a God! Newsflash, I don\u2019t know what you are, but you are not a God, and I am definitely not one either! I do know, however, that you caused all of this, and I don\u2019t care who or what you are, because right now, you are gonna be the one to <b>FUCKING FIX ME NOW!!!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sarah breathed heavily, done with her rant. She did not care about anything else, just that this nightmare end, and that she had finally told Olania off, but when the goddess removed her hands from her face, one look was all it took for Sarah to realize she had royally screwed up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The reflection of Sarah violently changed into the bronzed form once more, but this time, the warm glow of her skin was harsh and blinding, and the comforting warmth that radiated from her now burned and sizzled. The figure raised a  hand towards Sarah, and immediately the red eyed woman gasped and screamed. Her extended stomach shot forwards, outwards, and grew in all directions, her custom bought clothing tearing almost instantly. Later, Sarah would count that she now has twelve, 42 week unborn children residing in her womb, but that wasn\u2019t all.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sarah could feel her insides ignite with movement. What was once little nudges and squirming, was now forceful and violent kicks and punches. She could see her stomach visibly distend with each movement, causing quite a lot of pain, and they were all kicking at once. After a time, Sarah noticed that the Distortions of her skin were growing bigger, and her stomach was increasing in weight. She realized that the children were growing, as well as multiplying. She later would learn, after buying a new scale (she broke her first one weighing herself), shuttering at its readings, and crunching some numbers, that each child now weighed about 12 pounds. But that was not her concern right now. Her only thought was pain, and it was only getting worse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah\u2019s troubled belly suddenly became extremely hard, and she could feel an impossibly large child shoot its way through her birth canal, too fast to happen naturally, and stop near her lips. Her instincts told her to push, and boy did she, but after several tries, it was clear that this baby was too big too arrive naturally. but it still pushed, and Sarah could feel another child line up behind it. She also had feeling that the child being too big was on purpose, but she had no clue what gave her that idea.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah knew she had to push, but this thing was not coming out, and it felt like she was being ripped in half. To top it off, waves of Nausea hit the struggling woman, and she threw up almost immediately all over herself, and couldn\u2019t stop. Soon, soreness and tiredness began wash over her as well, and she was consumed by horrid pains all over her body, especially in her breasts as they suddenly began to stream colostrum , as well as complete and utter exhaustion. For the cherry on top, it appeared that Sarah had lost control of her bowels too, and wet herself repeatedly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sarah was sure she was about to die, either from the unborn ripping her stomach open, or from the lack of energy to push out the impossible child, when Olania finally spoke, her voice now booming and intense, over Sarah\u2019s tormented screams.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201dYou dare doubt my godhood now?\u201d</b> She boomed, <b>\u201dNever strike me again.

You can be the Karate Kid to my Mr. Miyagi!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sarah stood, frozen in shock, covered in every horrible bodily fluid possible, unsure of how to proceed. Luckily, Olania knew exactly just that.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dAw honey, you are in a state! let me get that for you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah blinked, and suddenly she was perfectly clean, but still very naked and belly newly expanded belly had not shrunk. Sarah, for her part, was struggling to complete a sentence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dWha...I\u2026.Buh...Buh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dNow, I am not going to let you get off scot free for that little \u2018incident.\u2019 So, until you learn how to control your powers, your belly is staying that way.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah\u2019s eyes widened. Her knees were starting to shake from the weight of her womb, and both of her forearms were tensed and straining to keep her belly off the ground. She could barely stand, let alone move to go to work, or get basic necessities, or have any sort of life outside of this belly. Plus, she was pretty sure that there wasn\u2019t any clothes that could fit her body like this, custom made or otherwise. How was she going to do anything like this?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dHey Sarah, I heard you were sick, so I decided to give you a surprise visit with some goodies! Now I know you hate unexpected visitors, but believe me when WOAH!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah gasped and turned around as fast as her heavily laden body would allow, only for the gravid orb to smack a young man, bringing him down to the floor, a bag of cans of chicken noodle soup and pastries flying after him. He lifted the mop of sandy colored hair from his wood bark eyes, only to see a mountain of flesh above him. hurriedly scurrying back, he saw Sarah in all her naked, fertile glory. Sarah was at a loss of words, and so was Olania, But that, as Sarah noticed when she quickly craned her head behind her, was because the Goddess was nowhere to be found. She turned her head back to her only friend, wide eyed, and on her living room floor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dSarah?\u201d Marshall asked, \u201cIs that you?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI...uhhh..wha\u2026.buh..\u201d was all Sarah managed to eek out, before her knees finally buckled, and her massive womb came crashing to the floor with a hearty, meaty <b>SMACK!!!</b> The impossibly pregnant woman tried with all of her remaining strength, but to no avail. She was immobile for the time being.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dSarah\u201d Marshall asked, \u201cwhat happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This was the final straw that broke the camels back, and with all the shock to the systems, the emotional turmoil, and the ordeals she just went through today, It was finally to much for Sarah. and she burst into tears, a huge crying fit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI don\u2019t know!\u201d She said in between huge, heaving sobs, \u201cWhat is happening to me?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought that they may have started around 20 or 25.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201d98\u2026...99,\u201d The pressure was unbearable sometimes. Sarah constantly felt tight, and like she might burst at any minute. She hoped that if she did explode, she would not spill her guts on Marshall, who was right beside her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dCome on Sarah, that is enough, you have had your workout today. Good job! Now put down the Barbell.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201d........100.\u201d Sarah gasped, placing the weight back on her shoulders and returning to the squatting position.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dThank god its over.\u201d Marshall mumbled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201d........101.\u201d Sarah gasped, once again rising.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dOh hell no. Sarah drop the weight!\u201d Marshall scrambled behind the woman, and tried the weight off Sarah\u2019s hands. This act of intervention, though, only served to have Sarah lose the center of balance that is critical for a woman pregnant with 12, and tumble backwards on her ass. Luckily, Marshall managed to avoid death by womb and rolled away. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dOh shit! I am so sorry! Are you okay? You need Help up?\u201d Marshall babbled on. He raced toward her side, but Sarah waved him off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dNo! I am going to do this on my own. I have to able to do this on my own. Otherwise, these past two months will have been a waste.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The past two months have been anything but a waste for Sarah. Well, maybe the first day. The rest of that day was spent with Sarah inconsolable, with marshall having no idea what to do, as well as wondering why his best friend was now huge, and naked on the floor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marshall was probably the only friend Sarah had ever had that she felt like she could be herself around. For the longest time, when Sarah made friends, she would always have to hide herself in baggy attire, for if any of them would find out what she really looked like, the conversation would always change too \u201cWow! You look great! I don\u2019t know why you hide in those clothes.\u201d or \u201cHey, there is this cute guy I know that would be perfect for you! You want me to set a date?\u201d and Sarah would always fall out of contact.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marshall was different though. Sarah remembered when they first met. She had just gotten hired at the university, and was over the roof when she arrived at the lab. Finally, she could work in peace, and learn more about the world. It was hot that day, and he had decided to wear a cute blouse under her labcoat. Sure, it revealed <b>waaay</b> too much cleavage for Sarah to ever be comfortable with, but on this murky day, it was just light enough to get by. Imagine her surprise when she turned to find Marshall right behind her. To say  the timid woman was startled was an understatement. Marshall, for his part, only smirked, said, \u201cSo you have been given grants for this too? Well, it looks like we are lab partners.\u201d, and turned and went straight to work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah had no idea what to say. Usually, people were dumbfounded and speechless when they first saw her, not the other way around. Here she was, in a very attractive blouse, and this man had blown her off! Sarah was unsure what to do, so she followed his lead and went straight to work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When asked him about that first meeting much later in their friendship, he only shrugged.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter who you were, or what you looked like,\u201d he said, \u201cthe work was more important.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marshall meant it too. All that day, he didn\u2019t once so much as glance at her breasts. He was always looking at her face, asking for her help, and slowly being more and more impressed with her depth of knowledge. For Sarah\u2019s part, she was amazed at this man who valued her mind over her body. So few people ever saw that in her. From then it was only a matter of time until the two became great friends, and a friend was something Sarah Desperately needed on that first day.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah told Marshall everything. She had to, otherwise she would lose her mind, and Marshall was hard pressed to disbelieve her, seeing as how the evidence was right in front of him, huge and squirming. Together, they worked out a plan. Well, Marshall worked out a plan, while Sarah carried on with her panic attack. First, Sarah called in to the university, and told them of her aunt, whose cancer had relapsed rather conveniently, so she would have to take absence so she could take care of her. The University understood. Sarah was a <i>huge</i> get for the institute, and most certainly didn\u2019t want her to quit. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While her job was taken care of, she was still naked, and almost immobile, and there was really only one way to fix these things. The next two months saw Sarah undergo an intensive strength training regimen. It was definitely a switch up from her usual routine, as Sarah always worked her whole body, and was rewarded with a nice, toned body, with muscles that, while not too big, were still impressive.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All that was thrown out the window, as Sarah now solely focused on her arm, leg, and back muscles. Anything that could help her support her gargantuan stomach. The first couple days were incredibly rough. Sarah could barely move at all, and was forced to drag her belly across the ground and pull it like it was some bag of rocks. She still thinks she feels the rug burn, although that could just be underbelly constantly being sore, her knees always bumping into it when she walked. That was the weird thing. Sarah had yet to go into labor. Here she was, about two months \u201coverdue\u201d and had yet to feel a single contraction. She worried if the children will ever come out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah was an expert on fitness, though, and with determination, and incredibly hard, and painful, work, Her efforts were starting to pay off. Her biceps, once fit and toned, now rippled as the Muscles, giant now, struggled against the weight of her unborn, the sinews and strands on her back straining with their newfound power. Soon enough. Her new, powerful legs muscles took purchase, and Sarah was now completely upright by her own volition for the first time in two months. Sarah never wanted big muscles, but now that she had them, they were quite useful.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dCongrats\u201d Marshall said, his tone conveying the exact opposite of what he was saying, \u201cnow maybe you can stop pushing yourself so hard. Whether you like it or not, those babies well being is on you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dYes, Marsh, thank you so much for reminding me that I am pregnant. I don\u2019t know how I would have ever remembered.\u201d The sarcasm was dripping off of her every word. \u201cBesides, there are plenty of studies that show no correlation to strength training and birth defects. You know that.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI know, but it still makes me uncomfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dTry living with a dozen tiny humans in your stomach, who think its Wrestlemania, and talk to me about uncomfortable.\u201d Sarah softened when she saw the look on her friends face. She knew his worrying was out of care for his friend, and she could understand that.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dLook, for the first time since my \u2018horde\u2019 spawned, I am able to move on my own. Its a big achievement, but I still have a long way to go. I still have to have at least one arm holding up my belly at all times to keep it up, or I hit the floor, and you have seen how fast I can waddle.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI know\u201d Marshall relented, \u201cbut it doesn't mean you have to push yourself so hard.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTell you what,\u201d Sarah said, \u201clets take a break for now. Now that I finally can move somewhat, why don\u2019t we focus our efforts on my main problem, and I can lessen the workouts for now, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marshall nodded in agreement, \u201cAlright, Deal. I will go get your laptop.\u201d he said, rushing into the other room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dGet my spare bra while you\u2019re at it!\u201d Sarah yelled at him. Clothing was the one thing Sarah had to say she failed on. Try as she might, she just could not find any clothes that fit her \u201cproportions\u201d no shirts, pants, anything. The most she found was a custom bra maker, that could make one for her, now 36HH, breasts. They were expensive though, and had a two week shipping period. At least now, combined with the fact that her belly is so big now, it covers her womanhood for her, she was at least (semi)decent.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marshall came running back, a bra in one hand and a computer in the other. He presented them as if victories of conquest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dFor you, my heavily laden maiden! We can now begin work on the main problem!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah glared at her friend, and snatched the items from his hands. A quick hooking and logging on, and She was Ready to tackle her main problem; The Church of Olania. She knew they were an ancient order, but not much else. Hell, her trip to the library only gave her the name of one member. For the first time since she met her, Sarah wished Olania were here, so she could question her for more information about the Church, and if there was a way to reverse this, but Olania had not reappeared since that day she had lost her temper.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She realized she was going to have to do some deep research, dig under every source, and spend months looking for a single lead. She was prepared to keep at this, no matter how long\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dWha..? Sonofabitch, they have a Facebook Page!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Welp, that was easy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah shook out her long white hair while she looked through the cult's Facebook page. For exercising, it was tied in a ponytail, but she always found it restricted the flow of ideas through her genius brain. It felt tight, and with an 11-month 12-baby pregnancy currently going on inside her womb, things were already tight enough for Sarah's tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a lot of information for Sarah to gather. There was no physical address for a meeting place listed and no email or phone number to use to contact members. The page's timeline was certainly interesting. Up until they met Sarah, there were only a few cryptic messages, mixed with some messages telling non-cult members following that \"All pictures of pregnancy on this page hold religious significance. Stop commenting on how 'hot' they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sarah was visited by Nora and the others, there was a flurry of messages where the members seemed to be talking in code, coordinating when and where to meet to visit Sarah. Then came stray pictures of Sarah on her first day with the belly, struggling just to waddle down the sidewalk. These also came with various comments talking about how \"hot\" and \"sexy\" Sarah was. Then, since Sarah's self-imposed exile, there was silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of good this does,\" Sarah sighed, resting her cheek in her hand. Clicking on the \"Likes,\" section, Sarah saw one familiar-looking name: Nora Velden. If Sarah had any doubts of whether it was the same Nora from the cult, her profile picture did away with them. It was Nora's same smiling face with curly black hair resting on her shoulders. And out in front of her was a large pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt her heart race as she clicked on Nora's name and looked at her profile. Nora's last few pictures featured her standing in her community garden, belly pushing out her dirty overalls. \"Every time I feel them kick, I feel so blessed!\" Nora's caption read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I got rid of her pregnancy,\" Sarah muttered. \"I took it for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky her,\" Oliana said, looking over Sarah's shoulders. \"Looks like she had some good karma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah yelped and spun around, taking a few steps away from the goddess who looked just like her. The last time Oliana was around, Sarah ended up being the size of a bus. She'd just gotten used to her size after months of hard exercise and she didn't feel like repeating it. As Sarah let out long breaths, staring down Oliana, she noticed something was different: Oliana wasn't pregnant. Or naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how you greet me after two months away?\" Oliana pouted, putting her hands on her wide hips. Unlike her past times visiting Sarah, Oliana had on a bikini that was as bright white as her hair. A smile spread across her lips and her gleaming red eyes narrowed. \"Say...you're looking awfully agile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had some time to get adjusted,\" Sarah said. \"And I don't need to know what it's like to carry 24 fetuses, so no funny business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, it's fine,\" Oliana smiled, hands up. \"Friends, see? Well, more than friends. You're me, in a way. We have to stick together. Don't tell me you weren't thinking about how much you missed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliana had a point. Sarah was wondering when she'd show up and explain more about this whole \"pregnancy goddess\" thing. Or at least take the burden off of her. \"I suppose you're the only person I can really talk to about all this,\" Sarah said, resting her hands on both sides of her belly. \"It's weird not seeing you with one too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels weird,\" Oliana smiled, twirling around to show off her beach body. \"Since you threw a tantrum, I decided to take a little vacation. The beaches of Rio de Janeiro, the hot springs of Oslo, the resorts of Okinawa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dressed like that?\" Sarah blushed. \"People couldn't see you, could they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Oliana beamed, running her hands down her waist. \"I had to sacrifice my powers and my lovely belly to be corporeal for a while, but it was worth it. Don't I look a little more tanned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's my body!\" Sarah shrieked. \"P-people saw me in that revealing outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliana giggled. \"Some people got to do a lot more than look, dear. Speaking of which,\" Oliana got close to Sarah and looked out the door at Marshall, who was on the couch, not hearing Sarah talk to herself. \"I see you've got someone in your life now. Does he like the belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah got embarrassed a lot in her life, but she had never blushed hotter or brighter than when Oliana asked her that question. \"I-I-I cannot believe you would ask that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliana sighed and smiled. \"Sarah, my sweet girl.\" She shushed Sarah as Marshall peered over, hearing Sarah's squealing outburst. \"It's okay. You're not the first one of my incarnations who was still a v-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it,\" Sarah fumed, lifting a muscular arm. \"It hurt plenty when I socked you before, right? Well imagine if I did it this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliana laughed, a little divine bronze glow shimmering along her skin. \"Fine, fine. But you do want to talk with me, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rested one hand on her belly and nodded, walking back to her computer. \"Why is Nora pregnant again? I took her babies back from her when I accidentally made her pregnant with quadruplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliana looked at the screen, a smile across her lips. \"But she looks so happy. Why did you take it away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oliana...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staying on topic, sorry!\" Oliana laughed. \"Anyway, you've held her in good graces for a long time, so she's getting what she wants: a big, healthy pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sarah said, crossing her arms across her heaving chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a god, sweetie. You answer prayers, so to speak. People close to you and people you like, if it's for long enough, will get pregnant on their own and have amazing children,\" Oliana said. \"Deep down, you must have really liked Nora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know anything about her?\" Sarah asked. \"I want to find her and she's the head of your church, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliana shrugged. \"Eh, it's an unofficial fan club. I know very little about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" Marshall said, from the other room. \"Everything okay? You've been at the computer for a while. Learn anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my cue,\" Oliana winked, giving Sarah a kiss on the cheek while rubbing her belly. \"Despite our little...confrontation, I'm still so proud of you, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't go yet!\" Sarah said. \"Can't you make me smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smaller?\" Oliana said, looking at her with confusion. \"Why would you ever want to be <i>less</i> pregnant?\" With that, Oliana vanished in a golden flicker as Marshall walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't even changed out of your exercise clothes yet,\" Marshall said, trying to keep his eyes up. Sarah's sports top didn't exactly conceal her cleavage. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just...\" Sarah stalled, before something clicked in her head. \"Actually, let me try something.\" Sarah was more focused on physical sciences than computers, but she was good enough at mathematics to be able to code and, more importantly, hack. Sarah didn't have a Facebook account of her own, for obvious reasons, so with some programming that felt rudimentary to her, Sarah had lots of information about Nora. Address, phone number, her college transcripts for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you'll be able to reach out to her after all,\" Marshall said, still a little in awe of how quickly Sarah managed to put that all together. \"But what do you think you'll manage to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know,\" Sarah said, rubbing her belly. \"But if she likes being pregnant so much, maybe she won't mind taking some of the burden off of me.\" Sarah turned to Marshall and gave a little smile. \"N-now I need you to step out again. I'm sweaty and gross and I need to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Marshall nodded quickly, darting out of the room. Sure, he'd seen Sarah pregnant and nude for a few seconds once, but she still kept her naked body carefully guarded. It was a huge step that she let him see her with an uncovered belly at all. Stepping into the shower, Sarah detached the head and sprayed it all over her body, sighing and moaning as she felt her muscles ache. Looking down at her meaty biceps, Sarah felt another wave of self-consciousness come. People were already looking at her like she was a demon with her hair and eyes (if they weren't already ogling the rest of her body), and with huge muscles, she would only stand out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you kind of take most of the credit for that, though,\" Sarah sighed, rubbing her soapy belly. A kick made Sarah smile a bit. Honestly, and she hated to admit it, but she was getting used to being pregnant. Parts of it made her kind of happy now. She felt less awkward being naked because it wasn't really her body anymore. And when the kicks weren't making her keel over with their tightness or hitting her in the bladder were a little cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering and squeezing into the baggiest clothes she could find, Sarah stood by the door, hands on her hips. \"Now, let's see how much Nora likes it when someone shows up at her doorstep uninvited.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At that moment, Sarah felt a buzzing in his pocket. She raised a confused eyebrow and reached in, pulling out her large, clumsy cellphone. Sarah was far too shy and protective of her identity to get anything fancier than an early 2000s Nokia that was only good for calls in and out. And she barely got or made any calls anyway. But the limited caller I.D. the phone's display allowed for told her it was work so she answered as quickly as she could. Reaching into her pockets was hard with nearly 100 pounds of swollen womb in front of her. And no matter how baggy the pants she found were, her pregnancy, coupled with her pre-existing natural beauty, meant her hips and ass were so large that her pockets were as tight as a vicegrip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Sarah said on her end, looking at Marshall with an unsure gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah! Good to hear your voice after so long,\" Margaret, Sarah's supervisor at the lab, said, sounding worried and out of breath. \"H-h-how's your aunt doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, her aunt and her missteps into bad health. The reason Sarah gave for her inability to come into work for the past months to hide the fact that she was the most pregnant woman on the planet at the moment. \"Um, doing well,\" Sarah nodded. Lying made her uneasy and it was not among her various skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, that's great to hear!\" Margaret said, on the verge of nervous laughter. \"So...would it be alright if you came back to the lab today? Since she's doing better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah paused and looked down at her belly. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See...we've run into a bit of a problem over here,\" Margaret said, trying her best to sound sane. \"There have been some mix-ups and some misunderstood communications between ourselves and several of the groups that give us grants. We're...overbooked, let's say, and we need to deliver on research and progress on our experiments on a very, <b>very</b> short turnaround.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Sarah gulped, looking at Marshall with a worried look. He'd never mentioned anything about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and the IRS is also visiting us...regularly,\" Margaret said. \"And we were all thinking, gosh, you know who always seemed to juggle a lot of work easily and quickly with high quality? Sarah!\" Margaret began laughing nervously again, trying to drown out the sound of shouting in the background of her phone call. \"So what do you say? Come back at least until this is all cleared up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed and felt a few kicks along the side of her belly, disturbing her already uneasy wardrobe. \"Sure, Margaret, I'll come in. But you should know...I look a little different than I did a few months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we understand,\" Margaret said. \"Taking care of a sick loved one can be very stressful and it can drain the color from you...although in your case-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Sarah nodded. \"A-anyway, like usual, I'd like privacy while I work.\" She turned to her one friend in the world and smiled. \"But Marshall will still be working with me, if that's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you need!\" Margaret exclaimed before clearing her throat and calming down. \"I-I mean, that's all fine. If you need anything else, just ask and we'll see if we can accommodate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah hung up and turned to Marshall, resting one hand on her massive middle. \"Looks like I'm going back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Marshall said, his jaw dropping. \"But your...you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belly? Not much I can do about that,\" Sarah sighed, rubbing her gut as she waddled out the door. \"We've got a lot of work to do, so make sure to dig in deep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And try not to knock over too many beakers with your stomach, Sarah,\" Marshall chuckled as Sarah blushed and looked down. \"Sorry, did that go too far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's good advice,\" Sarah said quietly as she gave her belly a soft stroke. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah and her lab partner approached the doors of the massive lab, Margaret rushed out, an enormous smile on her face. \"Sarah! So glad you could make it! And Marshall, good to see you t-\" Margaret stopped talking instantly, her face a mask of total befuddlement as her legs continued to move her closer to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Sarah mumbled as she tried to move a little quicker. \"L-like I said, I look a little different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R...ight,\" Margaret nodded, her eyes as big as coffee saucers. \"Well...congratulations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Sarah blushed as she continued to move. \"Where do you need me the most?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me, um, lead the way,\" Margaret said, opening doors for Sarah as she waddled through. Her improved physique helped her mobility, but not so much that her pregnant gait was eliminated. And even if she'd mastered walking in her current state, with an 11-month, 12-baby belly, it would still sway back and forth considerably with each step, as it did now. \"You look like you've been working out too. I mean, I knew you did a lot of martial arts, but you really look buff now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a machine when it comes to weights,\" Marshall chimed in with a grin. \"You've never seen someone lift with such determination and single-mindedness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marshall...\" Sarah whispered, her cheeks turning redder as she grabbed her lab coat off of its rack. It barely fit at all now but it still mattered to her as a status symbol. It showed that, despite being hugely pregnant, despite learning that she's a reincarnated god, Sarah was still Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Margaret said, showing them into a vacated lab. \"The information we have so far is on the center counter and all the supplies you should need are there as well, but if you need anything, feel free to contact us via intercom.\" She let out another nervous laugh and hugged Sarah tightly. \"I know it's unprofessional, but you have no idea what a big help you are do us by doing this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're welcome,\" Sarah said, her arms twitching as she held them by her side awkwardly. When Margaret broke the hug, she gave one last sigh and smile before leaving, pressing one hand against her gurgling belly as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back at last,\" Marshall sighed, moving to the center counter and looking over the data. \"It's going well so far, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far,\" Sarah nodded, crossing her arms as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough that you'd...maybe consider coming back to work like usual?\" Marshall asked. \"It's sucked not having you around. Everyone else here is a moron. Me included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give yourself more credit,\" Sarah said with a little smile. \"I trust you to be my lab tech, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Marshall said, letting out a gasp and hurrying over as Sarah's belly hit a cabinet full of chemicals, grabbing it before it fell. \"L-let's get started, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sarah blushed. \"Let's.\"</span></div></div>",

Being an expert in her field as well as many other fields. Sarah decided to take this one up. She was that scarily smart. Graduate of medicine and biochem it proved she was the right person for the job. Raising her glasses to her head and rubbing her eyes. She began to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like my stress is getting to me.\" She thought as she continued to massage her eyes. She worked at home in her beautifully designed home a top a hill looking over a surburban area. It had the perfect view of the city. It wasn't like she couldn't get along with anyone, she was just shy but also felt some people were intimidated by her superior intellect. Stretching her arms and legs, she decided to get up and take a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine as well grab a bite to eat before droning out here.\" She said to herself as she arched her back causing her large bust to stretch her small white t-shirt. Sarah went into her large kitchen and fixed herself a snack. As Sarah finished, the doorbell rang. With a grunt she walked to her door to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird...who would come up here at this hour.\" Sarah thought looking at her wall clock which read 10 pm. She opened her door to see an old man with a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh. Good evening sir. What can I do for you?\" She said to the old man. The old man smiled at Sarah, handing over the box he was holding to her. It looked like a jewelry box as it was laced with gemstones. Sarah couldn't tell whether they were genuine or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please! Keep it your going to need it more than me.\" Sarah smiled pushing the box slightly into the old man's chest. But her pushed back, giving a sad puppy dog look, hoping she would accept her gift. With a sigh, she took with both hands and examined it more, it had a lock but you could push it to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank....you?\" Sarah said only to find that the old man had vanished into thin air. Scatching her head, she looked about to find not a sign of him. With a shrug, she walked back in with box in tow, closing the door behind her. Sarah went back into the kitchen to grab a glass of milk. She sat on the table as she looked at the mysterious gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what could that old man give me?\" As Sarah pressed the button as it popped open, looking inside she saw....</span></div></div>",

She was little over 6 feet tall. She resembled the statue, with long black hair, red eyes, and wearing a long white gown with a gold tiara and bracelets. But two things caught Sarah's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was the fact that she, like the statue, was immensely pregnant. Her belly was the size of a beach ball, and her breasts were double Sarah's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was the fact that the woman was transparant with blue skin.

Sarah barely had time to react before she started to chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes went wide as her belly and breasts began to inflate. She could only watch as her shirt began to tear, revealing more of her expanding belly and swollen breasts. Eventually, her shirt exploded, leaving her belly exposed. Eventually, her bra burst too, leaving her completely topless. After a few seconds, her belly button popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her growth stopped. Sarah looked at herself in shock. Her belly had swollen to the size of Venter's belly, looking overdue with quads, and her breast had doubled in size. Her breasts also felt incredibly full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" Sarah asked, hands under her now immense gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My apologies, miss.' Sarah suddenly heard Venter say.

Breathing a cold steam as she grabbed her blanket to cover the rest of her body. Totally unaware of of what surrounds her.

For what reason unknown but they continued to enter Sarah's body. Like an inflating balloon, her belly began to bulge underneath her shirt. Going by the months as each spirit entered her body. Sarah groaned as she shifted to her right side near the right edge of the bed. She seemed to be at least 3 months along but the spirits seem abundant in number. They continued filling Sarah's womb and she was dumbfounded due to her tireness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rose as her alarm buzzed. It was time for her morning jog around the neighborhood. Sarah lazily tried to shut it off. Annoyed she tried slamming it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it! Shut up already!\" She said as she threw it off the bed table in the floor, shutting it off. Yawning as she stretched her arms and legs but noticed she was a bit heavy. Looking down from her laid back condition. She noticed a large bulge had risen where she believes is her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the....?!?\" Sarah said as she undid the bed sheet covering her. She grunted trying to get up using her elbows as a boost, only to be blockes by her large belly. Her eyes went wide of large gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the heck did this happen? I didn't eat that much last night!\" Sarah screamed as furiously got up, flailing her feet as she finally sat on the side of the bed. Sitting in the edge, she used her hands to.explore her large belly. It was firm and taught and it covered her thighs a bit. Looking down were partially blocking her view. Sarah used her right hand and cupped her right breast. They were comtricting in her bra, digging into her shoulders a bit. She was now at least a F-cup. Her hips had widen an inch on each side. Her butt had grown as well, pushing her tight shorts down a bit, revealing her butt crack a bit. Sarah began to make conclusions based on her analysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant. Enlarged breasts, large, firm belly, widen hips and butt. But I don't feel morning sickness or nausea.\" Sarah thought to herself, rubbing her belly. \"I have to be 40 weeks pregnant with one. How is this possible?!? I'm still a virgin! What is this...!\" Sarah screamed as she looked about for answers then she spotted the statue from yesterday. Struggling to get to her feet, she slowly made her way to her work desk and grabbed the statue. Examining it from all angled, finding evidence of how it got her pregnant. But couldn't find a hint. Sighing as she sat on her chair, she put the statue on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can guess its you. But how? There's no other explaination but you for this spontaneous pregnancy. Just who was that old man who gave me this.\" Holding it a top her belly. She began to ponder her options for explaining this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah takes a picture of the statue then uploads it on her computer. As the picture finishes scanning, she hits the search button. The monitor says searching as she slowly gets up and makes her ways to the kitchen. There she brews some coffee and makes bacon and ham. Sarah gets annoyed that her belly bumps nearly everywhere. She drinks down her coffee and chows down her food but strangely, she notices something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird. I don't have any cravings. Thats something all pregnant women should have but I don't. This proves that I'm not pregnant!\" Sarah said outloud jumping but nearly loosing her balance. \"Whoa, maybe a bit pregnant.\" Sarah then heard a ping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the search is done.\" as Sarah made her way to her computer. To her disappointment it said no matches found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! The net is the biggest source of information! How could it come out with none!\" Sarah yelled, slamming her fist as the table shook. Her breasts wobbled a bit. Sarah hit search again. The computer began to process as she stood up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall take a shower. It should cool off my head a bit while I think things over.\" thought Sarah as she stripped down in her bathroom and climbed into the shower. Sarah shampooed her hair as it slid down her body. But as she scrubbed her belly, she felt unusual pleasure. She sighed and rubbed slowly. Then she snapped out if it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it! I am not pregnant!\" shouted Sarah as she quickly dried herself. She found arousal again when wiping her breasts and belly but shook it off. Holding the towel to cover her belly and breasts, she went into her closet to find some things to wear. She always had a larger set of underwear which fit perfectly. She had stretchable black pants and wore a white tank top. She wore a large purple turtle neck sweater. Sarah then fixed her long white hair into a ponytail. She looked at herself in the mirror, satisfied went back to her desktop. Only to find empty results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh. What gives! Is this statue unknown to us? Who was that old coot who gave me this. And how did you make me pregnant!\" Yelled Sarah as she grasped the statue with both hands. Just then she noticed a chat window active. She went to see who it was, it said Hey Sarah! Its been a while. What's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its Annie Patron! One of my classmates in history back in high school.\" Sarah remembered her as she was a smart cookie but not as smart as her. She was one of her few friends back then so Sarah answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing good actually. What have you been up to?\" Sarah typed back. In moments Annie replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good as well. Unlike you, I only finished in bs history. But my main expertise is finding unknown artifacts and stuff.\" Annie typed. Sarah began to ponder an idea so she typed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since your an expert in that area. Do you have any information on this statue?\" Sarah typed as she uploaded the picture and sent it to Annie. It took some time for Annie to answer back. Sarah began to impaitiently wait for her reply. Just when all hope has failed, a message alert sounded. Sarah quickly looked at Annie's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems familiar. I might have it in the many tomes that I have here. Could you bring it here if your not busy or anything? It would be better if I saw it personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah typed back,\" Sure thing! Be there ASAP! Where do you work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the national history mueseum. Theres a section called newly discovered. You'll see me there. I'm excited to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise! Just don't be startled when you see me. I'll explain when I get there.\" Typed Sarah as she took a black baseball cap and wore it. Moving as fast as she could taking all the important things and placing it in a backpack. Hoisting it on her left shoulder, s<br>\r\nSarah took the statue in her right hand, grabbed her keys and made her way to her sports car. Annoyed that she needed to pull the seat since her belly touckes the stirring wheel. She sped off as the security system in her home came to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be there in 20 minutes. The answers I get are crucial to explaining what's happening to me. I hope she has the answers.\" thought Sarah as she drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The museum was an impressive structure.  Sarah paused for a moment outside the entrance to admire the masonry.  Despite her situation, she thought it was important to take stock.  She had never been here before.  Most of Sarah's life was built around rigorous self maintenance of both body and mind.  She did not often go out to experience simple pleasures, which was something she had begun to desire more and more.  Success had not been as fulfilling as she had expected.  While she would never wish away her accomplishments, for they provided her a measure of privacy and safety, there was something undefinable missing from her daily life.  Perhaps it had something to do with her poor social skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah was shy, and bad public speaker.  Her list of friends was terribly short, and they all lived several states away.  She could confidently call them meaningful friends, but they had never quite been able to break her out of her shell.  It had taken a lot of time to get to know each other, and this was partly because Sarah was always busy thinking.  This meant that Sarah was awful at hiding her current discomfort.  She had picked the best clothes that she could, with moderate success.  Rather than wear one of her dresses that would have suited her condition better, Sarah was wearing a combination of exercise clothes, a black cap, and a purple hoodie. Her white hair was tied in a ponytail, and overall she looked like she was trying to hide herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This was impossible.  Sarah's body had always stood out, and now even more so.  There were also few people that had red irises, which she hid behind sunglasses.  In the backpack that she hauled was the statue, wrapped in cloth.  She had begun to feel uneasy carrying the thing with her, as if its effects could worsen at any time.  This whole issue was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she reached the front desk, almost everyone was stealing a glance at her.  Nobody present knew her personally, but they were aware of her presence in town.  Why this wealthy recluse would come here today, how beautiful she was, and who could possibly be the father of her child, were among the many thoughts present.  The receptionist pointed her towards Annie Patron's office, and she hustled over as quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Annie was more or less shocked at what she saw.  \"Oh, wow, Sarah!  You never mentioned anything like this.  Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, it's actually a problem.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't say that!  You must be tired from walking here.  Ankle swelling and all that.\"<br>\r\n\"No.  I actually need you to look at that statue I mentioned.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.  May I see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah placed the statue on a nearby desk.  Annie smiled as she began to examine the small sculpture.  \"It's well made,\" she noted.  \"It's surprising that this sculpture is painted; someone must have really treasured it.  A bit perverted looking, though.\"  Annie picked up the sculpture to examine the base, which gave Sarah a start.  She hoped that its magic wouldn't affect Annie as well.  She couldn't live with herself if that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spiritus Catinum is written on the bottom,\" Annie said, \"in marker.  What a way to treat good art.  I could see about removing that if you would like to donate this.\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" Sarah said quickly.  Although she was uncomfortable around the enchanted statue, she was even more afraid of it getting out into public.  \"I just wanted to see if you knew anything about it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it reminds me of something, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe I can get back to you later.  Thanks for bringing it over, and I hope you change your mind about keeping it.  Then again, it's a great way to celebrate the baby, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah felt miserable on her way home, statue in tow.  As she drove, her mind shifted inevitably toward her condition.  She had not felt any kicks or fluttering in her stomach, which she surely would have felt by now.  The implications of that were troubling.  Under normal circumstances, it would be a possible sign of a miscarriage, which would be an even more horrible discovery after waking up like this.  Instead, however, Sarah felt what seemed to be a kind of thrum, and a gentle heat.  It was an odd sensation, and she subconsciously kept a hand on her stomach, as if to listen more carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The words written on the statue were a clumsy attempt by the previous owner, she expected, to sound smart.  If they had written in English, she expected he would have written the words \"spirit\" and \"crucible.\"  She didn't want to leap to conclusions based on such a simple discovery, but she had an active imagination.  Could it be, if magic were real in some capacity, that she was not carrying a human child?  Or, if magic weren't real as was most likely, could she have grown a tumor overnight?  Her concerns were halted when she reached her home.  There were strange lights emanating from the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The acre of land that constituted her front yard was full of fireflies.  As she went up the driveway, she slowed down to gaze at the marvelous display.  She had never seen so many, or any that shone quite so brightly.  It was beautiful.  When she parked, Sarah walked to her front door and turned to look back.  The lights were blinking in and out as they hovered in the air.  Many were slowly approaching her.  She noticed an envelope had been left on her doorstep, and decided to read it in the lamplight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Sarah,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>My name is Jun.  I'm sorry that I didn't speak with you yesterday.  Quite frankly I was nervous.  I owe your family a great debt, and I couldn't put it into words.  I've decided to try to communicate my feelings properly in this letter.  It was many years ago when your parents saved my life.  I used to work at a monastery.  Your parents were travelers, and passing through to learn about our religion.  Now, at the time I was going through a very difficult period, and I was losing my faith.  It became so bad that I needed someone to physically intervene, and your parents did so.  They asked for nothing in return, only that I pay it forward.  Even greater, they kept tabs on my condition, and regularly checked in with my superiors.  But one day the letters stopped coming.  It was a long time afterwards when I heard about you, and that your parents had passed on.  You may not know my religion, but suffice to say that we believe in a form of purgatory, and that the ghosts of the dead travel the earth for eternity in hopes of passing into the next realm.  The process of leaving all sins behind is an arduous process, to be sure, but none of us living can fathom the nature and experience of a ghost.  It is with trepidation that I describe what the statue I gave you is for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a kind of beacon, built to represent one of our deities.  Those that are pure of heart that are gifted this totem are said to be given eternal fortune to their ancestor's wandering souls.  It is also said that it allows the recipient to channel those souls, (and any others that they are receptive to) into the next realm.  I must confess and apologize that I doubt that you are pure of heart.  Nor do I truly think that was the case for your parents.  They were good enough, though, to help a wretch like myself.  I simply wish to give my dearest thanks to your family, in the only way that a lost soul like mine can.  Please forgive me for how awkward this gift must be, but it has a religious significance, and I mean for it to speak metaphorically, not practically.  Thank you for the blessing of your family, and many blessings be upon you in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah was not one to panic.  She had many academic and physical accomplishments, and all of them required staying cool under duress.  As she lowered the letter, however, she gazed once more upon the immense collection of fireflies polluting her yard. What she felt then, as her mind raced at all of the implications of what would happen, was quite akin to panic.  She was frozen.  One of the lights was extremely close to her now; it floated gently towards her belly.  For a moment she hoped that it had in fact been a firefly, but of course this wasn't true.  The light passed through her skin, causing a gentle heat and vibration to occur.  For a second she could feel her skin tighten just little, and then relax.  She didn't need any more proof.  Sarah raced into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0During the previous night possibly dozens of ghosts had found refuge inside of her, and she had no idea how to get rid of them.  Worse yet, her home was surrounded now by hundreds of them.  Why had they waited for her to return here?  Perhaps the totem had marked the area at the same time as her, and this \"channeling\" could only occur on these grounds.  If that was the case, then she would have to stay and attempt some kind of ritual with nothing but an enchanted totem to aid her.  The rule was now in place: she was a conduit to the spirit realm, a crucible for these lost souls until she either completed this ritual or somehow canceled it out entirely.  For that second option to take place: she would have to make a made dash through the crowd of ghosts back to her car, praying that not too many would reach her before she drove off the grounds, and pray further that they absolutely couldn't follow her.  There was no guarantee of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the choice, Sarah was in for an interesting evening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah took a deep breath.  Whatever was going to happen, she would have to do the best she could.  With conviction, she walked toward her room, a hand gently brushing the surface of her belly.  She had been shocked by how she had transformed as she slept.  Now the prospect of becoming even larger was frankly unsettling.  It was not permanent, supposedly, but she had no real clues of how to \u201cpass the spirits on to the next realm\u201d as the letter had suggested.  She wouldn\u2019t have time to plan, as the spirits were already passing through the walls of her home, drifting towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the statue on her nightstand and laid herself onto her bed.  Her thoughts turned to prayer.  \u201cPlease let me be okay,\u201d she whispered.  As she prayed, the spirits began to pass into her stomach.  Each one brought a gentle heat and a subtle vibration.  Sarah\u2019s stomach seemed to glow as each light entered her.  She began to sweat.  The skin of her stomach was warm, and she witnessed the surreal process of it expanding before her eyes.  Hundreds of spirits were racing into her home, and her room was now full of them.  With each spirit, her skin tightened a little more, then relaxed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had looked like she was expecting a single child this morning, merely five minutes into the process, she looked like she was expecting twins.  The orb of flesh stood tall and proud, pushing the limits of her shirt.  As more spirits poured forth, and the heat increased, Sarah relented and pulled off her clothes.  As embarrassed as she felt, she knew they were only going to become a hindrance going forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentle thrum that she felt began to spread through her entire body, which she found relaxing on her weary muscles.  The whole experience was so bizarre, and now there was a guilty pleasure that had arisen in her.  There was a subconscious part of her that, against all reason, was finding joy in this experience.  She had never really thought about whether she wanted to become a parent, she realized.  Perhaps this was one of the things that had been missing in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight after light came in, and Sarah\u2019s stomach continued to expand and broaden.  She looked like she was expecting triplets now, after only half and hour.  The rate in which the lights entered her wasn\u2019t consistent, but they were racing furiously around the room.  It was as if there was an excitement in them, that they were finally reaching the end of their long journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah reached out and grabbed the idol.  Whatever deity it represented, she wanted its help now.  Sarah had hoped that, through prayer, she could engage whatever process it was that removed the spirits from her.  With all of her efforts so far, however, it did not seem to be enough.  She thought for a moment that maybe she should leave after all, and ask Annie Patron for more help, that perhaps they could discover whatever process was required.  Maybe she could find the strange old man that had left the statue with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sarah was much heavier now, and she was overwhelmed and panting because of her sudden growth.  As she prayed, the statue began to react, and it resonated with a  sweet sound.  A sound, like a choir, began to permeate the room, attracting the spirits in the air.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sarah wondered.  The deity had heard her prayers?  She didn\u2019t have much time to think, however, as suddenly the spirits became even more hurried.  The beautiful sound emanating from the statue was calling them forth into her womb.  The hundreds of lights darted into her, and she began to grow at an even greater pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gasped.  She looked pregnant with quadruplets at this point.  It was overwhelming to see this massive part of herself.  Her belly, blooming with motherhood, was growing in every direction.  She splayed her hands against the taught skin and felt her belly continue to push out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked due with quintuplets, Sarah felt a bit afraid of how much longer this would all go on.  She was beginning to lose track of time among the tidal wave of emotions that she was feeling.  Fear, horror, apprehension, excitement, honor, even lust.  For a moment more the thought about leaving to her car came up again.  Get out, don\u2019t do this, you have no idea what you\u2019re getting into, she thought.  She writhed.  Her body wasn\u2019t listening to reason.  She thought she might lose herself in the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glow began to cast from the window into the room.  Sarah looked outside, and what she saw gave her pause.  Outside it appeared that even more ghosts had appeared.  There must have been hundreds in total.  All she knew was she was in for the long haul, to help the spirits pass on into the next life, for the moment experiencing a blissful motherhood herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey flooded into the room.  Her stomach continued to rapidly expand, glistening with sweat in the new light.  Sarah moaned.  Now, did it look like she was bearing sextuplets, or even more?  It was impossible to tell anymore.  The statue continued to resonate in her hands, the sound slowly changing as she grew.  Sarah was beginning to feel uncomfortable, the skin of her belly pulled more taught than it had ever been.  It had grown impossibly during the event, but she supposed it had to be magic at play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, spirits stopped entering her.  Sarah gasped, again and again.  Every breath felt like her first after being submerged under water for too long.  Her belly seemed to glow before her, and as she continued to pray, her wish was finally being granted.  The massive mountain of flesh began to decrease in size, slowly returning to her normal state.  The process seemed to go on forever.  Sarah was overcome with images of countless people.  They waved to her in thanks as they disappeared from the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much, and Sarah began to cry.  She had never imagined that something like this could happen in her life.  The enormity of what she was doing was finally sinking in.  She looked out again to the plethora of spirits remaining.  There were still tons of them.  She was helping them. This was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah returned to her typical stat, and for a moment she was gleeful to see her stomach as it had been.  As she had worked so hard to make it.  Despite her reprieve, however, the job was not done.  The shimmering lights of the dead began to grow restless.  \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Sarah said, \u201cI will help you cross into the next life.\u201d  As she said this, the glimmering lights danced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long night. Sarah continued to pray with the statue in hand, and the spirits continued to fill her womb.  A constant cycle began, new spirits replacing the old ones that left.  She had grown once more to the incredible size she had reached at her limit, and she remained in that state for several hours.  All the while, Sarah experienced what could delicately be described as bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sun rose, Sarah\u2019s job was done.  Every spirit that had collected at her home had passed through her into the afterlife.  Exhausted, Sarah took the best shower of her life, and returned to bed to sleep.  Even though it had ultimately been a fulfilling experience, she hoped that she wouldn't have to go through it again.  She couldn\u2019t imagine doing this regularly.  Of course, she realized that technically all of the spirits had been her ancestors.  That was a little awkward for her to consider, although the letter had stated that she could accept spirits from other families as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all a little too much.  Sarah didn\u2019t want to make a habit out of reliving the previous night.  When she awoke, she wrapped up the statue and placed it once more in the box that it came from.  Perhaps she would donate it to the museum after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah drove swiftly from the quiet suburban neighborhood to the city streets. It had been a 10 minute drive just when she approached a traffic jam. Mumbling to herself, she asked one of the passerbys what happened. They seem to have come from the direction where the traffic jam was occurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Do you know what happened?\" asked Sarah to one of the passerbyes. They seem to be a group of teenagers, composed of two boys and 3 girls. They saw Sarah asked and one of them a girl came up to her. The teenage girl had short brown hair tha curled at the tips and was wearing glasses. She wore a teal colored t-shirt with denim pants, white shoes. They seemed to be coming from the nearby school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theres been an accident at the cross intersection. Looks like a pileup of four vehicles, it happened right in the lane that you're currently in ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Sarah waved as the girl waved back. Ignoring the remarks of her friends. \"Ma'am huh? Do I look that old?\" as Sarah looked at the rearview mirror. She noticed cars behind her so she couldn't back up. She hit the steering wheel as she sat there, in her car, waiting for them to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in an emergency too you know!\" She thought to herself as she looked at her watch as 30 minutes have gone by. She ignored the blue orbs that seem to surround the car, thinking some sort of movie prop. Unaware that the statue had attracted them. People were coming out of there cars to see if they could see the situation but they were quite far. Others just chatted amongest themselves to pass the time. Sarah just sat in her car, annoyed by the accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just my unlucky day.\" Sarah said as she sighed as more and more spirits surrounded her. Then all of a sudden, one by one they went into. Caught by surprise, she gasped as she felt a cold chill after another enter her. And soon enough it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Sarah said as she looked around. Thinking that it was some prank. Then she felt her belly grow as she slowly turned her head to her stomach. The spirits seemed to want to make more space. Her hands clasped her belly as it continued to push outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on!?! Why am I growing?\" Sarah though as it slowly filled her knees. Her hips grew another inch on each side as her thighs and butt grew as well causing her pants to creak. In unison to it all her breasts stretched the sweater as well growing an inch and a cup size. Her stomach now looked to give birth to twins as it covered half of her thighs. Annoyed by her growth spurt, she noticed that the traffic was moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better move it. Who knows if I grow again.\" Sarah though as the traffic was smooth again. Sarah was annoyed that her breasts were getting in the way as she shifted and turned the wheel. Even more annoyed that she had trouble lifting her legs to accelerate, brake.and clutch do to her increased girth and weight if her belly. Soon she enough she parked at the parking lot of the museum. Sarah struggled to get out of the car due to her increased size. Her belly bumping into the door and then the car seat as she fetched her backpack and.the statue. Her breasts wobbling as she waddle a bit as she made her way to the entrance of the museum. Tired now that she was heavier, took.a breather as she paid for for the entrance to the museum. The tenant looked at Sarah as she was blushing red and catching her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright miss?\" She asked Sarah as she had one hand on the counter, slightly bent over catching her breath as her breasts quivered with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just not used to this thats all.\" Sarah said, finally catching her breath she asked the tenant. \"Do you know were Annie is? I'm Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. She was expecting you. I'll give you directions to her office.\" The tenant said giving her a map. Sarah thanked the tenant and slowly walked her way in. The security guard walked up to the tenant who watched Sarah disappear into the museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought Ms. Annie wasn't expecting anyone pregnant.\" Said the security guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but she fit the description she gave me. Probably a surprise for Ms. Annie. I mean that woman has to be expecting twins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda cute but I heard that that woman is a bit eccentric. Scary smart I hear.\" Said the security guard.</span></div></div>",

It was 48 karat gold with jade gemstone creating the chain that holds it together. There was a pendant that was rectangular but was transparent compared to the other jade gemstones. In the transparent pendant, there was an engraved picture of a woman in egyptian clothes, hands clasped above her head who was well endowed and had wide hips. She turned the pendant to see a similar fashion, transparent jade with an engraved picture but it was the curvy woman's body but it had a head of a hippo! Sarah began to feel sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting.... Can't believe that old man would give this to me.\" Sarah mumbled to herself as she continued to examine it. Then her phone rang as she slid her chair towards her phone. \"Bet Pinky would know something about this. I'll drop by her place later.\" Sarah thought as she picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? Sarah speaking.\" she answered as she heard some groaning in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Sarah. Its Leilah from the pharmaceutical company that used your formation for vaccine of a certain tropical disease.\" Said the voice over the phone. Sarah knew that Leilah was a short and stout woman in her late thirties. She had organe hair that was always tied up and a bit chubby. Sarah began to think which one she meant as Leilah spike through the phone once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one for the new strain of malaria? You need to come over to the lab to see this.\" Leilah said with the sound of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine. I'll be there in twenty. \" she said as she hung up the phone. She changed into a baggy pink turtle neck sweater with tight black jeans. Then she fixed her hair into a ponytail while wearing a black cap that said Ph.D. Grabbing her backpack with all her IDs, driver's license, purse and tablet. She was about to turn off her tv when a flash bullettin came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just in. Due to the sudden surge in buglaries in the county. The police annouced that all citizens should hide their belongings and keep their doors on and security systems in check. They advise to not leave valuables laying about and be weary of suspicious people wondering about. Please report to the police hot....\" as Sarah turned off the tv. Disgrunted she began to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the state of the art security system with cameras but I heard these guys are good. Besides my research work the only thing valuable is.....\" as her eyes wondered towards the necklace the old man gave her. Distraught....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine as well wear you but your hiding in my clothes.\" Sarah said to the neckalce as she put it around her neck. She put in her sweater as the pendant landed in between her breasts. She rushed to turn on the security system and locked the door. Getting into her sports car she sped off towards the city.. not noticing the necklace glowing benath her sweater.</span></div></div>",

Sarah saw red and blue lights blinking as small line of cars before her lined up. Seeing people out of their cars, she asked the ken and barbie couple in front of her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what happened?\" Sarah asked while lifting her sunglasses off and turning down her music. There was a country police suv but no ambulance in sight. The couple answered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A car skid into this protected area and crashed into a tree headon. Dunno what happened to th people in the car though.\" The guy said as Sarah pulled into the dirt shoulder to get closer to the scene. As she approached the police suv, the deputy was a dirty blonde woman who halted her. Sarah introduced herself as she parked and got out of the car with her backpack in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its you...D..\"  Said the deputy but Sarah told her to keep quiet. \"So glad of you to be here, I'm Deputy Risewald.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. I know what the accident is but how are people in it.\" asked Sarah as she saw another suv near the car. Two male police officers helping the man sitting near the suv while the other two seemed to pull out a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as you see Dr.\" Said Risewald but Sarah told her to call her by her name. In which she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems the male is okay Sarah but the female is..\" Said Risewald as she saw Sarah walk toward the male who was the driver of the car. The one deputy went over to report to the deputy about what the male's story. Sarah finished her analysis of the male. She began to explain to the male officier but seem stunned by her. Well it isn't everyday you see a white hair, red eyed, doctor about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem... the driver seems to suffer minor burns as well as a left broken rib. Burns due to the airbag.\" Sarah said. The officer was late in taking down notes. She walked over to the female passenger to her surprise to see she was very pregnant. She had long brown hair tied in a cross ponytail had a maternity blouse on and wore stretchable denim pants. By her estimate, she was due or 10 months into her pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's unconcious maam.\" Said the brunette male officer. Sarah laid down to check her vitals. She looked at the car to see the small car totaled in the front. They were lucky but she still had her worries over the mom to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that. Well lets see her injuries.\" Sarah said as she opened the button of the tight jeans. The woman had a bruise on her forehead as well as on her right arm. She opened the blouse to see bruises on her right side of her belly. Even more worried she asked the officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long till the paramedics arrive?\" Sarah asked blantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It quite a long way Sarah.\" Said Deputy Risewald, \" About 20 minutes since its rush hour. Apparently the boyfriend was in a hurry to get to the clinic since she was having contrations. He lost control when a deer was on the road and crashed here. So how is she?\" The deputy kneeled next to Sarah..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good.. if they don't get here soon she will miscarry.\" Sarah said as she saw a more worried look on the boyfriends face. Sarah wanted to help them out but she can't move her due to that she might injure the woman more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a way to help them... Just to add more time to them....\" Sarah pondered as she saw the deputy radioing for something. Sarah looked back at the woman to see there wasn't any movement from the woman's belly and she was bleeding from her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap... She miscarrying.\" Sarah yelled. Her boyfriend was paralyzed but tried to move towards his girl but the officiers told him to stay put as he may injure himself more. He cried asking for forgivness as Sarah looked around to see no ambulance in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it... If there was anything I could to to save this baby I would do it. What's the point of me being a doctor if I can't save the smallest of lives.\" Sarah thought as he slammed her fist into the ground. Causing her breasts to wobble tossing the necklace about as it glowed brighter beneath her thick sweater. Sarah then place her hands on the woman's pregnant belly hoping to feel even a bit of movement from.within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please save this baby.\" Sarah prayed as her eyes closed there was a bright light the blinded her and she fell on her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Sarah yelled grasping her head. She saw that the paramedics arrived and saw them put the woman on the stretcher the male was already inside the ambulance but Sarah's eyes went wide to see the woman no longer pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha.. Where did her baby go?\" Sarah thought as she saw the deputy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Sarah? Lemme help you up.\" said the Deputy as she helped Sarah up. Sarah a bit dazzed and confused wondered what had just happened as she heard the deputy speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you weren't pregnant and a doctor I wouldn' let you pass to help out. Just be careful next time okay?\" Said the deputy as she patted her back and walked back to her suv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she say...I'm pregnant?\" Thought Sarah as she looked down to see a large round belly stick out of her sweater. Placing both hands on it, she felt its smooth but taut and sensitive. Closing her eyes as felt her hips had widen. Her pants were unusually tight as her butt and thighs grew as well. Her hands wandered to her breasts to her bra tight as well then it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Gawd! I took her pregnancy!\"\" She yelled as the passerbys looked at her in confusion. Blushing she tried to walk but found her new found weight new to her. She cradled her belly as she slowly walked to the car. Sitting in her car, she had to make sure if its real and then she felt a kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... I really did take it but how do I return.. Is it possible? But how did I take it in the first place...I remember praying that someone or something to save her unborn baby.\" Sarah pondered as she went into a thinking gesture. \"Am I stuck like this?\" Her phone rang as she struggled to get it from her bag. She pushed her seat back a bit since her belly was touching the steering wheel. Answering the phone she found it was Leilah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" said Leilah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Accident on the road.\" Sarah answered rubbing the spot where the baby kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get over here. It urgent!\" Said Leilah as she hung up the phone. Sarah tossed hers at the passenger's seat and began to brainstorm once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems urgent but what to do with you..\" Sarah stared at her belly as she started her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
