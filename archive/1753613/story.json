She is cute and all, but her past had something so tragic that happened to her, that she ended up not being the same ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, let me explain the story to you, she was living in New York City when she was young, and she was victimized to many giant monster attacks that happened over the years in her life at NYC. When she was 10, she moved to Tokyo, only to have a similar fate when the Gorizilla (Godzilla parody) attack happen, then moved back again, but here is the most tragic part of it all. One day, she was running from a giant monster attack when her parents got killed in a train accident that was caused by the monster, somehow\u2026 when the monster got defeated by the superhero that everyone known and loved (you know the name anyway, so why bother telling you), it was too late. Chantal somehow got on fire and got seriously burned from the monster\u2019s flames, and she was taken to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith injuries this drastic, the Cyber Hero Project took her in as their newest hero, Since some monsters love their huge size, perhaps they need to make her huge as well\u2026 so they have created the M295X, a full 150ft tall battle mech that would be equipped with tons of weaponry and gadgetry that would counter off those monsters and help the city that they never could imagined. They knew that in order for it to work though, someone will have to take the armor itself, and merge it into their own, and Chantal was that person since her injuries were so bad, this was the only way to save her life. Chantal\u2019s brain was removed from her old dying body, and was inserted into the robot as its new master programmer, and controller. When this happened, the robot turned into a version of Chantal Carlonine. Same sexy look, but now is armed and dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal knew that the monster took her parents, and she vowed that she would defend New York City with her life with this new mech that she is now bonded with. She might be huge, and deadly\u2026 but she is still the same caring self, and would protect the city with the heroes and the government.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she came in, she became the heavy guns, the brute force, the supporter that everyone wanted, and the government got tons of respect because of her. Her new look now reflect a power armor suit that shows most of her skin, but uses a pinkish bikini suit armor to hide the private parts, and she has gain a lot of attention as a result, not to mention her weapons and her vicious roar that could shatter many into terror if used wrong, etc. Also, with new tech developed by Cyber Hero - Macro, she can now vary her height and weight. So she can be normal sized or bigger than the Empire State Building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Project taught her how to use this new armor, and how it now bonds with her as of this day, and ever since\u2026 she was doing jobs for the city that she can do. She does demolition when needed, she also does construction, monster fighting, security for certain events, city watcher, modeling, etc. She became the reason to enroll for many, for others\u2026 it\u2019s just to see this girl. They called her Giga Mecha Chantal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in NYC, Chantal was last seen\u2026.?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chantal was glad that she had such fans, especially in the young boys and girls as everyone seems to be in love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now here is a backstory on her success, her actions on taking out monsters, watching the city, etc\u2026 has earned her a lot of success\u2026 heck\u2026 Japan made an anime cartoon out of her, and she was a real fanbase there, and in America as well. Everyone like the fact that a young sexy 18 year old cute girl is turned into a 150ft kaiju fighting mech with tons of weaponry and such a cute and caring personality. Everyone basically knows her identity\u2026 and its Chantal, but the kids refer her as Mecha Girl, and Chantal really like that name, and would continue to fight for the kids of all ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer publicity even went into a motion picture itself, a novel of her success, coloring books, theme parks, video games, comics, etc\u2026. and she was by far loved even more than Vertigo, or any of the other superheroes you might say like Spider-Man, Capitan America, X-Men, Hulk, etc. Sooner or later, she simply became the reason to come to NYC itself, to experience Mecha Girl in all of her beauty, and her amazing size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal was playing with the many kids at the park as she has nothing that big to do at this moment as the government gave her a break after doing a lot of things, then suddenly a man shows up to see Chantal, and the kids left as they needed to get going, and Chantal can do anything, and thankfully the man in suits was not a criminal or terrorist at all, so at least it\u2019s okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChantal\u2026 or should I say\u2026 Mecha Girl.\u201d said by the man in the suit as he got to see Chantal. \u201cIt seems you are loved by all the kids in NYC and around the world, and how you are by far the most famous person in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true, everyone basically came to NYC for me ever since I became a huge star, do you have anything for me?\u201d Chantal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly, you see, I got a job for you, and you are going to like the job.\u201d The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Chantal asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How's my favorite Cyber Hero couple hanging?\" (Scott is Cyber Hero-Wingman and Penny is Cyber Hero-Whirlwind.) \"Hey Jesse. What brings you here?\" asked Scott. \"Nothing. Just decided to practice my skating.\" \"Well don't let us keep you,\" said Penny. \"All right, I'm off. You lovebirds have a nice night, hear?\" I skated away, barely keeping my balance. As I flopped around the ice, I mentally keyed in the tracking program in my suit. It lets me track a Cyber Hero's ID card and communicator, telling me exactly where they are. I pulled Wyvern's data up and let the program do its thing. A second later, it told me Wyvern was right behind the statue of Prometheus. I skated around, ready to dazzle Mya with my sparkling wit... That is, until my breath caught in my throat. Mya was behind the statue, all right. She was also making out with another girl. For a second I didn't know what to do.</span></div></div>",

And you're the copy, dreg.\"<br>\r\n I used my magnetic powers to grab a dumpster and hurl it at him. At the last second, he shot another fireball, knocking the dumpster away from him. \"Don't you know anything, dreg?\" Helix sneered. \"Magnetism is repelled by extreme heat. Which means you're about to be flash-fried.\" Another, bigger fireball soared at me. I pulled  some metal debris over me as a shield. After the heat was off, I stood up, facing Helix down. \"And what do you mean I'm the copy?\" I asked. Helix laughed and began radiating fire. \"My powers perfectly counter yours. Your father was Vertigo, so who do you think mine is?\"<br>\r\nI stared at him in disbelief. \"But... Velocity never had a son!\" I yelled.

Velocity's just a washed up joke now. Sure, he might have been hot shit once, but now he's just a senile old fool. Me, I signed up with the winning team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke, a strange hovercraft flew into view. A rope ladder dropped from the side, carrying a malevolently familiar figure. \"Night Terror.\" The words caught in my throat. Night Terror was one of the most diabolical criminals the Cyber Heroes have ever gone up against. His goal was to unite the entire metahuman criminal population under his command. He already boasted a formidable arsenal of villains, such as Waterspout, Storm Lasher, and Shadra. If Helix was working for him, the heroes were in serious trouble. I mentally triggered the distress beacon in my armor. Within minutes, this block would be swarming with heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight Terror hit the pavement and studied me like an ant under a magnifying glass. \"You are Vertigo's son?\" he asked in surprise. \"I expected someone more... powerful.\" I struggled to get to my feet. \"Hey, do I insult your kids?\" The bravado was going to get me killed. The power enhancers in my suit were dead and my natural powers were nowhere near strong enough to take on Night Terror and his goons.
