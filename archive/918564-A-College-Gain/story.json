Here he was, finally at college.  Go, he was happy to be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Matt, his dad was pulling out suitecases from the trunk of the car.  When he saw Matt just standing there, he said \"Hey, get your butt back over here.  Your the one who's moving in here, not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't help but crack a smile at his dad's comment.  \"Relax, dad,\" Matt said, turning around to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might as well be moving in here, with the amount I'm paying for this place.\"  Matt knew that his dad was making a joke, but he also knew that his parents were sacrificing alot to send him to FGU.  Hopefully, though, he would be able to find a way to lessen the burden.  Next semester, he would be eligable to apply for a music scholarship.  He wasn't eligable this semester because he found out too late to apply, but he was prepared for next semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the last of his stuff had been emptied from the car, he gave both his parents a hug and a kiss.  \"Now you be a good boy, and keep your room clean.  You never know when you might find someone special to bring back to your room,\" Matt's mother said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, honey.  Matt's mind is gonna be on his studies,\" Matt's dad said, \"make us proud, college boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt watched his parents drive off, then turned back to his stuff and started carrying his bags into the dorms.  \"Hi, I'm Matt Bryant, and I'm here to register for my dorm room and classes,\" he said as he walked up to the registration desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy behind the desk looked up and said,...</span></div></div>",

He made sure that my brothers and I made up for him.  My older brother is competing now.  He skipped college and most of his social life for my Dad's dream.

We can check out the girls and get something to eat.\"<br>\r\nMatt trailed along behind Clint as they walked down the dorm stairs.  Clint was certainly packed with muscle.  He felt scrawny in comparison.  Clint turned out to be a good conversationist, asking Matt questions about his family, school and career plans.  By the time the boys reached the union, Matt had decided that Clint was going to be a friend and he was still hoping that Clint might be willing to help him build some muscles.<br>\r\nInside the union, Clint led the way to the pool tables.  By the end of the first game, a circle of coeds was gathered to watch Clint's muscles ripple while he took pool shots.  Two games on, Clint had established first name relationships with at least six of the best looking girls and by the time Clint completely whipped Matt after five straight wins, his new friends were asking him to join them in the burger bar.<br>\r\nMatt went along although the girls were completely focused on Clint who soaked up all the attention directed at him. He watched his new friend enviously.  Food started coming as the girls competed to get Clint's attention.  Burgers, shakes, fries, there was plenty of food and Clint packed it away to the admiration of his new fans.  Finally, Clint was satisfied.<br>\r\n\"Thanks girls,\" he gave them all a smile which sent them swooning but it's time for my buddy and me to get going.  Tomorrow is a big day and we still have to get unpacked.  Let's do this again sometime.\"<br>\r\nGracefully, Clint slid his tightly muscled body out of the booth.  Matt followed.  It was great hanging around with a girl magnet like Clint even if nobody noticed him.  He formed a committment to hit the gym and build some muscles.<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was good.\" Clint remarked on the way back to the dorm.  \"My dad would never let me eat that kind of stuff.  I could eat hanburgers all day. Especially when there are hot girls bringing them to me. College is going to be great.\"<br>\r\nBack at the room, the boys finished putting away their clothes when someone knocked at the door.<br>\r\n\"Come on in,\" Clint called.<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Rob from across the hall and this is my roomate Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There's a great Italian place with big portions two blocks over.\"<br>\r\nMatt was about to decline when Clint said sure, we would be happy to join you so here he was at the Italian restaurant waiting for the family style spaghetti and meatballs.  He definitely wasn't hungry but if Clint was going, he didn't want to stay in his room alone.  Besides, Rob and Lance seemed like good guys.  Rob was stocky -- well you might call him fat.  He was quite a talker and Matt knew most of his life story just from the walk over to the restaurant.  He called himself a recovering jock.  After a concussion in his final high school football game, he had sworn off athletics and dedicated himself to good living.  He told his new friends that he was up 50 pounds from playing weight last year and looking forward to the Freshman 15. Lance had been his friend from kindergarten and was about the same height but at least 100 lighter.  He had gone out for sports but was just never able to build the muscle necessary to make first string.  <br>\r\nClint had drawn these stories from their new friends and by the time the food started coming they all felt like family. <br>\r\n\"Eat up.\" the waitress loaded the table with a huge familly style platter of spaghetti and meatballs.  There was a big bowl of salad, baskets of garlic bread.  Let me know if you want more of anything.\"<br>\r\nClint was already packing the food away. Matt couldn't believe he could still be hungry.  Matt took small portions and picked at the food while Rob and Clint ate with gusto.  <br>\r\n\"No wonder you're so skinny.\" Rob teased Lance. \"You don't eat enough.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid to get between you and the food.\" Lance retorted.<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Lance.\" Rob paused and looked his friend in the eye.  \"You said you were going to go on a wieght training program and build some muscle.  You can't do that without giving you body some fuel.  You need to up your intake.\" Rob motioned to the waitress, indicating the spaghetti platter. \"Bring us some more spaghetti, please and another basket of garlic bread too.\"<br>\r\nWhen the food came, he dished a generous mound on Lance's plate.  \"Now clean that all up,\" he told Lance while he dished up a massive portion on his own plate.<br>\r\nThe boys managed three big platters of spaghetti but it was mostly Rob and Clint.  On the walk back to the dorm, Matt had a chance to talk to Lance while Clint and Rob argued about who could eat the most.<br>\r\n\"Lance,\" Matt asked.</span></div></div>",

We don't want to interrupt you in anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, we'll play.\" Said Clint, \"come on Matt.\"<br>\r\nAs they walked down the stairs Lance and Rob let go of each other and moved further apart.<br>\r\n\"We've already guessed you two are boyfriends, no need to hide it now.\" Said Clint.<br>\r\n\"We're not hiding, it's just easier this way, not looking, no hateful jocks or ignorant Christians. We rarely show off like that, we just wanted to know where you two stand sooner rather than later.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not judging. i'm bisexual myself,\" said Clint. Matt felt his heart turn at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey where down the stairs now and walking out to the grass field. Matt let Lance and Rob take the lead and studied them.

His belly pushed his shirt quite far out and Matt saw the shape of some sizable love handles on his sides. He also had huge tights giving him a bit of a waddle to his walk. They were walking at a decent pace, but Lance didn't have any trouble keeping up so Matt assumed he had decent stamina in his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rounded a corner and came into an open grassfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob and Lance marked up a square on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are a bit few for this but we'll make it work.\" Said Rob, \"You just throw the frisbe between you, and if someone catches the frisbee inside the square his team gets a point. I and Lance will be one team and you two the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began playing. Matt and Clint quickly took the lead. they were both decent runners. Rob proved to be a terrific runner however and as Matt and Clint began to get winded Rob and Lance began to catch up. Rob would run and get the frisbe and then throw to Lance who never moved far from the square. They had been playing for about 30 minutes when Rob missed a throw and the frisbe went outside the square. Lance ran toward it as fast as he could but, not ver fast, but he missed it. In his attempt to reach it he lost his balance and fell. He laid there panting for a few moments before he began to get back up. He used his hands to push himself to a sitting position. By then Rob had reached him and helped him the rest of the way up. Lance was still breathing rather heavy.<br>\r\n\"Shall we call it a day?\" Asked Clint?<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" said Rob, \"Wanna go get something to drink? I think we could all use it, besides, we don't really get to know each other like this.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Clint.</span></div></div>",

His fixation with Max caused him to model his life around becoming just like him.  He succeeded.  The transformation was dramatic.  Mike was obese, out of shape, gross, smelly, just like Max.  If he hoped that becoming like Max would make Max appreciate him, he was wrong.  Max's contempt for Mike when he was a preppy, college boy didn't change when Mike became a slob.  It wasn't even because Max was straight because he wasn't.  Max was into guys alright.  It's just that his preference was tiny, effeminate guys who were very clean and wore lots of perfume.  <br>\r\nMax didn't even want to hang out with Mike even though Mike could match every gross behavior that Max had.  <br>\r\nMike's family had told him not to bother coming home until he could put his life back but even after that, Mike still loved his new life.  He loved the effect that his presence had.  Nobody ignored him these days.  He supposed it was the odor but he had long since stopped noticing.  Maybe it was the rude noises that came from Mike's flabby, obese body.  Maybe it was his long ratty beard or greasy hair or the fact that he would eat anything from food left on plates in the cafeteria to the bags of stale food in the trash of fast food restaurants.  He still shared a dorm room with Max but only because nobody else wanted to be near them.  Mike is still hot for Max but by now he would settle for just a little recognition.  The dorm room is barely big enough for the two fatties and yet Max will only speak to Mike when absolutely necessary.It is hell for Mike but at least he is close to the man he loves and idolizes.<br>\r\nThen one day Max drops the bomb.<br>\r\n\"Preppy!\" he calls to Mike. \"Listen up.  I don't want to tell you twice.  I've been stuck with your sorry ass for a year now because the housing office says I have to stay here and smell your raunchy ass.

Sometimes noises that sounded like sobbing came from the room but otherwise nothing changed.  The odors leaking around the door were gross and overpowering but stayed closed.

He stopped attending class, eating in the cafeteria.  He never left the room until after midnight, making his way to visit dumpsters where restaurants and fast food stands unloaded their trash.  Mike spent the night scavenging anything edible, the raunchier the better until his hunger was quelled.  Max might be gone but Mike still tried to live up to his lifestyle.  A cloud of rank stink followed Mike on his mission.  As daylight broke, Mike made his last stop on the way back to his room, visiting the bathroom to leave a dump that clogged the toilet.  Then another day clutching the smelly boxers and sobbing for his lost hero.  But all good things must end.  Finally the school year ends and the students leave the dorms for summer vacation.  All the students except Mike who by now is oblivious to what day it is.  The maintenance crew begins to renovate and clean the dorm to prepare for the new school year.

It was sickening but there was a job to do so the door was unlocked and Morgan stared into the darkness of the room.  There was a large dark shape on the bed.  Turning on the light, Morgan could see a very large body in ragged dirty clothes.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?

It was reminiscent of the fould stench of the gone but not quite forgotten Max.  The smell comforted Mike at his work and he made quick work of the task.  Then he moved on to the sheep.  By now it was 11 and Mike had been at work for several hours.  Mike's belly rumbled, politely at first and then more ane more urgently.<br>\r\nMike's impluses  directed his actions these days, the purposeful. directed college student and athlete was reverting to a foraging animal.  He had forgotten delayed gratification and the concept of earing a reward never ocurred to him.  He was hungry.  He ate what he could find.  He searcged the barns for something to eat.  And he found the bin of stale bakery goods for the hogs.  They were stale, dry and even mouldy to civiliazed tastes.  But Mike had long ago abandoned those tastes.  He got down on all fours and shoveled the pastry into his mouth.  They were just what he was looking for.<br>\r\nHappy as a hog in slop. Mike stuffed, burying his face in the Mike stuffed, belly scraping the floor as he dived into the bin. Like the forager he had become he had losts the notion of portion size or normal meals.  Mike knew that when theere was food, you ate because you didn't know when the next meal might show up..  Finally even Mike's big belly could hold no more.  He stopped eating and tolled over on his back breathing heavily. His overladed belly rising majectically,  Mike slept. </span></div></div>",

He loaded up his tray, taking advantage of the All-you-can-eat style of the place, and then went to sit with his girlfriend, Rita.  Rita was at least half the reason Mike had come to FGU - she wanted to be an anthropologist, and FGU had one of the few anthropology programs in the region.  Mike wasn't into that - though Rita's anecdotes made it seem interesting, at least.  Mike thought he might end up in business, or engineering, or maybe geology - he'd liked the course he took in geology in high school, when he'd had to have one more science credit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita had only taken a few things on her tray, unlike Mike, but one of them was a piece of pie - which Mike knew he was going to get most of, as Rita would only eat a bite or two, then offer the rest to him.  He didn't mind - after practice, he was always hungry, sometimes he thought he should take two trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rita,\" he said, stopping beside her and putting down his tray before giving her a kiss.  She reached up and put her arms around his shoulders, seemingly inhaling his scent before returning his kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great - but hungry,\" Rita said, as he dropped heavily into his seat.  \"Sure you got enough food?\"  Back when they first met, Mike thought Rita directed that question in irony, but he'd found out that...</span></div></div>",

Mike always teased John about the difference that the 15 pounds made: thicker neck, larger chest, and sturdier thighs.  But today, Mike just wouldn't let it all go.  For an hour or more after they'd returned to their apartment off-campus, Mike was still riding John about his size.  It was beginning to get under John's skin.  He walked into their large bath and stood before the full length mirror.  He took off his shirt, and stared at his reflection.  For some reason today, John was feeling a bit inferior to his partner. When Mike called him for dinner, he got in one last remark......he called John \"skinnyboy\".  That put John over the line  and made him angry.  He now was determined to even the playing field with Mike by packing on 20-25  pounds of beef to finally surpass the guy, or something, whatever that might be, to stop the incessant teasing.  John laid down on the bed and soon fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was awakened by the phone ringing.  The man introduced himself as Dr. Phillips.  He had known John's grandfather some years ago.  He had found a box the man had left in his care many years ago for safe keeping.  He said the note on top stated that it should be given to John during his third year in college.  John said that he was in his third year.  Dr Phillips offered to bring the box to the young man the next day.  John agreed to meet the man at a coffee shop near campus about three in the afternoon.

He loaded up his tray, taking advantage of the All-you-can-eat style of the place, and then went to sit with some old buddies from high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGreg and Reese where total opposites, although they were good friends. The three boys had been hanging out together since high school, and were very pleased to discover they would all be attending FGU. Often times, Mike was amazed that Greg and Reese could manage to be in the same room without strangling each other, let alone enjoy one another\u2019s company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGreg and Mike had been on the football team together until he had torn his ACL in their senior year, ending Greg\u2019s football career. Even now, Greg\u2019s knee was regularly bound and he attended physical therapy at least once a week. He was tall and lanky with dark skin hair and eyes, and at the height of his football career was extremely athletic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReese on the other hand, hated all forms of physical activity. This coupled with his large appetite made Reese extremely large, particularly around the midsection, as he had been for as long as Mike had known him. He was as fair as Greg was dark and had a spat of thick red hair atop his head. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Mike.\u201d Said Reese as Mike set his tray down on the table and slid into the booth next to Greg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow was practice?\u201d Greg chimed in and Mike thought he detected a note of bitterness in his voice. Mike knew he really missed football. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLong and hard.\u201d Mike said tiredly. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\u201cMust\u2019ve been, with all the food you\u2019ve got there.\u201d Greg smirked, eyeing Mike\u2019s plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d Mike quipped, digging in to some mashed potatoes. \u201cYou\u2019ve been packing on the pounds lately, champ.\u201d He reached down and patted his friend\u2019s midsection tauntingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA light flush graced Greg\u2019s dark cheeks as he too looked down at his midriff, which had expanded considerably since his days on the football team. His t-shirt was stretched tightly over a small paunch the blubbered over the waistband of Greg\u2019s jeans. Mike could see an inch or two of skin that his shirt was two small to cover, exposing the bottom part of a chunky potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShut up.\u201d Greg snapped, tugging his t-shirt down to cover his gut. \u201cI\u2019ll lose it all as soon as my knee\u2019s better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, Greg lighten up.\u201d Reese said through a large bite of pizza rubbing his own rather larger gut. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with putting on a few pounds. After all real men have guts.\u201d He patted his fat belly fondly and then turned to Mike. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you get to cocky. The freshman fifteen had no sympathy. You\u2019ll be fat too, before you know it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMike laughed and then said.....</span></div></div>",

Their parents had been away, which was part of the reason they'd chosen Joey's house in the first place, and also the reason everyone had been able to drink that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc had brought four friends over with him. Joey heard them mention something about being in the same pledge class. While they seemed to be the same age, they did not share a common physique. One boy, Joey thought was named Justin, was tall (6'5\") but quite skinny. He looked as though he was recruited a lot for basketball, but not muscular enough as though he played it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boy, Greg, was a little shorter (6' 2\") and considerably heavier. He had considerable muscles contrasted nicely with a sizeable beer gut that Joey suspected was fairly recent and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, the next boy, was still a little shorter, (5'11\") and even heavier than Greg. Where Greg had a muscular frame with a beer gut on top, Harry seemed to take all that weight and focus it on his beer gut alone. His body was a little flabby, but seemed oddly disproportionate to the round gut on his front. From the tightness of his shirt and the way it rode up to show his happy trail, Joey guessed his was recent as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Sam was the shortest of the group, at 5'8\". He was even shorter than Joey's current height. He was stocky, with a strong muscular frame, with what Joey could best describe as padding all over. Where Greg and Harry's fat seemed to be very concentrated, Sam had an even distribution over his body. Muscles were apparent when he moved, and the way his body settled, but despite this he looked very soft and cuddly. It was apparent why he got the nickname \"Teddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all arrived very much stumbling through the door. Joey, upstairs at the time, had heard Marc's careless attempts to get his key in the door, as well as raucous laughter outside it. He came to the top of the stairs just as Marc got the door open. The boys stumbled inside and actually fell on each other, landing in a pile at the bottom of the steps, with Marc uncomfortably at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it into the living room without further incident.

His dad's armchair had been previously reserved by Marc, by sacred fraternity ritual (or the knowledge that Marc would be dead if anybody spilled beer on that chair). With four sizeable guys on a couch with three cushions, things were a little tight, but none of the guys seemed to mind being that close. It was also clear that none of the guys were going to give in and go to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them seemed to be loudly debating about what to watch, trying to read the DVD titles from across the room, knowing that getting up meant losing a seat on the couch permanently.

He flopped backward, his arms going over his head, which caused the bottom of his t-shirt to come up, exposing a small curve of belly marked by a happy trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey walked over to his bed, and remembered that he wasn't supposed to know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, and what are you doing in my house?\"<br>\r\nRather than respond in words, Sam sat up, pulled Joey down to the bed and put his finger to his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Shhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden motion broke quickly through Joey's act, and his next question was genuine. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam replied, giggling, \"If I'm up here too long they'll think I'm dead, like in a scary movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey was sure they'd have to be even more drunk than Sam to believe that, but give what he'd seen so far tonight he wouldn't put it past any of them. Sam fell back onto the bed again, and Joey's eyes were drawn straight back to that patch of exposed belly. Joey suddenly remembered, unbidden, that the porn he'd been watching when his brother's friends had been very interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from his laying position, Sam grabbed Joey's shoulder and pulled him down to the bed as well. Joey looked towards Sam, who slowly turned his head as well. Joey had never been quite so close to another guy before, at least not one this drunk. Before he really had opportunity to consider this, Sam pushed him on his side. Joey thought he was being pushed away, until he suddenly felt Sam behind him. Sam's crotch was grinding up against Joey's ass, while his hand explored Joey's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instinctively, Joey scooted his ass backwards, which caused Sam to thrust. Sam's hand grabbed Joey's free one and guided it back to his ass, pulling them closer together. Joey clasped Sam's ass through his jeans, feeling the softness of it and enjoying the twin sensations of his hand on Sam's ass and Sam's crotch on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

Sam was embarrassed as it suddenly occurred to him what he was doing. Joey was just frustrated at his brother's timing. Joey was also the only one able to meet anyone's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc didn't bring any of his frat friends over again after that night. One night, when he learned that Joey would be going to the same school he did, he pulled Joey aside. It was the only time he ever spoke of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, I need you to know some things.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n\"My frat brothers are some of my best friends. There are few things I wouldn't do for them.\"<br>\r\n\"Um... okay.\"<br>\r\n\"And you're my brother. If you're gay, or bi, or whatever, I don't care.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We've been over that, but ok.\"<br>\r\n\"The brothers at my frat... most of them are 4 beer queers.\"<br>\r\n\"It only takes four beers? I thought the standard was six.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever, it's a figure of speech. The important thing is, that some of them get very handsy when drunk, but get mean about it again when sober.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah.\"<br>\r\n\"So, do what you want in college, just be careful.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's last year in high school turned out to be a blast. He enjoyed himself, knowing college was in his grasp, and emerged as the relaxed, easy-going guy with the infectious smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a year after that awkward conversation, Joey found himself on his way to college. Marc had graduated, but the boys who had come over to his house once were still there, and were now Seniors. Despite his brother's warning, Joey was anxiously looking forward to reconnecting with the boys and especially Sam. At the first opportunity, he pledged his brother's frat, knowing he would get in by their legacy policy...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From his brother's description, the initiation for legacies was easy, but Joey didn't presume anything. On the night pledging began, he sat in a chair before a table of the officers; the same brothers who had been on his couch a year prior. They tried to look official; even dressed in suits, but when you've seen a group of boys in a drunken dog pile in your foyer, it's hard to ever take them seriously again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, who was apparently now the president, spoke first. \"Your brother probably told you about legacy initiation. It's a seperate process from new initiates, but in many ways more difficult to complete. You have one month to convince each of us, individually, that you should be a member of our fraternity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How to do it, and what it will take, are things you'll have to discover on your own. The only rule is, you can not speak a word to us until the end of the month, when we are seated here again. The vote must be unanimous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey had no idea what they were looking for. Convince them he was worthy, without saying a word? He decided to ask around, and talk to the current brothers to see if they had any hints. One of the brothers,\u00a0Tom, Joey remembered Marc mentioning. At the party later that night, he pulled Tom aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I do it? How do I convince them to let me in?\"<br>\r\n\"You have to do it in order, up the line of officers, from Treasurer up to President. So first Harry, then Greg, Justin and Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will it take to convince Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Harry's easy. He's always been the heaviest kid in the frat, ever since he joined, and he's looking for someone to take his place. Convince him that you're serious about eating, and you'll have his vote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Greg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink him under the table. Which is simple, but not easy. You'll have to warm up to it first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure you've already got Justin's vote. I'll talk to him and let you know once you get past Harry and Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause in which Joey notably didn't ask about Sam, and Tom felt he had to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to know about Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to get Sam's vote already,\" Joey said. He'd been planning for Sam's vote ever since a year ago. The next day, he set about getting Harry's vote. Getting into the cafeteria was easy. All freshman were essentially forced to take a nearly limitless meal plan, so they couldn't possibly run out of food. The trick for Joey was, he had to be there enough, and eat heavily enough, that it would catch Harry's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day, he missed two classes to spend an extra hour and a half in the cafeteria, keeping an eye out for Harry. He spent the time chowing down, eating more than he ever had. The food wasn't high quality, but it was definitely greasy and delicious. The cafeteria kept a hot grill running throughout each meal, constantly stocked with pizza slices, burgers, hot dogs and fries. Joey, in turn, kept his tray full of those things, and always closed with a big dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, Joey went home with a painfully full belly, twice. The walk home seemed long, and uncomfortable. He fell asleep on his own couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Joey didn't have class and got an early start on a huge breakfast. Pancakes were legitimately his favorite food, so convincing Harry or not, he piled his plate high and ate several short stacks. He lost himself in the food, loving pancakes so much he didn't notice until he was just as stuffed as the night before. He got up, and started to make his way home. He noticed Harry on the way out. Harry...</span></div></div>",

Just trust me on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey nodded again. Finally, Harry handed him a card from his wallet that looked like a credit card, but had no magnetic bar. As he drove Joey home, he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guy who owns the local pizza and burger place is a veteran brother, and my mentor when I joined. He'll help you out when the cafeteria is closed, or you don't want to get out. Call him, give the clerk this credit card number, and he'll deliver whatever you want free of charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey nodded again, this time openly excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We take care of our brothers,\" Harry said. \"But don't disappoint us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached Joey's dorm, and he got out. Harry drove away. Joey ran up to his room, forgetting he was still stuffed with breakfast. He grabbed a cup from his room, mixed a shake and prepared a pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to lift the cup to his lips when it occurred to him he had no idea what this stuff was, or what it would do to him.

Joey's classes were thankfully easy, because the shake and the eating had him sleeping a lot. Two, sometimes three times a week, Joey would also join in drinking games with the brothers of the frat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also made liberal use of the card Harry had given him, ordering all kinds of greasy foods after hours, even sharing some with Tom. After a week of this behavior, Joey had undergone almost unbelievable changes. He'd put on 20 lbs. The tight and muscular body he had entered college with was disappearing under a growing padding all over, with a concentration at a sudden and recent beer gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new starter belly was soft and wonderfully round. Tom loved playing with it at every meal as it got bigger, day by day. Harry was also noticing the changes, and would frequently stop by the two of them to compliment Joey's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's reputation as a partier was growing among the brothers, as well.

His shirts were all tight, and his new belly consistently stuck out the bottom of any he wore.

Joey was developing nicely.<br>\r\n\"So how do you like the frat? You seem to be settling into the lifestyle.\"<br>\r\n\"I like it.\" Joey answered.  he had been expecting Harry to talk to him and he wanted to get Harry's approval.  With Harry, he should be good to membership. Still he remembered that he had been warned that Harry just wanted some pledge that was bigger than him.  He eyed Harry's soft belly and looked down at his own.  He wasn't even close.  He tried to puff it out a bit.<br>\r\n\"I've really embraced college life.  Haven't been here a month and I've more than doubled the old freshman 15.  Look at this gut. I guess you could say that college agrees with me.\"<br>\r\nJoey grabbed his belly and gave it a good joggle.<br>\r\nYeah, I can see that. It's a good start.  You know about the Biggest Pledge Challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, never heard of it&gt;\"<br>\r\n\"Well it's like this each of the fraternities enters a pledge in the competition and the one that gains the most weight first semester gets $5,000 for the social fund.  The last time Sigma Sigma won was my freshman year.  I won by going from 140 to 225.  I'm counting on you to win the prize for us this year but it's going to be more competitive this year because the other frats have developed a feeding program.  It is going to take a real team effort for us to win and the frat has selected you as our entry.  You have a good start but to win we have to get serious.  Are you in?\"<br>\r\nJoey wasn't sure.  He wanted to join the frat and he didn't mind gaining weight if it meant eating lots of good food and sucking down beer.  He had already gained 50 pounds to a chunky 190.  Thirty five more would match Harry's record and he'd be 225 but Harry said that wouldn't be enough.  Maybe he'd need to hit 250.  He would be huge.  Maybe bigger than Harry. <br>\r\n\"That's a lot of weight.  I don't know it I can do it.\"<br>\r\n\"It won't be just you.\" Harry reassured him.  \"The whole frat will be helping you.  You won't have to lift a finger from now on.  We will have someone attend class and take notes for you.  You won't have to get up except to shit and if that's too much trouble we can work that out too.  You'll be the hero of the frat- heck all the frats.  You will literally and figuratively be a big man on campus.  What do you say?\"<br>\r\nJoey was in but maybe he could play it to his advantage.<br>\r\n\"I'll do it if I can have a coach to work with me and keep me encouraged.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joey had a terrible headache. He opened his eyes, as slowly as possible, and then closed them in a flash, pained by the dimmest of lights. It was late on a Saturday morning, though at the moment he was certain he wouldn't be moving again for a week. Among other things, he felt chilly and when he went to rub his arms he realized that this might be because he was not wearing a shirt. Or pants apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathered his willpower. Breathed slowly and opened his eyes. Someone had mercifully drawn all the blinds in the room and his eyes slowly adjusted to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\neverything was demolished. The building was still standing and there was only one new hole in the wall, but furniture had been trashed, everything was covered in sharpie drawings (mostly penises, of course) but most of all, the room was practically a ball pit full of beer cans -- the floor was completely invisible. With the waste around him, Joey was no longer surprised he had blacked out, he wouldn't be surprised if the entire frat had no memory of last night. And most of them seemed to be in the room themselves, also shirtless. You could tell the rough order in which they passed out by the amount of Sharpie drawings on them. Joey looked down at himself and had to chuckle. There were no penises, which was apparently the prize for being the winner. The word \"Champion\" however was scrawled across his chest in uneven letters. Joey smiled in spite of himself. He noticed Tom across the room, still sleeping. The evidence pointed to him being one of the first to pass out, so he decided to leave him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey managed to negotiate getting up and waded out of the room. It wasn't really possible to be quiet when passing through 4 inch deep beer cans all over the floor, but he gave it his best hungover effort. He made it to the kitchen and plopped down in a chair. He had not bothered to put on additional clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey grunted in lieu of a surprised jump. Looking up, he saw Justin at the stove. Given how much was already cooked and how much was waiting, Joey realized that he must have already been there unnoticed. This thought should have bothered him. Justin asked, \"You're on Harry's supplements, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey nodded, as much as one could with their face lying on the table. Justin placed a glass with a thick, red and pink smoothie on the table. He stuck in a straw. \"You're in luck. Drink up. You can talk, by the way. I won't tell and nobody else will be up for another hour, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey simply complied not considering that there were alternatives. As soon as he sucked down the first sip he began to feel better. Immensely better. And as his reasoning returned he realized that this was a little odd. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't yet able to voice his concerns eloquently. Justin knew what he meant anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a funny side effect of those pills he has you taking. Hangovers are easily dispelled by a strawberry smoothie. I'm still working on how exactly, but I won't complain in the meantime. Pancakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey would have given it, but Justin didn't wait for his agreement to a short stack before dumping them on his plate. Justin had on an apron and Joey realized he was cooking the largest breakfast he'd ever seen a man cook. There were several pounds of bacon frying up, the oven was turning our sausages and biscuits every 10 minutes, and three different coffee pots were boiling to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you this awake?\"<br>\r\n\"Heh. I could be asking you the same question. You literally drank more beer than anyone else in the frat, including Greg, and that's saying something. But, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin moved his apron to the side. He was shirtless underneath and across his chest, in much more even writing than Joey's, was \"Judge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey saw a very skinny chest underneath. Justin had to be the skinniest member of the frat by a longshot. All of them, to a degree, had a belly, and some had muscles, but Justin was all skin and bones. Joey dug into his pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't drink much to begin with, but I didn't drink at all last night. Rules of the contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey noticed Justin looking him over a bit. \"I also enjoy cooking for everybody. It's a personal accomplishment to feed that many bellies. I do it a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey realized it probably wasn't an accident that everybody in the frat had a belly. But he shrugged it off.</span></div></div>",

I will say it's nice to have another gay guy, but it wasn't required to get my vote or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey smiled nervously and stopped eating. He and Tom had agreed to keep quiet about their thing. People had seen him coming out of Tom's room in the morning, but friends sleeping over was not uncommon at the house; Tom even had a sleeping bag laid out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin laughed again. \"Don't worry, it's a semi-secret. Those who would care won't figure it out, and those who know what's going on don't care. I wouldn't say anything until after your initiation, but once you're a brother, don't worry about sneaking. I certainly don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry chose that moment to stumble in. Justin had another strawberry smoothie at the ready, and he kissed Harry on the forehead as he handed it to him. After he'd had a few sips, Harry looked at Justin in a way that surprised Joey that he'd ever thought of the boy as straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let him talk, didn't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin only smiled. Harry was smiling too as he turned to Joey and said \"No respect for our traditions. Good work, last night, and the past two weeks, Joey. Any plans on how to get Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry dug into a stack of pancakes and eggs that would have normally fed three people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just going to finish what we started that night at my parents house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry dropped his fork and Justin smiled wide. \"I knew it!

Before Cal knows it, they're sitting on the couch close together and Paul suggests they watch a movie in his room, down the hall. Cal agrees. When they get to Paul's room, Cal notices two things right away. First, Paul has no roommate. He has the same, double size room as Cal, but there is no second person. Second, using the space where a roommate would be, the room is decked out with a college boy's dream. Paul has his own fridge, a large futon couch facing a huge widescreen TV with two minifridges, one next to the bed and one next to the couch. Where his roommate's desk would be, there is a microwave and cabinet full of snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...
