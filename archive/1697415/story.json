            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was lucky timing when an investor discovered Phil's head massaging helmet which had just been perfected. To promote it, he wanted Phil and Luke to come on a crosscountry tour promoting it. Glad it would get them both out of the house, Claire agreed to it, even though it was completely out of character. So now it was just the three girls home, but Alex was so busy with homework, chess team, debate team, math team, and other schoolwork that she'd barely even be there.<br>\r\nSo right after Phil and Luke left she went to Sam's club to stock up. On entering, she headed straight for the snackfood aisle, but not before getting a cart. However, instead of choosing a normal grocery cart she took one of those ones you see at Home Depot that employess use to get your new washer/dryer to your car that doesn't have any sides. She started with a base of red bulls and 24 packs of soda on the outside to keep everything from spilling. Inside that she moved on to the baked goods and loaded up on cookies and cakes and more. Having finished her bottom layer, she returned to snack foods and got as many giant bags of chips she could find. Lays, Fritos, Doritos, Cheetos, Tostitos; anything she could lay her hands on. By the time she got to the register, she had a four foot tall stack out chips, soda, and cookies with her. But that wasn't all. After putting this first load in her car, she came back and got another cart. This one she loaded up with ice cream, candy, and frozen meals, none of which contained under 1000 calories. By the time she was done, her second cart was as full as the first one, if not more. All her food barely fit in the van, so it wasn't a very comfy ride, exaserbated by the fact she had the A/C blasting its coldest temperature to try and keep the ice cream from melting. Luckily, Haley was in her room when Claire got home so she didn't see her put away all the unhealthy foods.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Claire had put away the vast quantity of food, she was completely exhausted. Needing to relax, she went into the living room to unwind in front of the TV. On her way from the kitchen, she passed a bags of Lays she'd just bought and forgotten to put away. Thinking to herself that she'd spent her lunchtime shopping, she'd have just a few as a snack. Of course, these are salty, so I should get something to drink, too, she thought, and thus rationalized grabbing a beer. She sat down at a lucky time, her favorite show was just starting. This episode was particularly good, and she didn't even notice how quickly she was eating the chips. By the second commercial break, however, she had finished her beer. Not quite done with her snack yet, she decided to get another; it's not like she'd be driving anywhere. This  beer went even quicker than the first, and she was done with it by the end of the half hour episode. Seeing as another episode was up next though, she really didn't want to stop. Right then, Haley came downstairs from her room.<br>\r\n\"Haley, can you bring me a beer?\" yelled Claire.<br>\r\n\"Fine, you're controlling the rest of my life, so I might as well!\" yelled back Haley.<br>\r\nWhen she opened the fridge, Haley saw a cheesecake Claire had put in. Grabbing two beers for her mom, she took out the cake as well. <br>\r\nHanding them to Claire she said, \"here you go, will that be all, <i></i>Your Majesty<i></i> ?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, and there's no need for the sarcasm.\"<br>\r\nHeading back to the kitchen, Haley grabbed the cheesecake and went upstairs. \"Take away my phone, huh? Let's see how you like it when I take away your hard work!\"<br>\r\nThinking she was somehow getting back at her mom for the punishment, Haley began to eat the cheesecake. At first regretting not bringing a fork, Haley set to work on the cheesecake with her bare hands. At the first bite Haley realized how delicious it was, so good she never wanted to stop eating it. Which was fine, because she had a long way to go before finishing the 18 inch cheesecake. About a quarter of the way finished, she realized just how much cheesecake there was, but she was full yet. With two thirds left, she stopped being the least bit hungry. This didn't phase her though, and she kept putting handful after handful int her mouth. Halfway through, Haley realized that her shorts were growing tighter, but there was no time to worry about that now. Two thirds done her stomach started to hurt, and her shorts were beginning to strain, so Haley unbuttoned them. Immediately comforted, she continued eating, not noticing her stomach had pushed the zipper all the way down by itself. She just kept eating, inserting glob after glob of rich cheesecake into her mouth. With three quarters gone, eating the cheesecake became a bite-by-bite struggle for Haley. But she forced herself to keep eating; she would not let her mom win. This could only get her so far though, and with only a few bites left she was just about ready to quit. Right then though, in her mind, she pictured her mom's triumphant face, gloating at her. This gave her the resolve to force in the last bites of cheesecake before succumbing to sleep. It was in this state, ridiculously bloated and asleep on her bed that Alex found Haley when she got home. Wondering what happened, she saw the cheesecake pan. Realizing Haley would probably be gaining weight soon, Alex decided to observe it as it progressed. So after taking several pictures of Haley, Alex dragged her to the scale, and stood on it with her. 230 lbs. She then stood on it herself. 109 pounds. This meant Haley weighed 121 pounds, about 16 pounds heavier than she was three months ago at the doctor's. Not all of this came from the cheesecake, but a fair amount, certainly. Satisfied this would be an interesting experiment, Alex went downstairs to do her homework. She didn't even notice that she herself was nine pounds heavier than at that same doctor's appointment. She also didn't notice that the skirt she was wearing was more than a bit tighter than usual...</span></div></div>",

There was already immense amounts of junk food that Claire had bought so all she had I do was get Haley to eat it. She was going to make sure Haley gained weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Alex got up before Haley and was going to prepare a massive breakfast. Going downstairs, she passed the living room where Claire was sleeping on the couch. Alex saw that her jeans were unbuttoned, her shirt had ridden up over her chubbier than usual belly and there were 2 cartons of empty ice cream on the ground. Alex entered the kitchen and began preparing the breakfast for Haley. She made waffles, Pancakes, eggs, toast, bacon, sausage and anything else she could find and laid it out on the table. While cooking, Alex helped herself to a muffin that was sitting on the countertop. One muffin turned into six muffins as she tossed the empty container in the trash and finished the cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex went up the stairs and woke up Haley for breakfast. Haley's belly grumbled in anticipation. By the time the two got back downstairs, Claire was already seated at the table and stuffing her face. Haley sat down  across from Claire and began stuffing herself as well. Lucky for Alex, she had made enough food for ten people, so there was plenty of food for both Claire and Haley. Alex just stood at the counter and giggled in excitement  watching Haley stuff herself silly. She watched as the two shoveled food down their throats as if they had never eaten before. Alex, unaware of her own actions, was munching on a box of cookies and are an entire box while watching Claire and Haley eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Haley worked their way through nearly the entire meal until they could have no more. Each of their bellies were fully visible under their shirts and resting atop their unbuttoned jeans. The two girls then waddled over to the couch and took a nap. Alex to the opportunity to finish off the food the two had left on the table. She are the remaining eggs, bacon and waffles that were left behind and stuffed herself without even noticing. Her belly had emerged from under her shirt and she was forced to unbutton her restricting skirt. She then began preparing another snack for Haley...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One week after the first day Alex's plan was started, Haley was looking at her much curvier body in the mirror. Her boobs had grown from a b cup to a sizeable c cup and they were overflowing her bra. She loves her new and improved boobs and wanted to make them bigger. She also noticed her butt had expanded as well. She loved her new big butt and could no longer wear any of her jeans or short shorts because her but was too big. She had to resort to just wearing sweatpants. What she failed to notice was her soft and large belly that was hanging over her panties as she looked in the mirror. She was so focused on playing with her boobs and butt, that she didn't even notice a change in her belly at all. She put on a pair of sweatpants and a much too small t-shirt and went downstairs to get some food. Haley didn't even leave the house once over the past week and she gained 14 pounds in one week, bringing her weight up to 135.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was also facing the effects of her own plan. Constantly being around food and preparing so much for Haley, she managed to stuff herself almost as much as Haley did. Alex was so oblivious to her eating as she was focusing so much on Haley's eating. Alex maimed to put on 11 pounds over the week and was up to 130. (Much more realistic weight) Alex, being smarter than Haley, was able to see her gain is her much softer breasts, her softer butt, and her bigger boobs, which she loved, but was ok with her gain. She said it was a sacrifice she was willing to take because if she was eating as much, Haley wouldn't eat as much and wouldn't gain weight as quickly as Alex wanted her to. Alex had grown into a large C cup, close to a D, and they were nearly spilling out of her too small bra.(Alex in real life has grown out of her ugly nerd phase an now has a really nice rack. Look up Ariel Winters and you'll be surprised) Alex couldn't get any of her jeans to fit, so like Haley, she just wore a pair of sweatpants and a too small t shirt down stairs. Her newly developed belly was even bobbing up and down a little as she went downstairs to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire May have changes the most over the past week. She had slept on the coach every night because she was too full to go upstairs. She would also help herself to a 3 am meal every night when she got hungry. She completely forgot about her plan of fattening up Haley and was taking advantage of all the food she bought. She managed to put on 20 pounds in just a week. She looked like she was pregnant again with a 4th child and was forced to wear her maternity clothes because that was all she had that fit her.  Her belly, boobs and butt all expanded and she was rarely seen without some food in her hand. She was now up to 150 pounds, more than both of her daughters and setting an example for Haley's and Alex's eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls stuffed themselves to the brim for breakfast and lunch and even more snacks in between. The three girls were lying the couch rubber their stuffed bellies when Claire looked at the clock and remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot, I forgot, the family is coming over for dinner tonight at 6,\" Claire said, worrying, \"Go put on some decent clothes and help me cook the food.\"<br>\r\n\"Why does the family have to come over,\" Haley complained,\"they're so annoying.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I don't want to get dressed,\" Alex said.<br>\r\n\"Girls, this is your family,\" Claire said, \"go upstairs and get dressed.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls each went up to their room and tried to find some nice clothes to wear. Looking for just a pair of jeans that fit, neither of the girls were successful. They each wandered into the hallway in their panties going into their moms room to try and find some of her fat jeans. The two girls wandered into the hallway and stared at each other just standing in a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, you're fat,\" Haley said scanning over Alex's body.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know, I've put on a little weight recently,\" Alex says, \"but you look stunning as always,\" lying.<br>\r\n\"Oh I know,\" Haley says, \"I just need to find a pair of moms jeans that fit, I'm a little bloated from lunch.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too,\" Alex says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls search through their mom drawers and closets until they find her biggest jeans. They both try them on and they are a good fit. A little loose for each of their liking, but they'll have to do. The loose jeans make the girls feel confident about themselves and forget to get a top from their mom as well. They each put on one of their own tops, which are now looking like crop tops exposing their full bellies. They put on a little make-up to look nice and style their hair. The girls go downstairs, bellies and boobs bouncing and into the kitchen to help their mom with the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls, everybody will be here in 15 minutes,\" Claire said, \"we're making burgers, hot dogs, sausages, steak and ribs with sides of mashed potatoes, French fries and dinner rolls. Is that enough?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah just make sure there's a lot of deserts,\" Alex said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah what she said,\" Haley responded.<br>\r\n\"Okay good, you two keep an eye on the food for me while I go get changed,\" Claire said<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" the girls answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Haley kept an eye on the massive amount of food that was on the grill, in the oven and on the stove while taking the opportunity to satisfy their hunger with cookies and brownies that were on the counter. The 2 girls subconsciously ate the entire pyramid of desserts that Claire had bought at the bakery earlier that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire meanwhile had a difficult time finding something nice that would hide her gain from her family. She decided on a black dress, well cause black is slimming, right? Well usually at least, but not for Claire. The dress was skin tight and showed every pound she had gained. Her belly was screaming to be releases and her boobs were trying to climb out the top as her butt was falling down, revealing itself in the back. She didn't know how poorly of a fit the dress was, but she didn't have much time and she stuck with the decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Haley were amazed at what Claire was wearing wen she came into the kitchen. The dress was at least a few sizes too small and made her look really fat. They told her she looked great so she wouldn't change out of it. Alex thought if Claire looked fatter, all of the attention would be on her and not Haley and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were just putting a finishing touch on the food as the doorbell rung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it,\" said Claire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire walked to the door as Alex and Haley waited in the kitchen. Claire opened the door and her whole family was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everybody!\" Cam came in yelling, \"You look great Claire,\" he said being nice, giving her a hug.<br>\r\n\"A little big if you ask me,\" Mitchell said laughing, hugging his sister. <br>\r\nLily walked in behind her dads and went straight to the couch. Alex and Haley emerged from the kitchen to greet their family. <br>\r\n\"Oh you girls are getting more gorgeous every time I see you,\" Cam said, \"how have my favorite nieces been?<br>\r\n\"Great ,\" the girls responded. Giving Cam and Mitchell hugs.<br>\r\nNext into the house was Jay and Gloria. <br>\r\n\"Something smells delicious in here,\" Jay said, \"thank you for hosting today,\" said Jay.<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" Claire said, \"it's my pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria was the next to walk in and Claire could help but notice a little pudge was emerging from under Gloria's top. Guys wouldn't notice it as they would be too busy staring at her FF boobs but even her butt had an extra jiggle to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone's here, so let's eat,\" Claire said. <br>\r\nShe laid out the mountainous trays of food at the dinner table and everyone sat down to eat. All of the girls took no time to get eating. Alex, Claire and Haley started up like machines and started eating the food. Gloria, who was going to take it slow, conformed to what the other girls were doing and began stuffing her face. Jay, Cam and Mitchell just watched in amazement at the show they were watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm amazed,\" Mitch whispered to Cam, \"I never that Haley and Alex would let themselves go like this. They each have gained like 30 pounds since we last saw them.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's weird,\" Cam said, \"but I think it's good for girls to do what they want and not fall into to the anorexic stereotype that many girls struggle with.\"<br>\r\n\"I never expected Claire to eat like this,\" Jay chimed in, \"she looks like she's pregnant and that dress won't hold her much longer.\" <br>\r\n\"And are you okay with Gloria eating like this?\" Cam asked Jay.<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I actually encouraged it,\" Jay answered. \"She was so concerned with diets and she wasn't happy so I told her to let go cause she was the prettiest girl in the world and I just wanted her to be happy.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh that's so sweet,\" Cam and Mitch said simultaneously, almost to tears about Jay's story.<br>\r\n\"Yeah she's already put on 15 pounds and it's not stopping anytime soon,\" Jay said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, Haley, Alex and Gloria were all completely oblivious to the conversation as the were so focused on stuffing their faces. 15 minutes in, they all showed signs of stopping, but were determined to satisfy their hunger. Alex and Haley each had to unbutton their fat jeans and their hard rock, uncovered bellies were lying atop their thighs. Gloria had just popped the button on her short shorts she was wearing and her full belly plopped upon her shorts almost covering them up. Claire on the other hand was really struggling with her dress. She was really uncomfortable and her dress was on the verge of ripping. She decided to lift her dress up above her belly so she was comfortable and had maximum room to stuff herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls managed to finish all of the food that was made, with a little help from the guys, and were completely stuffed. The girls moaned in pain of their overstuffed bellies that were all on full display if you looked under the table. The girls fell asleep in their chairs and would take a short nap to make room for dessert...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sorry for such a long chapter, I just had a lot of thoughts that I threw together)</span></div></div>",

After polishing off the pounds of food that had been made, they moved onto dessert and each ate an entire cake on their own along with a plate of brownies and cookies for each of them. Jay, Cam, and Mitchell watched in amazement as Claire, Haley, Alex and even Gloria stuffed themselves to the point of passing out on the living room couch. All if their bellies were on full display as the families left the Dunphy household at 9 pm. Jay carried Gloria out of the house, much harder now, and they drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire woke up at 3am sitting up and the couch and just looked at her 2 chubby daughters. Both of them had taken off their jeans and shirt so they would be more comfortable. Claire looked at how Alex and Haley's bellies bobbed up and down as they breathed. She took note to buy the girls bigger panties and bras as each of their boobs were overflowing their bras and their panties were on the verge of ripping. She was happy to see real progress in Haley and was  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0happy that Alex was indulging a lot as well. Claire then looked down at her own belly. Taking off her dress she looked down down, happy looking at her new and improved boobs, back to about how they'd been when she pregnant with Luke at about a D cup, but a little concerned about her soft, growing belly. She played with her belly and moved it up and down, squeezing it and almost liked the feeling it gave her. She then moved her hands to her backside which felt softer, much wider and stuck out further then she remembered. She also noticed her butt was just eating up her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire walked into the kitchen, almost a waddle, and looked around for something to munch on. Her loud footsteps managed to wake Alex up but not Haley. Alex wandered into the kitchen to see what Claire was doing. Alex turned the corner into the kitchen and saw her mother seated at the table eating a leftover cake with her hands. Alex sat down next to her and started eating as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, it's obvious we're both gaining weight and Haley is as well,\" Alex said, \"I don't mind the weight, and you carry it well, I just want to make sure Haley gains more than us.\"<br>\r\n\"Well ok, do you have a plan?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n\"Well yeah I was researching weight gain online and found that there is a weight gain powder that increases a persons appetite, slows their metabolism and piles he pounds on fast,\" Alex said.<br>\r\n\"Well great!\" Claire said, \"can you come to the store today with me and find it for me and help me buy lots of fattening foods?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'll come,\" Alex said, \"and then we can give her the powder in a milkshake or a smoothie without her knowing.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah that should work,\" Claire answered. \"I originally put all of the fattening food in the house for Haley, but I kind of fell for my own trick.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I fell for your trick too mom,\" Alex said laughing and petting her belly, \"I love my bigger boobs and butt though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Claire and Alex finished eating their 3am snack, they went back to sleep on the couch. As they laid down to go sleep, they saw Haley wander into the kitchen to get some food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls re-awoke at 9am with their hunger completely back. Claire and Alex made a big breakfast for Haley, but also indulged in it themselves. After the three girls finished eating breakfast, Claire and Alex got changes to go to the store. Alex put on a pair of sweatpants that had previously been really loose and comfortable, but were now tight and constricting her waist. Not trying to impress anyone at the store, she just put on a t shirt that exposed a little of her newly acquired midsection. Claire again went with wearing some of her maternity clothes and people would really think she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Alex soon left the house to go to the store to restock on tons of junk food, pick up the weight gain powder, and get some new panties and bras for the girls. They left, but not before reminding Haley that there was plenty of chips and cookies still left for her to eat while they were gone...</span></div></div>",

Midway through the week, she stopped wearing any clothing around the house and really stopped moving in general unless she was going to get more food. The weight gain powder managed to help Haley gain 30 pounds in just a week of use. Claire and Alex had never been happier as they watched Haley began to go from chubby to just plain fat. Haley was now up to 165 pounds and at the small height of 5-2, she looked even more. Claire and Alex had each piled on 10 pounds over the week bringing Claire up to 160 and Alex up to 140, but they didn't even notice. All they saw was the sag of Haley's belly as it hung over her panties, the bouncing of her butt at it had a mind if it's own and the overflow of her boobs which were now in D range as her bra was struggling to hang on. Haley really accepted her lazy lifestyle and really was enjoying all of the eating. In her mind she was still a healthy girl, maybe around 125 pounds and with a sexy body.  She really was completely oblivious to her gain and it showed no signs of stopping anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire got a call day and it was one of Haley's friends from high school. She wanted to talk to Haley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haley!\" Claire yelled, \"Jessica is on the phone.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Haley said waddling into the kitchen to get the phone. \"Hey Jess, what's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Well me and the girls haven't seen you in a while and we wanted to get together,\" Jess said, \"do you want to come over to my house for a party later?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah that sounds great I haven't seen you in like a month,\" Haley said, \"I just have to ask my mom.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, can I go to Jess's later for a party at 8?\"<br>\r\n\"Umm, yeah sure honey but let me talk to Jess after you're done,\" Claire said.<br>\r\n\"Yes thanks mom, you're the best,\" Haley said.<br>\r\n\"She said yes Jess, I'll see you at 8,\" Haley said. \"My mom wants to talk to you though.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay put her on,\" Jess said.<br>\r\nHaley hands the phone to her mom and walks back to her normal spot on the couch. Claire wanted to tell Jessica something secret and she takes the phone upstairs so Haley cannot hear what she's saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jess, it's Mrs. Dunphy, Claire said.<br>\r\n\"Hey Mrs. Dunphy, what did you want to talk about?\" Jess asks.<br>\r\n\"Well it's about Haley,\" Claire said, \"she's put on a lot of weight.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay?\" Said Jess, confused.<br>\r\n\"I just want you to be really nice to her and tell her she looks great, cause her self esteem has been a little low since she's put on weight,\" Claire said, lying.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Jess, \"I will be very nice to her.\"<br>\r\n\"Also Jess,\" said Claire, \"try to set her up with a guy who likes her, she could use that.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay Mrs. Dunphy, I'll try, Jess answered.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jess, I just want to make sure my daughter is happy and has a good time,\" Claire said.<br>\r\n\"Oh I make sure she has fun,\" Jess said.<br>\r\n\"Okay thank you Jess, this means a lot to me,\" Claire said.<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Jess replied, \"tell Haley to be here at 8.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay bye Jess,\" Claire said.\"<br>\r\n\"Bye mrs. Dunphy,\" Jess said and they both hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had to find something Haley could wear to the party, none of her nice clothes would fit her with her new added weight. <br>\r\n\"Hey Haley, do you want to go to the store and pick out a new dress for tonight's party?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes mom,\" Haley answered, \"we can go after I get a bite to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It really accentuated her curves beautifully and Claire was amazed at how beautiful her chubby daughter still was. The dress showed off her DD boobs as they were overflowing the top, which Haley loved, but Haley failed to notice how it showed off her new belly and butt. The dress was skin tight around her growing belly and her growing behind. The dress didn't even reach down to her knees and been displayed parts of her thunder thighs. Haley arrived at the party a little early being anxious to get there. Claire dropped her off at 730 and would be picking her up the next morning as she was sleeping over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Haley,\" Claire yelled as Haley walked to the door, \"have fun.\"<br>\r\nHaley just waved goodbye as she walked up the steps to Jess's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley knocked on the door and waited for a moment. Jess opened the door a couple seconds later. <br>\r\n\"Oh hey Haley,\" Jess said, \"come in.\"<br>\r\nHaley walked into the house and Jess was really surprised at Haley's appearance. When Claire said Haley had gained a little weight, she didn't expect like 50 pounds. They walked into the living room and sat down on the couch. Already set up for the party was a table of chips and salsa and a bowl of potato chips. Haley immediately grabbed a couple chips to much on and ease her nerves. Jess could see how she had gained the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the first one hear so let's catch up a little!\" Jess said excitedly.<br>\r\n\"Ok, how have you been Jess?\" Haley asked.<br>\r\n\"Well good, I found a great boyfriend in Jeff a little while ago,\" Jess said.<br>\r\n\"Ooooh,\" said Haley, \"tell me about him.\"<br>\r\n\"Well he's a great, nice, tall and handsome guy. He's perfect,\" Jess said bragging about him.<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" Haley said. \"How many people are coming tonight?\"<br>\r\n\"Umm probably 30-40,\" Jess said, \"only about 10 guys though.\"<br>\r\n\"Only 10 guys!\" Haley said, \"I'll have to get lucky today.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah Jess answered, but with a body like yours, it should be easy,\" Jess said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door and Jess went get it. It was the catering company Jess had ordered from and they brought in platter after platter of tacos, burgers, fried chicken and pizza for the party. They laid it out in the kitchen. Haley's belly grumbled in hunger and anticipation of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead Haley,\" Jess said, \"everyone else won't be here for 15 minutes you've got time to eat.\"<br>\r\nHaley practically ran over to the table and began making a plate. She piled it high with various foods and began eating. Though being wild in her eating, she made sure not to get any on her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the other guests were arriving, Haley had already stuffed herself. Her tight dress was strained even more over her globe of a belly and her slouching on the couch made it look even bigger. Most of the guests arrived at the same time, some saying hi to Haley, some not, but there was one boy whom was intrigued by her. It was a friend of Jeff's his name was Nick and he was a full on chubby chaser, but had yet to show that side to his friends. Jess tried to get Haley up and active around the party but she kept sitting back down on the couch. Jess had given up and spent the rest of her night with Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the guests were drinking a wide variety <br>\r\nof alcohols that were floating around the party. Nick, haven drinken some vodka, found the courage to sit down next to Haley who was currently resting after having eaten her 5th ate of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's up beautiful.\" Nick said. \"My name is Nick, and yours?<br>\r\n\"Haley.\" She said blushing.<br>\r\n\"You know Haley, I just met you, but I think you are the most beautiful girl in the world.\" Nick said.<br>\r\n\"Oh wow never heard a guy say that one before,\" Haley responded sarcastically.<br>\r\n\"No really, you have the perfect body.\" Nick said. \"Curves in all of the right places and I think you are sexy as he'll.\"<br>\r\n\"Well thanks,\" Haley says, \"you're cute too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick leans in for a loss and Haley accepts it. Nick is a good looking guy and a nice guy too. Nick puts his hands all over Haley playing with her boobs, belly and butt. They hold the kiss for like 10 seconds and it truly is a magical moment. They let go and are each in heaven. They just look at each other after and are in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme some of you vodka Nick,\" Haley says, \"I want to make this a night to remember for you.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said nick handing her the bottle, \"it already is.\"<br>\r\n\"If I chug the rest of this bottle, you have to be my butler for the rest of the night and bring me food.\" Haley says.<br>\r\n\"Ok go for it,\" nick says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's about a third of the bottle left so it was a tough task, but definitely not impossible for Haley. She puts the bottle to her lips and begins chugging. Nick watches as she works through it in a mere 15 seconds. He can see how the vodka it slouching around in her stomach, but not even phasing Haley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring me 2 plates of food.\" Haley says smiling.<br>\r\n\"As you wish queen.\" Nick said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick continued bringing Haley food for nearly the rest of the night. At midnight, as everyone had cleared out except for Jess, Jeff, Nick and Haley the food had finally run out. Haley was nearly passed out by now and could barely communicate. A while ago she had Nick help her take off her dress as it was becoming too restricted. She was now slouched on the couch in just a bra and panties with her belly nearly covering up her entire bottoms. Jess and Jeff had been watching Haley for the past hour, amazed at what she was doing. She had eaten probably 80% of the catered food which was made for 25 people. She had eaten about 20 persons worth of food and even for Haley this was a new record. Haley had not had this much fun in a while and decided to call it a night. Before she passed out and fell asleep, Nick gave her a kiss and a belly rub saying goodnight. Haley slept on the couch for the rest of the night in her food coma.</span></div></div>",

But luckily for her the fridge was stocked with microwave foods. Claire took out two microwave burgers and started to cook them, \" well it's not exactly breakfast food but I'm hungry\" she said to herself.

Alex crept into Haley's room to find Haley in only her under ware flat out on her bed, with her clothes thrown all over her room. Since her weight gain Haley was becoming a real slob not bothering to tidy her room or even wash herself. To be honest Alex was the only one who had not become a lazy slob since the all started gaining weight. After staring for a couple of minutes and poking her to make sure she was in a deep sleep Alex brought the scale and measured Haley's weight \"173lbs  woo Haley your getting really heavy\" Alex giggled to herself. After recording the result Alex took scale back to the bathroom however Alex being curious stood on the scale herself \"145lbs.

It was the local supermarket man delivering their shopping, ever since Claire had started gaining weight she had become to lazy to do her own shopping so she started ordering online. The delivery man went to his huge truck and pull out a massive box full of food she order \" ooh that is a big box I guess I over did it a bit ordering this much food\" she said as the man pulled the box into the kitchen \" ma'am this is just one box, there are four more in the truck. I don't know how many your feeding in this house but you have enough to the whole street\" the man said with a hint of sarcasm \" well it's just me and my two daughters \" Claire said \"sheesh.

However the rest of the weight went straight to her hips making the extremely large and non of her pants would fit and only 2 pairs of underwear could.

Haley was the largest Dunphy and she was completely oblivious about it her once perfect face now supported a double chin and her lovely toned arms now had bingo wings dangling from them. Her breast however had barely grown but were starting to sag but her lower half was worse her thighs were huge and rubbed together as she walk, her once firm bum was now massive and fat and then there is her belly which stuck out in front of her which seemed like a mile long, it was a huge globe of fat that sagged in front of her. When Alex measured her weight this morning she also measured Haley's, Alex was shocked to find out she had gained 20lbs in two weeks making her 163lbs but even more shocked and happy to see Haley had gained 28lbs making her 201lbs. Nothing fit Haley she had 1 pair of underwear which had grown/stretched as she got bigger and that was it, this made it easier for Alex to record in her journal. \"Mom we are out of food, I thought you said the food would last ages because you ordered so much\" Haley whined \" well we've eaten it all so get over it\" Claire said \" no you've eaten it all you \" snapped Haley. \"Well the supermarket is close for a couple of months, so I can't get new food in for a while, but luckily your dad got a huge raise so we can afford to order fast food when we get hungry just until the super market opens up\" Claire said. Just then a thought occurred to Alex if they had gain all this weight from supermarket food they are going to blow up eating only fast food. \"Well I'm hungry so can I please order some food\" Haley said \"ye presides I'm hungry too\" said Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello this is super fast your new local fast food restaurant where we sell any and all kinds of fast food from things like burgers, to pizzas, and even donned kebabs. How may I help you\" \" yes hello my daughter Alex  would like to order 4 Mega burgers extra large, 2 18 inch pizzas, 3 dinner kebabs, and a box of 8 piece fried chicken. Oh and all With a side order of extra large chips and a coke.\" \"Okay any thing else\" the man says \"yes and for me and my other daughter Haley we will<br>\r\nHave the same as Alex but with an extra 5 Mega burgers extra large, 4 dinner kebabs, 2 boxs of fried chicken. thank you \" said Claire \"wow okay that will be about an hour we will deliver and that is $124.97 thank you .\" \"Right it's ordered \" said Claire </span></div></div>",

There was bits of uneaten food all over the place and half empty bottles scattered around the floor. Alex crawled out of bed and waddled to the bathroom to try and clean herself up. Alex had gained a ton of weight but was still the slimmest of the three however she was definitely fat. As she entered the bathroom she immediately stepped on the scale like she did every day for the past few months to see just how much she had gained \" oof 218lbs. 55 pounds in 3 months, I'm getting way too fat\" she thought. Her boobs were massive like watermelons and sagged down to her belly, her face had a huge double chin, and her hips were so big she struggles to fit through doorways, Alex was getting really big but she didn't care as long as the rest of her family in the house was bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex then walked to Haley's room to see the fat mess she had become Alex had been measuring Haley's weight since the beginning  and as of now Haley was pure fat weighing 274lbs. She had gained a lot of weight and yet she still remains oblivious or maybe now it's just denial. As Alex enter and walked through the foot high lair of empty food rappers she stared at Haley as she woke up and struggled to get out of bed. Haley now supported a major triple chin and her bingo wings were so large that if she didn't weigh so much she could probably fly. Her thighs were ginormous covering all of the lower bed and her bum had become so fat that her crack consumes any underwear she wears.  Her boobs had grown but really just sagged and rested on her colossal gut, her belly was her biggest part making it very difficult to move and impossible to see her lower half. After she finished pulling herself up she almost instantly got the phone and ordered some food \" wow your fat \" Alex muttered as she left Haley's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Claire's room, Claire was staring at herself in the mirror \"how did I let my self go this bad\" Claire thought as she messed with her fat. Claire had suffered the most so for (ironic since she started it) because of her husband being gone so long and all the tempting fatty foods around the house not to mention her new developed lazy lifestyle Claire had become the biggest Dunphy of them all. As she stepped on the scale and used a mirror to see her weight she almost had a heart attack when she saw the number \" 303lbs. I weigh over 300 pounds \" she said in disbelief. In the space of 3 months she had gain about 100 lbs. Claire waddled back to the mirror to examine the damage. She had a huge triple chin and her arms were smuthered in fat, her huge thunder thighs now rubbed together making it difficult to walk and her boobs had blown up in size but now sagged down and rested on her gut. Her bum was incredibly large large sticking out about 2 feet in ever direction and it sagged down to the lower parts of her legs. Finally was her gut, It was like another planet, as it dangled to her knees and stuck out so far in all directions that she could barely fit through the doors sideways and her belly button was like a never ending sink hole. As she stared at her body in horror and shock she blame only one person...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This started because of her so I will finished what I started and make her the biggest\" Claire thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had curves in all the right places, her boobs big and perky, her stomach was flat and firm and she had the perfect bubble butt. She wore skin tight jeans which showed of her perfect butt and a tight black top which showed of her big boobs and hypnotic curves, she was gorgeous. When she arrived at the Dunphy house and knocked on the door she was greeted by Claire. As the door opened both Gloria and Claire just stood in amazement and stared. \"Wow she is super hot and sexy\" thought Claire. \"Wow she is super overweight. I mean I knew she gained a little but this is bad\" thought Gloria. \"Hiii, come in the guest room is all set up, you'll be staying there Alex will help take your bags.\" Claire said acting happy but was secretly jealous of Gloria. \"Hello Claire how have you been?\" Gloria said as she looked at the mess around the house. \"I've been good thanks but I have gained a little weight\" Claire said. \" really I couldn't tell, you look great\" Gloria said being polite but completely lying. Claire was a mess she, ignoring the weight gain she was in what looked like an xxxxxl seat suit and it barely fit her. Her crack seeped over the back of the pants and her stomach pushed out from behind her top, not to mention her hair was greasy and she looked and smelt like she hadn't showered in months.Claire recently ordered some new large clothes for her and her daughters knowing that Gloria would be staying over but it was quite obvious to Gloria that they weren't going to last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Gloria had settled she walked down stairs to see Haley and Alex sat on the couch in the living room eating food. After she took a minute to take in how big they had got she walked to say hi \" hi girls what you up to\" \"nothing just relaxing\" said Alex \"oh hi Gloria, it's nice to have another hot girl in the house\" said Haley as Gloria stared at her confused \"just ignore her\" said Alex \"would you like a burger we just ordered then\" said Alex. \"Oh no i couldn't got to keep this body in shape\" Gloria said. \"Come on its just one you may as well treat yourself Remember you are on holiday \" said Alex \"well if you put it like that one couldn't hurt\" said Gloria </span></div></div>",

Remember?\" Claire said \"ye but the supermarket is still closed because they're having problems with repairs. So how do we get more?\" Questioned Alex \" well the delivery guy from before said there was some stuff left after the fire and that he could get a couple of boxs for us. You just need to get them with this money a start putting it in Haley's food\" Claire said giving her the money. \"Ok\" said Alex <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Alex dragged to big boxs of formula the the back door. She check the living room to see Haley with Gloria ordering food. Gloria after only being here one day was starting to become more hungry she even ordered some fast food with Haley. After Alex had finished hiding the formula the food arrived. \"I'll get the door\" said Gloria as she opened the door and then brought the food to the kitchen and said \" I'm just going to the toilet I'll be back in a minute\" she said. This was a perfect chance Haley's food was right in front of her and no one would be around. As Gloria left the kitchen she said to Alex \"don't eat my food I know you've become a bit of pig lately\" she said as a joke as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was mad at her cheeky comment and thought \" we will see who the pig is after this. Mom can fatten up Haley and I'll fatten up Miss perfect\" she pulled out the formula and read the label \"Cause extreme hunger, extreme deterioration of the metabolism and cause Large weight gain. Contains 100g of formula use 5g approximately 2 tea spoons per meal also do not use over the recommended amount can cause permanent cravings and damage to metabolism \" \" simple enough\" she said as she turned around to grab a spoon her large bum knocked over the tub \" dam\" Alex yelled as she grabbed a glass and scraped all the formula (about half) and put it in a glass so she could throw it out. She put it to the side and the put the spoonfuls of formula in Haley's and Gloria's food \"see how you like that\" she said. Just then Gloria walked back in and Alex panicked and hid the tub of formula still left. \" hi Alex\" said Gloria as Alex rushed out. Gloria then grabbed a random glass from the side more focused on getting the plates out for her food and the poored not noticing the formula in the bottom of the glass as it dissolved when in contact with a liquid and then took her drink and food and Haley's food to the living room to eat her meal. </span></div></div>",

Constantly being hungry and never getting full Gloria was like a black eating anything she could. Her hand was glued to the phone so every time she finished her food she could order more. And thanks to Alex topping her up with formula her she was gaining weight faster than any Dunphy before. Gloria had also become incredibly lazy only moving to go to the toilet and order food, this made it difficult for Alex to measure her gain. However Alex had the idea to put the scale secretly in the floor just in front of the toilet so every time some used it she could check the history and see there weights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had also been blowing up since she started having weight gain formula and she was starting to struggle doing simply task like getting up or walking through doors and this difficulty amuse Alex greatly. Haley would probably be the biggest if Claire would actually stop eating but she couldn't and she continued to become even bigger. Alex to had gained some weight but she was starting to slow done, every since the weight was starting to go to her stomach she had begun getting more self control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that time of day every one was indulging in there food so it was time Alex checked every ones weights on the history of the scale.

What did you do drink the whole formula?\" Alex said as she laughed to herself not realising the irony. \"And Haley wow I never thought I'd see the day wher you were over 300 pounds\" Alex said \" this next couple of months with Gloria and Haley and the formula are going to be good\" Alex thought with a smile. </span></div></div>",

Her arms were thick and flabby and had become huge bingo wings, and her boobs were gigantic saggy balls of fat that rested on her huge gut. Her thighs were like big tree trunks and they harshly rubbed together when she walked, however due to her time at the Dunphy's Gloria was to lazy to walk so she just lounged around all day eating. Her once tight perky bubble butt was big enough to be confused with the moon and instead of being tight and perky it was squishy and saggy. And the there was her colossal gut, packed tight with lair upon lair of fat, sticking out like 4 foot and sagging to her knees. It was massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Claire. Even though she had been filling Haley with formula and fast food, her complete lack of self control and extreme addiction to fast food had caused her to still be the fattest in the house. Claire's mobility was rapidly decreasing and she was becoming more blob like by the hour. Claire could no longer walked up the stairs as it had become a car to difficult task for her, so now she just slept in the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Claire wasn't the only one who was become more lethargic they all were even Alex. Non of them wore clothes any more only their underwear which was stretched beyond belief and even though the supermarket had opened back up they had gotten so use to fast food that they continued to only eat that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was incredible, only being a few pounds of the fattest she looked like a ball of bubbler.

Gloria however was in extreme denial, believing if she could just once get bigger than Haley she could end the bet and go home and lose all the weight and because of this Gloria aslo spent the week stuffing herself for the week.

However the damage was done and Gloria had become too fat and lazy to loose any weight when she got home and thanks to her 24/7 eating diet she had become too hook and couldn't stop eating fast food and she had become permanently stuck to the 24/7 fast food diet. Even when she got home she spent every minute of every hour eating junk food and weight kept sticking to her like glue. It took a while for her family to get use to it but in the end they accepted it. Gloria was now colossal she had a huge triple chin and fat cheeks and huge flabby bingo wings. Her boobs were massive full of fat and sagged immensely whilst they rested on her titanic gut. Her thighs were the size of tree trunks and her once bubble butt was now like two huge barrels of flab strapped to the back of her which spread miles when she sat down and wobbled incredibly when she walked. Finally her gut which was the biggest of the four four by a bit and weight just stuck to it making it impeccably fat and impossible for her to see the floor and jiggled when she breathed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's husband and son came home for a week as the were on break and was horrified with what the saw but after a week or so to a just they also accepted it. However when left to continue thier work Luke said \" I'm glad I don't have to stay there any more\". And as for Claire she spent the entire four months doing nothing but eat and she hated every minute of being fat but she just couldn't control herself so in the end it just lead to more weight gain. Claire was now a blob of fat her face laired with chins her arms having massive bingo wings full with fat. Her legs like two titanic walking logs of fat and her bum a massive ball of fat separated by a gigantic gorge and her boobs small in comparison to her but huge for others rested on her now immense gut packed full with fat and sagging to her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was Alex ,who had remained the smallest throughout ,managed to Pack on the most weight over the 4 months. However still remaining the smallest of the lot she was now gigantic. After a full four months of weight gain she now had a huge triple chin and massive bingo wings, her boobs her once biggest part were still massive but now sagged and rested on her gut. Her bum was pure fat and spread so far she could barely walk through doors. Her thighs are like jiggle tree trunks and are unable to be contained in any pants. Finally is her gut which had always stayed small through her weight gain but now had taken growth and suck up most of the weight, it was now her biggest part, it hung low and wobbled with every breath it stuck out far bumping in to everything when she turns and spot in the centre was a giant hole known as her belly button which look so deep it never ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Haley who also hated every minute of being fat was now the biggest, even though Gloria over took for a bit it wasn't long before Haley hunger increased even more and started putting on even more weight. Haley was now colossal if she wasn't before she definitely is know. Most of her was like the rest: three massive chins, massive bingo wings which wobbled when she lifted them, massive boobs which sagged and rested on her gut but her lower half was just incredible she had huge thunder thighs which rubbed together every time she walked and her bum was a titanic mess, sagging down to the back of her thighs, sticking out so far it bumped every thing behind her and so wide that doorways were impossible to fit through and what didn't help was her behemoth gut which stuck out so wide and so far that even sideways she couldn't fit through doors and it sagged down to her knees and had a black hole of a belly button in the middle it was truely huge and even though it was only a few inches smaller than Gloria's for her height and age it looked humongous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after the four months Gloria came to visit, every body talked, ate food and moaned about there weights, and then Alex suddenly got curious, as she looked at the 3 behemoths before her and her self she wondered what everyone weighed. After every one had left Alex grabbed her journal and went to the bathroom a much more difficult task nowadays. She had made sure everyone had used the bathroom so that everyone would stand on the hidden scale , including herself. She recorded who went when so she would know who weighed what and then when she looked at the weights and recorded them in her journal all she said was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"WOW\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex- Was 109lbs - Now 479lbs - Gained 370lbs<br>\r\nClaire- Was 130lbs - Now 563lbs - Gained 433lbs<br>\r\nGloria- Was 119lbs - Now 584lbs - Gained 465lbs<br>\r\nHaley- Was 105lbs - Now 589lbs - Gained 484lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Thanks for reading, sorry if you think it's unrealistic and if you want to carry on just go back a chapter and carry on from there and thanks for letting me write to the person who started this.

The first few days had been torture, but she'd slowly gotten used to not having it. She did miss talking to her friends, and she really missed Dylan, who she hadn't seen since she was grounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone got home, Haley would retreat to her room, a tub of ice cream and bags of snacks in arm and not come down until everyone else had gone to bed. Then she'd eat the leftovers from dinner and be asleep by 2am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley's bad habits were slowly taking their toll on her figure as well, though not too badly just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes were slowly starting to pinch her thicker skin, her stomach starting to fill out from the over indulgence and turn into a small pot belly. Haley was so used to being able to eat anything she wanted (even though she'd tended to stay away from fattening foods), but her body wasn't used to her new routine and lack of exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley didn't really wear a bra these days either, although she had noticed her boobs had grown a little and was happy with the results, but she seemed unaware as to the effects on the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter six weeks of clearing out the Dunphy cupboards, Claire had had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get dressed.\" Claire ordered, throwing open Haley's door one Saturday afternoon. \"You're helping me do the food shop today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley groaned from under her dirty, stained covers - it was way too early for her to get up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's nose wrinkled in disgust from the smell of the room. \"You have ten minutes. And you're cleaning this room when we get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrnnhh\" Haley moaned into her pillow. She heaved herself up out of bed, knowing not to mess with her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she took twenty minutes, not ten, Haley did make it downstairs looking relatively presentably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this was her first time out of the house since she'd been grounded, Haley wanted to look her best - unfortunately her 'best' meant now-too-tight clothing that made it looked like she'd gained 20 or 30lbs. With every step, Haley had to adjust her outfit, but at least her boobs looked good, even if they were trying to break free from her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked wide-eyed at her daughter - this was the first time she (or any of the Dunphy clan) had really got a good look at Haley since she'd been kicked out of school. She made a mental note to grab some bigger clothes and bras for her daughter while they were out.</span></div></div>",

Haley didn't notice Claire had added in a few pieces that were 10's and L's in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Claire hoped her daughter's habits would slowly subside, she wanted a few options that would avoid a meltdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their trip to the mall done, Claire and Haley headed to the grocery store. What Claire didn't realize was just how bad Haley's bad habits and become, and that they were about to get a lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, the shop hadn't been too bad - they'd stuck to Claire's shopping list as Haley wandered aimlessly after her mother, trying to distract herself from the hunger that was brewing up inside her. They'd grabbed a bite to eat at the mall as a treat: both of them getting a burger and fries, but Haley getting a cookies n cream shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the meal hadn't been enough and Haley's stomach was starting to grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about halfway through the list when the smell of fresh pastries caught Haley's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm bored. Can I have $10?\" Haley whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire rolled her eyes in annoyance. \"Why do you need $10?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I spotted an arcade machine when we came in that I wanna try.\" She lied, \"At least I can't get in the way over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother sighed and handed over the cash. \"Fine. I'll meet you in the frozen section in fifteen minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley smiled and skipped off to the baked goods section as Claire made her way over to the pantry items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley sat at one of the tables in the baked good area, devouring her box of warm, creamy donut holes when she spotted Dylan walking in...holding hands with her best friend Krysta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Haley thought she was seeing double, but then Dylan bent down and placed a delicate kiss on Krysta's lips, cupping her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley popped the last donut in her mouth, wiped the frosting from her lips with the back of her hand and stormed over to them, angrily chewing as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell guys?!\" Haley shrieked, taking them both by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan looked around the store sheepishly, while Krysta surveyed her former friend, noticing her bloated tummy sticking out of the too tight top she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Haley. You dropped out of school and no one heard from you. You can't expect Dylan to wait around for you to call. Did you get stuck in your pantry or something? He has needs, y'know.\" Krysta remarked, smirking as she nodded at Haley's tight clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley went red and tried to readjust her top again. Unfortunately the donut holes had done her no favors. \"So I've put on a little weight, so what?\" Haley bluffed, not wanting to believe the truth just yet. She turned to Dylan, who was starting at her middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true...you and Krysta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan snapped out of his haze when Krysta nudged him in the side. He nodded silently as Krysta took his hand again. \"...Yeah. Sorry Hales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley's eyes began to water, and she ran off to find her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Claire had just made it to the frozen food aisle when Haley rounded the corner, bags of junk food in hand. Haley dumped them in the cart before Claire could say a word, and then made her way over to the tubs of ice cream, grabbing half a dozen one-by-one as she ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <i>bitch</i>!\" She fumed. \"She knew how much I loved Dylan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were streaming down her face as she placed another mint-choc chip tub in the cart, followed by a tub of salted caramel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Claire was about to ask Haley what she was talking about when Krysta and Dylan came down the aisle, smiling while Dylan had his arm around her shoulder. She thought it best to not say anything and instead took Haley to the check out, abandoning the last few items on the list as Haley added more and more snacks to the trolley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire would let her have today, and the rest of the week to mourn the loss of her first love, then she'd have to get a job before it was too late.</span></div></div>",

Dylan just broke up with your sister - let her mourn her first lost love okay?\" Claire told them, hands on her hips and a stern look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she realize she's let herself go?\" Alex mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed. \"No, I don't think she has. She'll bounce back with a vengeance after she's got over Dylan though, I'm sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde started folding her bags, hoping she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week passed, and then another and Haley didn't snap out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first six weeks (before the incident at the grocery store) she'd put on about twenty pounds, but it only took her two weeks to put on another fifteen, bringing her from 95lbs to a chunky 132lbs and because of her small frame, the gain was clearly noticeable at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Haley had noticed, or would care at this point. She only left her bed to go to the bathroom or to get more food to binge on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Phil were worried about their daughter, and even Alex and Luke wished their sister was back to her annoying self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil softly knocked at his daughter's door, a tray of chocolate chip pancakes and an iced coffee in his arms. \"Sweetie, you missed breakfast so I brought it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reply from the other side. Phil sighed and set the tray down outside the door like he'd done every morning for the last fourteen days and headed back downstairs to leave for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she heard the door close for the final time that morning, Haley slowly got out of bed, groaning with every movement as she shuffled over to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped as she passed the full length mirror on her bathroom door, catching a glimpse of her reflection for the first time in at least a few days and turned to survey her ever-expanding body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were immediately drawn to the pot belly that stuck out between the too tight underwear and one of her mother's old maternity shirts. A few days ago Claire had left a box of old clothes outside of her daughter's door from when she'd been pregnant. She hoped her daughter wouldn't need them, and although they weren't snug yet they were sure to be soon if Haley didn't stop letting herself go like she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley prodded the foreign mass at her middle, watching her finger go in a few inches each time out of curiosity. It had been harder last night after her last binge of double stuffed oreos, a tub of birthday cake ice cream and two packets of chips. She stood to the side to have a good look at her own girth and bit her lip - she looked like she was pregnant (not too far along) but she knew the only thing inside her would be a food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs were wider and mottled with cellulite, starting at the hips she never knew she had and filling out her jiggly butt. With every step, she watched a wave of fat ripple across her body, and the weirdest thing was that she wasn't disgusted by it. She felt a small thrill at how her body moved, and was happy to see that her breasts had finally filled out, even if they were just pockets of fat on her chest that -with thanks to gravity- were starting to droop towards her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile that grew on her face highlighted her chubbier cheeks and second chin; Haley had always had a baby face, but nothing like what it was now. Her weight gain had given her a more womanly figure. She felt...sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley snapped out of it when her tummy gurgled. Thanks to all her binges, her stomach had stretched so much that she'd wake up every few hours starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, she say the stack of four pancakes and knowing that wouldn't be enough to satiate her needs, she headed down to the kitchen to see what else she could scavenge. Her luck was in, there were leftovers from dinner last night: half a dish of mac n cheese with crispy bacon and a few slices of cold pizza (she ignored the steamed veg that was also left over - she only ate greens if they were drenched in dairy or carbs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the dish and pizza along with another few bags of chips and a gallon tub of ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley piled everything on the bed and dug in, alternating between pizza, pancakes and pasta while she gave the ice cream time to soften. Twenty minutes later, she lay on her sheets, her stomach a rock hard dome that was sticking out of her now perfect-fitting tee. She tried to get comfy but her underwear was digging into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing side to side, shuffling around and trying to readjust them but it was no use. She struggled to get them off, becoming breathless from the heavy weight of her middle as she ungracefully shimmied out of the small piece of material. Once she finally got them off she tossed them on a pile of undone laundry and pulled the box of maternity clothes closer to her bed, winding herself as she flipped onto her side to find a pair of bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slides them up, the baggy material giving her legs some room to breathe. <i>If I carry on like this,</i> Haley thinks, stroking the sliver of exposed skin where the pants end and the shirt begin, <i>I'm going to need a whole her wardrobe</i>.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the first time every, Haley poured all her energy into researching weight gain and everything related to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched videos of girls showing their gains, read fictional weight gain stories and read advice columns on how to gain weight, all while munching on the last of the snacks in the house as she hatched a plan. Haley knew she couldn't hide in her room forever, and food was filling the void of losing Dylan and being kicked out of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan was to get a job relating to food, whether it be fast food, ice cream parlor or bakery. With more of a sweet tooth, combined with the fact there was a chance of getting a lot of food to binge on at the end of the day, she was hoping to get a job in the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, she tried to get her life back on track: she showered, tidied her room, did her laundry (all at the disbelief of Claire) and applied for any food-related jobs she could, all while subtly getting rid of the clothes she was never planning to fit into again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Haley's new routine was checking her body every morning when she got up, tracking every new dimple and tracing over every new stretchmark. When she could, she would track her weight gain, rewarding herself for every pound gained by treating herself to more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer family pretended not to notice her weight gain, all while trying to limit the junk food whenever she was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Haley to land the job she wanted: a local bakery called Geogie's were after someone to man the cash register and -when quiet- help out baking in the back. She worked six days a week for around six hours a day, doing the late shift and binging on the leftovers in her car before the drive home. It was everything Haley wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few bumps along the road: Claire confronted Haley about her lifestyle when she hit 175lbs six months after the incident with Dylan. At this point her mottled thighs rubbed together with every step as she was slowly starting to move to a waddle. Her hips had widened, starting to knock into doorways and furniture as she adjusted to her new girth, including her jiggly but and leading to her large, heavy belly. Her belly stuck out a good few inches, hanging over pants and skirts and starting to cover her underwear as it hung down lower with every pound gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now had at least two love handles either side, with a third pair making an appearance when she held herself in certain ways, and while her breasts had become sizable cushions of fat on her chest, she still wished they were bigger. Her face did show some of the most damage though, with her neck having disappeared into a double chin before she'd even started at the bakery. Her cheeks had puffed out, and spots had appeared on her once-flawless skin with her new diet, but Haley loved her new girth, as did one of her coworkers at the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to go on a diet.\" Her mother stated one day when she caught Haley wolfing down her eighth cream-filled donut hole in the car after she'd got home from work.<br>\r\nHaley didn't even look her mother in the eyes. \"I'm finally happy again, and you can't take that away from me.\"<br>\r\nClaire stood there at the car door speechless for a moment, before huffing and replying with \"You're never going to find someone if you eat like you do and don't have a social life.\" before she walked off back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley smiled, knowing just how wrong her mother was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was the owner's nephew and creative mind behind a lot of the delicious bakes at Georgie's. He was tall, with the build of a high school footballer that was more on the bench than on the field with a slight, soft tummy that just popped out over the top of his slightly snug jeans. He'd thought Haley was beautiful from the moment Georgie had introduced them on her first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't taken him long to notice Haley's habits and growing frame, and something about her slowly expanding in front of his eyes turned him on so to help feed his own desires, he'd make Haley special calorie-laden treats before kissing her one night while they were closing up. A few days later Haley admitted to Marc between make out sessions that she was intentionally gaining weight. That night, he helped stuff her until she was fit to burst with sweet treats in the staff room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time he stuffed her was at his apartment, before they had sex for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, both Haley and Marc's weight's soared with Haley reaching 200lbs only a month after Claire had confronted her. That's when her mother gave her an ultimatum: quit your job, lose Marc and go on a diet or move out.</span></div></div>",

She was exploring her new bits and pieces and their mere existence upset her. She had always been a thicker girl but due to all the recent stress her weight had taken a serious upturn of late. She had jumped from 140 lbs to 180 lbs, a massive gain in her mind that put her far beyond any other girl in the family. Her glasses rested on a face that was rounded to a continually more circular shape and was sprouting a solid double chin. Her breasts had massive expanded overflowing from her tight, old bra. For the first time in her life her belly extended slightly beyond her tits and formed a distinct upper and lower roll beginning to hide her belly button. This gave way to flaring hippo that were as wide as the mirror could extend and a buttime whose cheeks seemed like inflated basketballs. Her meaty thighs and developing cankles completed the picture of the increasingly worried, overweight girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex turned on the shower and allowed the warm,clear water to washave over her growing naked body. A hot shower always had given her clearer thought. As she gets up her new rolls and folds she came to the conclusion that this would not stand. She couldn't allow herself to be the biggest in the family anymore. She worked the hardest. She was the smartest. She deservedid to be beautiful. Her family did not. So she devised a plan to fatten the girls in her family. To make them so big that no clothes would cover their shame. So big they couldn't stand, let alone walk. She would laugh at their dependence and inadequate bodies and be able to claim the high ground. To be utterly superior. Yes this would be her plan. But how.....Alex saw the bowl of candy and reached for it.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her parents, in their infinite wisdom, had left the kids to themselves for a few months as they vacationed with Mitch and Cam. Gloria and Jay checked in every so often to see that they were still alive and that the house was not destroyed, but otherwise, they were left to themselves. \"Hey, I got an idea to really mess with her, let's act nice to her!\" \"I'm sorry?\" was all Luke was able to respond with. He had heard some bad plans (Usually by his father, who already had plans for a helicopter helmet in the works.) \"No, you don't understand, let's act nice to her, and fatten the little cow up! You notice how some of her shirts are starting to tighten? Well, maybe we can help that along, and we can laugh at what an absolute pig she can be, especially with finals coming up.\" \"That, does not sound like a good idea..\" Luke said hesitantly. \"Oh, come on, it could be fun!\" Fine...

To their credit they didn't try anything too drastic or complicated at first, keeping their ideas simple but effective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off they bought plenty of junk food, potato chips, candy bars and cans of energy drink, perfect for snacking on while studying. They quietly split the household chores between the two of them, meaning Alex had nothing to do but sit around and study. And whenever they ordered in for dinner, which was pretty much every night since their parents were out of town, they made sure to get double Alex's order. If she asked, they would blame it on the delivery guy, but to their delight she never even questioned it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was still skeptical of Haley's idea, but he had to admit it was fun to finally get the better of his annoyingly brainy sibling. Haley was just looking forward to seeing the look on her smug little sister's face when she realized that she had gotten fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw the first fruits of their labor on a Friday morning, roughly a week since they had enacted their plan. Luke had been put in charge of making breakfast, since pancakes were the only thing he knew how to cook, and he served Alex up a huge stack dripping with melted butter. She leafed through a textbook as she ate, unaware of her siblings shooting each other meaningful looks. When the last pancake was gone, she stood up and stretched luxuriously. Her pink potbelly bulged out from under her red flannel shirt, putting pressure on the top button of her pants, while her burgeoning muffin top swelled over her waistband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some more?\" Luke asked, already greasing up the pan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shook her head. \"Thanks, but I want to hit the library before class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll drive you!\" Haley said quickly, grabbing her car keys. \"We can get coffee on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shrugged. \"Sure, sounds good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley let her lead the way, scrutinizing her butt to see if it had gotten any bigger.

Her boobs had also greatly expanded, going up to a DD, breaking many of her shirts and causing no small amount of embarrassment to her sister when she tried to put on one of her bras in the morning, it being far too small for her now. Exams had finished, (with her getting near perfect grades, as per usual.) but her eating had not diminished, and Haley and Luke knew that the time to step up their program was now. After stuffing their poor pudgey sister with an entire pizza,( Haley too had also overindulged in the fatty food, but swore to be better about it in the future.) the three decided to sit down to a movie. Of course, Haley had made popcorn for the occasion and planned to have ice cream served as well. Alex, to both of their surprise, did not seem to be in any way suspicious, glad that her brother and sister were being so sweet to her. As the movie played, Alex wrapped her fatter form in a blanket and soon fell asleep, laying across Haley and Luke's lap. Both were far too tired themselves to move their sister, and soon all three fell asleep, Luke feeling a bit guilty over tricking his softer older sister as they did and swearing that he would do something about it if he could.</span></div></div>",

She could not, for the life of her, figure out what was causing her body to jiggle as much as it did, but she knew that she should probably do something about it. For her health if anything else. So, with her iphone in hand, and her, admittedly small running shorts and tank top painted on, she walked out the door to do some running. About 1 minute in, and she already felt like collapsing onto the dew covered grass. It was a scorcher out in the southern California urbanscape, and her indolent frame had become completely averse to exercise. Her tits also flopped with her stride, making it one of the worst,(and weirdest.) runs she could imagine. She decided to give up and just run the way back to her house. But while she was jogging, her painted on pants finally gave way, causing her jiggling mass to fall. Alex quickly got up again, and scurried away, her freed ass shaking with every labored step. With her half naked, doughy body on display, Alex nearly had a heart attack until she finally ran up the steps of her house, quivering suggestively the entirety of the way.</span></div></div>",

By the end of the meal, Alex';s stomach sat a full foot in front of the rest of her, and she had to be pulled up from her chair. What surprised Luke was that Haley also indulged a bit.m Her tanned flesh was contorted into a slight potbelly. Her ass also seemed slightly larger. As the two Dunphey girls padded their way into their rooms, Luke came up with a plan. He was a good brother at heart, and knew that both his sisters loved food, so, he logically concluded, I should fatten up both of them.

Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta thought for a second, and then pointed to the hot dogs, \"Are we just eating hot dogs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For tonight at least; once we're finished training we'll move onto other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, Elijah Wood.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie slid a plate of hot dogs to her side of the table, she closed her eyes and exhaled slowly, opening them only to connect with Brittas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta lifted the stopwatch and waved it nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, three... two... one... GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie dug into her plate like she was possessed, in lightning speed she had managed to stuff the first hog dog into her mouth as she chewed ravenously. Within the next ten seconds she had already brought the second hot dog to her lips, and ate with equal frenzy. <br>\r\nAcross the table, Britta was impressed at her speed with just a minute having passed since Annie had begun, but predictably she began to slow down within the next minute. <br>\r\nStiffling a burp on the sixth hot dog, Annie's chewing started to slow, as she began to develop a slightly glazed over look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to sound like Alien Ant Farm... but Annie, are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie nodded with half-closed lids, stiffling a second burp as she prepared to finish off hot dog number eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt just six minutes, Annie had managed to clear off nine hot dogs, and Britta was convinced that at least three of them were being stored in her exaggerated chipmunk cheeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to stop now, we totally can...\" Britta offered as Annie struggled to swallow her 10th hotdog, \"I don't think Annie Kim would have been able to eat that many...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the mention of Annie Kims name, the brunette had become reinvigorated with the speed and intensity that she had started with, becoming lost in a spur of jealousy and a competitive nature that had never been challenged. Annie swallowed her 11th hot dog while stuffing in the 12th into her mouth like it were a sausage link, and this too was followed by another directly after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta was shocked, turning her attention back to the stopwatch, the LED display was nearly finished at 9:34. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another, like, thirty seconds Annie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this Annie crammed the final two hot dogs into her mouth, struggling to get them both down before her time ran out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing in pain, she swallowed fiercy and just as she had done so Britta called \"Time!\" and surveyed the damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in her chair, Annie breathed deeply, a sharp pain in her stomach preventing her from getting into a comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy... Annie, you had...\" Britta recounted the number under her breath, \"Fourteen hot dogs in 10 minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie could only exhale deeply in response, her wandering hands massaging her extremely bloated stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has to be a record or something...\" Britta mused as she wrote the number underneath Annies column. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... urp... hope so...\" Annie's eyes were shut in faux-meditation, trying to blot out the deep pain coming from her protesting stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Meeting officially ended at 7:36 PM but the two remained in the Study Hall until 8:12  - while Britta tried to keep pace with Annie, it just couldn't be done and as the timer rang out she had eaten an admirable yet less impressive 7 and a half. Rising to her feet, Annie clutched her stomach as though she were pregnant, and from the looks of things, that wasn't completely out of the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're feeling okay? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm...\" Annie winced, \"This is what victory tastes like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hot dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I definitely taste hog dogs.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't meant to be awake just yet, but thought it a waste to try going back to bed. Sitting on the edge of the mattress, yawning as she prepared herself for the day ahead - then smiled extra wide when she thought of Annie Kims reaction to her stunning defeat. <br>\r\nAnnie stretched, raising her arms into the air as she wandered over to her drawer to pick out her outfit for the day. After much consideration she chose something she had worn before earlier in the year - a straight blue top with black skinny jeans, she remembered picking out specifically to impress Jeff Winger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she snaked her legs through the jeans, she caught herself in the standing mirror across the room, black was definitely her color today. Bringing the jeans to her waist, she reached down and tried to bring the button closed, but found that she couldn't quite bridge the gap. With a sigh she took the jeans off and cast them back in the drawer. It was something she didn't want to think of. What if it were true? What her clothes had been shrunk in the wash by Troy and Abed during one of their laundry trips? <br>\r\nWithout a second thought, she arranged a new outfit and prepared to greet Greendale with a record  to make Annie Kim positively green with envy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the hallway that the two Annies would meet, on opposite sides like they were about to duel. They came together amidst the sea of faces with emphatic sighs and false pretenses - any observer would believe they were the best of friends, but underneath they both detested one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Annie!\" Kim began, \"Britta told me about your new record - 24 and a half, that's amazing!\" <br>\r\nAnnie was slightly taken aback, but ate up the unguarded praise all the same, it had been worth it, absolutely.<br>\r\n\"Well, you know... it is just by half...\" Annie tried to sound humble, but it was lost on Kim.<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. Oh! Speaking of records, I have someone you <i>have</i> to meet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie Kim turned away briefly, reaching through the crowd until she found someone and brought them towards Annie Edison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large woman with very full features had been drawn close, at first Annie didn't recognize her, but after a few seconds her distinct features won out. <br>\r\nIt was Neil's girlfriend, Vicki, though in the months that Annie had seen her last she seemed to have nearly doubled her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember Vicki, Annie? Annie, Vicki?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded, Annie dumbfounded and Vicki feeling out of place by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicki is Greendales prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for Speed Eating - she's been in district competitions and has placed during the nationals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie could do little to hide her faltering smile, and she seemed to be running out of false sincerity very quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We even managed to set a record last night - she ate seventeen hot dogs in just ten minutes! It was honestly one of the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie had stopped listening as Kim continued, she could only focus on Vicki... Vicki... Short for Victoria... Latin for... Victory. She tried to keep smiling but only managed to clench her teeth. She focused back on Kim with her boasting words... \"And of course Neil is especially impressed with her - she's been trying to match her own personal best for a long time now. What are you going for now, Vicki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped between the two Annies, Vicky was forced into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... 20 was my goal originally, but I'd be happy with 18 to be honest - it's still a milestone that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty hot dogs,\" Kim leaned in towards Vicki, practically taunting Annie. \"Isn't that incredible Annie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was forced to regain her composure. \"Absolutely. Wow, Vicki...\" was all that she could say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should get to class, congratulations again, Edison.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were gone, lost in a sea of students, though the wake that Vicki left was far more pronounced that Annie Kim's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight would have to be a night of record breaking firsts, for both Annies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seriously. Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie sighed, and snapped the notebook closed, bringing her full attention to Britta who stood up and lifted the front of her shirt. Annie tried to hide her surprise, but her eyebrows had already betrayed her. Annie had seen Brittas toned stomach before, and now she looked as though she were 6 months pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not eating any more hot dogs, and I'm sick of leaving this Study Hall feeling like I'm about to explode.

She considered hitting the snooze button once more, just for a few minutes of extra sleep. Her stomach gurgled from beneath the blankets, still swollen following the latest attempt to break her current record. She reached down and massaged it, hoping to quell the sound of churning. She smiled to herself thinking about the previous night; she had  broken through to new territory - sixteen and a half! But what was more than that, she had set a new record for herself during the 10 minutes that was reserved for Britta as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered it vividly from the previous night - she had the stopwatch propped up on the notebook as she watched the LED numbers climb, 9:50, 9:51, 9:52.<br>\r\nAnnie chewed voraciously through the final hotdog, number sixteen, her stomach was writhing in protest but she carried on trying her best to ignore it.<br>\r\n9:53, 9:54, 9:55. <br>\r\nShe had finished the 16th hot dog and reached for the last one on her plate, she bit off half and began to chew like her life depended on it. <br>\r\n9:56, 9:57, 9:58 <br>\r\nShe swallowed, hard, and her stomach became a sloshing cauldron ready to bubble over at a moments notice - she was getting painfully full.<br>\r\n9:59, 10:00. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stopwatch beeped its tinny cadence as Annie laid back in victory. She breathed as deep as she could manage and exhaled while stiffling a burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past, Annie would have stopped here, it would have been Brittas turn to take over while she could rest at watch Britta stuff herself. Now that Britta had officially left the club however, Annie had been conducting an experimental challenge with herself. <br>\r\nEven though the sixteenth hot dog and its trailing half had left Annies stomach feeling overstuffed and tight like a drum, she wanted to push herself further. Since the 10 minute time limit had been imposed, she finished eating when the timer concluded. Now, she had an extra 10 minutes to attempt to finish Brittas hot dogs, which could be counted towards the total score against Annie Kim - nobody could eat like her for 20 minutes straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Annie Kim was enough to motivate Annie Edison a second time, and she knew she couldn't break too long between ten minute sessions for it to be counted as authentic. So with that Annie reached for the stop watch, set a further 10 minutes and dragged the nearest plate of hot dogs towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the second attempt, Annie was not nearly as quick as she had been during her first Speed Eating session, and for good reason, while the initial battle was one of determination and confidence, the second relied more on trying to fill an already extremely stuffed stomach beyond capacity.<br>\r\nAnnie multitasked chewing and rubbing her stomach, moaning when it seemed hopeless and swallowing hard when things seemed hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in her body was telling her to stop, but she ignored them all and persevered, using one hand to massage her stomach as it got tighter and tighter with every bite.<br>\r\nAfter a particularily nasty jolt of pain shot through her belly, Annie chose to stop timer, leaving it frozen at 5:33.<br>\r\nShe wanted to have more, but she knew that if did there would be trouble. She leaned back into her chair and exhaled heavily, her taut stomach completely round and immovable. 19 and a half hot dogs in 15 minutes - Annie Kim would be beside herself... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\nBack in her apartment, Annie had gotten out of bed and caught herself in the standing mirror across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that a lot had changed from just one week ago. First of all, it wasn't just her stomach taking the extra weight, but it had been spread over her entire form fairly evenly, with her ass getting quite a generous portion. <br>\r\nWhere her bangs had once framed a slender face, she was now sporting very full cheeks and a noticable double chin. <br>\r\nWhen she reached up to yawn, the top of her shirt came with it, exposing an inch of muffintop that had been previously hidden quite well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter inspecting herself from the side, rear and front, she wandered over to her drawer to pick out her outfit for the day. Whereas Annie used to consider all of the arguments for matching color, brand and style, her main focus had developed into finding something that would just fit. Luckily, an old t-shirt from Jeff Winger that used to fit her extremely loosely that she was just beginning to outgrow in the waist did the trick. <br>\r\nShe still couldn't decide on pajama bottoms or sweat pants, but this soon took a backseat to more pressing manners:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Annie Kims response be to a proposed 20 minute challenge? She knew that Vicki could easily outclass her in a 10 minute sessio, but if it were extended to 15 or 20 minutes, perhaps Vicki would slow down just enough to allow her to overtake her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the sweat pants out of the drawer, Annie hoisted them on with little effort and inspected the damage; her stomach was pressing up against the drawstring, it gave a low gurgle as she attempted to adjust it before giving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, onto Greendale!</span></div></div>",

So, all we have to do is talk to Annie about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk to me about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind Jeff, Annie had entered the Study Hall in sweatpants and a tight blue top, carrying her book bag in one hand and an empty Shirley's Sandwiches bag in the other. Annie's shirt was doing very little to hide her figure, already fighting a losing battle it could only barely cover her belly button. She passed Jeff as he tried to collect his thoughts as she sat down heavily beside Shirley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie. I uh... heh.\" Jeff started awkwardly. Britta tried to do some damage control. <br>\r\n\"Weee... just wanted to know how your club is doing... lately.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie could only glow with pride as she smirked, \"Well, you'll be pleased to know that the Gastrointestinal Giants set a new record last night; 19 and a half hot dogs in 20 minutes by one person - not even Annie Kim can compete with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great Annie really, so uhh... does that mean you're going to stop now?\" Britta offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?

Each club has to agree to a rotation to keep things fair, and I've got a secret weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandwiches?\" Shirely piped up hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>7:00 PM arrived quickly at Greendale that night, and while Annie had set up seats for at least 8 club members, she was shocked when not a single person had shown up. <br>\r\nMaybe Annie Kim had been bad-mouthing her, or worse still, maybe everyone knew how impulsive Annie could be, and chose to skip the club altogether.<br>\r\nStill, with or without any help, Annie knew she had gotten the upper hand - there was no way that Annie Kim could compete now, she would be forcing everything on the rest of the group. <br>\r\nIf Annie could get one person to join the club, just one, she knew she would be able to ride that to victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next half hour was spent measuring out ice cream, blending in milk and adding some chocolate powder for taste. The mixture was then added to several tall glasses that Annie placed next to each other - she jotted out the details in her notebook and prepared to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first milkshake was by far the easiest, Annie lapped up the thick mixture as she tipped the glass upward, her tongue darting out to catch the heavy dollops of ice cream left behind. In just a minute it had been completely emptied, the glass echoed as it hit the table and Annie sighed in relief. She tallied down the result under the 1:00 column and then began to work on the second milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way through the second milkshake, Annie could feel her stomach protesting as it gurgled and sloshed, she was getting pretty full - but she had to continue. She finished the milky mixture, savoring the taste as she wrote the results in the notebook as well. Annie stifled a burp as she reached for the third milkshake, much to the protests of her quite full stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the mid-way point of her third milkshake, Annie started to question her methods; she thought that the liquid nature of the milkshakes would reduce her chewing time that was being taken up with the hot dogs, but the liquid only seemed to fill her up faster and more completely. She gulped her way through the third milkshake as she found no further liquid to greet her. Annie placed the empty cup down and with a shaking hand marked her results down in the third column. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Annie reached for the fourth milkshake, a pain shot through her middle - she was now painfully full, and her drawstring was digging into her expanding belly.<br>\r\nShe took a second to adjust her pants, bringing the fabric down as she sighed in relief, letting her belly flow outward onto her lap unbridled.<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" Annie winced, \"Just a *urp* few more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth milkshake was finished in just over 3 minutes - while Annie had started off strong, she felt that she could no longer ignore the sharp pains that shot through her stomach and it was taking more time to convince herself to keep going. Even the thoughts of Annie Kim were hazy as Annie pushed herself on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick mixture traveled down her throat as she tried to chug the contents of the fourth milkshake, massaging her incredibly taut stomach between gulps, wincing and moaning with every swallow. When Annie had reached the end of the milkshake, she was practically gasping for air, clutching her stomach and she buckled forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to *hic* keep *hic* going...\" Annie groaned as she made another mark in her notebook under the fourth column. She was really reaching breaking point now, her stomach felt completely solid and even breathing in led to shallow breaths that sent pain ebbing through her entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth milkshake stood ahead, the final glass standing between Annie and victory. With unsteady hands, Annie reached for the drink and pulled it closer, breathing in the mixture of milk, ice cream and powdered chocolate was making her feel sick. Annie tried to take a deep breath to steady herself but that only made her wince in pain as she continued to hiccup. Annie cooed, massaging her stomach and preparing to tilt the mixture up off of the table and into her waiting lips. <br>\r\nThis was it... <br>\r\nAnnie brought the rim to her lips as she angled the glass upward. Gulp. Gulp. Gulp. Each swallow of heavy milkshake seemed to be causing her stomach to swell outwards an inch. Her eyes shut completely, Annie could only continue swallowing automatically, her nose getting its own taste of ice cream, milk and chocolate powder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a burst of pain jolted through her body, causing Annie to nearly drop the glass as she yelped in pain. In reflex she reached for her stomach and was shocked at just how full it was. She had never felt as full in her life as she did at this moment - Annie was completely, and undeniably stuffed. <br>\r\nBiting her bottom lip, Annie looked into the glass - there was just a quarter of mixture left, but it might as well have been a swimming pools worth as far as her stomach was concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh... oh... please... please just a *hic* little bit more...\" Annie whimpered. \"There's only *hic* only... three gulps left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she began to raise the glass to her lips. \"Only... *hic* three gulps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the mixture hit Annie's lips, she began to feel dizzy - her stomach was now audibly groaning, and churning below, attempting in vain to digest nearly 5 full glasses of heavy milkshake mix. Above, Annie was going against every instinct, forcing herself to finish it all. <br>\r\nAnnie was always an over-achiever, but she wasn't content with 100%, now her belly felt like it was at 110% capacity and Annie was straining to have it reach 120% at all costs. <br>\r\nShe gulped once. The heavy milkshake traveled down her throat and her belly went into an instant tantrum. She clutched it out of reflex, buckling over as she squinted through the burning tears in her eyes. \"Just two... just... oooh...two more\"<br>\r\nAnnie pushed on, bringing the glass to her lips as she angled it upward, taking in another mouthful of milkshake. She felt her stomach, rubbing it as she prepared to gulp, and was briefly shocked at how much her belly button seemed to push outward. Preparing for the worst, Annie took the next swallow of milkshake as it seemed to hit her stomach instantly. \"Oh WOW!\" Annie cried out, eyes wide open.\"This is... ohhh...this is too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled in agreement, sloshing its contents as Annie clenched her teeth together. \"Too much...\"<br>\r\nA beeping from across the table had suddenly caught Annie's attention - it was the timer she had set for 20 minutes; it was counting down the final 10 seconds. <br>\r\nAnnie turned back to the glass with newfound ill-placed determination and she looked down at the last bit of milkshake with equal parts fear and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie fastened her gaze, took a deep breath and brought the glass to her lips one final time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie had dropped the glass out of pain, but by some miracle it didn't shatter on the Study Room floor - not that she would have noticed. Annie cooed, taking in shallow breaths and trying to quell the massive pains that she felt in her overstuffed belly. <br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh... Ohmygosh that was...\" Annie breathed in wincing, burping aloud, \"that was... *urp* waaay too much...\"<br>\r\nFor the next hour, Annie sat at the Study Room table, her lips coated in milkshake mix, her pants pushed down by her beachball of a stomach and her panties completely soaked through the trial. <br>\r\nAnnie had overdone it, but she had done it, and that's all she cared about now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wheeled around to meet the gaze of her adversary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for setting up our sponsor for this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie Kim brandished her teeth like knives, she had some plan hiding behind a malicious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not a problem,\" Annie E. returned with the same false sentimentality, \"Sponsors are always looking out for talent at Greendale\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I agree,\" Annie Kim nodded, \"That's why I've been speaking to Greendale Creamery for their input, and they've offered up some feedback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... have?\" Annie was slightly taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie Kim began to smile even wider, \"Yes, just a modification of some of the ingredients, but don't worry - it's all covered by the Greendale Social Events budget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie Kim withdrew a note from within her bag and presented it to Annie Edison, which she took begrudgingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, the interests of the sponsor is something that we should definitely adhere to, unless, you disagree?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Err... no of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie Kim nearly sneered, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. I'm so glad we're on the same page.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Annie Kim spun away from the locker, heading down the bustling hallway with her plan already in motion - if she didn't have to keep up her sugar-coated facade, she would have laughed maniacally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her locker, Annie Edison unfolded the note and read the list of ingredients; there was only one change, and it made her eyes go wide as her stomach gurgled in a dull pain. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At 6:50 PM, Annie had arrived in Study Room F with a bag of ingredients in hand - she placed it on the table and began to withdraw each item. <br>\r\nOne tin of chocolate powder mix, one tub of vanilla ice cream... and then the final newly modified ingredient... one gallon of Greendale Creamery 'Heavy Whipping Cream'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the jug began to pour it into her milkshake mixer; it came out slowly and incredibly thick. Annie was already regretting what she would have to do tonight, but her principles had to be put first - she couldn't back out on Annie Kim now, she couldn't lose the sponsorship!<br>\r\nAnd so Annie continued to pour the Heavy Whipping Cream, following it up with a few spoonfuls of powdered chocolate mix and a few heavy spoonfuls of vanilla ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the milkshake mixer whirred to life, Annie tried to shirk off her feeling of dread, \"It's just cream, I mean... I've had cream before...\" What began as a self-assuredness soon fell as Annie noticed that the mechanized whisking had done very little to dilute the mix. <br>\r\nWithout any recourse, she turned off the milkshake maker, removed the mix from its cradle and began to pour it into 5 glasses she had prepared.<br>\r\nAfter pouring out the rich creamshake, she realized there was quite a bit left still in the mixer - Annie could only dread what that would mean for the measurements, or her own measurements for that matter. <br>\r\nCracking open the notepad she drew up a new table with her name on the top, separating it into 5 columns and then took a deep breath as she prepared to start on the first heavy milkshake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door to Study Room F opened, and Britta Perry entered, taking Annie by surprise.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Annie...\" Britta began in a slightly guilty tone, \"Um... Jeff thinks I'm well, stupid for coming down here, but... I couldn't just let you do this on your own... I... I'm sorry... for last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Annie piped, \"Umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Jeff was right, this feels stupid...\" Britta turned on her heel embarrassed as she prepared to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Annie squeaked, stopping Britta in her tracks, \"I'm glad you came back. Please. Stay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta turned to face Annie, both of them smiling at their newfound comradery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what are you working on, Goldie Hawn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta sat down at the table as Annie was pulled back to the issue at hand, her warm expression faltering as she turned serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, hot dogs are out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, good! I'm done with those for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And milkshakes...\" Annie continued, sliding the nearest one with her pencil towards Britta, \"are in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So exactly how many of these do we have to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday I finished off with 5, but since you're here... I could do 4 and you could do 2 for 6...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fair, but I'm not going to go over that okay? I just finished off working off those hot dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way Britta was right, she was entering slim territory once more, but it would be a lie to say that she was back to her original weight - her abs were still quite pouchy and the remnants of a muffin top still persisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\" Annie nodded, watching as Britta tipped up the glass to her lips, tasting the flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\" Britta peaked with glee, \"This is really good Annie - what's in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie found herself suddenly frozen, not unlike the time she had tried to imitate Blade over the phone to Britta. She couldn't tell her that she was downing a quart and a half of cream - she knew that would be enough to send Britta packing, and leave her to finish the rest all by herself. Luckily Britta hadn't seen Annie's 'deer-in the-headlights' stare, as she had brought the glass to her lips once more. Annie took this moment to collect herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...\" Annie mused, \"You know - just a bit of vanilla ice cream and a really high quality chocolate powder mix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I taste that for sure, it's just so... sweet too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm really glad you like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta hadn't responded to Annie, now lost in downing the rest of the milkshake. Annie breathed a sigh of relief at the potential bullet she had just dodged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just under 45 seconds, Britta had managed to drain the glass completely, licking her lips to catch any remnant of the creamy drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was better than I thought it would be,\" Britta mused. \"Alright, your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie looked towards her own milkshake, thanks to Britta there were only 5 left but the premise of drinking at least three of them still seemed daunting. After marking the results on the page under a new column marked 'Britta', Annie grabbed the milkshake and tipped the creamy mixture past her lips. <br>\r\nBritta wasn't kidding, the rich texture of the cream was only made sweeter by the inclusion of the ice cream - the chocolate power only served to bring the entire package together into something like a mudslide. <br>\r\nWithin seconds, Annie had managed to drink nearly a quarter of the creamshake, gulping fervently to savor it. <br>\r\nShe tried not to think of how much damage she was doing, drinking what amounted to thick liquid ice cream - but if Britta was willing to help her, that's all she needed to keep drinking. <br>\r\nAs her timer hit 30 seconds, Annie had already managed to down more than half, willing herself on to keep going and match Britta's time of 43 seconds. Annie's could feel the effects of the rich cream already settling in her stomach, pushing it outwards as she took the next few gulps. Tilting the glass back, Annie managed to drain all of the remaining liquid in 44 seconds, stifling a burp as she set it down - as she turned her attention back to Britta however, she noticed that the blonde had already began to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie watched as Britta tilted the glass upwards, gulping down the thick creamshake in steady swallows. In just 40 seconds, Britta had managed to drink more than half of the milkshake which sent Annie reeling with unexpected awe. While Britta kept chugging, she started to fumble at her jeans with her spare hand. Failing to find what she was looking for, she stood up still drinking and managed to unbutton her jeans expertly. The resulting freedom sent her belly pushing outwards, practically inflating as it was filled with cream - Annie could only watch in amazement as Britta continued to drink while massaging her stomach with her free hand, and in a matter of seconds, Britta had finished the entire drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwaaa*urp* ohhh...\" Britta moaned, still massaging her stomach, \"Ok Annie... it's up to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie nodded and grabbed her second glass - all she needed to do was finish two more after this and she would beat her record for the previous night!<br>\r\nShe began earnestly, bringing the glass to her lips which were once again greeted by the sticky sweet texture of the heavy whipping cream. Annie gulped the mix down as quickly as possible, still hoping to keep her momentum up for the next glasses. She was renewed with a vengeance, she could picture Annie Kim, unable to drink any of the milkshake, forcing it upon the rest of the club to pick up the slack. A sly smile escaped her lips as she continued to drink.<br>\r\nSetting down an empty glass, Annie massaged her full stomach as she reached for the third glass, it too started down easily enough, but after a few minutes it was clear that Annie was starting to hit her limit; the cream filled her up much more quickly than the milk, and her stomach was already starting to protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven unbuttoning her pants did little to alleviate the feeling of fullness, which felt like a huge rock in the pit of her stomach. Breathing heavily, Annie willed herself on, taking gulps with gusto as she drained her third glass of the night in just under 5 minutes. \"Urrg... Oh...*urp*\" Annie mumbled as she placed the empty glass down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just *hic* two more now...\" Annie winced as she reached for the fourth glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Annie!\" Britta called out, \"I'll do this one, then you'll only have that one to do - you have to take breaks between them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... *urp* Britta...\" Annie said weakly as she continued to massage her stomach - could she even finish that last glass? It seemed impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta began strong as well, but even she seemed to slow down as she reached the half way mark. Drawing the glass away from her lips, she took in a few short painful breaths as her eyes met Annie's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have... oooh... never been this full in my life...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a matter of minutes the deed had been done, and Britta lolled back in her chair, fervently massaging her stomach and taking short, shallow breaths. With a weak arm, Britta lifted her pointer finger towards Annie, who seem transfixed. \"G-go... last one right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie nodded and turned to the final milkshake. If she could drink it all in less than 3 minutes they would have made a new record.<br>\r\nDetermined, Annie took as deep a breath as her stomach would allow and began to chug the milkshake. Gulp, gulp, gulp. <br>\r\nAnnie could feel her stomach slowly swelling, surging forward past her jeans, laden with heavy whipping cream. <br>\r\nIn just over two minutes, she had managed to finish more than half, but immediately hit a wall as her stomach gurgled loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh... I don't think I can *urp* drink anymore...\" Annie whined as Britta sat up in her chair, still massaging her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I'll finish...ooohh... I'll finish it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie passed the glass over as the bloated blonde began to chug heavily, she squirmed as the liquid poured down her throat and into her very overstuffed belly. <br>\r\nBritta managed to finish the mixture just as Annie's stopwatch began to beep. \"YES! *urp* Oh man...\" Britta's brief moment of victory was soon overtaken by nausea as she clutched her stomach with both hands. <br>\r\nWith their glasses completely emptied, both Annie and Britta congratulated each other through shallow breaths, overcoming the extremely heavy feeling in their stomachs together.</span></div></div>",

Taking in her less defined features, round cheeks and prominent double chin, it was clear that Annie had officially surpassed the freshman fifteen and was becoming a softer sophomore. <br>\r\nCarrying on, Annie deposited the rest of her books and made a mental note to pick up a few binders for next week. From behind, Annie was unaware of the students staring at her filled out features, mainly her plush rear end which seemed to stick out as she bent it for further supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the crowd was deterred as Britta made her way through towards Annie's locker with triumphant strides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time since Britta Perry had rejoined the Gastrointestinal Giants, she had managed to gain back all of the weight she managed to lose - thanks to the heavy cream milkshakes, Britta was actively gaining more and more weight every night, quickly outgrowing most of her wardrobe. <br>\r\nHer midsection was taking it especially hard, with most of her old clothes figure-hugging tight pieces, Britta had no choice but to try and bring a conventional outfit together with a top that didn't quite cover up her abdomen, and sweatpants that were being strained by the drawstring. In short, most of the time Britta was walking around with at least three inches of her rounded stomach exposed - like Annie, she too was starting to develop a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie! Annie, guess what?\" the blonde could barely contain her excitement as she approached. \"Fat Neil has left Annie Kim's club!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie beamed, her round cheeks dimpling. \"That's great! Now we've finally leveled the playing field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget - she's still got Vicky though,\" Britta warned, \"We'll have to go at this thing twice as hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie thought for a moment before a sly grin began to invade, \"Would you protest much if we pushed back our meeting time tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... not really.\" Britta rested a hand on her stomach, \"To be honest I'm still pretty full from yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should see what we're really up against,\" Annie returned with a look of deviousness, \"If we start at 9 PM, we can do a bit of reconnaissance duty at the other study hall before then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, spy on Annie Kim?\"  Britta asked, intrigued at the prospect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the plan, Vince McMahon...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Britta followed and they soon found themselves outside of the window to the Study Room - luckily the shades hadn't been drawn, and they were free to peer in and watch the latest developments.<br>\r\nAnd there was certainly a lot of developments....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom one side of the table, Annie Kim held onto a clipboard, marking results quickly as her icy glare stared across the room towards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky. The only club member left of Annie Kim's group, surrounded by empty glasses of creamshake as she continued to chug the latest one down. <br>\r\nAs she angled the glass upward, the final heavy drops of cream slid down towards Vicky's waiting lips, and within a few seconds, the brunette had brought the drink down completely drained.<br>\r\nIt was here that Annie could see the transformation in Vicky's appearance from just a few weeks ago - her face, while always round to an extent, was now extremely full, framed with three distinct chins, her chubby cheeks made even larger from the constant supply of creamshake. <br>\r\nIf Britta had to guess, she would estimate that Vicky had put on nearly 50 pounds in the last two weeks alone; her clothes looked to be outgrown as they tried in vain to cover her expanding body - her legs and arms were extremely thick, looking more like tree trunks - the biggest development though, was her belly. <br>\r\nIt seemed like most of the weight had hit hard there - while it had been quite round in the times that Annie and Britta had seen Vicky before, now it was flat-out spherical, filled to the point of bursting every night with milkshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vicky tried her best to catch her breath from her latest drink, Annie Kim scribbled a number down and broke the silence, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, go go! We need to beat 10 remember? You have to be quicker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReacting, Vicky grabbed the next drink and began drinking it quickly, Annie Kim only looked on at her stopwatch with increasing intensity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the window, Annie Edison looked in awe before turning back to Britta and whispering harshly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEN?! She's making Vicky drink TEN of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta nodded as she took in the scene, \"There's no way she can do that - she'll explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, Vicky had managed to drink nearly half of the shake before she took it away from her lips with a pained expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... Ohh... I think I need... a break\" Vicky wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have time! You have to keep drinking Vicky, otherwise the data will be unbalanced next meeting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky slid the glass across the table with two chubby fingers, \"Please... help me *hic* finish it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie Kim slid the glass back towards Vicky with her pencil twice as hard, \"I told you, I can't - I'm lactose intolerant. You have to do this, for both of us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her stomach, Vicky seemed to see no way out, and brought the glass to her lips and began gulping down the mixture reluctantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Annie, this is wrong.\" Britta hissed, \"We need to put a stop to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie fought an internal battle, focusing on Vicky continuing to chug before turning back to Britta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... fine. I'll meet with the Dean tomorrow and tell him to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come ON! I haven't lost to that Edison <i>BITCH</i> and I'm not going to start now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A new flare had sparked in Annie's eyes as she looked in to Annie Kim with vitriol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, let's see how this works out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Vicky was hitting her limit as she gulped down the final drops of heavy cream from her glass, pulling it away from her lips wearily, and setting it down on the table with an empty echo. As Annie Kim scribbled onto the clipboard, Vicky leaned back in her chair, desperately searching for something around her midsection. The next second she found it, and in one heavy motion, Vicky pulled down the zipper to her pants, allowing her extremely full stomach to surge outwards into her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh... *urp* Annie, I'm so full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irony wasn't lost on the leather-clad duo peering in from outside the window, all at once Annie Edison felt rather guilty for watching the session with Britta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just two more to go Vicky, I know you can do it\" Annie Kim piped up encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that the dawning realization struck Annie, \"She's had eight milkshakes alone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the women looked back into the window in horror as Vicky reached for her ninth glass of creamshake, reluctantly bringing the mixture to her lips as she massaged her painfully stuffed stomach once again. In a matter of minutes, she had managed to drain the entire glass and set it down onto the table wincing in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OoOoOohh... That's it! Ohh *urp*... That's it...\" Vicky sputtered as she clutched her stomach, \"I can't drink anymore Annie, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her pencil, Annie Kim pushed the final glass towards Vicky which seemed to make the bloated brunette queasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't... Annie... Ohh... please. Let's just have... 9 tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we only put down nine we'll be tied with Annie and Britta.\" Annie Kim affirmed as she shoved the glass even closer towards Vicky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do that then... ohhh...*hic* let's tie with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to tie with Annie Edison,\" Annie Kim flared, \"I want to BURY her! Now... DRINK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky brought the creamshake to her lips and began to drink it down in heavy gulps, from below her stomach was gurgling and sloshing violently. As Vicky began to angle the glass downward, Annie Kim shot forward with her pencil and kept the glass tilted high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, just power through it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to stream from Vicky's eyes as Annie and Britta watched on in shared sympathy, the brunette was pushing herself way too far past her limits. <br>\r\nAnnie Kim stood up, walking over to Vicky's side of the table with her clipboard in hand. <br>\r\n\"Come on Vicky... a little more...\"<br>\r\nShe placed a hand on Vicky's exposed stomach, it was as tight as a drum.<br>\r\n\"You've still got room, come on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky kept gulping down the creamshake, her stomach audibly protesting as Annie Kim rubbed her stomach - in a matter of minutes the deed was done; the tall glass was empty and Vicky was squirming in her chair clutching onto her beach ball of a belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good...\" Annie Kim cooed, \"See, that wasn't so hard was it Vicky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky couldn't even respond, she was reduced to only focusing on quelling the massive stomach ache in front of her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way that Annie and Britta will be able to beat us now - you did well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the window, Annie and Britta turned to each other, neither of them finding any words to say.  </span></div></div>",

Plus, her maternity clothes were fine for now, she could just wear them until she bought a new wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she wasn't worried about her weight she allowed herself some oreos, something she vowed she wouldn't eat again after her pregnancy until she'd lost the baby weight. With Cecelia napping, Pam knew she'd have at least an hour to relax. Taking the nearly full oreo bag with her, she sat down to watch T.V. Flipping through the channels, she found that there was a marathon of her favorite show on. Turning to that channel, she laid down the remote and absentmindedly reached for an oreo. Then another and another. After the end of the fourth half-hour episode, Pam heard heard Cecilia (from now on \"CC\") wake up. Without looking to see how many she'd eaten, Pam put the oreos back in the pantry to go change CC's diaper. If she had looked to see how much she had eaten, she would have been shcoked to find 3/4 of the almost new bag gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she changed CC's diaper, Pam heard her cell vibrate, signalling a text. After washing her hands, she checked her phone; the message was from Jim. It said \"Don't wait up for me, Micheal is keeping us all late because he lost his pen (long story). Go ahead and order out. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> u, from Jim.\" Thinking a night out alone could be nice, she called a sitter for CC and left. Recently, she'd been hearing a lot about a new Italian place downtown called \"Ragazza Grassa\". Not speaking Italian, Pam didn't know that meant \"Fat Girl\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got inside, Pam immediatley decided that she liked it here. She was shown to her table by a somewhat chubby hostess, then almost immediately waited on by a slightly more overweight waitress. Not wanting to miss out on what looked like so many delicious foods, she decided on the \"Five courses for Five dollars each\" deal, which took up to 50% off each item and consisted of bread, an appetizer, a releves, two entrees, dessert, and drinks for only $25! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bread came (enough for five, with more than enough butter for ten), the overweight waitress took Pam's order:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppetizer: Spinach Dip: 1099 calories, 94g fat, <br>\r\n(Don\u2019t be fooled by the fact that this dish has vegetables in it.  Most dips are made with regular mayonnaise and/or sour cream, which contain ample amounts of calories and fat)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppetizer: spaghetti and meatballs with two sauces: meat, and creamy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st entree: lasagna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2nd entree: feduccini alfredo with creamy sauce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDessert: zeppoli (920 cal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrink: long island iced tea (3 of them,  750 calories each)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't intend to finish each dish, but it was just sooooo good she couldn't not finish any of them!

She was essentially alone all the time, which left her with the task of filling up her days. While she would clean, she also started learning to cook more for herself. Of course, when this didn't work out, she'd just go grab take out instead. Take out and shopping were the only reasons Pam really left he house, other than maybe going for a walk but it was often too cold still. Pam lived a rather sedentary lifestyle at home while Jim was at the the office. Currently, Pam is sitting on the couch, she just finished some stir fry that they'll have for supper. She's snacking on some chips, a bit of her belly exposed from under her tshirt as she sat there. \"Ugh I won't lie, I'm feeling a little peckish. I could just eat something here... hmm what do we have..\" As Pam started to rise out of her spot, an ad came on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry!? Come on down to Burger Valley, home of the largest burger menu in the world!\" Pam froze, her belly grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no, I really shouldn't, at this rate I'm gonna be huge in no time... I should just stay home, and eat something here, yeah, I've got this</i>,Pam thought, trying to stay confident, as she shouted to nobody but herself \"I can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have unlimited drinks and nachos!\" The TV added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam put on her coat, grabbed CC and began to drive to towards Burger Valley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit I tried... maybe next time.\" Pam said to herself, realizing she has lost her will power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, she was greeted by a young teenager, \"Hello, welcome to Burger Valley! Follow me to your seat!\" The boy led as Pam began to take in the smells. <i>Oh my god.. this place smells insane, wow I can't wait to eat...</i>Pam thought to herself, rubbing her belly absentmindedly. As Pam took her seat, she began browsing through the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peanut butter burger... Onion rings tower burger....oh wow, a mac and cheese supreme burger!? Okay wow this place can't be good for me, but oh wow does it just smell amazing...\" Pam said, looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi my name is Emily, I'm your server, what can I get you?\" Pam looked up at the girl. She was in her 20s, black hair, pale face, edgy and cute. <i>Oh my gosh, her shirt is tight, wow she looks like she's been enjoying the menu...</i> Pam thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Emily, what would you recommend?\" Pam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, well let's see, I literally just ate the Makin' Bacon Burger on lunch, it's amazing. But I also love the Ranch Burger, but get extra cheese and onion rings! Sometimes I even do two cause of how good they are haha...\" Emily quieted down, realizing how much of a pig she sounded like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan I get the Makin' Bacon Burger, and can I get unlimited fries and a beer please?\" Pam said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want cheese on the fries? I recommend!\" Emily said, almost looking for them herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah sure, uh why not, what the heck haha.\" Pam said, excited for her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it arrived Pam was blown away at the size. She dove in face first, <i>OH MY GOD. HOW IS THIS REAL?</i> Pam thought, chewing the delectable burger. <i>That was amazing, another bite!</i> Pam gorged on the burger, eating it in 10 minutes. Pam sat back, rubbed her belly, and belched. \"*Brrrahhpp!*... Oh wow, that was unreal... no wonder the server is putting on *hic* weight, god if I worked here, I'd be *hic* immobile in a month, hehehehe. I should eat some *hic* fries, see what they're like.\" Pam grabbed some cheesy fries and took a bite. \"Holy smokes, this place is just amazing at everything... these are so goooood!\" Pam ate faster and faster, until her belly was stuffed tight and full. \"I'm such a pig... ugh... I can't believe I ate that much.\" Pam paid and went left the restaurant, seeing Emily sneak a burger in the back. <i>Oh boy she's going to get huge if she's not careful...</i> Pam thought to herself, <i>hmmm, maybe I should pick um something for dessert....</i> Pam continued thinking, as she walked out the front door of Burger Valley. </span></div></div>",

Pam has also come to seriously enjoy the restaurant chain \"Burger Valley\", and tried to go there only once a week to keep her figure down, however, she had been going more than once a week. Almost 3 times a week you could spot Pam Beesly chowing down on a massive burger and unlimited fries, normally drinking a couple beers or some wine with her lunch. Much worse, she only ate there for lunch so she could hide it from Jim, but Jim was gone this week, leaving Pam totally alone for days at a time, allowing Pam to indulge more often than usual. When she needed time to unwind, she would give CC to her Mom to watch allowing Pam to do whatever she pleased. Right now was one of those times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Pam was on her way to \"Burger Valley\" for her third time since Jim had left, and that was only two days ago. Pam was currently going for lunch, she had just finished running errands on this side of town and decided she'd celebrate with a hearty lunch. As Pam got out of her car, she finished the last gulp from her large mocha latte (something else she'd been indulging in lately) and began walking towards the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm...</i> Pam thought, <i>I swear my butt is jiggling more than usual...</i> She knew her weight was climbing, but liked to ignore it until she really needed a wardrobe change, thinking that was the sign that it was officially time for action and start going to the gym, and getting back in shape. Until then though, she was gonna enjoy her time off with some great food. As Pam opened the door she began to smell the delicious patties grilling, and the bottomless fries awaiting her gut. As Pam got further inside, she got up to the hostess stand and waited to be seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Pam! Good to see you again!\" The hostess, Mallory, said while grabbing the menu. \"Follow me to your table!\" Mallory said happily, leading Pam towards a nice spot in the restaurant. Pam was embarrassed for becoming a regular so quickly at this place, only imagining what people probably said about her behind her back. <i>God they probably think I'm such a fatass.</i> Pam thought to herself while following Mallory, examining her changing and growing body. Mallory had long black hair, gorgeous blue eyes, and olive skin that made Pam jealous looking at her. However, Mallory also had some new curves happening on her frame, showing some fat on her hips, giving her some cute love handles that complimented her new chubbier belly, jiggling slightly as she walked. She also had rolls of fat forming on her back that were visible through her tight black shirt, showing she was soon due for an upgrade on her uniform. All of these aside, the true marvel was her expanding ass and thighs, which jiggled with every step she made. <i>Looks like I'm not the only one enjoying myself at least</i>, Pam thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go! Someone will be with you soon, want me to grab you a beer?\" Mallory asked as Pam shuffled her frame into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that'd be great, thanks!\" Pam replied, beginning to take off her coat and put it on her chair. Pam's frame had definitely been expanding with her new habits. Her belly folded more onto her lap than it did before, her breasts heavy like when she was pregnant, making her blouse feel more and more tight every day. Her ass had been growing, something she did notice with her old pair of sweatpants from last week, but they were her smallest ones anyways. As Pam began to feel adjusted in her chair, Mallory came back and gave Pam the beer she had ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go! Hope ya like it!\" Mallory said cheerfully, before remembering to tell Pam something. \"I forgot to tell you, but we have a promo right now that you can get $100 credit here if you refer them here for their first times! In case you know anyone, it's a great deal! And multiple people adds up in-store-credit, so if you can think of anyone bring them!\" Mallory said, making Pam shocked she could get free food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay wow, maybe I'll take my mom here for dinner,\" Pam said out loud, before realizing she sounded like a true pig in front of Mallory, \"Uh I.. I uh mean another night.. pfft... obviously not tonight hahaha....\" Pam said, looking nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I used to be a gym rat before I worked here, but it's damn good, I eat here a couple times a day... it's delicious, impossible to resist, but... it's got it's consequences...\" Mallory said, giggling as she patted her belly fat. \"Anyhoo, I'm gonna grab myself a bite to eat while it's still slow!\" Mallory turned around, walking towards the kitchen, showing her jiggly butt for Pam to watch. Pam began to look through her phone, looking for her mom. Free dinner tonight would be so great... Pam thought to herself, sending plans for dinner. Pam then looked at the menu, finding the \"Onion smoked triple mega burger, with extra sauce!\". <i>Mmm hell yes, that looks so good</i>, Pam thought, salivating from her anticipation. Just then she spotted her waitress coming towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Isn't that the one from a couple weeks ago...?</i> Pam questioned, trying to think back. As the waitress got closer, Pam confirmed it was indeed Emily, the waitress from her first experience in \"Burger Valley\", but she looked a little different from last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was looking a considerable amount fatter than last time they'd interacted, but she could argue the same for Pam. Both girls had put on weight, but Emily definitely put on more, looking like she had been eating Burgers nonstop. Emily had a small belly bouncing with every step, riding up slightly and exposing her bare pale flesh. Emily was still in her old sized clothes, showing off all of her curves. She looked extremely bloated, probably from the grilled cheese burger she just inhaled. Emily snuck food like crazy, and clearly paying the price for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, ...*hic*..*urr*...\" Emily started, clearly trying to hold back burps. \"What... *hic*... what can I get... for you *hic*.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna grab a Onion smoked triple mega burger, with extra sauce, but also can I double the cheese and grab extra bacon? And also, I'd love the fries of course, and I'll take another beer in a bit, thanks!\" Pam said, trying to make the waitress's life easier. Emily just smiled and turned around, burping as she walked away. <i>All the staff here get fat, I really should stay away from here once Jim is back, but what's the harm in a week long pig out? I carried a freaking baby inside me for nine months, I deserve it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much longer, Pams massive meal was brought to her, which she devoured in a mere 10 minutes. As she sat back, she cradled her pot belly, enjoying the feeling of the burger, fries and beer sitting in her gut and feeling ready for a nap. Pam got up and paid quickly so she could return home and sleep this off before she returned for dinner with her mom. </span></div></div>",

She barely took clothes off for the nap, and her hair and makeup were smudged. \"Time for a shower!\" Pam said, walking to the bathroom. After a quick shower, she was changed and ready for her supper with CC and her mother. Pam drove herself to the restaurant, meeting them there just on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom! Thanks so much for watching CC, it really helped with my chaotic afternoon.\" Pam lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no issue at all sweetie, I love CC!\" Helene responded. Helene was a very gorgeous woman, especially for her age. Helene had her blonde hair done up nicely, with her jacket open and showing off her light top which gave a nice view of her breasts. Helene was in great shape, and enjoyed to flaunt it whenever she could. \"I'm hungry, though I've don't usually eat burgers, I'll probably just grab a salad or something.\" Helene said as they walked in the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there! welcome to burger palace, let me grab you a table!\" The host said, as he led them to their tables. <i>Happy it wasn't still Mallory, god if my mom founds out how much I come here...</i> Pam thought to herself nervously, worried of being confronted on her weight. As they made it to the table, Pam mentioned the deal Mallory told her about earlier, and that her Mom had never been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case I'll get you a tab Pam! We hope you enjoy, folks.\" The host said, walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is free?\" Helene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, totally free. You get $100 credit for everyone you bring.\" Pam replied, seeing her mom open up about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well if I like something on the menu maybe I'll try something new, since it's free.\" Helene said, looking at the burgers. \"Holy hell, look at all this food. This can't be good for us, this one has a melted chocolate bar on it? How good could that really be?\" Helene said in disgust, shocked at the unhealthy menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom you should have the \"Cheesy melt Burger\", with cheese fries. I, uh, I had that the last time I was here.\" Pam stuttered, trying to downplay her attendance of the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good I suppose, though that's a lot of fo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's free mom, this is when you try stuff!\" Pam insisted, making Helene lean into ordering the burger. \"I'm so happy we're doing this!\" Pam said to her mom, clinking their glasses together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much longer until they had their food at the table, ready to eat. Pam watched her mom as she carefully took a bite into the large burger. She leaned back and began to taste the delicious meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh myy goodness, this is so good, wow...\" Helene said, taking a second and a third bite from her food. Pam began to eat, trying to not make a pig out of herself, and only eating a \"double everything burger\", which was quite an impressive meal. Both women began eating their meals, only moaning for communication. Soon, they were both empty handed but filled to the brim inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness Pam, that was.... *buurrrp*... oh wow excuse me, ugghhh... that was just so good, thank you for bringing me here.\" Helene said, grabbing her full and small belly, but holding back belches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mom... BUuuurppp!...it is no issue, I'm happy you enjoyed it, maybe we can come back again?\" Pam asked her mother, curious to her response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah for sure! *Uuuurrrrrrrp!* ugh.. excuuuse me wow... we can't come too often though, this place will make us fat if we do hahaha.\" Helene laughed, making Pam aware of much weight this place was putting on her. The women got up, said their goodbyes, and went to their own homes. Pam had CC for the night, and put her to bed not long after she got home. Pam finished the night off with a pint of ice cream, passing out naked in her bed with the ice cream leaning on her taught and bloated belly. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of Pams mat leave went by slowly, feeling excited to return to work, especially because Pam would finally stop gaining so much weight, maybe she'll feel motivated to go to the gym, who knows? Pam was excited for the change back into the field, knowing that Helene would take great care of CC while Jim and Pam worked, allowing Pam to feel worry free for the next little while. In the weeks leading up to her returning Pam was forced to face reality and buy new clothes. Pam now weighed 180 pounds, and the number still didn't seem like it was about to stop on it's own. Pam had learned to enjoy gluttony more during her break, learning that food could taste better than she ever imagined. Pam had a belly pooch that poked out, and her boobs still continued to grow, stretching her shirts more and more. Pams face looked fatter than ever, and her ass was quite large. Pam had really let herself go in recent months, and was nervous of her coworkers reactions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the morning of her first day began, Pam began to stress eat about what people would think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim, people are going to make it weird... oh god I don't know if I can do it..\" Pam said to Jim, pacing around the kitchen as he gets the rest of their things together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pam, just trust me, ok? It will not be a big deal, I've got you back.\" Jim said, reassuring her. \"And remember, there's a cafeteria now, so you don't have to pack a lunch anymore.\" While Pam was gone, a business called \"Future Foods\" moved in, using the warehouse and office spaces, as well as bringing a cafeteria for all building tenants to use that sells \"Future Foods\" products. Since then, some things had changed around the office. Jim told Pam that Stanley had left the office due to his wife forcing him to retire, and that Sabre now owned their company, creating new issues between coworkers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jim and Pam began to pull up the Office, Pam began to get nervous again, but Jim held her hand the whole way until they were exiting the elevator to Dunder Mifflins offices. Erin was working the desk, and was the first one to see Pam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness! Pam! It's you! It's you! Guys look it's Pam!!\" Erin yelled, jumping up and down and running around the counter to give her a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha heeey guys how's everyone been doing?\" Pam said, beginning to look around at her coworkers, some looking different than before. Almost everyone looked... fatter? Pam was shocked, worried about her weight when it seems like it wasn't just her. Erin looked heavier, wider, with a bit bigger breasts and tummy that pops out a little and jiggles, Pam could see her garbage filled with wrappers and her desk still has sweets waiting to be eaten. Then there was Angela, who admittedly looked like she'd gained the least. Her clothes looked tighter, and her face looked softer, but other than that she was the same old Angela. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you enjoyed yourself during Mat leave.\" Angela said, laughing, causing her chubby face to jiggle a tiny bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was enjoyable.\" Pam said back, shutting her down quickly. As Angela scoffed and walked off, Pam then caught a glimpse of Meredith, who was walking from the bathroom. While Angela and Erin were on the smaller side of gains, Meredith was not. Meredith looked quite fat, currently stuffing a muffin into her mouth. On Merediths desk were two bags with \"Burger Valley\" labeled on them. Her floor was littered with garbage and wrappers of food, and Pam couldn't tell if they'd been from a while ago or just today. Meredith had a bulging belly, that was popping out of her clothes and jiggling while she stepped. Her face was fatter, almost complete with a full double chin, but still softer than before. Her tits bobbed with every step, clearly growing as she gained weight. Meredith looked completely gluttonous and different, and Pam was mostly relieved she didn't gain that much, even when pregnant. Kelly was in the back somewhere, leaving only Phyllis left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever being \"thin\" in the first place, Phyllis really had to eat to show any real weight gain, and eat she did. Phyllis too had gone off the deep end with her eating, loving the new cafeteria and all it's goodies. Her desk showed she ate a lot of burgers, pizza, fried chicken, and sweet. Phyllis looked bloated and stuffed, sitting there talking to Pam. Her shirt was tight, looking like the buttons were threatening to blow at any minute. She looked so stuffed it hurt to move, and she still reached for more to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam was blown away by the changes seeing she wasn't alone in discovering indulgences, but she was a little worried that meant losing the weight was gonna be harder than she first thought...</span></div></div>",

Pam began to open her computer while catching up wit her co-workers on all the latest drama. Many acknowledged their weight gains from the new food, and not only the women. Some of the men had put on a couple pounds, trying their best to shed them off. However the gains in the office were heavily female, seeing how some had become extreme. Phyllis explained to Pam that Stanley had to retire because of how much weight the cafeteria was causing him to gain, resulting in his wife, Teri, making him finish work from home for the remaining years, which he wasn't fond of. The company has also created a team to go and develop new sales techniques, bringing Michael, Dwight, Gabe and Toby for a couple weeks on meetings in New York. The office is now owned by Sabre, and on Occasion Jo' shows up and checks in, something Pam was nervous about still. Into her first hour, Pam was back on track, feeling the joy in keeping busy return to her fingers as she typed, enjoying the buzz of her coffee and the taste of her fruit snacks as she worked for the next hour or so, until she was rudely interrupted by her belly grumbling, asking her for food. Pam stopped working and looked down at her pooch, grabbing it a little, feeling the reminder of her snacking habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't eat, if I wanna lose this weight, I gotta hold off, that's the only way. </i> Pam remained strong for a little while longer, trying to ignore her hungry tummy. Pams rear was filling up the chair much more than she remembered, and it's squishiness was a new feeling in a desk chair. Pam kept watching the clock, slowly waiting for lunch break so she could finally eat. <i>I really gotta go get something to eat soon... god I'd love a Burger Valley loaded burger, with the gooey cheese and onion rings, and ugh the bacon... so go- oh no, what am I doing... I need to get up and pee, or just go for a walk, clear my head!</i> Pam thought getting her chubby frame out of her chair, Erin seeing her coworkers fuller body move towards the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pam entered the break room towards the bathrooms, she realized something felt different. Something was... quieter. <i>Oh right! What about Kelly? Is she even here? Wonder what she got up to, maybe I should go check. </i>Pam thought, looking forward to a little talking break with her old friend. As Pam entered the Annex, she began to smell something... something pretty good. Pam also noticed food wrappers tossed about in the back, more and more piled up leading towards Kellys' cubicle. It was now, that as Pam approached she realized why Kelly hasn't been talking. It's because she's too busy using her mouth for something more important. Eating. Pam looked in at the whole cubicle, spotting her friend, who looked much... much different...</span></div></div>",

Even Meredith hadn't gained this much weight since Pam had left. Kelly was currently sitting in her desk chair, putting back a triple meat lovers pizza with stuffed crust, the box was currently halfway empty, and judging by the pace Kelly was eating, Pam assumed it wouldn't be long until she was done the whole thing. Kellys office was an absolute mess, with garbage everywhere, crumbs all over, and even some articles of clothing which looked to have ripped off of her while she was at the office at some point and has yet to clean them up. Kellys clothing was incredibly tight, leaving little to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 300 pounds, Kelly had seriously changed. Pam could barely recognize her, seeing how her face was now swollen and she had a strong double chin occurring, and she was almost 3 times the size she was before Pam left. <i>What the hell happened?</i> Pam thought to herself, shocked to see her friend so large. As Pam continued to evaluate her friends figure, Kelly still hadn't noticed Pam standing behind her and was still working on that pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of anybody, Kelly was definitely the largest in the office, not by much though (Kelly only just passed Phyllis and Kevin). Kelly held most of the weight in her lower half, causing her ass to practically explode out of her office chair. It was absolutely humongous, spilling through the sides of the chair as her waist pushed her weight through the rest of the gaps between the arm rests. Her belly and ass were quite the sight, with her shirt riding up exposing all sides of her gut and love handles, looking like she had to really work hard trying to squeeze herself into her pants in the morning. Kellys belly draped over her crotch and formed some hearty rolls which were pulling apart her blouse. Kellys breasts were not too much bigger, showing how much bottom heavier she was than so many others in the office. As Kelly shoved the last slice of pizza into her mouth, eating it in one bite, Kelly leaned back in her chair, rubbed her belly and let out a large belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BRaaaahhhppp!!!* Oh myyyy gooodnesss.... wow, their pizza never fails, I'm, so gonna have to order another one in a bit.\" Kelly said out loud, still not aware of Pam.Pam decided now was the time to bring herself to Kellys attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Kelly, I just came back today, thought I'd say hi...\" Pam said with no confidence in voice. Kelly shifted her heavy bulk around in the chair, allowing Pam to see her from a new angle. Kelly was covered in various sauces and foods on her face and clothes, but she smiled when she realized it was Pam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pam! Oh my gosh it's- *BUUUURRPPP* oh myy.... It's so good to see you!\" Kelly said, shifting her weight as she moved towards Pam. \"How is CC? Tell me how Mat leave was!? Here, grab that chair *urp!* over there and have some doughnuts!\" Pam grabbed the chair and sat across from Kelly, watching Kellys arms jiggle as she reached for full box of doughnuts, still unsure of if she should ask about her new sudden love for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" Kelly said, handing the box towards Pam. Pam thanked her and opened the box, seeing 12 large dense doughnuts. <i>Okay you can have just one, then give her the back the rest. We can do this.</i> Pam grabbed a chocolate peanut butter cookie dough doughnut, closed the box and passed it to Kelly, who looked confused at Pam and then giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no that ones *urp* pardon me, that ones your box, this ones is mine!\" Kelly responded, pulling out a second box from somewhere on her desk. \"I insist! They're just from downstairs, you can always get me back hahah.\" Kelly pulled out a massive chocolate one and bite in with fury and inhaled it in a mere matter of moments. All Pam could do was watch in awe and wonder, watching anyone eat so fast was just incredible. <i>She has no limit, I've never seen anyone eat like this before... she just inhaled a pizza and looks unfazed by it. How much has she eaten today? How much more will she eat?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're great Pam, trust me.\" Kelly said in between doughnuts. Pam finally bit in, afraid just how great they are. Pams tastebuds exploded, <i>Holy crap</i>, Pam thought, <i>this is the best doughnut I've ever had... no wonder everyone is getting fat... </i> Pam began to inhale her snack and without thought opened the box for a second when she was done. Kelly had eaten her second already as well, and grabbed two more out that she was holding in her hands, before eating both, she asked Pam a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you happy to be back?\" Kelly asked, stuffing both doughnuts in quickly, alternating each hand. Pam smiled, finishing her second doughnut and thinking hard about a third. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, so happy. I was going stir crazy at home. Happy to be back, though, it seems like things are different, you know?\" Pam said, interested to what Kelly would say back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they definitely are for me. Look at me, after all, I've put on a couple of pounds.\" Kelly said, shaking her belly fat for emphasis. \"The thing is, I didn't intend on losing my super hot body, it's just, well it's Ryan.\" Kelly said as she stopped eating to update Pam \"Just after you went on leave, that new Cafeteria was announced, and it moved in quickly. Ryan said he didn't want work for Sabre so he left and joined a new business in a whole other state.\" Kelly said, taking a sip from her mega sized pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh Kelly I'm so sorry.\" Pam said, feeling sorry for her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's okay now. See, I was just so distraught by it, and I vented to anyone I could, until one day, Meredith takes me to the cafeteria and told me have a snack and let off some steam. So I did, and then I did again the next day for lunch, and then the next day for breakfast AND lunch, and it's really just been non stop for me, and I really just enjoy it so much.\" Kelly said, taking a bite out of more doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Kelly wow, I think you look so good, you really pull it off.\" Pam said, trying to encourage Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's okay, see, once I began putting on weight, everyone did. I get lunch with Meredith a lot now, we see eye to eye on a lot now. You should tag along today! Pretty much everyone goes now, it's fun!\" Kelly said, dropping a doughnut into her mouth and practically inhaling it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to snack on the doughnuts until both were holding empty boxes and their own full bellies. Pam couldn't believe herself, her pants were undone, her blouse was incredibly tight and she was only an hour away from lunch. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite this, as the next hour went by she accomplished a great deal of tasks around the office, feeling good about her hard work. Pam intermittently looked at her larger coworkers, still adjusting to their new weights. Over the course of the morning, Meredith had eaten a dozen doughnuts, 5 muffins and 5 danishes, looking absolutely stuffed. Her belly sitting proudly on her lap, her face smothered in chocolate. Erin and Phyllis snacked lighter, but they were still eating fatty foods all morning, and even Angela got caught sneaking chocolate every now and then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pam went to hand in her last sheet of paperwork before lunch, Kelly walked out from the Annex. Well, really she wasn't so much \"walking\" anymore, as she was really waddling. Kellys large frame jiggled with every step as she walked towards Pams desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pam! It's lunch!\" Kelly said, holding a half eaten slice of cake, which she bit into quickly before finishing her sentence. \"Mmm..mph... let's... grab lunch together! *munch munch* How about it? Braahpp!\" Kellys belly was poking out from under her shirt, and it jiggled as she belched and swayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm actually surprisingly hungry after all those doughnuts... where do you go for lunch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cafeteria!\" Meredith shouted, getting her clothes in order as she walked towards the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam joined Kelly and the other ladies to the cafeteria, noticing other people in the building were growing just as fast as the girls. <i>This place must be good... look at everyones waistlines...</i> Pam thought, excited for something tasty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the doors, Pam saw...</span></div></div>",

Pams chubby mouth opened wide as she began to look over the spread. One section was a breakfast place, open all day and packed full of breakfast sandwiches, sausages, pancakes, and bacon, all hot and ready to be eaten. Next to the breakfast stand was a burger bar, with huge amounts of toppings and patties all ready to be grabbed and eaten. Already as Pam was looking up the burger bar Meredith got right up to the counter and began loading up 3 different burgers, each one topped off with 2 patties, extra cheese and bacon with all the dressings. Pams mouth watered seeing the delicious burgers, just thinking about their juiciness and cheesiness, she just wanted one so badly... but just then, something new caught her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPams head turned as she witnessed Phyllis approach a different table, this one filled with trays full of different pastas. Pam watched as Phyllis loaded her own large plate high with piles of macaroni and cheese, thick raviolis, and a heaping pile of meat balls, one of which Phyllis popped into her fat lips as she finished loading her plate. Pams belly grumbled for some pasta now, making her unsure of what she should eat from the cafeteria. <i>Oh god</i>, Pam thought, trying to calm her belly down by holding her flab, witnessing her coworkers gluttony. Pam watched as Phyllis moved her heavy frame to the table where Meredith was already seated, finishing her first burger as she wiped juice off of her fatter boobs, also unzipping her pants for more room. <i>I can't believe they're so fat, how can they not see what's happening to their bodies? Aren't they even a little worried?</i> Pam thought, still shocked by her coworkers changes over her mat leave. As Pam was still frozen in the cafeteria, she quickly felt a poke in her back and turned around, noticing Kelly who had a fully loaded tray of food. She had mashed potatoes, 4 slices of cake, a full pizzas worth of slices stacked and 2 triple stacked burgers, smothered in cheese. Kellys frame jiggled even as she stood still, her boobs wobbling and her thighs jiggling back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pam, are you not gonna get anything to eat?!\" Kelly said, shocked at her coworkers empty hands. \"It's all so good, you can't go wrong! Here, hold my tray, let me pick you something out, OMG this will be so fun! Go take my tray down and grab yourself a drink!\" Before Pam could protest, Kelly was off wobbling her fat frame back around the tables looking for Pams lunch. As Pam went to the table, she put down the tray and went to the pop machine, where she got an extra large cola with vanilla. Pam walked back to the table, and as she began to sit she saw Kelly walking over with a massive tray of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh my goodness Kelly that's a lot... I don't kno-\" Pam started to say, but Kelly quickly interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you have to try it! We'll finish any you can't!\" Kelly said heaving her obese body onto a chair, Meredith and Phyllis nodding about eating leftovers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pam looked back over at her own tray, she still couldn't believe all the foods Kelly picked for her. Two double stacked burgers, with a side of onion rings and poutine loaded with bacon and cheese, a slice of cake and a slice of pie, as well as mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. <i>If I eat this I'm gonna burst out of my uniform, ugh this isn't going to help my waistline at all...</i> Pam thought to herself, holding her belly with one hand. <i>That being said though, this does smell pretty damn delicious... I don't have to eat all of it after all...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam picked up a burger first, feeling the grease drip down her hand and back onto her plate. It looked big and unhealthy, just the way Pam liked it. As Pam took her first bite into the burger, her eyes lit up from the flavourful bite, quickly getting a second and third bite from the burger. Pam moaned as she chewed, \"Mmmm... wow that was amazing, you guys were so right. This tastes amazing!\" Pam took another large bite from her burger, also taking sips from her drink. By now Meredith had finished eating her burgers, she had her gut open for the public to see as she rubbed it and burped. Phyllis was also almost done her plate, and had laid her own belly out onto her lap, allowing her to breath better. Pam would have been watching the obese women had she not of been so busy eating her food. In fact, had she been even looking beyond her own lunch tray she would have seen Angela sneak into the cafeteria while no one was looking to grab her own tray, a spread of burgers and pastries to help her sweet tooth. Quickly Pam finished her first burger, prompting her to grab the second one without hesitation. Kelly was almost halfway through her meal, hardly taking time to breathe, her fat arms moving quickly to keep up with her fast jaw. Her shirt was riding up her gut more and more as she ate with reckless abandon. Just as Pam thought lunch was coming to a close, Erin came by with two trays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi guys, got your food!\" Erin said, bubbly as ever with a smile. Meredith grabs one of the trays with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Erin, you rock!\" Meredith placed her tray down, and eagerly grabbed a chicken leg, moaning with each bite. Merediths tray had loads of desserts and junk food, like more burgers, cheese fries, cake and cookies. As Meredith gorged on round two, Phyllis took the second tray and thanked Erin as well, before inhaling half a chocolate cake in moments. Pam could only watch in awe as she saw the pure gluttony surrounding her, but before she thought too long and hard about it, she began to eat the onion rings and poutine, even as her belly felt more and more full. Erin began to walk back into the cafeteria, only to come back moments later with two more trays, this time there is one for Kelly, who had just finished the last slice of cake on her plate, emptying her first tray and releasing a massive burp. Kelly began to gorge on the pastries on her new tray, and also stuff the remaining burgers and fries on the tray. The second tray was filled with a a large assortment of pastries and sweets, from doughnuts to cake, to pies and chocolate bars. The tray was stacked full, and Erin was the first one to start eating from it, grabbing a large doughnut covered in sugary cereal and taking a large bite. As Erin ate her sweets she moaned and rubbed her stomach, eating the goodies quickly. Kelly burped loudly, halfway through another burger, she leaned back and rubbed her fat gut, before talking to Pam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh myy goooodd... this food is just *hic!* awesome! Don't you *braaahp!* think so?\" Kelly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is really great... I must admit it's going to be hard to resist it...\" Pam said eating her cake and rubbing her bloated gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pam awoke in her bed, wearing only a bra and her pyjama bottoms and looked at her clock. It read 10:00 am, causing Pam to briefly panic before she remembered it was Saturday, and Jim had obviously woken up to take care of CC, allowing Pam to lay back down and exhale her worries. Her head was sore, and her vision blurry. As she tried to remember what happened the night before, she realized her memory was foggy, <i>Hmmm think Pam think... well, I vaguely recalls some wine, there were a few beers, oh yeah and some shots... oh my goodness no wonder I can't remember any of it...</i> Pam began to remember more and more events, remembering she was at a girls night with her work friends at Burger Valley. <i>Oh my god... now I remember...</i> Pam thought in horror. She quickly rushed to find her purse, searching to find a receipt. As she searched around, she finally found it, causing Pams' Jaw to drop. Over the night, Pam ordered unlimited cheese fries and a \"Zesty Taco Burger\" to start, but as she kept on drinking she kept on eating, putting away a \"Grilled Mac, Bacon and Cheese Burger\" and a \"Hot Heat Burger\". Even after all of that, Pam then ordered a garlic bread and a pound of chicken wings. By the end of the night Pam had eaten and drank herself beyond memory, but even still this morning her belly appears bloated and is sticking out more and more every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past week had been intense on Pams figure. Her first Monday back resulted in such a massive feast with her new foodie coworkers showing her what she missed over maternity leave, she couldn't even buckle her belt on her way home. She even ordered a whole pizza for herself for dinner, her gluttony shocking Jim. Pam hoped Tuesday would be better, a little easier to resist the food and maybe even start to lose some of her new found weight. Unfortunately for her however, Tuesday was an even greater challenge. As Pam walked into the building she could smell their pastries and breakfast foods, and almost every time she would see at least one coworker chowing down and wave her in to join. They pulled her to the cafeteria for lunch and made sure to remind her to try something different than Monday. Erin would hand out treats almost every half hour since Micheal knew how much people enjoyed them, causing almost everyones waistlines even more expansion. Wednesday and Thursday followed the same trajectory, having Pam guilted into eating breakfast, hand fed sweets all day and stuffed like a turkey for a solid lunch, and the inevitable undone belt as she walked to her Car. Friday started out better because no one saw her as she walked by the cafeteria, allowing her to skip breakfast and lay off food until break. However, avoiding the first few offers from Erin was hard, and it only got harder and harder watching her coworkers stuff all her favourite treats into their bellies. But she lasted until first break, and figured she deserved a doughnut (or 3). She continued to snack until lunch, justifying it by thinking she was still doing a lot better than the rest of her week so far. Lunch on the other hand, was a failure. She ate more than she had at any other lunch, eating a tray loaded with some pizza, a couple double burgers, poutine, 2 bacon and egg sandwiches, 3 slices of cake, 2 doughnuts and 5 cookies. Pam was stuffed to the brim, but something about her appetite was so insatiable that it seemed impossible that she'd ever stop eating. Of course she did, but not without a massive burp and gas for the rest of her shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday was different though, because rather than her usual \"go home and eat dinner with Jim\", she was invited for a \"girls night\" with her coworkers. Pam figured she needed some fun time, especially since she was getting along with everyone better than before, and she wanted to keep that up. So, Pam went home and got cleaned up for her first night out since CC was born. She was excited, until she began to get dressed. All of her old pre-pregnancy clothes were definitely too small, that made her unhappy but she wasn't really surprised, but even her newest clothes were tight on her frame. One shirt pressed onto her belly, showing off her love handles and gut, while her breasts were getting much larger by the day, pressing on the top of her shirt and causing the bottom to lift up and expose some of her pale fleshy belly. Pams button up shirts were starting to stretch, but they showed less skin than her other ones, so she put on a pink button up shirt. Pams pants were all tight, but she managed to get one pair on after a few attempts, reminding herself to go easy on food or else she would burst out of her clothes. Pam heard a car honking out front of her house, which must have meant Kelly was there to pick her up. She quickly ran as to not keep Kelly waiting, after saying bye to Jim and CC first of course. The rest of the night felt like a blur, but she recalls pigging out and clearly drank way more than she should have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, on Saturday morning, Pam is forced to start her diet off right, with some healthy breakfast! She put on a T shirt over her bra and walked to the kitchen. She began to smell something great, <u>Ohhh myyy is that bacon? And eggs, and... pancakes?</u> Pam walked into the kitchen to find her husband cooking a very <b>large</b> breakfast. All over the table was an assortment of foods, such as waffles, pancakes, hash browns, eggs, sausages, bacon, and even an omelette! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, you seemed like you had a fun night, thought you might want some hangover breakfast.\" Jim said smiling, gesturing at the table. Pams jaw was dropped at the kind gesture from her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you shouldn't have, this is soo thoughtful Jim, thank you!\" Pam said, kissing her husbands cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and I got you these too.\" Jim pulled out a box of pastries and handed them to Pam, who's mouth started drooling at the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow you are just so great! You have been seeing how much weight I've gained right?\" Pam laughed, trying to get a reaction from her Husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pam you just had a baby, it's very normal. And besides, you're still gorgeous just the same, I love you no matter what! Now, go eat, while the food is till warm.\" Jim said, kissing his wife as she walked over to the table. She propped open the box and grabbed a chocolate covered doughnut, taking a quick bite and moaning before setting the box down and sitting at the table. Pam began to grab different items, a handful of bacon here, and few sausages there. She finished the hash browns first, and then the bacon, sausages, waffles. Pam was devouring her husbands fantastic meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is the life... mmmm... all this food is just so goooood!</i> Pam thought while taking a large bite from an omelette.<i> I'm definitely going to have to take him to the bedroom after my stomach settles down... he's earned that and more for this great meal.... mmm such good pancakes!</i> Pam belched after finishing a pancake drenched in syrup. <i>I really need to diet, but maybe I should just indulge for a little bit longer? What's the harm in pushing the diet back few days? </i>Pam pondered to herself, grabbing a danish from the box and stuffing it into her mouth. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pam spent the next few weeks putting off her diet and instead tried to spend her time with friends, family, and of course food. Jim was learning all kinds of new ways to cook knowing how much happier it made his wife to eat homemade deliciousness. If she wasn't at work eating at the cafeteria or at home enjoying Jims cooking, she would be dining out at Burger Valley or she would order take-out, so she had no shortage of food at her disposal. Obviously, with all these opportunities available for Pam to overeat, came the consequences she was trying to avoid with her so called \u201cdiet\u201d a few weeks before. It was officially 4 weeks since Pam decided to push her diet back a \u201cfew days\u201d. While Pam wasn\u2019t happy about her increasing size, she found the food and the fun that comes along with it too irresistible to stop, at least for a little while longer anyways. Pam has had to upgrade her wardrobe a couple of times over the past month, reminding her of her increasing waistline, but also slowly allowing her to accept the changes to her fatter figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince returning to work Pam has managed to put on 30 pounds, putting her new weight at 210. Pam sported a pot belly that had officially grown to rest on her belt even when she was holding in her breath. Her boobs were larger than they were when she was pregnant, slightly resting on her belly whenever she sits down in her desk chair. Pams face was very cute and even chubbier now having puffed cheeks and a more obvious double chin than she had before. Pams arms were looking thicker and thicker, jiggling more and more every day, while her ass followed suit as it grew fatter and fatter, jiggling with every step she made and giving her more padding when she sat down. Pam looked downright fat since going back to work, and based on the fact she was still eating far more food than any one person needs to, she was only going to look larger and larger over time at the office. Even though they had a young baby, they were finding time to still enjoy each others company in and out of the bedroom. Clearly Pams weight gain hadn't been turning her husband off, as he was still very much into bedroom activities with his wife, even with her new bulk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been exactly 4 weeks since her letting go of herself, and currently she is running errands with Jim while her mother Helene is watching Cece at home. They were just leaving the grocery store parking lot, about to head back to the house for lunch when Jim heard Pams belly started to grumble in the passenger seat. Knowing his wife, she is probably wanting a snack even though she knows lunch is right around the corner, so without even asking Jim pulls into a QuickBurger drive through, causing Pam to ask where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJim it\u2019s almost lunch time, I should probably just wai-\u201d Jim placed his hand up, gesturing her to stop as he lowered his window and placed his order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019ll take three chocolate peanut butter milkshakes please.\u201d Jim says, leaning back from the window and whispering to Pam, \u201cGet a small snack to tide you over, you\u2019ll be cranky if you don\u2019t.\u201d Pam just smiles at him and gives in, moving closer to the order box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we also get an order of the mozza sticks, and a sma-actually, a medium chicken bits please? Extra sauce?\u201d Pam leaned away from the window and waited for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, pull on up!\u201d The box responded, exciting Pam for her \u201csmall snack\u201d. As they pull up, the cashier opens the window and begins to talk to Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, your total is $11.83. Also, we happen to have an extra order of chicken tenders, would you guys like them for free? They\u2019ll just end up in the trash otherwise.\u201d The cashier said, causing Pams eyes to light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! Thanks buddy.\u201d Jim says, taking the food and milkshakes after paying. And with that Jim drove away with a hearty snack for his plump wife to munch on during their drive home. Over the next 20 minutes, Pam ate her mozza sticks, chicken bits, and free large tenders, leaving barely any trace that she ate before their lunch with her mother. Pam released a large belch before leaving the car, rubbing her bloated belly as she exited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for stopping for me, you\u2019re the best.\u201d Pam said, kissing Jim on the cheek as she walked through the front door of her house holding the milkshakes. \u201cMom, we\u2019re back! We brought you a milkshake!\u201d Pam yelled, putting down the tray of drinks and looking around the living room for her mother and daughter. Just then, Helene was walking down the hallway towards Pam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey honey, good to see you\u2019re back, I was starting to get hungry. Cece is napping right now. Thanks for the milkshake, I can\u2019t wait to have it!\u201d Helene exclaimed grabbing the cold drink and taking a sip. \u201cOh my that\u2019s great, this tastes fabulous!\u201d Helene has always been a skinny woman, not usually keen on junk food or fast food, but since her visit to Burger Valley with her daughter, Helene has given food a second chance, especially since it helps with the loneliness since her divorce. Helene ate as a way to relieve stress, which is the reason she\u2019s almost bursting out of the button up she is currently wearing. Helene now weighed 176 pounds, the heaviest shes ever been, even when pregnant. She had a belly that was currently squished enough to show her muffin top and love handles, while also showing the pressure that was being put on her buttons. Helenes top buttons were undone, showing off her larger breasts nicely. Her ass was thicker, but she could still squeeze in jeans for now. Helenes arms were fatter as well, showing her lack of workouts in recent weeks. Her face was rounder and softer, making her appearance kinder than she was before. It was an adjustment for Pam to see her mother overweight, but it was nice that her mother wasn\u2019t hounding her too much about her weight or eating habits, as she was equally guilty. Pam and her mother helped Jim put away their groceries as they discussed their plans for the upcoming week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going on vacation this week? I just remember you can\u2019t watch Cece for a bit.\u201d Pam asked her mother.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYep! I\u2019m going to an all inclusive resort in the Caribbean on Thursday, I\u2019m going to stay for 2 whole weeks. Can\u2019t wait for the drinks, the buffets, the pool! I will need to upgrade my wardrobe afterwards I can feel it hahaha. Anyways, I\u2019m going with a couple girlfriends who like to relax and get away from the cold. Plus they make me feel skinnier when I\u2019m with them.\u201d Helene jokes as she puts away a couple bags of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like fun Helene!\u201d Jim said happily. \u201cI was thinking we should do Burger Valley for lunch? What do you guys think?\u201d Both women's eyes lit up at the mention, both agreeing with intense head nods. \u201cGreat, then I\u2019ll start the car.\u201d Jim walked out to the driveway, getting the carseat ready for his daughter. Helene and Pam get Cece ready for lunch. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they walked through the restaurant doors Pam and Helene had the same reaction, closing their eyes and inhaling deep to enjoy the smell of their favourite place to eat. As they walked up to the hostess stand, they saw a larger woman coming from around the corner wiping face with a napkin as she walked closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there folks, great to see you guys again! Table for four?\u201d It was Mallory, one of Pams favourite employees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mallory!\u201d Pam responded smiling, going in to hug the hostess. While Pam has been seeing Mallory frequently, the last time we saw her she was most definitely skinnier. Working at Burger Valley has grown Mallorys appetite and size, but she seems to mind it less and less everytime Pam sees her. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d Pam continued, as Mallory began to show them to their table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory still had her beautiful black hair and bright blue eyes, and her skin still looked great, even if there\u2019s more of it than there used to be. Most of Mallorys weight went to her boobs, giving her DDD bras quite the workout. Her whole frame was covered in a layer of fat, showing the rolls on her back through her black top, and showing off her reasonable belly. Her ass had grown wider, giving her an incredibly sexy hourglass figure that was incredibly accented at 200 pounds. Mallory led them to their booth and waited until they were seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you guys like me to get you drinks? Your server is coming in a few if you know what you want, I'll grab \u2018em.\u201d Mallory said, her boobs jiggling with every slight movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! I\u2019ll take a pint of beer.\u201d Pam responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh me too please!\u201d Helene said quickly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a water please.\u201d Jim said, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing guys, be back soon!\u201d Mallory said, walking to the bar as her tits knocked from side to side. Pam was a little jealous she wasn\u2019t gaining like Mallory, she looks hot at any weight. Pam grabbed her menu and started looking to see what she\u2019d have. As they looked over the menus Mallory came back with the drinks, handing them to everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything else I can help with?\u201d Mallory asked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually yes, what do you recommend?\u201d Helene responded, causing Mallory to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as you can probably tell I\u2019ve had everything on the menu, but there's a new burger called the \u201cMeaty Mudslide\u201d. It\u2019s loaded with peanut butter and chocolate and it\u2019s a triple patty with tons of bacon and cheese. It\u2019s amazing, definitely worth the try. I\u2019m probably going to order one for myself now that I\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d Mallory laughed, rubbing her soft belly. \u201cAlso the \u201cVolcano Burger\u201d is great too! It\u2019s a 6 cheeseburger with a triple patty and spicy peppers on it. I eat at least one of those burgers everyday, I\u2019m always such a bloated cow when I leave this place.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I worked here I honestly think I\u2019d constantly eat the entire shift every day.\u201d Pam laughed, even though it was an honest statement with how much Pam has been eating recently. \u201cI\u2019d be double my size I bet haha.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I know you guys well enough to say that I\u2019ll eat at least 5 burgers every single day.\u201d Mallory whispered, somewhat ashamed of that fact but still laughing about it. \u201c And they\u2019re not the only things I snack on here, it\u2019s pretty ridiculous how much junk I eat now. I\u2019ve gained a ton since starting here, but your server Emily, she\u2019s more far gone than I am. She totally knows too.\u201d Mallory said, before seeing people at the door. \u201cOh gotta go! I\u2019ll see guys later.\u201d Mallory walked away from the booth, jiggling her fat ass side to side. As Pam looked back at the table, she saw her mother take a large sip from her beer and loudly exhale, taking another one quickly after. Pam took a drink from her beer as well, enjoying the time well spent with her family. Just then, Pam noticed their server, Emily, was on her way to their booth. While Mallory was turning into a real glutton, Emily was a step ahead of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had her black hair down, but her face was still visible, showing off the softness from her gain. She had a good double chin, and a fatter neck. Her arms were fat and had jiggling bingo wings which moved as she walked. Her breasts hadn\u2019t grown much from their original size, most of her weight went to her belly and legs. From the side she looked like she had 3 distinct rolls of fat. Her fupa at the bottom until you reach the waistband of her pants, where her belly roll is one large distinct curve up until her breasts which rest on her large gut. Her ass is large and sticks out from her body more and more after each shift. At 220 pounds it was clear Emily was gorging nonstop, especially since her black shirt had sauce stained on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, what can I get you?\u201d Emily said while adjusting her tight clothes and burping quietly. Jim ordered first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a regular burger and wings please.\u201d Next was Helene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a volcano burger please, extra mayo on it if you could. I\u2019ll have the unlimited cheese fries as well please, with a side of gravy. Also, I\u2019ll have a meaty mudslide please!\u201d Helene said while handing back her menu and licking her lips. Pam looked shocked to see her mother willing to order so much unhealthy food, but it made Pam feel better for what she was about to order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take two grilled cheese double burgers and one double pizza burger with double cheese, along with the unlimited cheese fries with gravy on the side as well please, and I\u2019ll also have a pound of the hot wings. Also another beer for my mother.\u201d Pam said, Helene smiling as she drank more of her beer, spilling it down her shirt slightly. Emily walked back to the kitchen, showing the strain on the back of her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were feeling drunk by the time their food arrived, making them even more excited when Emily and Mallory brought them their feasts. Mallory had chocolate stained on her shirt from her own mudslide earlier, her bloated belly pressing on her shirt. Emily went to order her 7th burger of day after smelling the volcano sauce. Helene grabbed her mudslide burger first, digging in with a large bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm oh my goodness Pam, this burger is amazing\u2026*munch*.... *munch* \u2026 *gulp*... let\u2019s see the volcano one.\u201d Helene said as she grabbed the second large burger, double fisting two triple burgers. Helene begins taking a large bite and moans with pleasure. \u201cOhhh myyy that\u2019s amazing\u2026. Mallory was so right to suggest these\u2026 *munch*.... I gotta have more\u2026 *chomp!*... mmmmm.\u201d Helene continued to moan in pleasure as she stuffed herself silly with burgers. Pam grabbed a wing first, finishing it all in one move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmmm I friggin\u2019 love their wings so much\u2026 gosh I can\u2019t wait for those burgers\u2026.\u201d Pam said, grabbing the pizza burger and taking a swift bite before moaning again. Jim sat and watched as both women continued to drink and eat themselves until full, which he wasn\u2019t even sure was going to happen. Helene finished both burgers in 10 minutes, promptly unbuttoning her pants, then swiftly moving to the fries and gravy, but she didn\u2019t look fully satisfied. Pam too finished her meal quickly, eating just the fries now. Pams belly is poking out and her pants are also unbuttoned. Emily came back and the ladies ordered dessert, clearly wanting to be fully stuffed from this meal. Emily brought cake slices, pie slices, cookies and ice cream for both women, who ate with gusto. Helene managed to pop a button on her shirt, and Pams belly was very open to public viewing. Both women sat back in their seats, showing off their bloated bodies, Helenes spare tire looking larger than normal, and Pams pot belly sticking far out onto her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jim and Pam are currently on their way to work with more time to spare than usual as Helene took care of Cece for the day until supper when she would come over, Jim suggested Pizza and wings which both ladies were thrilled to hear. Helene had come early and somehow Jim and Pam had made it to the office without realizing they were 30 minutes early, leaving them both disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we are so tired we didn\u2019t even notice how early we were leaving, jeez look at us, model employees.\u201d Jim joked as he turned off his car while Pam giggled. \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we get some breakfast from the cafeteria? Not like we\u2019re gonna get any work done anyways.\u201d Jim smiled at Pam, who smiled back at her handsome husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God I really shouldn't, </i>thought Pam as she walked into the building, <i>But my goodness my belly feels like it\u2019s gonna eat itself if I don\u2019t eat soon, why am I so much hungrier than usual? </i>Pam wondered as she rubbed her gut which was looking tight in her new shirt and pants. <i>Normally I eat a bowl of cereal, an apple or two and a smoothie and I\u2019m good until first snack\u2026 but wow I really need something soon or I might pass out. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim held the cafeteria door open for his wide bride as she walked in, the smells instantly wafting into her nose. Jim watched his fat wife slowed down to a halt as she took in the various smells, looking over the plethora of food in front of her, watching her thinking process unfold in front of him. Of course, this wasn\u2019t overly new for Jim as he is no stranger to Pam's new increased appetite. He knew she would grab bacon, eggs, sausage, and definitely some pancakes. He also knew she\u2019d want a bottle of maple syrup at the table, just based on the tall stack of them on one of her plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam also grabbed a few doughnuts, a couple danishes and strudels, and even 3 cookies. To drink she a large glass of chocolate milk and a large coffee, all carefully placed on her tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Pam begins to inhale her breakfast Jim is slowly eating his apple while looking at his wife gorge herself on an incredible amount of unhealthy food, fully knowing she\u2019ll continue eating at this pace over the course of the day. Still, as Jim watched her, he wasn\u2019t disgusted like some would be. In fact, Jim had come to enjoy his wife's new curves and appetite, knowing how happy it made her to enjoy good food. He had no idea he\u2019d appreciate gluttony or fat this much, but he did know he\u2019d enjoy the ride, knowing Pam would probably want to lose the weight eventually, or at least slow down her gain. Jim watched as Pam inserted a large bite of pancakes into her mouth, dribbling syrup down her double chin. Her current dress shirt showed her fat edges, showing slight strain as she was sitting down. Just then, in the corner of Jims eye he spots Phyllis walking into the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past month since Pams return, almost every woman at the office were piling on pounds, overeating and over drinking more and more frequently, and while each one took their own unique approach to that, all of their waistlines and wardrobes suffered from it. As Jim stared at Phyllis, he noticed how she had made no effort to slow down her food intake and instead opting for the more popular method of \u201cgorge yourself silly\u201d. Her larger body moved through the cafeteria waddling towards the trays, clearing about to grab a quick breakfast too. Phyllis was clearly the fattest in the office nowadays, especially since Kevin left to work from home due to his immense size from the cafeteria food. Phyllis chooses to work at the building just because of the cheap and delicious, plus she can meet with her husband for \u201cbreaks\u201d. She wouldn\u2019t know, but she weighs 373 pounds and counting. Her face was fat, her double chin thick and covering her entire neck, and her cheeks were rosie and round. She was wearing a sweater much too small for her, it was tight and showing off her large belly and boobs which were currently jiggling as she waddled towards the breakfast table, picking up an assortment of meat and piling them on her plate, then reaching for more. Phyllis was huge, clearly exhausted from walking so much. Phyllis had never excited Jim so much before, but now he found it impossible not to watch the fattest person around gorge herself. However, there were other people in the cafeteria, doing the exact same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMen and women alike from all offices in the building had begun to enjoy the tasty meals that were made in their building, eating more than anyone needs to and putting on a lot of weight because of it. Jim looked around, seeing people putting their uniforms to their limits and eating themselves beyond silly. Still, no one matched Phyllis as of now anyways, she was a whale of a woman. Jim could hear her coming, causing him to turn his head and realizing the office whale was about to join them. Not that Jim was mad, this wasn\u2019t exactly romantic or anything. Pam hadn\u2019t said anything for 5 minutes, clearly being lost in her large and fattening breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya\u2026 *puff*... Jim... *puff* how\u2019s it\u2026 going?\u201d Phyllis said as she walked up to the table, putting her tray down and preparing to lower her large rear end on to one of the larger cafeteria chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty good, see you needed some breakfast before work too, huh?\u201d Jim says casually, referring to Pams current feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026*puff puff*... I always do now, Bob brings me early. *wheeze* It\u2019s easier than cooking that early haha.\u201d Phyllis had a large tray full of food and 20 minutes to wolf it down, which everyone knew she would. \u201cGood Morning Pam!\u201d Phyllis said picking up a large slice of chocolate cake and pushing it into her mouth, grabbing a doughnut for the ready once she swallowed the cake. Pam looked up with a full mouth and just nodded and swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe-BUUURRPP-woaah my excuuuse me haha, did you hear that Jim?\u201d Pam said laughing and bouncing her jiggly body up and down, giving Jim chills, before returning her conversation to phyllis. \u201cHey there, is what I meant to say. Good to see you bright and early too!\u201d Pam picked up a piece of bacon and shoved it into her mouth, returning to her feast and allowing Phyllis to finish in time for work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim watched as both women stuffed their bellies, mystified at their capacities. Pam finished her last sweet treat and leaned back with 5 minutes to spare. Her belly was pushing on her dress shirt, and her face looked bloated and fat, various food smeared all over it. Jim began to wipe his wife's face and she laid back, moaning and groaning about her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026*buurpp*...my goodness Jim...ugghh my belly is soo tight...I should\u2019ve stopped at the doughnuts\u2026*braahhpp!*....uugghhh.\u201d Pam groaned, while Jim helped her up out of her seat. While they got up, Phyllis was almost finished her food. Eating at an almost impossible pace, she was moving quickly through the remaining food. \u201cJim let\u2019s wait for Phyllis, she\u2019s gonna need help up.\u201d Pam said, still looking uncomfortable as she stands, gripping her bloated gut. Jim had no issue waiting for Phyllis. As he watched, he then saw someone in the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking into the cafeteria was some more of Dunder Mifflin employees, Erin, Meredith and Kelly, and they are looking very well fed. Firstly, there\u2019s Kelly, who unsurprisingly continues to gain at an overwhelming rate. Kelly is currently 334 pounds and in almost every way she\u2019s looking it. Currently Kelly is standing with half a breakfast sandwich in her right hand and food all over her clothes and face. She was looking stuffed to the brim already, undoubtedly going for a fast food drive-thru breakfast. Her figure was completely stuffed and bloated, turning into an apple shape if it wasn\u2019t for her large ass that stuck out and was wider than her shoulders. Kellys breasts were even more massive as she expanded, resting heavily on her large double belly which was slightly exposed at the bottom. As Kelly forced the rest of the sandwich into her mouth and went up to the bakery, she grabbed a large white box that looked heavy, the first round of office doughnuts. Jim couldn\u2019t believe it when he saw Meredith go for a second box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Meredith, her figure is also blossoming into quite a large form, taking up more and more space everywhere she goes, not to mention it\u2019s harder for her to get drunk with her new weight. But clearly she doesn\u2019t care enough to stop eating so much, showing how she is just as addicted to the food as the rest of them. Meredith looked to be stretching her dress, already, Jim even noticing that in fact it already had rips in it, which Meredith's fat would push through and enlarge each and every time she sat down. Meredith weighed a hefty 236 pounds, which jiggled all around her as she walked away from the counter smiling holding the box with one hand and holding her gut with her other hand. Her belly was jutting out in front of her, her double chin jiggling with every move. Jim was incredibly aroused seeing these women expanding, exciting his new found love for heavier women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Erin, who hadn\u2019t gotten nearly as fat as her coworkers, but she was still on the incline. At 160 pounds, she\u2019s managed to put on 35 pounds from her snacking on treats. Of almost anyone Erin looked the least affected from the food, but she still did put on a good amount of weight, it just went to the right places first. Her arms thicker, she finally has really boobs, slightly bouncing now as she walked. She had a slight visible belly, but by Jims guess she was probably just about to go through her first real clothing change phase. Erin looked cute as she grabbed her box, showing her slight love handles as she lifted up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That\u2019s a lot of doughnuts though, are they all really gonna eat that much before lunch? </i>Jim thought, watching as Meredith grabbed one out of the box and shove it into her mouth as she walked away. Phyllis had just finished eating, which meant Jim and Pam had to help lift her heavy bulky body out of her seat. Quickly they went upstairs, making it just on time as per usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they had a visitor they weren\u2019t expecting to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hi there Ms. Bennet! How are you doing?\u201d Erin said, happily to the CEO of Sabre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot great Erin, can y\u2019all tell me why are all ya\u2019ll folks late?\u201d Jo said sternly before looking at Erin's pastries box. \u201d And I\u2019m sorry but are you gonna eat all those pastries to yourselves? My goodness this branch has some kind of epidemic about food that I don\u2019t understand, however I will say I\u2019m gonna get to the bottom of this. Gimme that box and get to work, the lot of ya!\u201d Jo grabbed a box out of Erins Hands, who rushed back to the desk afraid of being yelled at anymore. Jo walked into the conference room with the doughnuts and closed the door loudly. All the girls dispersed to their desks and began to work. Meredith shoving down doughnut after doughnut, eating 13 in an hour. Kelly stuffed hers back quickly as well, rubbing her fat and soft gut, thinking about her next snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the uncomfortable exchange with their boss the morning before, most of the women were trying to work extra hard hoping she was watching, just trying to salvage whatever dignity they could from Jo, although admittedly she hadn\u2019t been very keen on her employees since the morning. Jo had stayed in the conference room since she stormed in there, making Pam, Erin and Phyllis nervous about being so close to her proximity if she started shouting again. Meredith figured she was far enough from Jo\u2019s sightlines that she could chow down freely and hide before she got caught (which was unlikely due to her excess bulk). The most afraid of Jo\u2019s wrath was Erin, which would explain her thoughts of panic when she realized Jo was texting her from the conference room to come see her. Erin was in a panic, worried about her tight clothes, rumbling stomach and chubbier face, she knew she\u2019d cave at any of Jo\u2019s questions. Still, she had no other choice. <i>What\u2019s the worst that can really happen? </i>Erin thought nervously, lifting herself off of her chair and towards the conference room fearing for her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin walked up to the door, she slowly opened it fearing for the worst, expecting Jo to fire her for her gluttony, or for her to shame Erin for putting on so much weight in such a short amount of time. Erin held her breath opening the door, but as she walked in she quickly realized something else was going on, something very different than she expected. Erin saw Jo, who was leaned back in her chair, pants unbuttoned and her hand caressing her bloated belly. In front of her, lay the open box she had confiscated with 2 doughnuts still left in it, half a doughnut still in her left hand. Jo\u2019s face had sugar and pastry smothered all over it, while her eyes looked dazed and empty, clearly in a trance from her private pig out session. Erin quickly closed the door after entering, keeping the scene contained from the other employees of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Bennet! Oh my goodness how can I assist you?\u201d Erin said wanting to help her boss, worried she was about to be yelled at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 my\u2026 *burrrppp!* Erin you\u2019re soo-*URP!*.. Sweet! Don\u2019t worry though, that\u2019s not why I texted you to come in here.\u201d Jo said, still leaning back and taking another bite from her half finished doughnut. \u201cMmm *munch* I just wanted to apologize about earlier, what I said and *urp* did was out of line, I\u2019m very sorry for taking your very delicious doughnuts. As you can tell though, they were clearly delicious though haha\u2026\u201d Jo said, giggling about her current stuffed state. \u201cNow I know I\u2019m the one who got myself into this mess, but I need your help. I figured maybe you and I could work out a deal.\u201d Jo said, smiling mischievously towards Erin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to help boss, let me help in any way I can.\u201d Erin responded, happy to do anything to keep her from being in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! So here\u2019s the thing, before this morning, I didn\u2019t understand what everyone was so late, but after I confiscated your doughnuts, I thought I\u2019d have one for a quick snack. Sure enough, I couldn\u2019t get enough, even as my pants got so tight, I still just kept munching on them.\u201d Jo said, grabbing a doughnut from her box and handing it towards Erin, grabbing the last one for herself. \u201cLook I can\u2019t encourage everyone to eat over work, but I think while I\u2019m here, I should take a look at this cafeteria, see if it\u2019s a business I should get involved in.\u201d Jo took a bite while Erin nibbled slowly, afraid of eating the way she wanted in front of Jo. \u201cSo while I\u2019m here, I want you to secretly bring me food to a different room I\u2019ll be working in, one where I\u2019ll be more hidden. I want to try their menu, and in exchange, you can eat everytime I send you down there if you\u2019d like, how\u2019s that sound?\u201d Jo asked, looking greedy and round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my that sounds amazing, yes please!\u201d Erin shouted, thinking of the sweets she\u2019ll be eating soon enough. \u201cWhat can I get for you now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like your attitude, here\u2019s the deal, I\u2019m here for the next couple of weeks, so I want to try something new everyday unless I request it specifically, okay?\u201d Jo said, doing up her clothes. \u201cI\u2019m gonna leave to that room, I want some fried chicken and if they got mashed potatoes, get me lots of gravy please.\u201d Jo proceeded to exit the room, scaring employees with her stern look. As Jo left, Erin shoved the rest of her doughnut into her mouth, moaning a little as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the remainder of the morning, Jo went upstairs one floor into a spare office space she rented for secret meetings without Michael. She indeed proceeded to work, but not without something to \u201csnack on\u201d. Up until Lunch came close, Erin would get a text from Jo and be called to grab something she craved, or hoped they\u2019d have. First it was a slice of chocolate cake, some whole milk and some cookies. Erin left her desk, grabbed them, dropped them off to Jo, then went back to her desk. Only 15-20 mins later she\u2019d get another text, only this time asking for pancakes, bacon, eggs, sausages, muffins and biscuits. Erin would then repeat the previous steps, multiple times before lunch even came. This would be great physical exercise for someone who didn\u2019t eat 2 slices of cake as a \u201ctreat\u201d, or stuffed a half dozen doughnuts in mere minutes to keep her coworkers unsuspicious of her new deal. Both of the women looked bloated and stuffed, constantly burping yet somehow craving more to eat. While Erin had been eating like this for a while, it seemed unusual that Jo Bennet, a superstar CEO who looked to be unbreakable, was now stuffing her belly full of greasy junk food like the rest of the girls. Jo would continue to eat and eat, looking bloated and fully gorged, but yet somehow still hungry and demanding more. Erin was stunned by how much she ate before lunch, worried her boss might explode. Erin had to ask what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey uh Jo\u2019.\u201d Erin said timidly, entering the secret hideout of Jo\u2019s. Jo was stuffing a bacon melt into her mouth, her face covered in grease. In only 3 hours, Jo ate more food than she would\u2019ve in two days. \u201cI really love your uh, enthusiasm for food, which I definitely share hahahaha-um but uh, I was just wondering why you\u2019re um...eating so much all of sudden\u2026?\u201d Erin was scared, especially with a poor delivery. Jo sat back, swallowing the remnants of her sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know something? That\u2019s a ballsy question.\u201d Jo said with a serious face, shifting her already abundant frame around in her chair. \u201cBut I think it takes guts to ask, guts I most definitely have myself. Hahaha!\u201d Jo laughed, grabbing her orb of a belly. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, okay? I\u2019ve always had a thing for food. Since I was a girl I loved to eat, my daddy had to keep a close eye on me until I was 18, cause I would sneak food any chance I had. I wasn\u2019t this big then, but being wealthy and busy make for a bad diet. Believe it or not, I\u2019ve been pretty good recently. But these damn doughnuts, well girl they\u2019re amazing. And everything since then has been too! This place makes highly delicious and addictive food, and frankly it\u2019s brought my inner fat girl out. Now, since you\u2019re here, could I order my lunch?\u201d Jo said, smiling and relaxing again, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah of course!\u201d Erin said, getting out her notepad, as Jo started listing a large amount of food. Okay, I\u2019ll be back!\u201d Erin said, smiling and walking away, her bigger ass swaying side to side. Not long after, Erin returned with a tray full of food. Nachos, tacos, cake, chicken parm, ravioli, cookies and a burger! \u201cHere you go! Anything else?\u201d Erin said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo dear, this will do for now. Thank you so much! Go get yourself a bite to eat, don\u2019t worry \u2018bout being late either, I\u2019ll let Michael know about your \u201clate lunch\u201d\u201d. Jo said smiling, while grabbing the plates in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks so much Jo!\u201d Erin said, walking back to the elevator, excited for her own meal. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It\u2019s just after Christmas break, all of the employees are getting used to working 5 days in a row again, most are excited to enjoy the cafeteria food they missed over their days off not because they\u2019d been eating light at home, their addictions and cravings were just calling their stomachs on their first day back. The cafeteria was quite packed on the Monday morning before everyone's shifts had started. Some things had changed rather quickly since Jo discovered food again, causing quite a stir in Scranton and beyond. Jo realized quickly of what kind of potential this cafeteria had at becoming a massive food empire, so she decided to contact their CEO, and with a few more calls Sabre accumulated the company, \u201cFuture Foods\u201d as their own. Jo used this ability to eat for free at all their current locations- including \u201cBurger Valley\u201d, but quite frankly she just called her people to make the expansion happen, and quick. Already another restaurant popped up in Scranton, the \u201cScrantons\u2019, All You Can Eat Anything.\u201d An even larger version of the cafeteria, with more food options as well as larger booths and tables. She gave all Sabre employees a card for 50% off at any Sabre owned location, which of course was quickly utilized by many employees. She also had the cafeteria upgraded again, adding more food options and even a delivery service, which employees could pay a service fee to have a runner drop off food. This was also utilized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, since Jo had gotten mad at the women, they had their guard up about being fired. They all knew how expensive their food addiction would be to feed if they didn\u2019t work there, they all had to keep their jobs. However, eating less was an option that was quickly off the table, so to speak. Another ship that had sailed was using Erin as their own runner. She refused to since getting in trouble, and also vowed to never eat at her desk again. She did keep that promise, but only because of her deal with Jo of being her own personal runner. Erin had still been pigging out, in fact, this new arrangement had Erin eating more food than she ever had before, but thanks to all the moving around for Jo, she actually managed to keep her gain slower, at least compared to other staff members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had gained a decent amount of weight in such a short amount of time, of course Jo\u2019s orders had kept her trips to the cafeteria frequent, from her new stress eating about keeping her deal secret from the rest of the women, and then how much she managed to gorge on her Christmas break, eating from the new \u201call you can eat\u201d place or Burger Valley. Erin had been letting herself go majorly, and while she was aware of it she still tried her best to ignore it. Her constant gorging and addiction to sweets places her new weight at 184 pounds. Her boobs were larger than ever, and almost every part of her put on a layer of fat, making her appearance softer with no particular \u201cfat body part\u201d yet. Almost everyone was aware of Erin's weight gain though, watching the skinny and perky secretary thicken right before their eyes. Of course, the same could be said about every other staff member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Erin was busy with her task of keeping Jo hidden, she knew she\u2019d still have to make an appearance around the office for the first while, reminding them she was actually still around and watching them. Frankly Jo had no idea what they were even working on, she was lost in her new business venture, but she pretended to care, just to keep them on their feet. This also kept the girls on edge about eating on company time, hiding snacks in all their drawers. Jo knew they were still porking out behind her back, she frankly didn\u2019t care about that, she actually wanted them to want the food more, thinking if she made them do it behind her back they\u2019d eat more at lunch and dinner, hopefully from her restaurants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also didn\u2019t take very long for the staff to realize that Joe had been eating just like them, in fact it seemed like she was eating even more. Every time they\u2019d see her she would have food all over her shirt or face, and not to mention she was blowing up like a balloon. She\u2019d be bloated, burping and groaning all over the office, clearly trying to hide it. But Jo\u2019s waistline was the dead giveaway. In a mere 5 week period she grew a rather substantial amount, eating only fattening food at the amount and rate she was would only make a person obese. Jo weighed 265 pounds, sporting her large belly around as she stalked about the office. Jo\u2019s clothes would get incredibly tight before she\u2019d upgrade it, clearly aware of her expanding figure. Still even though she was obviously hooked, they hid all their food just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Phyllis\u2019 desk, it was stocked to the brim full of snacks and treats. One drawer was candy bars, another one was filled with doughnuts and other pastries, her largest one filled with 3 large and full bags from Burger Valley. When her food ran out, she\u2019d call for a runner and hope Jo wasn\u2019t coming by at that moment. At work Phyllis was still managing to pack away food like it was her last day alive. She\u2019d show up for breakfast before work, then snack in secret until lunch, which is when she\u2019d gorge herself on two trays worth of food, returning to work bloated and stuffed. Phyllis ate until the end of the day even though she\u2019d feel fit to burst. She\u2019d pick up drive through on the way home and meet her husband, which is when they would have their wild wild sex they love to talk about. This habit over the past 5 weeks has given Phyllis 35 new pounds, putting her at the range for a new scale and past the 400s. She now weighed 413 pounds, and sure was acting like it too. She was always chewing as she worked, munching on something in secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there\u2019s Meredith, who is now 270 pounds of mostly blubber. Her fat form is very noticeable since she only seems to wear small clothing. Meredith had quite a sizable gut that hung over her waistband in a way she seemed proud of. Meredith looked incredibly fat now, looking like beyond the point of no return, which is probably true. Meredith felt fine hiding burgers, shakes, fries, hotdogs, cakes and more in her desk. She had food hidden all over the office for whenever she needed a snack, which was really all the time now. Meredith also fell in love with her new discount, going out for dinner almost every night now and stuffing her belly full beyond belief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly couldn\u2019t stop herself if she tried, hiding food all over the annex so she\u2019d never be hungry again. The fear of being unable to eat terrified her, so she made sure there were always snacks nearby for her to devour.  At 365 pounds she was a force to be reckoned with, making Gabe too afraid to confront her about her eating. Kelly was massive, bursting from her uniform and jiggling with every movement. Kelly looked as if she couldn\u2019t stop even if she had no other choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen of course, there\u2019s Pam who we know as quite a hardcore snacker herself. These past few weeks were stressful trying to not get caught by Jo. Sometimes Jim would go for her, fetching a large order to fill up her own desk which he also donated desk space to her treats. Not to mention she would go out for dinner almost every other night now, giving into her addiction like the rest. Pam very well knew she was gaining an alarming amount of weight, which she also knew she\u2019d start really feeling the physical effects even stronger as she grows larger and larger. Already Pam feels her breathing has gotten worse, and she sweats more than ever. Pam knew her abundant form was getting out of control, but how exactly is she supposed to stop eating with all of these bad influences around her? These thoughts circulated around Pams head for the past few weeks, only making her clothes feel tighter and tighter. Pam was growing fast tipping the scales at 262 pounds, incredibly close to a new weight gain. Pams fat body pushed on her chair hard, and she looked to be outgrowing clothes almost every other week. Even Jim had put on weight, nothing major, but enough to show his new belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, all the guys had put on some weight. Oscar was fatter than before, while Gabe quickly put on some weight too. And then there was petite Angela. She had been trying her best to hide from the women. For one, their gluttonous appetites and enthusiasm for gorging themselves wasn\u2019t shared with her. While she did enjoy the food, and perhaps over eat every now and then, she didn\u2019t find joy in constant face stuffing. Angela did however love a big breakfast, and a solid lunch, and of course a hearty dinner. Angela liked to load up hard 3 times a day, which did allow her gain to be slow, but the weight was inevitable nonetheless.  Angela weighed 150 pounds, which made her feel huge. She\u2019s never been so large before, but months of large meals will make anyone fat. Angela would try to hide her gain at all costs, trying to avoid her embarrassment. Over Christmas Angela ate out more than she had all fall, feeling her addiction to the greasy food grow like her waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there\u2019s Michael and Holly, who have officially reconnected and can\u2019t stop hooking up all the time, causing quite the stir at the office. However, over the 5 weeks for them...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since Holly had arrived she had discovered that Scranton was a bad influence on her own figure, especially noting the increase of her boyfriends size. Micheal had put on 50 pounds since the cafeteria moved in, causing him to upgrade his wardrobe as well as adjust his seat, now that his frame was larger. Micheal was mostly addicted to the sweets the cafeteria had to offer, eating pastries and desserts until he passed out from his sugar rush. When Holly first arrived, she noticed his increased size and wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it, however, she came to enjoy having more to hold while kissing him, not to mention since his weight gain he had calmed down quite a lot, making Holly grow confident that he was the man for her. Of course, with her new attitude, job and chubby boyfriend, Holly was constantly surrounded by junk food which led to her own weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Holly and Micheal are in his office \u201cdiscussing business\u201d with the blinds closed, enjoying their morning snacks together while trying to hide their PDA from their co-workers. Micheal is seated at his desk, with a plate of doughnuts in front of him. His suit is tight, definitely needing a size up soon if he doesn\u2019t slow down. Across from him was Holly, who enjoyed sweets herself, but she also found enjoyment from savoury foods that they served in the cafeteria. Holly had gained 30 pounds since starting back at Scranton, not yet buying new clothes to accommodate her new frame. Holly looked plumper, her butt looking thicker, as well as her breasts which were showing a decent amount of cleavage through her dress shirt. Holly is currently holding a doughnut in her right hand, while holding a dense double breakfast sandwich in her left. She was on her second sandwich since entering Micheals office, and almost finished her fourth doughnut. Holly's face was looking chubbier, her rounder cheeks bulging whenever she took a bite of something delicious. Her neck and chin looking softer, showing her future double chin off. Holly was currently showing off her new small rolls, sporting a bit of her pale flesh out in the open (not that she was aware). Holly had grown to enjoy the Scranton office lifestyle quickly and had learned that exposed skin was nothing to be ashamed of, or at least not when you saw her compared to the real office cows. Holly forced the rest of her doughnut into her mouth, spreading sugar all over her lips and giggling at Micheal, who smiled at his adorable girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying your food?\" Micheal asked while taking a bite from a Danish. \"I told them to get extra sprinkles for it today when I went. Did you notice?\" Holly smiled while swallowing her dessert, preparing to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I definitely noticed! These might be some of the best ones I've had yet!\" Holly said with excitement, gesturing towards the snacks on the desk. \"Especially the stuffed ones\u2026 they're so good babe!\u201d The two of them continued to snack profusely throughout the day, both of them eating a very full and greasy lunch that left them both nearly comatose for the remainder of the day. Pam would watch as Holly would take frequent trips downstairs, unafraid of Jo because of her flawless report and ability to follow deadlines, not to mention she was Micheals girlfriend which would make any confrontation about it weird than it would need to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the day was coming to an end, Pam went to the break room for her last break, pulling out a large slice pie from the fridge and digging into it. Oh my goodness, I still can\u2019t believe how good they make these things. Pam thought to herself, taking forkful after forkful. Pam was aware of bulging belly and widening thighs. She knew her body was always growing, but she liked to ignore that to the best of her ability, and eating food really helped keep her calm. As Pam was sitting at the table alone, the door opened showing none other than Holly, who was holding a doughnut in her hand and a brown paper bag full of something greasy in her other. Pam noticed how she was jiggling in places she never had before, seeing how Holly had love handles forming, and how her ass was looking ready to rip right through her pants in the next few meals. Holly smiled as she saw Pam and began to ask her a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPam! Good to see you, is this seat taken?\u201d She asked, gesturing at the seat at the table adjacent to Pam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, by all means take a seat!\u201d Pam responded with a smile. \u201cWhat do you have to munch on?\u201d Pam asked politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I just finished another box of doughnuts, so I grabbed a burger, fries and chicken nuggets from downstairs, something salty and good, y'know?\u201d Holly responded, opening the bag and pulling out it\u2019s contents. \u201cI mean really, this stuff is impossible to resist, am I right?\u201d Pam agreed with a smile, slightly ashamed of how far she had let the food take over her figure. At least everyone is on the same page though, almost everyone has put on weight, hell I\u2019m not even the worst of the bunch!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so right, goodness me I\u2019ve managed to really ruin my figure since coming back. I never thought I\u2019d be so lost to food.\u201d Pam said in agreement, clutching her jelly belly with one hand while still taking another bite of her pie. \u201cIt seems like everyone has lost it, I honestly still can\u2019t believe it sometimes. Everyone has grown so much, you know what I mean?\u201d Holly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I was worried at first in all honesty, but this food changed my mind. Not to mention I never thought I\u2019d like Micheal with more meat on his bones, but I love cuddles and even sex is better than ever. I can\u2019t believe it but we\u2019re both actually\u2026  happier, as crazy as that sounds.\u201d Holly said, taking a bite from her large burger. \u201cI never thought I'd be so liberated being able to eat whatever I want, but you girls here in the office have really changed my point of view, and honestly thank you for that.\u201d Holly said as she continued to eat the fast food making a mess of herself by smearing ketchup and mustard all over her face, while she's also dripping grease into her bigger cleavage, causing Pam to catch herself and look away. Pam had to admit it to herself, she was slowly coming to terms with her new pounds and while she still wasn't the biggest fan of them but she had to admit that she like the way that Jim touched her and felt towards her recently, not to mention she enjoyed Jims new dad-bod while they were cuddling in bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women continue to eat their unhealthy lunches on their last break eating far more than they needed to, stuffing their stomachs to their final limits before the last bit of work. As Holly finished the rest of her meal she leaned back in her chair gripping her full and bloated stomach, burping loudly and messily, causing Pams eyes to widen at the sound of Holly\u2019s gluttony. Pam had just taken the last bite of her pie, rubbing her larger belly, feeling how painfully tight her pants felt and yet still thinking about what she was going to have later when she went home to eat, remembering Jims suggestion of roast chicken and potatoes. As both girls sat in the break room clutching their stomachs and sitting back in their uncomfortable seats, none other than Kelly waddled into the room, jiggling her own gut while holding a soda and a slice of pizza in her hands. </span></div></div>",

Saturday is looking like a really good day for fun, although Sunday I just wanna be lazy and order in food all day, I hope he\u2019s down for that ha ha ha.\u201d she laughed while smiling at her co-workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like so much fun Holly!\u201d Kelly said smiling. \u201cHow about you Pam,\u201d Kelly asked \u201cAre you doing anything fun this weekend with Jim?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, unfortunately we don't have any plans this weekend. It's really challenging with Cece still being so young, but we're hoping that my mom will help us out soon enough and take her for maybe a week or two. We really want to go to an all-inclusive resort somewhere nice and warm, really enjoy ourselves, take a small break from the stress, you know?\u201d Pam responded honestly, tired of the same ol\u2019 Scranton life. The only thing that Pam and Jim are doing on the weekends anymore is watching TV, cooking their meals for the next week, and going grocery shopping. All of these activities result in Pam snacking heavily on many various junk foods. The three women continue to talk about their plans for the weekend until the break is over, and they all walked and waddled out to their desks to complete the final day's work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day ended all of the staff got out of their chairs, put on their coats and proceeded to walk out the door. Kelly was currently walking (with some serious effort) towards her car with a large bottle of soda in her hand, burping with every step. As she opened her door, she slowly moved her fat body into her seat, squishing her lard around as she shifted for comfort. Good lord I\u2019m huge, it\u2019s harder and harder every day with all this bulk. She thought to herself as she put on her seat belt and started her car. Either way though, there\u2019s really no stopping it now. I\u2019m already this big, I doubt I can even lose this weight. As Kelly was getting ready to pull out of her parking spot, she looked at the clock in her car. Well I\u2019ve got an hour and a half til the dinner menu at the buffet, so maybe I\u2019ll make a pit stop at the movies or something. That popcorn is pretty dang good, oh plus they have those stuffed hotdogs mmm\u2026 not to mention their pizza is pretty good.  Kelly thought to herself, her mouth watering at the thought of all the greasy and savoury food she was going to eat. That\u2019ll definitely help keep me occupied until dinner. Kelly left out the parking lot, the car tipping down lower on the left side thanks to her massive body. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Ohhhh oww, my head is killing me\u2026</i> Kelly thought to herself as she began to open her eyes to the bright sunlight outside her window. <i>Jesus, I really did a number last night.</i> Kelly thought as she began sitting up in her bed and seeing the mess all over her floor. It seemed that Kelly went on an eating spree last night, gorging herself at the movies and then the buffet. Not to mention all the ordering she did once she got home. Kelly made the mistake of drinking alcohol earlier than normal at the movie theatre, which resulted in her consuming beer, mixed drinks, and shots for the rest of night. This resulted in her taking a cab home (after some extra food stops).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellys floor was littered with garbage from her late night binge, as well as beer bottles and soda bottles. There were bags from at least 7 different restaurants, and she must have eaten at least two dishes from each place! There were boxes everywhere, and food spilled on the floor. Pastries and boxes of cookies and other sweets were on her dresser, and a carton of ice cream was sitting on the floor with a spoon in it. <i>Damn, I can\u2019t believe I kept going after those chicken wings. They were so tasty but dang I was full. </i>Kelly looked down at her body and examined the damage that was caused from last night's bender. Her nearly 400 pound body sat on the bed, causing quite an indent on her heavily abused mattress. Kelly examined her large breasts as they hung onto her hefty belly. She lifted her arms and watched as her fat hung from them, almost admiring the softness of them. Kellys neck was soon on its way to disappearing, leaving a fat double chin that was close to hiding her neck and rendering her almost recognizable to her old friends. Her fat rolls looking larger and larger every day as she ate without abandon, Kelly felt doomed to obesity at this point, and dammit she was going to enjoy it! But first, deal with the headaches. <i>Oh my god, my head is friggin killing me. I need some medicine, and definitely something to eat!</i> Kelly shifted her bulk out of bed and onto her floor, slowly moving her fat body towards her kitchen, looking forward to her bountiful breakfast to soak up all the alcohol in her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor breakfast Kelly would often eat food of many types of varieties to satisfy her many cravings, anything that was greasy, savoury or just simply delicious would do for her. Kelly was currently thinking about all the places that she'd like to go out and eat at for her breakfast, however she currently had no desire to leave the house with her pounding headache and grumbling stomach. She needed to eat, sooner rather than later. There was no time to get dressed up to go out, she needed to order from all of her favourite restaurants as soon as possible to quiet her growling gut. Kelly ordered eggs, bacon, pancakes, waffles, french toast, sausages, and an abundance of different types of meat and cheese spread out over various omelettes and sandwiches. After a bit of time, her door bell began to ring nonstop, a different delivery driver with different food each trip to the door. After a few minutes of setting up the rest of the food she hadn\u2019t already started eating. Kelly had a feast for the making in front of her face, and she was ready to devour all of it. Bring it on. She thought, smirking while taking a bite from a breakfast sandwich. Kelly was sitting on her couch in her living room, pushing down on the cushions below her due to her massive weight. She was taking up half of the couch, her wide ass squishing under the fat of her upper body. <i>My god I\u2019m taking up so much room on this couch. Pretty soon this love seat is going to be the only thing I can fit in at my own apartment.</i> Kelly slapped her fat belly rolls, watching them shake and ripple from the impact.<i> Oh well, I need something to eat! Let\u2019s get creative here! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly picked up a few sausage links with her fat fingers and put them into the middle of one of her pancakes, which she then rolled up after drenching it in maple syrup. Kelly took a large bite from her unhealthy snack, dripping the syrup down onto her jiggly and large breasts, trailing down to her fat belly button. She moaned with pleasure after each bite, stuffing the food faster and faster into her mouth with each bite. Kelly continued to stuff pancakes, waffles, french toast and bacon into her mouth, spilling food into her cleavage and staining her barely fitting bra. \"My god all this food is just\u2026 *Burp!* Oh my, it\u2019s just too good. I\u2019m such an *BELCH* an addict. I\u2019m so fat, I can\u2019t stop eating so much *BELCH* I\u2019m going to be unable to move if I don\u2019t stop soon\u2026\" Kelly said to herself while belching, chewing and moaning with pleasure with each bite, rubbing her stomach and continuing to eat more junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Kelly was left sitting on the couch surrounded by empty trays and plates from all of her favourite breakfast places. Her stomach gurgled from how full and bloated it was. Kelly was glued to her love seat for the next hour thanks to all the food that she had just inhaled, barely able to move her body an inch. <i>That was a delicious start to the day\u2026  *hic* \u2026 My head feels better, this is the friggin life. I need to rest that off before I do anything for a while. Maybe I\u2019ll just close my eyes for a second\u2026 </i>Kelly Fell asleep quickly, her large stomach rising up and down with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour passed, Kelly eventually wakes up and looks around her, spotting a large pile of dishes with food scraps and garbage littered around the room. <i>That was a great breakfast, I\u2019m still pretty full. Maybe I should watch some TV for a bit.</i> Kelly thinks, putting on her favourite channel. After a few minutes, Kelly felt the dryness of her mouth and decided she needed a drink, so with some effort, she lifted her fat body off of her couch and walked towards the refrigerator. As she opened the door she spotted soda as well as a case of beer. <i>Hmm, my head does feel better. I could go for a beer.</i> Kelly grabs two of them and closes the door, her other hand grabbing a party size bag of chips and carrying them over to the TV. After an hour or so, Kelly caught an ad on the TV for one of her favourite restaurants, Burger Valley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on down folks! We\u2019re starting our giveaways this weekend and we want you to be a part of it! For only $20.00 you can have unlimited fries, appetizers along with unlimited burgers! All you can eat! This weekend only!\u201d The TV said, showing the food in slow motion on the screen, causing Kelly to drool and caress her gut. <i>I am getting hungry again\u2026 I could be down for  some lunch. </i>Kelly lifted herself up once again and jiggled towards her bedroom to get changed, already planning out her lunch. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After getting dressed and heading out into the world, Kelly arrived at Burger Valley. The place was very busy because of the limited time promotion, making Kelly wait a few minutes for a table to open up. While Kelly sat at a booth at the front, she watched the patrons of the restaurant as they walked past her, until noticing that one of them was in fact her former co-worker, Karen Filippelli. Karen was walking with a couple other people, looking like they were on a business lunch. <i>Maybe there\u2019s a conference in town this weekend?</i> Kelly thought, wondering what they were doing in Scranton. As Karen began to walk past Kelly she saw Karen's slight belly jiggling as she walked, her love handles sitting over her tight pants. Karen's butt was a tad bigger as well, making her quite the hit with any men around. Compared to so many, Karen had barely put on any real weight. She looked hotter, thicker, and ultimately healthier, pulling off her new weight very well. Before Karen could leave, Kelly called out her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren? Karen Filippelli?\u201d Karen stopped quickly and turned around, unsure who was calling her name. \u201cOver here, it\u2019s me, Kelly Kapoor! From Dunder Mifflin!\u201d Kelly said, waving her fat, meaty arm in the air to get Karen's attention. Karen's gaze turned onto Kelly finally, and her eyes widened quickly. It was a miracle her jaw didn\u2019t physically drop from the shear surprise of seeing Kelly Kapoor 3 times the size she used to be. Karen walked over, unsure of how to approach the literal elephant in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Kelly. How\u2019s it going?\u201d Karen asked politely, trying to keep a straight face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well! About to get some mighty fine lunch, did you just get some?\u201d Kelly asked smiling, looking almost oblivious to her humongous weight gain to Karen. <i>How in the hell does someone gain so much weight so quickly? She used to be so skinny!</i> Karen thought to herself, still taking in the size of Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah actually\u2026 we did.\u201d Karen said, trying to play it cool. \u201cLast time I came down for a meeting I was told about this place and I really enjoyed it, and since there is another meeting this weekend in Scranton, I thought I\u2019d treat the staff. Show them what I was talking about\u201d Karen had an itch to eat at Burger Valley any time she was in Scranton, which was becoming more and more frequent (in secret of course). Karen was an addict like the other girls, however she didn\u2019t have the luxury of having it readily available like they did in Scranton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s neat! Why are there so many meetings here? I didn\u2019t think that we really had anything.\u201d Kelly asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but you guys have the beginning of sabres new massive fast food chain. I\u2019m here to see how they are and let the bosses know if we want one in our cafeteria. I\u2019m thinking we do, it\u2019s damn tasty.\u201d Karen said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not the healthiest stuff I suppose.\u201d Karen froze. <i>Why did I just say that? Oh she\u2019s gonna call me on it,</i> Karen feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa tell me about it, I\u2019m a blimp since trying all this new food.\u201d Kelly said with a smile, slapping her gut and laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s only a few pounds Kelly, you look great, honestly, I really couldn\u2019t even-\u201d Karen started, before Kelly interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m huge, I know it, you don\u2019t have to pretend don\u2019t worry ha ha. But I don\u2019t know if I can stop eating, I\u2019m so hooked on all of it. It\u2019s been incredibly challenging keeping myself from blowing up so much, but I can\u2019t control myself.  Will say it is definitely a fun time to just eat whatever you want, whenever you want.\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to explain, but there\u2019s a new found freedom in this. I used to be so mean, and opinionistic on unimportant topics. I think I\u2019m a better person since discovering this hobby And I\u2019m not ashamed of my body, it is what it is at this point.\u201d Karen was surprised by the answer, not really being able to understand what it\u2019d be like coming to terms with being almost 400 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good attitude to have, at least enjoy it. I like that.\u201d Karen responded. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll ask for some extra features for our cafeteria too, since I should at least enjoy it a little bit right?\u201d Karen said with a smile, causing Kelly to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely, get them a milkshake machine!\u201d Kelly said enthusiastically. As they both laughed, Karen said goodbye and told Kelly she\u2019d be in touch. Karen didn\u2019t imagine herself getting out of that situation so smoothly, pleasantly surprised by Kellys attitude. <i>Maybe I should let loose a little bit too, I just gotta be slimmer than her, which shouldn\u2019t be hard. I mean how could I really lose that much self control?</i> Kelly snickered in her head as she walked to her car. As Karen was getting out of the parking lot, it was around the time that Kelly was brought to her table, finally picking up her menu. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kelly observed the menu, she wasn\u2019t totally sure what she was going to have. <i>Hmm, that breakfast really did a number on me, but I do have room for maybe a small lunch</i>. Kelly was thinking it over as she looked at the appetizers and mains, their desserts and chicken dinners. Kelly's belly was wedged into the table, her belly roll overlapping the table and her large breasts drooping closer than ever before.<i> Maybe I\u2019ll get a couple burgers, and some chicken and poutine. Definitely something alcoholic to drink too. </i>Just as Kelly was thinking to herself and finalizing her order, her waitress appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, my name is Emily, can I start you off with a drink?\u201d The waitress said to Kelly, as she lifted her head. Unsurprisingly, Emily had put on even more weight since the last time we saw her. Emily now weighed in at 270 pounds, however she must have just upgraded her uniform because for once she wasn\u2019t bursting out of her uniform, at least for now. Emily had more distinct rolls than before, and her double chin had grown bigger as well, making her look even fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019d love a pitcher of beer please, I\u2019ll also order now if I can.\u201d Kelly said, looking excited to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you know about our \u201call you can eat\u201d deal I assume?\u201d Kelly nodded. \u201cAlrighty then, what can I get for you?\u201d Emily asked. Kelly began to list off her order and even added a couple last minute dishes as she saw the menu again. Emily wrote it down and went off to the kitchen and bar. After inhaling a quick burger and giving the cooks the order, Emily returned with a large pitcher of beer and a glass for her drink it out of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go! The food will be over as soon as it can!\u201d Emily said before heading back to the kitchen to snack on some fries. As Kelly sat with her beer she began to drink it quickly, enjoying the refreshing taste. <i>Mmm this is good, jeez I can\u2019t get enough. I\u2019m going to down this so quickly.</i> Kelly thought to herself while taking another gulp. As Kelly continued to wait, she looked around at the restaurant, noticing how full it was of patrons eating food at different amounts. The place was packed with so many different types of people. There were some skinny women to her left eating a regular sized lunch, enjoying their burgers and fries while gossiping about this and that. Then there are some chubbier women who look like they had just started putting on the noticeable weight and they hadn't changed their wardrobe to fit their new body sizes. Then there are also people who look like they are seasoned pros, much like Kelly. There were so many obese people around. People who weighed upwards of 500 pounds were in the restaurant doing the very same thing as Kelly. Eating themselves immobile. And those were just the customers. The staff was growing very rapidly. Many, if not all of the servers were looking stuffed, their clothes clinging to their tight love handles and jiggling spare tires. One staff member in particular was sitting at a table for her lunch break, eating a massive burger with a massive stack of onion rings next to her, already finished her second double stuffed hot dog. This staff member was none other than Mallory, the hostess that was friendly with Pam. Mallory was looking fat and gluttonous recently, giving in even more frequently to her cravings at work. While sitting at her table, she looked like her bra was about to burst open and release her massive and fat boobs across the table, maybe even knocking her food onto the floor if she wasn't careful. Mallory was still very much top heavy, but not for much longer if she keeps increasing her new found appetite. <i>It\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m not the only person to get so fat, and I think there are plenty of people on their way to my weight. It\u2019s only a matter of time. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of drinking and waiting, Kelly's food was officially arriving at her table. A relatively average order for Kelly, not normally having such a massive breakfast during a workday, this was all she thought she\u2019d need. Although, all the beer she was consuming was beginning to make her feel otherwise. After ordering another pitcher, Kelly began to go to town on her lunch. Devouring the burgers quickly, then eating her heavily loaded cheese fries, drinking the bottom of the bowl, making sure to get every last drop of gravy into her fat mouth. Kelly kept drinking quickly, spilling as she got more and more drunk. Ordering more burgers and fries after she finished her first order quickly. Kelly also devoured her second order, which was another round of burgers and fries, but this time she got a full tray of cheese hotdogs to go along with them, and even ordered her third pitcher by this point. Kelly began to get sloppy and sloppier, spilling food all over herself, and moaning with a high volume as she indulged her taste buds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh *hic* myyy this is just sooo\u2026 *BURP!* good, wow excu-brahhp! Excuse me!\u201d Kelly ordered dessert after one more lunch order, this time a huge chicken dinner. Kelly's belly was pushing itself onto the table more than she could ever remember. Her shirt was riding up her fat gut, which was stuffed almost to the brim yet again today. After a few more minutes, the chicken was all gone, leaving Kelly stuffed to the brim, still ready to finish her remaining dessert though. As Kelly forced the rest of her cake into her mouth, she giggled drunkenly, getting her wallet out to pay. After squaring up, Kelly slowly lifted her large body out from her spot and headed out the door, ready to sleep it off for a bit. <i>My goodness, I\u2019m so full, jesus\u2026 I need my bed, I need a cab\u2026 </i>Kelly thought, pulling out her phone to call a cab. After a couple minutes Kelly got a cab to take her home, where she immediately fell onto her bed with a loud thunk and fell asleep. Kellys fat and bloated body on the bed was quite the sight, showing her large and full belly and her large bouncing boobs. Kelly was on her way to immobility at her rate of eating, and she knew it deep down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since Jo had the buffet constructed, the impact on the waistlines of the citizens of Scranton was tremendous. People everywhere were looking fatter, a lot were more minor gains, but some were as dramatic as Kellys, if not more. As Kelly walked into the restaurant she noticed the unbuttoned pants and exposed bellies of the many customers. As Kelly took a seat at her booth she ordered the more expensive meal option where a server brings her food to her. Kelly was a fan of keeping her movement to a minimum, especially when eating. She rang off her first order with speed to her waiter, a charming slightly chubby man named \u201cAustin\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get myself a couple hot dogs, and I\u2019ll take two burgers. I\u2019ll also have a rack of lamb, and an order of ribs. Mmm yes, and this looks good too, the full chicken? I\u2019d like the whole thing yeah. I\u2019ll also take an order of the mac &amp; cheese with loads of bacon, don\u2019t forget that! I\u2019ll also grab a full order of mashed potatoes and gravy, and top it off with some cheese and bacon too while you\u2019re at it!\u201d Kelly kept calling out more and more food, as the waiter smiled and continued writing her order quickly, he had to flip pages a few times due to the size of her order, but he got all of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that everything ma\u2019am?\u201d Austin asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll also grab a pitcher of your lager! And I\u2019ll likely order more don\u2019t you worry sweetie.\u201d Kelly said with a flirtatious smile, misreading Austins politeness as flirting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got it!\u201d Austin said before turning and walking away, hoping for a big tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pitcher of beer quickly made it to Kelly, which she began to drink quickly, enjoying her current buzz. <i>I\u2019m going to be really drunk by the time the food gets here.</i> Kelly giggled out loud at the thought. As Kelly finished her first pint she exhaled deeply, then began to grab the Pitcher to refill her glass. While finishing her pour, she spotted a pair of familiar faces from across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly and Micheal were currently out and eating dinner across the restaurant. <i>Oh no, I don\u2019t want them to see me, it might be weird.</i> Kelly thought, also considering how drunk she currently felt. Kelly sat herself in her booth in a way that she could hide her face from them in case they looked over at her. Kelly watched as she watched Holly and Micheal pig out in front of her. Micheal looked full and bloated, his pants open and his gut exposed. However, the real sight to see was Holly with her own belly sticking out, and her cleavage open and food stained. Holly looked like an absolute glutton just by the way she was eating her meal. She was currently tearing through a full pizza but she still had plates of other foods in front of her just waiting to be eaten. Holly looked to be in a trance, and looked even to be drunk as well now that Kelly had spotted her own pint in front of her. <i>She\u2019s going to be bigger than me in no time, I can\u2019t believe she joined in so quickly. </i>Kelly thought as she looked at the large and in charge HR rep. <i>They are cute though, they really love each other. </i>Kelly thought looking at the way they looked at each other from across the table. Holly was 170 pounds now, but she is eating at a rate that will put her past 200 in very short time, especially with Michael's encouragement. As Kelly looked closer she noticed a shimmer on Hollys finger, not one that she had seen before. <i>Wow that looks new\u2026 wait that\u2019s a huge ring! Did he propose! </i>Kelly thought, beginning to get excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact earlier in the day Micheal did propose to her, and she did say yes. They were eating to celebrate their engagement. Just as Kelly watched Holly stuff the last piece of pizza into her mouth and pick up a large slice of cake, her own food had finally arrived on it\u2019s trolley. <i>Oh finally! I\u2019m so hungry!</i> Almost immediately she began to dig into her food, grabbing as much as she could to satisfy her fat belly. First she inhaled the burgers, stuffing them down quickly. After she began to shovel her mashed potatoes in her mouth, drinking from a bowl of gravy. Kelly began to cram the chicken into her mouth almost immediately after finishing her potatoes, looking like she was barely fitting in time to actually breathe. Kelly then shovelled mac and cheese into her mouth, spilling it all over her mouth and breasts. Austin returned while Kelly was halfway through her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is everything?\u201d He asked with a smile, desensitized to witnessing such gluttony at his job. Kellys mouth was full and she quickly grabbed her pitcher and chugged the rest of her beer right in front of Austin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*BRAHHPP!!* Phew excuse me! This is great, I\u2019d like to *hic* order more though please! *BURRP* And another Pitcher as well!\u201d Austin smiled while pulling out his notepad and waiting for her to list off her seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u201dll take a steak, medium rare! I\u2019ll also take an extra large poutine with bacon, extra curds and gravy! I\u2019d like a burrito, stuff that sucker full too please! I\u2019d like some roast, and a pizza too! And I\u2019ll have a whole chocolate cake for dessert! And a lot of ice cream when I\u2019m closer to being done! Thank you!\u201d Kelly said, before continuing to eat her food. Over the rest of the night Kelly kept eating more and more food, finishing her second order and even trying for a third before being told they were closing. Kelly was drunk and full beyond belief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize that we couldn\u2019t continue to serve you, ma\u2019am.\u201d Austin said while helping her out of her booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cou-could always *hic!* come\u2026 home with *hic* me! Ha ha ha, I still *hic* n\u2026 need more serving *belch*.\u201d Kelly said flirtatiously, rubbing her finger down Austins shirt. Austin had to admit she was fun, and he doesn\u2019t get a lot of opportunities to actually sleep with a customer, even if she was humongous. \u201cI\u2019ll make it *hic* worth your\u2026 while. *Braahp!*\u201d She added, suggesting more than just dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not, I don\u2019t mind some overtime\u2026\u201d Austin said seductively, continuing to help Kelly out of the door but holding her fat arm and back with more interest now than before. \u201cI\u2019ll be five minutes, I can drive you home if you wait over there by my car.\u201d Austin said, pointing at his car. Kelly nodded and waddled her bloated body towards his car. Shortly after Austin returned and helped her into the car and then drove off to her house. On the way home Austin stopped at numerous fast food places, getting all of her favourites. Once home Austin helped her load in the food, placing it in her bedroom. The two of them began to touch each other, but Kelly eventually grabbed a burger and began to stuff it into her belly. She continued to eat more and more with Austins help, the two taking their time to undress. They continued to eat and kiss and touch throughout the night, until Kelly was fat and tired from all of her activity. That was so good, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve still got it at this size. Kelly thought to herself, feeling the confidence boost. I must really still be sexy, even at my weight. Eventually Kelly fell asleep, enjoying the thought of people finding her body attractive and dreaming about eating food and having sex with hot men.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following Monday at work, it was announced that Micheal and Holly were engaged, thrilling all of the staff that Micheal managed to finally find love. However, all of the joy was cut quickly a couple weeks later when they dropped the bombshell news that they were moving away to Boulder, Colorado to help Holly's family. The staff were shocked, not having Micheal as their manager was going to be weird, and quite sad too. The staff had a party for him and treated him to a grand dinner party where everyone partook in a stuffing session. Before Micheal left, he was set to be replaced by a man known as Deangelo Vickers. The staff were a little weary of him, but he seemed like a goofball just like Micheal, maybe that was a good thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course quickly it was discovered Deangelo was a nightmare of a boss, and had left everyone worried about the future of their employment. The stress over this time left most people eating out of anxiety rather than just pleasure. What if we lose our jobs? He\u2019s a terrible businessman! People would think, watching his antics and stupid games play out throughout the day. Deangelo was also a successful weight loss story, which meant his desires to overindulge on the fatty foods were strong and nearly impossible to ignore in Scranton. Deangelo quickly gorged himself on foods, looking like he would be the next fattest member in the office at his rate of consumption. However, it didn\u2019t last very long. After a seemingly friendly game of hoops in the warehouse, Deangelo went to attempt a challenging dunk, however, Deangelo messed up on his shot, especially with his new and heavier frame, resulting in him falling and hitting his head. Because of that, Deangelo suffered severe brain damage and was out indefinitely for his brain injury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeangelos leave of absence was unforeseen by Jo, making her upset about having to hire another replacement, especially since all Jo was concerned with now was Future Foods and it\u2019s success. Jo decided to leave it up to the staff, most of which enjoyed the search committee because of their ability to eat non stop. Eventually they were left to choose an unusual man named Robert California. Upon entering Dunder Mifflin on his first day of work he quickly looked around, looked blankly and walked immediately out of the building. The search committee weren\u2019t overly thrilled by this, having just wasted their efforts, however it turned out that Robert drove straight to the headquarters in Tallahassee and had an impromptu chat with Jo. Somehow Robert actually managed to talk Jo out of her position as Sabre CEO and appoint him to the role instead. The staff at Dunder Mifflin were shocked that he managed to do that, especially with Jo. Jo did stay on as owner of the company though, and she still ran Future Foods herself, that was what she wanted to do instead anyways. She didn\u2019t seem to care about printers and paper as much anymore. All of this left Robert to make a choice of who to replace him as regional manager, and he chose none other than Andrew Bernard, A.K.A the \u201cNard Dog\u201d. Once Andy was finally up and running as manager, things actually started to get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that brings us to now, 8 months since Andy has taken the role of manager, and things have changed a little bit. It was mid September, the weather was beginning to cool down and the leaves were changing colours. Scranton was beautiful this time of year, and was particularly Pams favourite time of year. Pam was currently looking through the window at her work, wishing she was outside so she could smell the leaves and paint some scenes. Instead Pam was working with Paper, like usual. She was not as happy as she would like to be, wishing she had a better job is a usual frustration for Pam, but now she had a new thing to upset her. Pam was officially resisting the addicting food from the cafeteria, in fact she had been doing it successfully for a couple months straight now, but that didn\u2019t mean she liked it. With all of the stress in the springtime, and worries about the new work environment, Pam hadn\u2019t stopped ballooning in weight. One day in March she had stepped on her scale and read the dreaded words she never wanted to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cError\u201d. This meant that Pam officially weighed more than her scales weight limit of 300 pounds, which revolted her to no end. When Pam told her Mother, Helene checked her own weight and discovered the horrifyingly high number of 220 pounds. Both women couldn\u2019t believe they had grown so large, and vowed to help each other drop the pounds. And so, since March both women have been working hard on resisting the temptation of the foods they once enjoyed, drank far less frequently and began working out more regularly. All of these tactics were successful and left the women on the right track for losing weight. As of this fall morning, Pam weighed herself and discovered that she now weighed 250 pounds, putting her on the right track to her once thin and sexy body. Helene had a slower weight loss story, likely due to the challenges of losing weight at her age, but she was definitely shedding the pounds now that she weighed 196 pounds, officially getting under the big 200 and becoming more and more excited to be her old skinny self again soon. Jim however, was less excited with these results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim would watch his wife struggle with her appetite, reminding her that he \u201cloved her at any size\u201d, reminding her she could \u201calways take a cheat day\u201d, noticing that she seemed very tense because of her diet. Jim does love Pam no matter what, but since seeing her at her larger size Jim has made some major self discoveries. Before the recent changes, Jim had no idea of his desire for fatter women, but now as he watches his wife slim back down, he wishes more than anything on the inside that she\u2019d quit trying to lose the weight and maybe even gain more. But Jim knew he couldn\u2019t force her to do that, it would be dishonest. He tried his best to sway her mind, but in the end she deserves whatever she wants. So for now, Jim decides not to intervene, besides maybe she\u2019d fail soon enough and gain it all back. There\u2019s always room for hope.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Office, Pam was currently walking around the office trying to stretch her legs. She had a regular habit of doing this whenever food was being delivered to someone in the office. Pam found it hard to concentrate smelling the food at her desk so she liked to walk away briefly, as to not fall for the tempting heavenly smells. Currently, Pam was walking around the office and decided she should pop in to say hi to Kelly briefly. On her way into the Annex she reminded herself to stay strong. We\u2019ve got this Pam, don\u2019t let her convince you. She said to herself sternly in her head, trying to keep her will power up before entering Kelly's food dungeon. As she opened the door the various smells wafted over her, causing her belly to rumble. You can do this Pam, you\u2019ve got the strength of an ox dammit. She reminded herself, keeping her hope up and her confidence high as she turned the corner towards Kelly\u2019s cubicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kelly, how are you doing?\u201d Pam said while facing Kelly's back, causing her to turn around smiling at her thinner co-worker. Over the past 8 months, Kelly has continued to eat relentlessly, focusing her spare time on it on the weekends and most definitely doing less at work because of her various snack breaks. Kelly had put on 60 pounds, making her one of the largest in the office at  433 pounds. Kelly was huge, bursting from her too small suit jacket and pants, the seams splitting in various spots and squishing her robust blubber around. Her dress shirt was straining, especially around her breasts, looking close to bursting a button and showing off more cleavage. Kellys face was fat and thick, smeared in grease and sauces from whatever she was eating last. Her neck fat was even thicker, losing more and more of the features that once defined the beautiful indian woman. Kelly's legs were thick like tree trunks, and even though Pam couldn\u2019t currently see her ass, it was a massive sight to watch sway across the office floor. Kellys large double belly sagged out from the bottom of her shirt and out over her beltline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there Pam! It\u2019s so good to see you! Doughnut!?\u201d Kelly asked quickly, reaching for a full box next to her in her piles of food containers and plates. It was already past lunch and Kelly was doing quite a number today. </span></div></div>",

As Kelly reached for a doughnut from her box, her pudgy fingers moved around the box looking for a particular flavour. One she found it, she grabbed the pastry and lifted it up and towards her mouth, her arms looked like they were flexing because of how much fat was filling her suit jacket sleeves. They looked so tight they looked close to splitting right off her. Pam could never understand why Kelly played so close to the line about her wardrobe, but maybe she just never shopped anymore because she\u2019d rather just eat food at her house. \u201cSo what brings you by?\u201d Kelly asked Pam, who was standing awkwardly, trying her best to not look at the tasty snack in Kellys hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh not much, just one of my walks, thought I\u2019d see what you were up to.\u201d Pam said nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell not much now, but if you came a few minutes ago you would've heard the steamy call I made with one of my boy toys, he\u2019s gonna pick me up from work today and treat me to supper.

So pretty and nice!\u201d Pam said while Kelly finished the rest of the doughnut. Although, Pam didn\u2019t understand how she got so many guys. They were clearly into her large body, but Kelly didn\u2019t always act like she knew that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know, but thank you. I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m irresistible no matter how thick I get!\u201d Kelly said, going for another doughnut, her chair screaming under her weight. \u201cI\u2019ve got a handful of boys at my disposal, I\u2019m their queen, some even call me their goddess! And I feel like I really am!\u201d Kelly shoved a whole doughnut into her mouth, smearing sugar all over her lips. \u201cI never got this attention when I was skinny, I\u2019m much more desirable as a thick and juicy woman, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to keep it!\u201d Kelly said, shoving the second doughnut into her mouth violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy goodness, she\u2019s huge. There\u2019s no way I can eat that much again, I\u2019ll end up hopeless like her. Pam thought to herself as she watched her co-worker inhale the sugary snacks. Over the next few minutes the women talked about various other gossip, Kelly continuing to inhale snacks while Pam watched jealousy. Eventually Pam knew she had to get back to work, and so off she went out of the annex, leaving Kelly alone with her food yet again. Pam liked to visit Kelly because of their friendship, sure, but she also used Kelly as a reminder as to why she was dieting, telling herself that she\u2019ll end up like a bloated cow if she ate the way she was last year. On Pams way out towards the office she went through the break room and spotted another co-worker of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela was currently deeply headfirst into the fridge, most likely looking deep for a drink or some of her leftovers. Angelas butt was sticking out of the fridge and into the air for any curious onlookers to gawk at with confidence that she wouldn't catch them. Pam never would\u2019ve imagined seeing the miserable Angela Martin. The once petite woman had been hiding her snacking from her co-workers, however they all knew what she was doing, her waistline was all the proof they needed. She had grown wider in the past few months, nothing as drastic as Kelly, but nonetheless she had grown noticeably larger. Now weighing 180 pounds, Angela showed a lot of her curves thanks to being so short. Her butt for example, was larger and jigglier than it ever was before. Pam noticed as Angela was bent over that she could see her belly hanging along with her larger breasts, her sides squishing over her pants. As Angela lifted her from the fridge she was bringing out a slice of cake. Angela noticed Pam and shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! I didn\u2019t even hear you, jeez!\u201d Angela said scared, keeping the slice of cake low, hoping Pam didn\u2019t see it. Angela looked thick, showing her fat easily through her sweater. Angela moved into chubby territory and is pretty close to being officially fat. Her face looked rounder, her whole frame is puffier and fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Angela, I was just walking back to my desk. What are you up to?\u201d Pam asked while hiding a smirk, curious as to what Angela\u2019s lie was going to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just grabbing water nosey Nancy. Don\u2019t worry about what I\u2019m doing, shouldn\u2019t you be at your desk?\u201d Angela said, trying to change the subject. Pam giggled and began to walk out of the breakroom, leaving Angela alone to inhale her slice of cake. Angela wasn\u2019t a very big fan of her new body, although that clearly wasn't enough to convince her to stop pigging out, as she was finding it harder and harder to resist the delicious cafeteria food. Angela would go to the buffet and order take out frequently, trying to remain hidden from her co-workers. The last thing Angela wanted was to look as weak willed as them. Something she reminded herself every day looking at Meredith and Phyllis jiggle and grow from her desk.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Angela almost has a constant view on Meredith, Erin, Pam and Phyllis thanks to her corner space with Oscar. Angela would often stand up and watch her co-workers waste company time eating. Of course, she couldn't really complain too much since she often eats instead of work, she\u2019s just different because she eats in secret. After all, it's not stealing if you don't get caught, right? Anyhow, after Angela was finished eating her slice of cake (stuffing it down quickly so no one got suspicious of why she was gone in the bathroom for so long) she washed the chocolate off of her face and returned to her desk, rubbing her chubby belly after inhaling the delicious dessert. On her way to her desk she spotted Meredith Palmer eating a footlong sub sandwich. Meredith was a sight to see, gaining 70 pounds in the past 8 months had changed the way she looked completely. Her now 346 pound body was bloated and expansive, bursting clothing nearly every day. Meredith was enjoying food on a different level than Kelly was. Meredith had found sexual interest in eating as much as she did, getting turned on by stuffing her belly, or popping buttons, or acting like a pig in public. She spent a lot of her time eating and masterbating at home, enjoying the new pleasures that came with food, the fullness in her belly, and the pounds that all of it added to her figure. Her flabby body looked highly inappropriate in her outfit, the way her fat belly was oozing out of her dress shirt, her bottom 3 buttons undone and unable to fit. Meredith's breasts were practically bursting out of the top of her shirt, showing off her massive cleavage to the world. Meredith's double chin and pudgy cheeks changed the way her face looked, making her almost unrecognizable now besides her bright red hair and obvious obnoxious behaviors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith wasn\u2019t only bursting out of her clothes either, she was also staining them with all of her sloppy various meals. Meredith looked like a pig, and was by far the messiest eater in the office. Meredith was a slob, and over the past few months she\u2019s only dived deeper and deeper into that type of lifestyle. Meredith's desk is a mess, littered with garbage and other wrappers. Her breasts have crumbs of her sandwich on them, although if you look closely you'll see remains of other meals from earlier littered in her bosom. Meredith continued to inhale her sub, seeing Angela with a look of disgust on her face. Meredith was turned on by this though, enjoying the shame of her eating habits. Meredith was starting to lose control of her gluttony and greed, not only eating without restraint but also drinking on the job. Meredith's drinking was back, and now she was becoming a little too loose for her work environment. She would reveal her body often, and flirt with anyone who would bite. Angela had finally had it, she had to say something to Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh now, come on Angela, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Andy said to Angela, who was standing overlooking Andy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the rate that she is gorging herself, she's going to be naked by the end of the day, she barely even fits in her own clothes! Look at her.\u201d Angela responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on an employees weight gain, Angela, that\u2019s highly inappropriate and not to mention unethical. She just needs to go shopping soon, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Andy responded cooly, hoping Angela would leave soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrew. Bernard. No. You cannot let her dress like that here. This is a professional environment, I will not leave here until you do something about it. Do you want me to call corporate again?\" Angela said sternly in Andy's office, as he was sitting down and looking up at her. Andy got up from out of his chair and walked over to the window of his office, looking out towards Meredith who was at her desk, stuffing back the final bites of her sandwich. Angela didn\u2019t know, but Andy was secretly a feeder, much like Jim. Meredith's display of gluttony was a huge turn on for him, thus why he was so lenient with the dress code for everyone. She\u2019s probably right, I should say something, even if it\u2019s really hot. Andy thought to himself, walking out the door with Angela snickering behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeredith, hey there, hiya. It\u2019s been brought to my attention that your work attire is a little bit too inappropriate for us here. I\u2019m going to need you to get some clean and new clothes, and clean off your desk too please and thank you.\u201d Andy said, hoping his cool and sly conversation would ease over the awkwardness he was feeling trying not to get a boner looking at the half naked blubbery whale in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re not a fan of all of this woman, eh?\u201d Meredith responded, slurring her words slightly as she talked. \u201cI see the way you look at me.\u201d She responded with a cheeky smile, gripping her fat and stuffed belly causing Andy to blush, hoping no one heard what she said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep it between you and me don\u2019t worry\u2026\u201d Meredith whispered in his ear. Andy wasn\u2019t sure how to treat this, feeling insecure and afraid of her giving him away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell um\u2026 yeah okay so you\u2019ll be um, more appropriately dressed tomorrow, t-thanks M-Meredith!\u201d Andy said, quickly turning around and walking to his office, trying to hide his boner from the staff as they watched him hurry and shut his door. Meredith just smiled, loving the power she had over Andy, now having absolute confirmation on whether or not he\u2019s a feeder. I\u2019m watching you, Andy. I think there\u2019s some fun to be had there\u2026 Meredith thought to herself before grabbing a muffin and taking a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Angela despised Meredith, she wasn\u2019t crazy about Phyllis and the way she spent all of her time eating as well. Phyllis spent her entire day snacking, binging and feasting away at all the food she could eat. There was rarely a moment spent without food in her hands. As Andy walked back into his office, Phyllis watched while still taking bites from a whole pan of lasagna, moaning with each bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow the cheese on this is just so good!\u201d Phyllis said, chewing quickly and devouring the large dish without any effort. While Kelly and Meredith had grown fat, no one would could compete with Phyllis. Even before 8 months ago Phyllis was an eating machine, enjoying the food as well as her new fatter sex with Bob that had spiced things up in the bedroom like you couldn't believe. Phyllis began to overeat more at home than at work, enjoying her husband's enthusiasm about her fuller frame. Now weighing in at 532 pounds, Phyllis was a massive woman. Even before Phyllis was heavier, but since her new passion for food she expanded quicker than anyone else in the office, which is truly saying something. Phyllis looked huge, her face thick with fat, her neck fully transitioned into one big fat wall. Her large breasts hang over her huge fat belly which itself is hanging closer and closer to the floor everyday. Everything about Phyllis was huge, and it wasn\u2019t a surprise she was so large since she almost never stopped eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhyllis\u2019s life had changed now that she was so large. For starters, she is starting to shift her body a certain way to get through some of the doors, a fact that sounded like an expensive fix to Andy that he hadn't considered about the office. He was also worried about the elevator though, and the fact that people have to be aware of who is in the elevator. Phyllis can\u2019t take many other people with her without strain on the machine. It was hard to believe but Phyllis was actually eating herself to the building's physical limitations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhyllis had been considering the idea of moving home to work, but she wanted to see if Andy was going to offer her a sweeter deal first. Currently Phyllis is going home early, Bob is driving since Phyllis is actually too fat to operate her own car now. As Phyllis finally gets down to the parking lot, she sees Bob's truck waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey babe!\u201d Bob says getting out of the truck to help Phyllis get in. Bob is much thinner than before. It turns out having a fat hog of a wife requires a lot more physical activity than expected. Bob thoroughly enjoyed taking care of Phyllis, treating her with love and respect and feeding her any food she asked for. After a struggle of her getting into the car, Bob drove to plenty of fast food places on the way home, just like usual. Phyllis continued to stuff herself silly, fattening herself up without any intention of slowing down. Especially when hot sex with Bob is on the line.  I can\u2019t wait until we\u2019re home\u2026 Phyllis thought, looking her husband over and licking her lips. Maybe I should retire soon, I\u2019d always be home\u2026 endless food and pampering\u2026 god that sounds amazing...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Phyllis left the parking lot with Bob, Andy watched from his window as she struggled getting into the car. My God that woman has grown out of control, she's a liability to the company if I don't do something about it soon\u2026 but it's so hot with her around. Andy had always enjoyed Phyllis's size, but he wasn't one to fantasize about her too much, she wasn't exactly his type. No, Phyllis was too boring for him, he only really enjoys her now because of her gluttonous behavior and disregard for her obese body. Andy's type was more playful and fun, someone who matched him. At one point he thought it was Angela, but upon discovering her cheating on him with Dwight, Andy broke up with her and moved on. Wondering if he'd ever find love again, Andy worked at Dunder Mifflin with sadness and pent up rage, feeling like the world was working against him. Now Andy was on top of the world. He was the manager, and he was using his power to his benefit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Andy became manager Dwight quit the company, finally giving up on paper and turning to beat farming. Sales only had Phyllis, Pam and Jim now which Andy needed to fix soon. He needed to hire someone else to replace Dwight, even though the current sales team was happy making much more money by dividing up Stanley, Andy, and Dwight's old accounts. Andy was close to picking his new salesman soon, he just needed more time, something Robert was tired of giving him. Andy hosted a lot of parties since taking charge, keeping morale up with food incentives and extra time off. Despite how much the ladies ate, they still managed to get a lot of work done. The Scranton branch was still one of the most successful even with all of the changes over the last year. Had Jo seen what he was doing, Andy likes to think she'd be proud of him. After watching Phyllis head home, Andy walked out of his office to check on his wonderful girlfriend, Erin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy and Erin had been flirting on and off for a few months, but once Andy became manager he really went for it and asked Erin out. Since then, the two have been together nonstop, enjoying each other's company before, during, and after work. Erin had become very attracted to Andy's new power, success and confidence, making him appear like the most ideal man she had ever had like her. Andy loved Erin's appetite, gifting her treats and snacks frequently, enjoying the view of his expanding girlfriend. He never would\u2019ve imagined being in his current position. I\u2019m going to live out one of my all time dreams\u2026 He\u2019d think to himself as he\u2019d watch his staff eat themselves fatter and fatter every day. Although Erin was growing, and Andy was definitely responsible for a lot of her recent gain, she wasn't as big as most of the others. Erin already had the advantage of youth and a strong metabolism, not to mention she was very skinny to start off with. Erin didn't put on weight nearly as fast as her co-workers, which she was secretly proud of in her own head. The other thing that kept Erin slim was her time fetching food for her friends, even though she wasn't doing that very often anymore. All of the exercise counteracted a lot of the food she was consuming, keeping her gain minimal and smaller than the rest of the office. No denying with her reduced physical activity, Erin was very much still gaining weight and no longer considered skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Andy approached her desk he took an in depth look at his fat girlfriend. Erin was sitting in her chair currently, focused on a task on her desk with her face down. Erin was looking especially plump in her chair. Her larger butt was filling it out more and more each day, getting closer and closer to eventually getting stuck in it, something Andy was looking forward to seeing (hopefully soon). Erin's legs were meatier than before, thick on her thighs specifically, putting a good portion of her weight in her lower half. Her belly was doughy and soft, and in her current dress shirt it was starting to strain her new t-shirt. As she sat her belly flopped onto her lap slightly, working its way to a real gut soon enough. Erin's breasts had grown exponentially since her gain, resting heavily in her tight bra. The most strain on her shirt was actually the upper half because of her massive boobs, rather than her flabbier belly. Erin's arms were very meaty and thick, folding skin around her elbows slightly and jiggling with very little movement needed. Andy enjoyed looking at Erin, her thicker body is a massive turn on for him. Once Andy finally made it to the desk he sang a song to get Erin's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eriiin, I brought youuu some pastries~!!\" Andy sang, laughing at the end while holding up a large box of doughnuts, cakes, danishes and other delicious treats. Erin's head perked up with a smile, jiggling her slight double chin and stretching out her chubbier cheeks with her grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you so much baby! I was just starting to get hungry again!\" Erin said, grabbing the box and eagerly opening it. Andy loved watching her enthusiasm. She wasn't aware of how sexually motivated he was by the weight gain, but she knew that he definitely liked it. That meant Erin liked it too, but she had no idea how much fatter he wanted her to get. Erins gain was increasing quickly ever since she stopped moving around so much. Ever since the servers were hired to deliver food from the cafeteria to the office, Erin had been forced to remain at her desk, stationery and in Andy's sight. He delivered treats frequently, making sure she was happy and comfy at every point of the day. Erin loved the pampering from Andy, and enjoyed her perks with her boyfriend running the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So babe, I was thinking of some dinner plans after work. How does the buffet sound tonight? I'll buy?\" Andy said with enthusiasm. Erin smiled with a mouthful of doughnut, nodding her head as a yes. \"Awesome! I'll drop you off at your place and I'll pick you up at 5?\" Andy asked. Erin swallowed the rest of her bite ready to respond this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great! I'm excited for some Mexican food tonight! Some burritos and tacos! Oh boy I can't wait!\" Erin started saying out loud, giving Andy a slight boner. But before Andy can respond, he hears Meredith make a joke behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My oh my you two are my kind of party, if you ever want a third just let me-\" she began before Andy quickly stopped her there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meredith cut it out. That's highly inappropriate for the workplace. What I told you today was true, you need to dress more appropriately.\" Andy said sternly, hoping to get through to her this time. Meredith looked at him with a smug grin, grabs her belly and shakes it in front of both Erin and Andy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I'll stop it from now on. But just so you know, you really helped me out on a video I was shooting. I needed you to get mad, so I just pissed off Angela enough she'd tell you to intervene.\" Meredith said. Andy looked confused, unsure of what she was talking about. \"I'm shooting videos of me eating, and someone requested me to eat in the office and get my boss mad at me. If I did it they'd pay me a bunch of money, which I'm now going to collect at home.\" Meredith looked proud, Andy didn't even consider Meredith smart enough for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making videos? Like\u2026 fetish videos?\" Andy asked, trying to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I'm what you call a BBW model, working my way up. I've discovered a joy in eating, a freedom in my gluttony. It's just\u2026 such a turn on to keep eating food, knowing what it's doing to my body.\" Meredith said slapping her belly for emphasis. Erin looked flabbergasted, while Andy pretended to not be extremely aroused. \"I eat food on camera and more. I make really good money, I'm only starting too, I see a lot more on its way. All I gotta do is grow and eat, how lucky am I?\" Meredith laughed. Andy thought about it for a moment before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Meredith, whatever you do on your own time is up to you, but no more doing it at work okay? I don't want you to get fired for that.\" Andy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, I'll keep it at home. But I'm serious, if you two are ever interested-\" Meredith started, before they both told her to stop. \"Whatever, more for me.\" She laughed, walking out the door. Andy couldn't believe what just happened. My life is becoming more and more like a dream. He thought to himself. Nothing can go wrong, my life is only getting better\u2026 Just then Robert California walked into the office and approached Andy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy, just the man I wanted to see!\" He said cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert, what brings you in today?\" Andy said, feeling like he is in cloud nine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I talk with you in your office?\" Robert said, gesturing towards the office. They both walked in while Robert closed the door behind him. Andy stood behind his desk and waited for Robert to start talking. \"Andy I like to be blunt, so I'll get right to it. I'm having you demoted from your position as manager immediately. I'm having you moved back to sales to fill that empty spot.\" Robert said, Andy's smile washed away from hearing this. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
