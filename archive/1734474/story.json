Space was big, very big, and very dark. The ships had been traveling for a while to their destination - long enough for the Young Wanderers to travel between the packs on the different ships, meet up with the Stayers, perhaps mate with them, and decide to either Stay with that pack or Wander to another pack, where they would again mate with the Stayers, and either stay, or Wander again, until eventually, some of the first ship Wanderers had wandered back to their original ships, and had Wandered to all of the ten major packs, perhaps with a mate that had traveled with them, and had offspring with them as well. The Packs had tried to keep their Traditions alive, at least in the case of the Wanderers - it kept the packs from inbreeding at any rate, and it fostered friendship between the different packs. Of course, with the technology the ships had, this practice wasn't necessary, as the females could look through the genetic banks to pick the perfect male to father their offspring, but there was something about physical interaction that made things better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader looked at the information he had. The destination reminded him of home, a home that was no longer there. He missed the forests, the fields, the hunting, and more. He looked at the the information on the native lifeforms. The information indicated that most of the animals, as well as the plants, were edible. There was one animal that caught his attention: it was bipedal, nearly furless, had no claws to speak off, and yet seemed to be in almost every environment on the planet. This seemed to be due to the species' use of tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem fairly primitive compared to us,\" his mate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader looked at his mate. \"I'm sure the Abductors thought the same about us. We hunted, foraged, fished, and farmed. Then they abducted us. We're still around, and they are dead, at least on these ships at any rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if there is more?\" his mate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not,\" Supreme Pack Leader said. \"We've already lost one home to them. We're not going to lose our new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want our next litter to feel soil beneath their paws, and feel the wind in their noses,\" his mate said. \"Not these metal floors and ventilation fans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader smiled, as he held his mate, feeling the life growing in her. \"I wish to see them hunt in the tall grasses as I once did, swim in ponds, and streams, and lakes and rivers, as I once did. I wish for stories about traveling through space to be just that - stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that too,\" his mate said. She looked at the information again. \"What do we do with the native species, specifically, this one that can use tools?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one requires special consideration,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"The others we can eat, although some management might be required as to not hunt them into extinction. This particular specie, as you can see, seems to be sentient. We might be able to negotiate with them, and thus we can settle in areas they do not yet inhabit. They might prove to be useful as allies. Thus, we will hope for our initial encounters to be peaceful, which might be possible, as there seems to be a number of packs, and most seem to get along with the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they are not friendly towards us?\" his mate asked. \"What if they attack us?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We'll assume that any initial attacks done towards our First Contacters were due to miscommunication, and/or fear responses,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"We'll try talking to them peacefully again, stating that we mean them no harm, but that we will fight if we have to. If they understand this, and do not harm us again, we might be able to work something out. If they keep trying to attack us, we'll do what's necessary. Hopefully we won't have to kill too many of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I did my fair share of killing,\" his mate said. \"We all did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Abductors got what they deserved for what they did to us,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"My regret is that I won't get another chance to taste another one: I liked feeling their leader squirm inside of me as he died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mate rubbed his belly. \"A fitting fate, given that they gave us our new abilities, that being one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader chuckled. \"Wouldn't mind feeling that sort of feeling again, although I think I'd let the prey out this time, depending on the situation of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mate chuckled again. \"Yes. Then <i>I'd</i> be able to try them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"Now for the probes to be sent out, and do some further investigations. I want to see <i>just</i> how advanced these creatures are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Time the Invasion was during</span></div></div>",

Send a probe over to one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, one of the Engineers spoke up. \"It's a device for transmitting and receiving information, like our probes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader's ears perked up at this. \"Can we receive information from this device?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a few itches,\" the Engineer said, pressing some buttons. \"We're receiving. Lots of information. Pack Leaders. Pack alliances. Some Pack warfare. There's a lot here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a few more probes check these things out, while the rest check the planet out,\" said Supreme Pack Leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader sat back, and looked at the information. After a while, he found himself being able to understand the words. There was also talking images - those he soon also began to understand after a while. He was also surprised at the amount of space dedicated to what looked like fiction, or at least it looked like fiction, as there wasn't any other references to the events recorded, save by those who had written the information. One thing that really surprised him was things known as <i>fetishes</i>, which included a number of various sexual fantasies. Some of these fantasies involved something called <i>vore</i>, that is, either eating someone or something, or being eaten by someone or something, for sexual pleasure. In some of these scenarios, this inevitably proved fatal to whomever it was that got eat, but in others, the prey was safe through the whole thing, and was later let out, one way, or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's interesting,\" his mate said. \"We might be able to use our abilities to have some fun after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader chuckled. \"Let's hold off on that for a bit - don't want to give them the wrong impression of us.\" He looked at the Chief Engineer. \"Technology status?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as advanced as the Abductors, and we would enjoy a one-to-one ratio, in terms of weapon superiority,\" said Chief Engineer. \"Even ten-to-one we'd be doing good. Problem is, while we might be able to dominate a number of the smaller Packs, they seem to be allied to each other, which would not be good if they decided to fight us at the same time, especially if the Packs of the United States of America, Russia, China, and possibly India, also decided to fight as well. Basically, in the short term, we would win, but in the long term, they can repair, or replace, their damaged craft, while we might have issues. Also, once the odds get to fifteen-to-one, we might start losing craft. On the ground is a similar story - short term success, but long term failure. They can replace ammo and weapons, but we can't, and that's despite our technological advantage. As for unarmed fighting, it would take at least a hundred of them to best an Assault type, but in total, they outnumber us seven thousand to one, and it's not like everyone is an Assault type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, our best bets are to either fight a very quick war, and hope they don't provoke us further, or just arrive peacefully,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"Makes me glad we already plan to try the peaceful approach; scout teams of ten - four Basic Infantry, three Recon, two Assault, and one Infiltrator, who has the Designation of Ambassador, while the others act as guards. Give the orders to send the teams. I want to be on the ground, preferably before I'm a father again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others grinned at this, each having similar thoughts, as orders to the teams were dispatched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to wait,\" said Supreme Pack Leader.</span></div></div>",

In fact, these extremists are convinced that they are fighting a Holy War, but everyone else believes them to be insane, among other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are we here?\" the young Assault type asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The United States of America Pack has their battle-hardened fighters in this region,\" said Ambassador. \"If we can talk to their Chief Fighter, we might be able to get them to talk to other Chief Fighters, so that our other scouting parties are not attacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they attack us by accident?\" the young Assault type asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we disable their vehicles and disarm them,\" said the Ambassador. \"That's Supreme Pack Leader's Standing Order. We are not to kill any of these humans, if we can help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what if they try to kill us?\" the young Assault type asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we get out of here, and let the rest of the Pack know,\" said the Ambassador.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it's these Extremists that we end up meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, we capture them, and take them to the United States of America Pack's nearby den,\" said Ambassador. \"That sends two messages: that we'd like to be friends, and that we don't want to be enemies.

He had a thin strip of fur under his nose. Supreme Pack Leader had a bad feeling about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then listened to another Pack Leader, who had a thicker strip of fur under his nose, who stated that by fighting for the \"Motherland\", the \"Russians\" would be able to kill the \"German invaders\". Supreme Pack Leader had a bad feeling about him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened to a third Pack Leader. He sat in a chair, and spoke calmly, saying that he and the \"American People\" would help their allies overseas, in material, weapons, and \"men\", and that they would stop the \"German Aggressors\" as well as the \"Japanese Aggressors\". Supreme Pack Leader had a good feeling about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened to a fourth Pack Leader. He talked about how they would help \"France\" get its freedom back from \"Germany\", and how \"Great Britain\" would never surrender. Supreme Pack Leader had a good feeling about him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Supreme Pack Leader watched, the more languages he soon realized he could understand. He looked at his mate, and the others watching the footage; they too were understanding the words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as groups of aircraft fought over a territory called \"France\", and more over a group of islands in a place called the \"Pacific\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the one with the designation Chief Engineer. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our craft should be able to take them on, even if they were outnumbered thirty to one,\" said Chief Engineer. \"That being said, the Natives might be able to replace their losses, while we might have some problems. There's also the risk that they might get lucky, and capture one of our wrecks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"And on the ground?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Similar situation; even if highly outnumbered, we would enjoy an initial advantage in technical superiority, but they might be able to replace their craft, while we would have problems,\" said Chief Engineer. \"To say nothing about if they capture our weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unarmed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would take approximately a hundred to one for them to finally kill an Assault type,\" said the Chief Biology Specialist. \"That being said, they outnumber our entire population by two thousand to one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"They'd swamp us with numbers, if they worked together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now they are involved in Pack Warfare, all over the world,\" said Chief Warfare Specialist. \"Except for here, here, and a few other places.\" He pointed to what was called the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, South America, Australia, southern area of Africa, and the eastern section of the Soviet Union. \"That being said, almost all of them are sending material, weapons, and such, towards where the fighting is occurring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if they worked together, they might win in a prolonged war against us,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"Hopefully the overall plan works: either we make our home here, or we will perish. Contact the other Pack Leaders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, Supreme Pack Leader looked at the other Pack Leaders. \"You know the plan: send in teams of ten - four Basic Infantry, three Recon, two Assault, and one Infiltrator. Infiltrator has the designation of Diplomat, and the others are their Guards. Their mission is to negotiate with the leaders of these <i>humans</i>, and see about acquiring territory for ourselves. Their orders are to try to use peaceful means to do this, and to fight only in self-defense. Avoid casualties if possible, retreat if necessary, and to retaliate only if there is no other choice. I'd rather avoid a war with these people, if possible, but as you all know, our very future is at stake, and if we must fight a war to survive, we will fight one. It will be difficult, even with our technological and biological advantages, so lets hope for a peaceful outcome, and likewise, if we have to go to war, may it be over swiftly. Tell your teams to prepare, learn the <i>humans'</i> languages well, especially those used by the locals, and good luck to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader watched the scouting craft leave the ships. He hoped that they would succeed in their mission: contact the Human Pack Leaders, and acquire territory for the Packs to live in. They were sent to the Humans Packs' Leading territories, including the locations known as Washington D.C., London, Berlin, and Moscow, among others. All he could do now was wait, and see what other orders would be necessary - would his people be able to settle on the planet peacefully, or would they have to fight once more?</span></div></div>",

He then looked at the reports that he'd already had, which had been left by the now dead Abductors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairly primitive is accurate,\" he said. \"I know we had farms and small settlements, although the hunting was good enough not to worry about needing to grow our own food. Then again, this just might be during the time of the year that they Wander between their Packs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's if they are like us in that aspect,\" said his mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader looked over at the Chief Engineer. \"Is this how advanced all these creatures are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spears made of wood, stone, bone, and sinew,\" said Chief Engineer. \"Of course, some use a specially modified stick to fling a special type of spear further than they can by paw, to say nothing about these ones that have some sort of fiber stretching from one end to the other, that can send another smaller stick towards their target.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Used to use something similar, back when I was in my pre-Wandering years,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"The prey would bleed, and then you can track it, until you were close enough to tear its throat out with your teeth and claws. I remember hunting with my father. We always brought home meat, and my mother and sister brought home plants. Mother was going to take me foraging for plants, and father was going to take my sister hunting, so that we would know how to look for things during our Wandering years, so that we wouldn't eat the wrong plants, or lack the ability to hunt. Then the Abductors came. They took me, and killed my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the others paused for a moment, thinking about that dreadful day that they'd all been taken from their home, and had watched it get destroyed. Then, there was the experiments, and the alterations. All of them had been changed, and the changes were passed on to the next generation as well, but not all those experimented upon had made it. Then there was the Rebellion, which had started soon after the Abductors decided to teach them how to use their weapons and abilities. That was a big mistake for them - for the Packs had made the plan to play along with the Abductors, until they had known everything they needed to know, how to use the weapons, their new abilities, how to use the vehicles, where the fuel and ammo was located, how to get the fuel and ammo, how the ships worked, as well as the general plan the Abductors had for them - at which point, the Packs struck back, using the very weapons they'd been trained to use, using the very abilities they'd been given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Leader of the Rebellion, it was only fitting that he personally had put the Abductor Leader to Death, and had Executed the Abductor Leader using one of the very same abilities they had given him, by swallowing the Leader alive, at which point, the other Pack members had done the same to every Abductor still alive. It had been a <i>fitting</i> punishment, feeling the Abductor try to escape, but being unable to do so. Some Abductors had tried to stab or cut their way out of the Pack members that had swallowed them - seems the Pack members' stomach would fill with strong acids, and digest the Abductors while they were alive, after which, the Pack members' injuries quickly healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Pack Leader looked back up at the footage, where he saw the furless creatures kill a very large animal, which had a long flexible nose, and two long teeth that were just about as big as its nose. The large creature had proved to be formidable, even injuring one of the furless creatures with its long teeth, but the rest had managed to cause it to back up in fright, and thus fall off the edge of a cliff. After this, a couple of the furless creatures went to the injured one, and helped him up, while the rest went to join others waiting at the bottom of the cliff, where they finished off the large creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the very least, they seem to care for their own, and are smart enough to use traps upon their enemies,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"Assume that they are as good as adapting as we were. Let's treat them with extreme care. Just because we might be able to dominate them now doesn't mean they can't turn the tables on us in the future. The Abductors abducted us for a reason, and these creatures were part of it. We'd best not underestimate them. Of course, only the Dead know the Future. I wonder what it will bring.\"</span></div></div>",

In any case, the name stuck - the word human was applied to the furless creatures. The humans had also given a name to what the members of the Pack were - Wolves, but again, this might have been a misunderstanding of \"Big\", \"Hairy\",  or \"Scary\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat matters was that the Packs soon settled on the planet. As for the native furless creatures, they had many different reactions - ranging from worshiping the Pack members as if they were Gods, to attacking them, and being captured, to avoiding the Packs, out of fear. Despite some members calling for the complete capture of the creatures, and others calling for their extermination, Supreme Pack Leader had made it a policy - the creatures were to be left alone, providing that they hadn't attacked first. The creatures were not to be mistreated, citing Pack Members experiences at the hands of the Abductors, who had once thought themselves superior to the Pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this policy didn't stop the furless creatures from attacking, but Supreme Pack Leader had made it allowable to capture those that had attacked. It seemed that seeing several of their own being devoured whole and alive took the brunt out of the attacks, as did the sight of seeing captured members of their groups being brought back up, safe, and alive. After a while, the attacks dried up, and soon, the furless creatures merely followed the Packs when they hunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, understanding was made. In time, the Packs and the furless creatures hunted together, and worked together, though it wasn't easy. In time, the Packs taught the furless \"Humans\" their story. They then started to build. Then, they learned how to train together, making new weapons, in case the Abductors ever came back. Sometimes they even lived together, and it wasn't unheard of for lonely Pack members and lonely humans to mate with each other, although no offspring was ever produced. It was found that the humans had an interesting flavor, and that some humans enjoyed the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there were those who broke the rules, and other troubles. Different organizations were made to try to keep the peace, and pass on understanding, especially as new discoveries were made.</span></div></div>",

Things seemed to be the same with other Law Enforcers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up his talker. \"All clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow day. Slow days were good. No one had been called for some sort of trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned his seat back, with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting bored, big guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw Enforcer #56 looked over at his partner, Law Enforcer #67. She was a human, while <i>he</i> was an Assault type. He grinned. \"Nothing wrong with being bored.

Of course, I did have to point out the trick you used on me to get me out of the frame. Seems he didn't know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I until I did it,\" said Law Enforcer #56. \"I just noticed that joint looked a little weak, and I didn't think there'd be any issue if there was some cosmetic damage for Maintenance to fix up. Didn't know that removing that pin would cause you to fall out of the cage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad we were done having sex when you did pull that pin, and that I landed on something soft,\" said Law Enforcer #67.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad that you weren't heavy like Law Enforcer #45,\" said Law Enforcer #56. \"He would have broke a rib or two if he had landed on me like you did, and I mean <i>my</i> rib.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a big cub,\" said Law Enforcer #67. \"You shoved the frame away, flipped me around, brought me to your mouth, and started licking my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw Enforcer #56 chuckled. \"They were sweet, and sweaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there was my <i>sex</i>!\" Law Enforcer #67 groaned. \"Your tongue was very rough on it, although it did feel <i>good</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw Enforcer #56 grinned. \"I know I liked that part. Besides, if the other Law Enforcers smell me on you, I want them to think it was from training, not from sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there was my <i>breasts!</i>\" Law Enforcer #67 exclaimed. \"You could have just finished gulping me down, but no! You just had to have fun with those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never said 'No' to any of it,\" Law Enforcer #56 pointed out. \"You didn't complain about any of it.

Despite the wolves best attempts to establish peace, the humans were far too weary and suspicious to establish an effective and long lasting peace. The distrust of the humans did little to stop the wolves from, spreading around the whole planet, colonizing large parts of it. The wolves were adapting frighteningly fast, adopting the human tradition of using names, quickly getting used to the flora and fauna of their respective region, putting the planet's rich and up to now untapped resources to good use, by creating  iron and bronze spears for hunting and defending against human raiders. Now 100 years after the first encounter, the wolves have established several tribes and clans all around the earth, each differing vastly from the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><b>The IronClaw Clan</b></span><br>\r\n<b>Leader:</b> General Vvulf<br>\r\n<b>Numbers:</b> 450,000 wolves 150,000 humans(emergency rations)<br>\r\n<b>Info:</b> This tribe roams the lush forests of central Europe. many wolves opted to follow General Vvulf because he is the descendant of the Supreme pack leader.

Well, I was hungry too.\" He patted his belly. \"Not any more.\" He glanced at a human servant, who was busy cleaning the floor. \"These pathetic snacks know better than to steal from me, don't they, Snack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master,\" the human said, still cleaning. \"We're just snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lore Keeper looked at Vvulf. \"That's your justification: that you were hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVvulf looked at him. \"Yes. Do you have a problem with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple Hunter would have only executed them if they were dangerous to the Pack,\" said Lore Keeper. \"He would of had those thieves work for their meal. Even the other Packs would have come up with a better reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, spare me of this nonsense,\" said Vvulf. \"The Jungle Hounds sacrifice humans to their so-called god, and the Anubians do a number of other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but at least the sacrifices tend to be volunteers in the case of the Jungle Hounds, and the number of Anubians that abuse humans is fairly small,\" said the Lore Keeper. \"You are a Pack Leader. You set an example for others to follow. I wonder how things would be if there was a different Pack Leader, like one of your brothers, or their sons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVvulf growled. \"Don't you <i>dare</i> mention them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lore Keeper looked at him. \"It is the Lore: A Pack Leader can be Challenged if deemed unfit to lead. Relatives have first chance, followed by fellow Pack Members, and then Outsiders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVvulf looked at a number of heads he had hung over him. \"Then let those that try, see what will happen to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such will be your fate, if the Challenger was to win,\" said the Lore Keeper. \"Your father was a respected Pack Leader; he even stepped down as Supreme Pack Leader when we did settle upon this world. Even those who hated, and disagreed with him, and his policies, respected him as a Leader. I wonder what he would think of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVvulf growled, as the Lore Keeper turned, and left the room. He wanted to kill the Lore Keeper, but such an act was punishable by a fate worse than death itself - his name would be erased from the Lore. It was worse than being considered a Villain, or an Idiot that needed to learn a Lesson, in a story. Better to have a negative type of fame, than none at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all for the day?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

To say that Vvulf was a difficult master to please was an understatement. She'd seen what had happened to the five food thieves that morning - they had merely stolen some food, only to have been eaten themselves. It wasn't like they'd been shown any sort of mercy either, like getting their necks broken beforehand, but rather had been tied up, and swallowed whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVvulf gestured with a finger. There was a look on his face, one that most would fear, if they had any sort of sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snack knew the look, and felt even more afraid. \"What do you wish of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVvulf grinned.

Thek is not a cruel chief, but a pragmatic one, the borders between the hut cities of his clan and the fire pits of humans are clear, and only the ones who are to trade may enter unharmed.  Because of their fur, they need no clothes, allowing them to dedicate a large quarter of their workers to gathering food, rather than making fabrics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Council of Five Fires is the alliance between the human tribes who live closes their to the hyenas, but they are denied the knowledge of their neighbors, forced to scrape a living in lean-to's or beneath the open sky.  Most humans have forgone clothing to be more like the hyenas, hoping to be seen as more civilized than those who would wage war, now only the tribes of the badlands along the desert wear anything anymore.  And the badlands lead raids against the humans they see as traitors, and the hyenas who've forced them there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the influx of the hyenas, food is hard to come by in sufficient quantities, so the dead are often cannibalized for food, even the humans have been forced to turn to the dead for survival.

With her mate dead, he'd been eaten by the camp, and his thigh was all that had kept her pup fed these last few sunrises, but once again, they were out of food.  And he was too old now to take her milk, not that she was milking anymore, what with the lack of food, and her pup had to start eating solids quicker than most, at least he took to it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and stretching, she idly scratched her thigh as she walked over to her pup and grabbed him from behind, tickling him.  \"Who's my big, strong hunter?\"  She laughed as he tried desperately to get away without dropping the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am! I am!\"  He laughed, managing to squirm his way out of his mother she arms, plopping on his behind in  the dusty ground.  \"You gonna hunt today momma?\"  He asked, hearing her stomach growl while she tickled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down to nuzzle his head (one of many mannerisms and customs the humans took from the hyenas), she closed her eyes and took a deep breath before answering, \"Yes my little hunter.  But don't worry!  I may find an elephant or a terror bird for food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pup smiled at her before getting up, and running over to the other pups, bone in hand, as Obah giggled at his dirt covered bottom sprinting away.  \"They grow up fast don't they?\"  Turning to the voice that spoke, she saw her mother and the camp elder, Nok\u00e9, \"I remember my mother telling tales of grand hunts, hunts that stopped when the hyenas arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah sighed, \"I know mama,\" she held back her tears, walking over to her javelin strap, making sure that she had all four before grabbing her spear as well, \"you've told me many times before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her daughter and then the horizon, Nok\u00e9 asked \"How far are you hunting now dear daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the border.  They somehow have plants that grow when they want, and they never seem to run short of food!  If I can get some, we may yet outlast the dry season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful daughter.

Securing her strap once more to her person, and a quick stop to double check her water pouch, she grabbed her spear and headed off to the border, keeping low to the ground, sniffing the air and checking the ground for tracks frequently, both for food, and to avoid predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was high, almost at the apex of its arc, and nary a beast was seen or smelled for the entire journey.  By now the hot sun had caused her body to sweat off much of the dust covering her, and she knew that she'd eventually have to find another bluff where such soil was, which would be hard in unfamiliar ground, or head home empty handed.  Before she decided, she took one more sniff of the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking upwind, she saw several pillars of smoke rising over the hillside, crouching low in the dry grass, Obah carefully crawled up the side before looking over the hill.  Hyenas.  Dozens of them, far outside the borders agreed upon by their chief.  Not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe border was at least another two hours journey away, why would they journey so far south?  Her answer arrived in the form of a Hyena hunting party carrying several humans on poles, food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humanitarians.\"  She growled to herself.  Most hyena didn't care for a particular kind of meat, and only ate human if they broke the laws and borders agreed upon many seasons ago.  Humanitarians actively hunted and ate humans, and as such were outlaws from the hut cities of their kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick count had twelve hyenas in their encampment, and her camp was only a few hours away from here!  Her camp was her immediate family, including herself, only seven, and even then only three could actually hunt ... or fight.  Deciding to watch the hyenas down below, Obah laid as flat as possible and settled in to observe them.  If they left soon, she could resume her hunt, if they stayed, she'd have to warn her camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking at the prisoners brought another idea to mind, theft.  These hyenas weren't protected by the laws nor their chief, if she could steal some of their food, she could feed her family and warn them to move in one swift stroke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on her stomach in the dirt, covered in dust, the naked huntress watched the camp below and waited to see what they would do.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't lead them home, her camp wouldn't stand a chance, she'd have to lead them away, or fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't in top shape, the dry season and scarcity of food had taken its toll on her, and these hyenas were eating well, turning a left at the lone tree, she led them down toward the  cracked earth.  Once a watering hole, now the soil was dried out, and the larger plant life dead.  Drawing one of her javelins, she turned and picked the center hyena, throwing it with all her might at her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf his fall to the ground wasn't an indication that she hit her mark, the howl of pain was.  His companions put on a burst of speed, and she could hear their footsteps beside her, deciding to stand and fight, she stopped  and thrust her spear where the footsteps on her left were coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena grabbed her spear and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTumbling across the ground, she scrambled to her feet, drawing another javelin as the hyena snapped her spear in half, his partner drawing his own spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now female.\"  The second one said, \"Just die honorably feeding the superior race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never.\"  Obah spat back, ignoring the various scrapes that covered her body, \"You are not superior.  You are monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first hyena chuckled, \"Monsters we may be, but we are still superior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them rushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrusting her javelin as hard as she could into the hyena with the spear, she succeeded in landing her hit, but the other one tackled her, knocking the wind out of her.  He pinned her arms and legs to the ground before running his snout from her navel to her throat, sniffing and occasionally licking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell so good,\" he panted, \"and the sweet sweat adds to the natural flavor.\"  He laughed as he licked the side of her face, \"You killed my brothers, now I eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah glared defiantly at her enemy, \"Not yet.\" She growled as she bent her knee as hard as she could, getting the hyena in his crotch, causing his grip to weaken, and a yelp of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll scream for that!\"  He roared as he kneed her in the belly, once again knocking the wind out of her, before bringing his mouth over her right shoulder and biting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah screamed.</span></div></div>",

Looking over to the source of the sound, she saw two more hyenas approaching, one drawing a javelin as he approached.  Rolling over, ignoring the pain in her throwing shoulder, she crawled toward her discarded spear, and whimpered as she rolled back over, and waited for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they weren't after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching in partial shock, and partial adrenaline rush, Obah watched as the hyena who'd been on top of her, laying with a javelin sticking out of his side, was brutally ripped adapt by the new hyenas.  As she inched her way back away from them, the two saw her, and after a brief conversation in their barking language, approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was deep and old, and not at all aggressive, she could scarcely believe that's it came from a hyena.  \"Y-yes.\"  She hissed as her shoulder gave another bolt of pain, \"Justa little hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyenas companion kneeled down as drew an herbalist pouch out of his satchel, grinding some leaves up in his massive hands before he forcibly pulled her closer and slathered her shoulder in the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it easy for a few days.\"  He said, wiping his hand so off in the dirt, \"Don't need an infection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded silently, looking at the horribly mauled corpse of a hyena behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep voiced one turned to see what she was looking at before looking back at her.  \"Don't worry, we're servants of Thek, not humanitarians.\"  He gestured to his javelins, \"We were actually stalking them when they started hunting you.\"  He looked her over, and it seemed that he liked what he was looking at, \"What's a lovely female like you doing out in the wilds alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah rolled her shoulder, the herbs having numbed it, before answering, \"Hunting.  My pack is hungry, and my pup especially needs food.\"  She absently rubbed the pack mark cut into her right forearm, \"My mate died not too long ago, and it has been many moons since the rains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharing a look with his companion, the deep voiced one turned back to Obah, \"How many females in your pack?  And do you serve the Five Fires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Including me?  Three of rutting age,  my mother, one male, two pups.  And we do answer to the Fires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyenas smiled at this, standing up and gesturing back to the way they came from.  \"Though you are human, and forbidden from eating hyena, as the laws decree, our camp has much food.  Bring your pack, all we ask is the right to rut with your females, it has been many nights since we last saw a female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I refuse?\"  Obah asked, knowing to always stay cautious around hyena, no matter their behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we leave, and you continue on your way, and we on ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up to her full height, her head barely reaching the belly buttons of the hyenas, Obah looked up at them, \"I accept on behalf of the pack.\"  She lifted her head up, exposing her neck and her bare body to the two large hyenas, ancient custom of the humans showing their vulnerable parts to their then masters, the hyenas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep voiced one licked her neck, ending the custom, allowing her to lower her head, \"We look forward to it.\"  He rumbled, once again gesturing the direction to their camp, the two headed off, and Obah began her way back to her pack.</span></div></div>",

She nervously looked up at the hyenas, the human male came up to just barely over the belly button of the hyena leader, but like Obah said, they were desperately hungry for food and a good rutting for full bellies was a fair trade.  Looking at her old body, she sighed, so many memories so long ago before the rains became infrequent, her body had aged quite a bit, her teats sagged and her fur turned grey, but that was life out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah meanwhile was feeding her pup and herself while taking glances at the hyenas tents.  The idea of the tent was not in the normal human pack innovations, they normally found a bluff to camp under or a cliff face or a cave.  Their most recent camp was literally just leaf mats under a large tree, and a bonfire in the middle.  She even saw some shiny stone looking spears that one hyena called \"meh-tul\", but the word wasn't one he was familiar with, humans were used to using sharpened wood and stone, why should they change their culture any more than they had to match the hyena?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters, Tetay and Ponti, were eating while being rutted.  Bent over and presenting themselves to their partners, they were on their knees and elbows, stuffing their mouths with whatever food they had in reach in between moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\"  Obah heard the leader ask behind her, sniffing at her neck, causing goosebumps to run across her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing the instinctual fear at being presented with a superior predator, Obah nodded, setting her pup aside to play with his cousin.  \"As ready as I can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader smiled and Obah's jaw almost hit the dirt, when the leader's penis was unsheathed. It was a rather <i>impressive</i> size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah looked at her sisters, being rutted by the smaller healer and another smaller pack member, but a deal was a deal.  She turned around and presented herself to the leader, getting on her knees and looking up at him over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader got on his knees too, and then, it started.  She couldn't tell whether it was from pain or pleasure, but she didn't want to to get any worse, she could feel his paws/hands on her shoulders, and she barked like a female hyena.  Just like her mother said to, she'd had to do this before, so Obah and her sisters listened, and obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the strength of the hyena's maleness behind each thrust.  Eventually the twitching from both the leader and Obah ceased and Obah and the leader let loose primal howls that resounded across the savannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first watch began, Obah, more than a little sore, like her sisters, lay down under the stars with her pack, all the humans feeling uncomfortable under the tents since they were used to the open sky above them.  Her pup cuddled up beside her, and the last she felt was the warmth of the fire, and her pup unconsciously trying to nurse from her.</span></div></div>",

It means that your a friend. When asked by another scout, tell them it was given to you by Scout Leader Chirk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah looked at the item. It was a piece of metal that dangled off of a length of tough dried sinew that could be worn about the neck. The metal had a shape that looked similar to the hyenas. She put it on. \"Thank you, Scout Leader Chirk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChirk nodded. \"Of course, if you forget my name, just go along peacefully with whatever scouts that do encounter you, until I can verify things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Obah. \"I'll let the others of my group know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChirk nodded. \"Good. Depending on your choice, maybe we'll get to know each other better. Failing that, may our next encounter be less of a rescue, and more that of friends greeting one another.\"</span></div></div>",

Using her spear, she would dig in likely spots, searching for creatures that buried themselves into the ground in order to avoid the heat, along with edible roots and tubers. So far though, her search had produced nothing. Drinking sparingly from her water pouch, she then looked for something else. The heat was becoming too much for anyone to travel, but it would get cooler later, and she could travel then. She then noticed a small rock pile. She walked towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Obah got to the pile, she tapped on the sides of it, and waited for a moment. She then removed a rock, looked inside for any creatures that had escaped the heat of the day, but found nothing. She then crawled inside herself, replacing the rock. It wasn't much, but it kept her out of the sun, the wind, and many predators would have a hard time locating her. For now though, she could rest, and try to regain her energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, something awoke her. At first, Obah wasn't sure what was different. Then, she sniffed. She could smell smoke, and meat cooking. Grabbing her spear, she listened carefully, hearing the footsteps and other sounds. Someone was outside the rock pile, someone heavy. Placing an eye against a crack, she saw a figure, a large one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear you in there,\" the figure said, in a deep voice. \"Come out, and share my meal, if you like. Or, stay in there, and remain hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah felt her stomach grumble as she smelled the food again. Given that the rock pile was still intact, and that she hadn't been dragged from it to be raped, or eaten, she felt that it was possible that the stranger could be trusted not to harm her. Carefully removing the rock, she crawled out of the pile, replacing it once more. She then looked at the stranger. The hyena was a male of the </span></div></div>",

Obah wondered if she'd of been better off to stay hidden inside of the pile, but the hyena merely indicated a spot on the other side of him, a spot that placed the fire between them. Granted, the hyena could probably, and easily, grab her in spite of the fire, but he was being polite, offering her some space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Obah said, as she sat across from him. She looked at him. \"Aren't you a little out of the Border for your tribe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Wandering,\" the hyena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah nodded in understanding. The hyenas, and the others like them, would have those who traveled around the Packs, looking for a place to settle down. Sometimes this took years, during which, they were the Honored Guest of those who hosted them, and thus were allowed to hunt in another Pack's territory, so long as they shared the bounty with the Host Pack, and were allowed to mate with those who stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't a whole lot of your kind in this general area,\" Obah said. \"Cross the river over in that direction, and you'll find more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena nodded. \"I've lived there. But I don't want to just stay there. Might travel towards the Anubian Territories; I've heard that hunting is generally easier there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the dry season,\" said Obah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena chuckled. \"I've noticed.\" He then looked at the meal. \"Food's about ready.\" He took out a bowl, scooped some food into it, and offered it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Obah said, as she accepted the bowl. She then began to eat the contents, just in case the hyena changed their mind. Instead, they took a second bowl, filled that, and ate from that bowl. She watched as they soon finished, and set their bowl down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out here by yourself?\" they asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah nodded. \"More or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a tribe nearby?\" the hyena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reasonably,\" said Obah. \"Trying to locate food for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that you're out here by yourself,\" the hyena said. \"Surely most of you go out hunting with someone, just in case of danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah lowered her eyes. \"My mate died half a moon ago. He fell off of a cliff while searching for bird nests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" the hyena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our pup is with my mother at the moment,\" said Obah. \"There's only a handful of us at the moment. Others, they've drifted off in order to make hunting and gathering easier. But, we haven't had much luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be able to help you out with that,\" the hyena said. \"I was tracking a solitary elephant when I came across your stone pile, and decided to take a rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about the elephant?\" Obah asked. There would be plenty of meat to feed her family, if she could kill one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena nodded. \"It isn't too far away. Should be able to get to it before sundown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah looked at the sun. Night wasn't too far off. \"You sure about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not a problem at my pace,\" said the hyena. \"I could tie you to me, or put you in a carrying pouch, or I could carry you in my stomach. Alternatively, you could just walk alongside of me; might take a little longer though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, you're just going to split the elephant with me and mine?\" Obah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of it would go to waste otherwise,\" said the hyena. \"You interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm interested,\" said Obah. \"Don't know what I can offer you for your help though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena chuckled. \"I can think of something. I'm not too picky about my temporary mates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah looked at herself. She then looked at the hyena. \"Well, I have been curious about what it would be like to mate with one of your kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the hyena said. \"My name is Reze. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReze nodded. \"So, how do you want to travel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObah thought for a moment and said...</span></div></div>",

She wasn't sure what she was expecting from him, but this definitely wasn't it.  As Hok (the lone male) started prepping some of the elephant meat for when Noke returned, Obah and her sister started drawing the ceremonial celebratory markings across their bodies in the elephants blood.  The ornate lines and swirls covered them from head to toe, with the exception of their breasts, crotch and buttocks, which had hand prints over each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little hunter!\" Obah called, \"Come here!\"  Her son nodded, waving at Reze before coming over and letting his mother cover his body in similar markings, his cousins getting the same treatment from their mother and father.</span></div></div>",

He didn't understand the reason behind the ceremony, but decided not to say anything about it, as it wasn't anything too crazy. After all, it was nothing like what some of the humans did in the territories of certain packs where the local Wolves were worshiped like they were living Gods or whatever - sometimes those humans offered themselves up as meals to the Wolves.

Can you please help me wrap my head around that?\" he muttered in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say boys, What are ye two chattin' about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth wolves froze. It was the captain, Viktor Bludflagge himself had overheard them, and they were too busy slacking off their guard duty to notice him coming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing Mr. Bludflagge, we were't talking about anything!\" the first wolf said frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Captain Bludflagge to you! If you two nimrods have the guts ta say something behind my back, then yer brave enough to say it to my face! So speak up, before i have ya thrown overboard, fer the sharks to enjoy...\" yelled Viktor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes Captain Bludflagge! Me and my friend here just wanted to hear the story of how you defeated Big Mack.\" the second wolf said, trying to cover up their tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, why didn't ya just say so boy! Ain't nothing shameful in wanting to be educated. Anyways here i go.\" the captain said as he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, a long time ago, i managed to survive the initiation and got a job as a lowly janitor. Back then there was a mountain of a wolf called \"Big Mack\" who was the captain and Supreme Marshal of tha sea dogs. He might have had the size advantage but i had something he never had! I had ambitions, determination and a rusty dagger...\" Viktor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain took a drink from his trusty canteen before he continued the story. \"Picture this, a young, lowly human janitor challenges a wolf three times as big as him. Funny picture right? At least old Mack thought it was, tha big bastard laughed his ass off for a solid minute. He was so slow and had the reflexes of a dead whale! He had barelly started swinging his great big cutlass when i lunged for him. Ya should have seen tha surprised look on his face when i sunk me dagger in his big fat belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain started laughing hysterically, while the two wolves were listening in disbelief. \"So anyways, Tha big bastard just fell on the ground and bled ta death shortly after. On that day i was crowned the new Supreme Marshal and i became captain of this here fine vessel. Even got this nice, custom made hat. From that day forward any wolf brave enough to challenge me has ended up with his insides on the outside! So don't be getting any smart ideas, and get back ta work! Ya lazy gobshites...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes captain!\" the wolves said in sync, then they resumed their guard duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain silently swayed his head in disappointment. Did these two idiots really pass initiation? If so, he ought to make it even harder. While he was busy devising new ways to test recruits he ran into an assault genotype wolf with a missing eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Finn! You know tha two new recruits?\" Viktor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the two recon types, Vinny and Lyn?\" the large wolf replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah them. Do me a favor and roughen them up a bit will ya? They ought ta learn to not question authority.\" Viktor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, aye Captain.\" answered Finn as he went off to search for the two unfortunate wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge smiled. Finn was as big, hardened son of a bitch, and he was as loyal as they come. He couldn't dream for a better right hand wolf. He then resumed his inspection of the ship and the crew. After he checked every bit of his prized vessel he went back to his quarters. When Big Mack died and Viktor became the new captain he found the current captains quarters to be far too big to be usable by a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he had the whole room destroyed and refurnished to his liking. He sat in his comfy chair, lifted his boots on his desk and he lit up a cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it's good to be the captain.\" he said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut the tranquility was soon interrupted, as someone knocked on the door.</span></div></div>",

When i came over to see what's going on I found our chef, piss drunk, boasting how he stole money from the treasury.\" Finn explained. \"So I had Amelia check our stash and she confirmed that there was in fact a large sum of money missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge was really staring to loose his cool. Not only was the dumb bastard bold enough to steal from the captain's gold, but he also had to boast to the other crew members. Bludflagge took a deep breath, and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, First off. Where's the dirty rat right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well once I was sure he stole, I shoved him in one of the holding cells. Wasn't too hard, he was too drunk to retaliate.\" Finn answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Second off. Who was guarding the treasury when the theft happened.\" Bludflagge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two rookies from earlier had been guarding since the last check up, so it was most likely them.\" Finn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge sighed. \"Of course it was those good fer nothing Schmucks... When they recover I want you to give them a proper beating, but for now, bring the cook to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn nodded and exited the room. A few minutes later he came back, hauling a chubby, basic infantry genotype in cuffs. When he put the wolf down it became apparent to Bludflagge that the alcohol had worn out, and the poor wolf was scared shitless, his knees shaking, sweating profusely. He even barely managed to mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i'm sorry c-captain. I promise i won't ever cross you again... Just please don't kill me...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reaching for a knife he called out, \"That you Finn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and in came a figure, cloaked in white cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge relaxed a bit. It was that Lore Keeper. Bludflagge never could figure out the strange wolf, whose pack had declared themselves neutral in any decision a pack leader made, merely writing down what occurred, yet would offer advice, and criticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lore Keeper had been on a ship heading for Okami Lang Nation territories, until Bludflagge's pirates took it over. While the other passangers and crew had fetched a handsome price in ransom, in terms of precious metals, gems, food, water, medicines, and other needed things, the Lore Keeper had chosen to stay with the Sea Dogs, as the pirates didn't already have a Lore Keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some ways, Bludflagge found him to be annoying, as the Lore Keeper wrote down everything, and yet did nothing himself. The Lore Keeper would speak to him without any fear of what could happen to him, for there were laws that even Bludflagge was forced to follow, namely being that no harm was to come to a Lore Keeper. It was said that they could erase ones' very name from history, along with everything they'd ever done. Bludflagge didn't know if this was true, but he'd heard stories about those who had done wrong to one - such people ended up being written as if they were villains, and worse. Thus, the Lore Keeper was to be treated with respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, at the same time, the Lore Keeper was a fountain of information. Lore Keepers shared what they'd written with each other, and they knew the histories of the other packs, and how different pack leaders had acted in similar situations, even before their kind had ended up upon this world, although the information prior to the Abduction was, much to their regret, somewhat fragmented. Still, knowing how another pack leader had once acted was useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to know?\" Bludflagge asked, as he looked at the Lore Keeper, who was of the Basic Infantry Genotype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lore Keeper sat in a chair. \"To know why you are having the cook executed instead of just having him beaten, like you do most thieves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact that he stole from my treasury isn't good enough?\" Bludflagge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could put that down, if you wish,\" the Lore Keeper said. \"Although, that would just portray you as being a greedy pirate, who wants wealth for himself. A good enough reason, however, might just paint you as just being a strict leader, who cares about the well-being of his pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge looked at him. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I think isn't important,\" said the Lore Keeper. \"My job is to write the history of our kind. What you think, as leader of the Sea Dogs, is important. After all, not many packs are lead by a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Bludflagge. \"In that case, how about:</span></div></div>",

Are you a cook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman kept quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge looked at her. \"It's a simple question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at him, defiance in her eyes. \"Why should I answer filth such as you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge grinned. \"You have courage, that's one thing I like about the Okami Lang humans. Those of the IronClaw, I actually feel sorry for them, especially those of the household of General Vvulf, and I don't try to bother ransoming them back to that pack. But this Mori Tenno Huangdi, he's rather tolerant, and will even buy IronClaw humans off of my pack, although so would any other pack for that matter. I used to be part of the IronClaw pack, and I was always afraid of displeasing my master. Then I got picked up by Sea Dog raiders, and while it was harsh for me at first, I eventually became Pack Leader. You could become someone important to in this pack, making sure that my meals are safe, listening for plots against me. There might be other benefits as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only serve Lord Mori Hidyashu,\" the woman said. \"I would never serve the likes of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge looked at Finn. \"One of our newest captives, right? The Emperor's own son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn nodded. \"Same ship we got her on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, invite him to dine with me,\" said Bludflagge. \"Having him be my guest ought to keep her from trying to poison me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on the woman's face became neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he a good master?\" Bludflagge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but he'd rather die if that meant that you'd be dying with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge chuckled. \"Would you be willing to die as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what it took to bring you down, so be it,\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have someone keep an eye on her as she prepares the meal,\" said Bludflagge. \"If she attempts to poison me, regardless of it it is successful or not, see to it that Lord Mori Hidyashu dies a vicious death, with her watching. After that, toss her into the sea, with a rock tied to each of her limbs.\" He looked at the woman. \"Your Lord's fate is now in your hands.\" He then looked at Finn. \"After you've sent her to the kitchen, come back here, with Amelia. I have important business to discuss that I wish for you to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Bludflagge was alone with the Lore Keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harsh much?\" the Lore Keeper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is of an enemy pack, and would have reason to want me dead,\" said Bludflagge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captured in a raid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now you're the leader of the pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're talking about me, and not her?\" Bludflagge asked, looking at the Lore Keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lore Keeper wrote on his pad. \"Of course. I could talk to her and Lord Mori Hidyashu later about what they think about you. But knowing your story, that is important. We were about to discuss your prior cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we were,\" Bludflagge said, just as he door knocked. \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in Finn, Amelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge watched as Amelia came in. She was an Infiltrator Genotype, his Accountant and next to Finn in the chain of command, as well as his lover, and there were times that he was her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" he said. \"Close the door. I don't want the others to hear this.\" As he did, he gave off a careful gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia and Finn nodded, and closed the door, but left a barely open crack, perfect for any eavesdropper to listen through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason I'm having the cook executed is thus..</span></div></div>",

Let's just get the formalities out of the way, Amelia roll call please.\" Bludflagge said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia then took out a small paper note and cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ahem* Roger, the Widowmaker\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\" said a young infantry genotype wolf, that was sitting next to Bludflagge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ymir, Giant of the Icy seas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present.\" said a white, assault genotype wolf with many scars covering his 20 feet tall body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killian, the Red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here\" said an infiltrator genotype wolf with red tribal warpaint covering his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tek, scourge of the Nile\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here\" said an muscular recon genotype anubian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last but not least, Ericson the Kingpin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah i'm here.\" said a chubby basic infantry genotype, adorned with several golden earnings, necklaces and braces. \"Cut the crap Bludflagge, did you bring us here to waste our time?\" he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, please. I know there's enought bad blood and old beef between us to fill a bovine leper colony. Besides we all know i wouldn't call all of you here unless it was very important. SO SHUT UP! Because this concerns all of us!\" Bludflagge yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric growled and reluctantly stopped complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad we reached an understanding, but we have more important matter to discuss...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the wolf's paws was a list of records from the various ships that the various crews had managed to capture within the last couple of days. These records were of cargo, crew, passengers, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything good Amelia?\" Bluddflagge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty of goods, some gold, quite a bit of gems, and a number of the passengers are quite wealthy, and even the lesser ones hold some value,\" said Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Bludflagge. \"Hopefully their friends'll pay a handsome ransom for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's even medicine,\" said Amelia. \"It will be useful to some of the crews that have been sailing in those warmer areas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Bludflagge. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia looked at him, and grinned. \"What else do you want, Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you to shut the door, and lock it,\" said Bludflagge. \"After that, take your garments off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia chuckled, as she shut the door. \"Don't forget yours. I wouldn't want to ruin them.\" She locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge started to remove his shirt. \"You know that I wouldn't be the leader of the pack if it wasn't for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted Mack dead, and you wanted to be in charge,\" said Amelia, as she took her clothes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bastard never treated you right anyways,\" said Bludflagge as he started on his pants. \"All he ever used you for was sex. He never saw how intelligent you were, nor your cunning, and he certainly never saw you put that potion into his drink that would keep him from healing up from his injuries. A few good cuts did the rest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to believe that people believe that you used nothing more than a knife to kill him,\" said Amelia, as she finished taking her clothes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both,\" said Bludflagge, as he finished himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want, Captain?\" Amelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludflagge smiled. \"Can I trust you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia chuckled. \"No. I'll use you to get to my own ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why I trust you,\" said Bludflagge. \"You won't kill me unless it suited your purpose. Tell me, does killing me suit your purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia grinned. \"Not at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough for me,\" said Bludflagge. He walked up to her, and placed a hand on her shoulder. She lowered her head, as he lifted his. The two of them kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, my mate?\" Amelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bludflagge said....</span></div></div>",

The inhabitants of this planet were indeed primitive, but probably more advanced in certain ways than the Packs had once been. Many areas had stone buildings, and even stone paths linking different settlements. Two were fairly close to each other, the Pack of Rome, and the many small, yet allied Packs of the Greeks. There was another pack called the Hans, which had some trade with the Romans and Greeks, but mainly dealt with other smaller packs that were nearby. Then, over on the other side of the world was the Pack of the Mayans. They seemed to have a rather interesting culture where they would fight with fighters of the other nearby packs, capture those fighters, take them to the top of a tall building, where certain ones would cut the captive open, and pull out their organs, raising them to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty blood-thirsty people aren't they?\" his mate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were pretty blood-thirsty ourselves,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"Let's not judge them too harshly.\" He looked at the Chief Engineer. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth be told, we could take this planet over,\" said Chief Engineer. \"They outnumber us a hundred to one, but our technology is more than enough to overwhelm them. In fact, I doubt we'd take many casualties, and all we'd have to worry about is some scratches on our vehicles\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure the Abductors thought the same thing when they first saw us,\" said Supreme Pack Leader. \"We'll stick to the Plan of sending groups of ten to the main settlements of the major Packs on this planet, and negotiate for territory. Fight only in self-defense, retreat if need be, and try to minimize casualties. I'd hate to have to fight a war, but if we must do so, let's see that it is over swiftly. Notify the other Pack Leaders, and send the teams. The teams are to each consist of four Basic Infantry, three Recon, two Assault, and one Infiltrator. Infiltrator has the designation of Diplomat, and the others are their Guards. Hopefully they should be able to do this.\"</span></div></div>",

        "created":1292891280,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">An invasion occurred to a planet far away. Its inhabitants were abducted, on mass, and then the planet was destroyed. The abductors did a lot of things to their new victims, enhancing certain features, making some larger, some very large, and making all of them stronger. Then, the kidnappers decided to train their victims on how to use their weapons, which were highly advanced, planning to use them as expendable soldiers during their next invasion. This backfired on them, big time. Their victims fought back, and soon the kidnappers were all dead, some wishing they'd been dead before they did finally die. With no home to go back to, the plan the victims had was to settle on the next planet that the ships had in their programming: Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aliens, which resemble Terran Grey Wolves, were enhanced in many ways, but here is what's common to them:<br>\r\n1. Ability to learn new languages - just thirty words, spoken or written, and they are just as fluent as a native speaker, although slang is an annoyance. This ability was for conducting interrogations or negotiating with Collaborators, or so the theory goes.<br>\r\n2. Very strong, and very fast. Even the weakest can outrun a deer, and outfight a bear.<br>\r\n3. Large appetite -  These wolves need to eat a lot of meat, but can make due on plant matter if need be.<br>\r\n4. Rapid Healing - These wolves heal quickly from injury, but will need to eat a large meal after a serious injury.<br>\r\n5. Digestion Control - Even the smallest wolf can hold a prey item the size of a human safely in their stomach, for thirty minutes. After that, the prey is at risk of passing out from heat exhaustion and lack of proper air to breath. However, if the wolf is seriously injured while carrying live prey in their stomach, digestion occurs at a rapid rate. This ability is believed to have been used for taking prisoners, and possibly for torturing them. That being said, there might be <i>other</i> uses for this ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir technology, which they took from their kidnappers, is highly advanced, but includes spacecraft, aircraft that can fly in either space or atmosphere, laser weapons, projectile weapons, armor, plus designs to make more items, such as watercraft if need be, among other more practical things, such as healing chambers, food processors, farming equipment, and other such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are 4 main variations where the wolves are concerned, although there are those who thrive in Arctic-type areas, Desert-type areas, Woodland-type areas, and other environments.<br>\r\n1. Basic Infantry Type - Most common, at 40% of the wolves. 10 feet tall. Can swallow one human-sized prey comfortably, but can hold two in a pinch. Every wolf carries the genes for this type, which explains why there is so many.<br>\r\n2. Recon Type - 14 feet tall. Enhanced eyesight, hearing, and smelling. Good at tracking, and scouting. Can hold two human-sized prey comfortably, although they can hold three in a pinch. 30% of the Wolves. Genes suppress Basic Infantry Genes<br>\r\n3. Assault Type - 18 feet tall. Extremely strong. Very resilient. Can easily hold five human-sized prey in their stomach, comfortably, but can hold a few more if need be. 20% of the Population. Genes suppress both Recon and Basic Infantry Genes.<br>\r\n4. Infiltrator Type - 8 feet tall. Weaker than even Basic Infantry type, but still strong enough to take on a bear. Can swallow one human-sized prey, but they feel quite a bit of discomfort, and have trouble moving. Additionally, they can shapeshift into other species of similar size, such as humans. 10% of the population. Genes suppress Assault, Recon, and Basic Infantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nature of the Invasion depends on a number of factors, such as if the first contact is peaceful, or violent, if the Native Humans think the wolves are Gods, or Demons, potential allies/enemies, technology of the Time that the wolves landed during, if a war is going on, not to mention peoples' reactions in general to seeing large talking wolves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. There will be an option for different Time Periods initially - from Prehistory to Modern Times. Likewise, the story might start in different locations. Throwing in a couple of Future Timelines.<br>\r\n2. The Wolves' technology will be superior to that of the Humans', at least initially. Humans might be able to acquire the wolves' technology through trade, or theft, or the wolves might decide to downgrade the majority of their stuff, keeping their advanced gear in reserve.<br>\r\n3. Humans as Prey will depend upon the situation. If there is violence towards the wolves, humans might be on the menu, as a form of punishment, or torture, or lack of alternative foods if the wolf is injured, and this might be directed towards those engaged in violence with the wolves, or with those who are already dead, or dying. In peaceful situations, humans might just be Pretend Prey, being released soon afterwards, either as part of Training, or a Role-Play scenario, or some other such situation. Also, it's possible that the human is dying of some sort of illness, like cancer, and doesn't want to prolong their own suffering.<br>\r\n4. It is possible for the wolves to have sex with humans. However, offspring are <i>highly</i> unlikely.<br>\r\n5. The wolves do not have names as humans know them, except as Designations, at least initially. This might change, depending on the time.<br>\r\n6. Good Spelling and Grammar would be appreciated.<br>\r\n7. Try to create a story, with the fetish stuff as a side note, and not the overall tone. That being said, give a reason for the fetish - part of a job, master and pet/slave, loving couple, or whatever. Don't just do it out of the blue.<br>\r\n8. Starting Number of the Wolves is one million - keep this in mind when making ratios comparing wolf numbers to human numbers of the given eras.<br>\r\n9. When it comes to fetishes, most anything goes, except for toilet related stuff, non-oral-type vore variations, body swapping, gender swapping, and anything else I think doesn't fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy.</td>",
