            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I thought back to what the doctor had said... \u201cThis is a one time procedure,  the body you\u2019re given is the one you\u2019re going to have for the rest of your life.\u201d At the time, I\u2019d thought nothing of it but now I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it. I\u2019m a fucking girl.<br>\r\nWell, might as well get introduced to myself. I decided to start my investigation from the room. I opened the door on which the mirror was hanging and felt my jaw hang open. Who fucking needs a closet this big? Me, apparently. I entered the closet and stared at racks upon racks of clothes, some even had tags on them. The shoe collection took half a wall. As I stared at a pair of ridiculously high pair of heels, I realized something. I\u2019m so fucked.<br>\r\nAfter taking a shower in which I spent a ridiculous amount of time touching my tits- I\u2019ve always been a boobs man, and my pussy, I had breakfast. Get this, this woman is an health nut. Every goddamn thing in her, well, my fridge was low fat shit. In other words, tasteless and boring. I ransacked the fridge until I found one small tub of chocolate ice cream. And that is what I ate, as breakfast. I had to go to a grocery store immediately. I searched the house until I found her wallet. I then discovered that my name was Ava Gregory. Hmm,  nice name. I was 23 years old and according to google, a fitness trainer. Not surprised at all. I was also pretty rich, judging by my clean, contemporary condo and a BMW key fob I found on the kitchen island. As I was about to open my Facebook page, I received a call from \u2018 Jessbabexoxoloveemojiloveemoji\u2019. The fuck happened to plain ol\u2019 Jess?  I picked the call and the first thing she said was \u201cHey chica, you ready yet? Don\u2019t forget you\u2019re doing my makeup so you gotta get your ass down here in fifteen minutes if you don\u2019t want us to be late. Lina and Emma are gonna meet us there\u201d<br>\r\nUhh, say what now? Ready for what? Who the fuck are Lina and Emma? And most importantly, I don\u2019t know how to use makeup! Okay, calm down. You\u2019ve watched enough movies and had enough girlfriends to know how to act like a woman. I cleared my throat, took a deep breath and spoke.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jess, I\u2019m almost ready. Course I didn\u2019t forget I\u2019m doing your makeup\u201d Wow.. I did it! I totally sounded like a girl right now. I did a little victory jig. <br>\r\n\u201cGood. Wait, why the fuck didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019d gotten back with Jason? Had to hear it from Lina. And what are you gonna do about Will? You guys were just getting serious, right? You know what, hold the gist. You\u2019re gonna tell me everything when you get here. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d She hung up.<br>\r\nI stared at the phone for a few minutes while I suppressed the sudden urge to cry. Why? Why couldn\u2019t I take the body of a normal woman who had no boyfriend, ate normal food, didn\u2019t store numbers with a lot of emojis and didn\u2019t use makeup? I had a pity-party for all of five minutes before I sucked it up. You can do this. You didn\u2019t play Romeo in high school for nothing. You can act like a goddamn woman and make it believable.<br>\r\nPsyched up from my pep-talk, I ran into my room, entered the closet and stopped short. Now, what the fuck do I wear? As I turned around, the clothes blurred together, making me dizzy. Holy shit, this is harder than I thought. I sat down on the carpet in the closet and contemplated my dilemma. Dude, think. What outfit do women always wear? Hell, think of the last woman you picked up? What was she wearing when you approached her?<br>\r\nA wide smile pulled my lips as the idea formed in my head. Jeans. I can never go wrong with jeans. I stood up and rushed to the jeans section. A ten second perusal turned my smile into a frown. There were at least fifty pairs of Jeans in different colors and stages of bedazzling. I decided to choose one at random and I ended up wearing a deep blue skinny jean. Great, now a blouse. I was lucky to find a camisole/leather jacket combo so I put that on. At the shoes section, I didn\u2019t even bother to check the heels, no way am I willingly subjecting myself to those deathtraps. I put on a pair of sneakers and checked my outfit in the mirror. Damn, I\u2019m fucking hot. I gave myself a thumbs up and strutted out of the closet. A look at the vanity brought me up short. Makeup. Well, I could always tell Jess I wanted to get there early so I decided to forgo using makeup. <br>\r\nOne Last good look in the mirror at my sexy new body.... There she was.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking a deep breath and smiling my best fake smile at the beauty in the mirror I walked out of the condo and took the elevator down to the garage. I stepped out of the elevator and scanned the garage. Now, I assume I have a car but which one is it? Got it, I\u2019ll just press the key fob and go to the one that makes a sound. Except, I don\u2019t have the key fob with me. It was then I realized that I\u2019d forgotten the most essential thing a woman carries, a purse. I ran back to the elevator and pressed the button for my floor. On the way there, the elevator stopped and a tall, chocolate handsome man came in. As soon as he saw me, he grinned, picked me up and kissed me. Holy shit! I\u2019m kissing a dude. The fuck? I tried to get him to put me down but it didn\u2019t work so I pinched him, hard. He yelped and dropped me.<br>\r\n\u201cAva, baby, what are you doing?\u201d he asked. I just stared at him, wide-eyed. I had no fucking clue what to say or who he was.<br>\r\nMight as well ask. \u201cWho are you?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Will. What\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re acting a bit weird.\u201d  He said as he slipped his arms around my waist.<br>\r\nSo this was Will, my boyfriend. Guess, he does have a right to kiss me.<br>\r\nThe elevator doors opened again and another man came in. He was white, average-height, muscular and handsome too. He came at me when he saw me too but stopped when he saw Will\u2019s arms around my waist.<br>\r\n\u201cThe fuck is going on here? Who are you and why are your arms around my girlfriend?\u201d He tried to get into Will\u2019s face. <br>\r\nApparently, this is Jason, my other boyfriend. One question though, why on earth would Ava have two equally handsome boyfriends who live in the same building? It was a deadass recipe for disaster. <br>\r\nI disengaged myself from Will who snarled back. \u201cWho the fuck are you calling your girlfriend? She\u2019s mine, fucker.\u201d  <br>\r\nHe pushed Jason and he staggered back a step. Oh boy, I thought as Jason responded with a mean right hook. As they took each other down, wrestling and punching, I just stood there wide-eyed, one thought looping through my mind, I should have fucking died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You hear two children shout as they enter the room interrupting your horrific realization of what had happened. as you turn to see them they are already mid air jumping on to the bed to hug you! One was a little boy who looked to be about 5 with very light brown almost dark blond hair and the other was a blonde little girl who you figured must have been around 8 or 9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both seemed so excited to see you but you didn't even have any idea what their names were and you sure as hell weren't their mother in any way other than appearance. As they hugged you and confessed how much they loved you, how worried they were and how glad they are to get to see you and that you're alright, you were still trying to assess the situation as best you could. Your thoughts were constantly interrupted as they climbed and moved around you by all the new sensations it cause throughout your new body. You haven't even gotten a chance to examine your new body in the slightest other than a glance in the mirror and you were feeling squished in some soft places and proportions and balance seemed different in others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as you began to wonder if you were a single mother, for some reason you seemed to have a guess at the kids names. You just seemed to think the boy looked like a Brandon, and the girl looked like a Sara. Then without any fanfare a man came through the door, he looked like someone you'd see modeling hiking boots in an Eddie Bauer or Lands End magazine. Before he even acknowledge you he said \"Brandon, Sara, get off of her, let her rest.\" \"come sit over here\" he said as he directed them to some chairs against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe he turned his attention to you and said \"I'm so glad you're doing better, it seemed pretty touch and go there for a bit.\" then ihe said</span></div></div>",

It was then that the doctor came in and broke your current train of thought. He said, \"I'm not sure we've been introduced, I'm Dr. Johnson. Now thay you're awake a nurse will by shortly to run a few tests and take a blood sample. then if all continues to go well we should be able to release you in 48 hours.\" He didn't really offer up any additional information about your situation, why you were a woman, why she was in the hospital, if this man, knew what happened, and then before anything else could occur a nurse entered and started checking the machines attached to you and taking a blood draw and the doctor slipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the nurse left you had to pretend to be the kid's mom and answer questions and entertain them a little, and you tried to act fairly feminine, which seemed at times to come rather naturally. Here and there however you slipped up and thought you would get caught and found out instantly. No one seemed the wiser though and soon the man gathered the kids and got them ready to go. He came to the bedside and gave you a kiss on the cheek and said \"It sounds like things are going well, when they let you out I'll be here to get you and take you home.\" then he added, if you'd like me to stay with you I can or you with me if you think you'll need the help for a while. Then when you're one hundred percent again we can get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll come by tomorrow around the same time\" he added as they left with the kids shouting \"Bye Mommy! see you tomorrow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was gone the doctor came back in...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">My bed had a fucking canopy. That was the first thing I noticed when I opened my eyes. Not the short kind either, oh no, the whole four-poster bed was covered in lace, fucking lace. What the hell! I sat up on the bed and started taking note of my surroundings, however everything I saw just made me more confused. What kind of man paints his room pink and purple, has two dressers, a vanity, wears a satin robe, wait a second, a satin robe? Oh shit! This had better not be what I think it is. I dreaded taking a look at my body but I knew I had to. Well, here goes nothing.<br>\r\nI looked at my body\u2026.. and screamed. Oh no, no, no. this can\u2019t be happening. I ran to the full length mirror hanging on one of the doors. I screamed again. I had fucking boobs! A nice perky C cup at that but what am I saying? I had boobs! I had hair too, long waist-length hair. Holy shit! This is bad, no this is a catastrophe. This is not what I signed up for. <br>\r\nYou\u2019re probably wondering what I\u2019m freaking out about. Well, let me tell you a story. One day, I was walking to work like an average American man, sipping hot coffee and whistling. I was on top of the fucking world because everything had worked right that morning. I\u2019d gotten my tie into a perfect knot on the first try, my pancakes had been perfectly round, hell I didn\u2019t even cut myself while shaving  \u2013 and I always cut myself. So here I was happy and smiling, about to cross the road.  I waited until the light was green before stepping on the road. Halfway across, I heard a deafening WHAM! Then I flew. I flew 10 feet, landed on my head and passed out.<br>\r\nI woke up in the hospital, tubes decorated my body and I was breathing through an oxygen mask. The doctor who had been checking my vitals then told me I had sustained a head injury which could not be treated and I was gonna die. Well, he didn\u2019t actually say it like that but that was what I heard. I hadn\u2019t even fully registered it when he went out and a man I didn\u2019t recognize came in. He walked to my bedside and what he said to me changed my life. Literarily. He told me about this program where dying people were given a second chance at life. My mind would be relocated into another person\u2019s body and I would live that person\u2019s life. So I thought, what do I have to lose? I had no family anyway. So, I agreed. In hindsight, I should have asked for the gender of the person whose body I\u2019d take over instead of just assuming it\u2019ll be a man because if I had I wouldn\u2019t be in this freaking situation right now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
