Seeing that it was... a Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s face, right in front of yours and blinking a couple of times back at you. Several blinks over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly scurry back as you look at the Legendary that was in front of you. You can\u2019t believe it! It was Mew, the Pokemon Mew! The legendary Mew! It looked at you as you sat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you slept on the outskirts of town today, no bit of you thought that you would actually be found on a legendary. You just wanted some rest on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy... hello there Mew!\u201d You say excitedly and with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Mew loved. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew!!\u201d</span> She said as she flew over and around your head. Taking several laps as it giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? You woke me up.\u201d You say with a laugh as you can\u2019t really be mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t answer, instead it flew high into the air, and then down at you. Your eyes open as you see it ram into your chest. Just enough to send you down on your back. You look down and see it laying on your chest and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew! Mew!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight... i\u2019ve heard that you are playful. Guess you are.\u201d You say as it flew off, only for a second as it then went under your shirt. \u201cH-Hey! Mew cut that out!\u201d You say with a laugh as it flew out and laughed itself. \u201cYou really are playful, just messing with a human like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew.\u201d </span>It said simply as it flew down to you, over your head as you feel it\u2019s small feet on your head. Suddenly it kicked your hair around, making it wild as you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay go ahead.\u201d You say as it messed up your hair even more. So for a long time you were gonna have bed hair, just great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew eventually got off, flying right in front of you as it turned around. Turning around and pointing it\u2019s tail to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayfully, she wagged it in front of your face and tickled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, Mew! Hehehe! Mew seriously!\u201d You say as Mew laughs itself. It was probably laughing as much as you were. You know you could probably just hit the tail away, but clearly it was having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let it have fun until it pulled away. Looking to the sky. \u201cMan what time is it? I did take a long nap didn\u2019t I?\u201d You say as you pull out your Pokenav. Pulling it and looking at the time. Only for Mew to come back down and land on your lap. Sitting there in a very cute manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Mew, say cheese!\u201d You say as you get the camera and go in for a Selfie. \u201cOr uh... Say Mew I guess...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew!\u201d</span> it said back, as you took the photo. There you go, proof that you met Mew. You don\u2019t want to risk and try to capture it at the moment. You two were getting along and lets face it... Mew would be far too powerful for any trainer you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I guess I got to go Mew. It was-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew!\u201d</span> it said as it flew up high. High above you and looking at you. You could tell it had anticipation, and you were gonna deduct what it wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more? Sure... go ahead. One more.\u201d You say as she it laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew took it\u2019s time thinking about it, until finally it got what it wanted to do. Smiling it flew right in front of your face, and suddenly... it\u2019s eyes glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s using a move, you didn\u2019t expect it but you guess it was. You wait to see what was happening, when suddenly you realised something. Was... Mew flying up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was above your head line, far above it. It kept going up. You were really confused, and it grew even more as you could feel the grass under you... get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a long while, until you suddenly realise something. Looking at the tree closet to you, it was bigger than it should be. Looking back to Mew, she was far above you and the grass was bigger than it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMew, are you shrinking me!\u201d You say as it didn\u2019t give a reaction. Instead you just went down and down, until one grass blade was enough for your entire hand to rest on. You stand up, not making much of a difference as you were now shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew\u2019s eyes stopped glowing, as it flew down to you. Doing a loop and looking. When suddenly it giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mew, this isn\u2019t fun! I-\u201d You trailed off, as you see Mew get closer. It was like a Dynamax version of itself, much bigger and much more powerful. You fall onto your rear as it gets closer, it\u2019s nose almost knocking you at this point as you can\u2019t believe the size difference.<br>\r\n\u2028Finally it flew up into the air. Far into the air as you could see it turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mew. Where are you-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew started to fly away, not before looking back at you and saying something. Not what Pokemon say, not her name. But words, and more than that a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cCome find me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Mew flew into the air. You could only watch as the giant Pokemon flew far into the air. As far and high it could go, until the giant Pokemon was out of sight, and you were left... by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a giant new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so I left it blank for the people who want to add and customise the story their way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was unreal, and yet it somehow was: you had been woken up by a playful - and almost all powerful - legendary who had put you through a series of silly games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't mind at first, since there was no real harm in letting said legendary in have some fun with you for a bit while also entertaining you, but things had gone south when Mew's playfulness turned into mischief and she shrunk you down to a pathetically small stature. You were barely bigger than the paw of an Eevee at this size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, if that wasn't enough, the mysterious move Mew had used to shrink you had also managed to turn a simple patch of grass into a thick forest, leaving you lost in the middle of it, so close and yet so far from Olivine City, in Johto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, basically, you were screwed, no matter how you looked at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your legs trembling, you slowly sat down on the ground, pondering your next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you had to do was clear: you had to find Mew and get her to give you back your size. After all, she was the one telling you to find her, no? The only question now was, how could you find Mew, who took off in a random direction? It would be already much if you managed to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned to yourself, thinking that the pesky legend was probably laughing while thinking about you now. Did she think of this as some game? Because you weren't enjoying yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" you muttered, putting a hand over your head while looking down, trying to figure a way out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, there wasn't much you could do while like this, but you couldn't stay like this, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at the sky, noting that the sun was about to set. If you had to do something, you had to move before night fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other thoughts you had suddenly vanished as an idea sprang in your mind. You still had your PokeNav! You could dial someone and ask them to come to your aid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally thanking Mew for at least shrinking your belongings along with you, you picked out the tool that was going to save you and searched for someone to call, hoping that they would believe you and not just laugh at your situation or even call you crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually picked a number and the PokeNav began dialing, but the result was unsatisfying: voicemail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn...\" you mumbled as you quickly dialed someone else, getting the same result, the same result you got for about three other times before finally giving up in frustration and putting your PokeNav back in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. What now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely alone. You didn't even have a Pokemon that could help you out in this dire situation; you briefly wondered if they would have shrunken along with you if you happened to have pokeballs on you at the time it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there for about five more minutes, surrounded by grass and enveloped in quiet. Then, you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever happened next, you decided to cross that bridge when you came to it; right now, you had to at least get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, remembering which direction you came from, you began a run through the towering blades of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, it didn't take you that long to get out of the 'woods'; you were actually able to find your way out in about five minutes, which was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got out, found yourself by the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately turned to head for Olivine City, but a thought halted you before you could take your first step: Mew had gone in the exact opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, you should have tried to go after her... you shook your head. The pink legendary was probably long gone by now!... But what if she wasn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered the last and only words she said you before taking off, 'Come find me'. Perhaps, that last game she wanted to play was a more wicked version of hide and seek? Perhaps Mew was just hiding close by and you had to find her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she wasn't, then you were just going to waste precious time and possibly stumble into some Pokemon or person, and it could end badly either way: you could get eaten by the former, crushed underfoot by the latter if you weren't careful enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought alone made you shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there by the road for a long while, trying to decide whether you should go find Mew or go to the city and get someone to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, after a long hesitation, you made a choice and hoped you didn't end up regretting it.</span></div></div>",

No if you wanted to get your height back, you were going to have to rely on someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who... well you were about to know, cause you were moving into Olivine City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way over, hearing the beach move as you know you need to go. You couldn\u2019t see much from your perspective, except for the giant towering lighthouse you can see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get close, but you know... it will take forever. No point waiting though, cause you need to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a couple of hours, you got into town! You got into the city, breathing hard and tired. After all, you were barely a couple of inches tall, and a small stroll was like a marathon to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you were in town, and you were moving in. The sun was going down, so you really should get someone\u2019s attention before the dark comes. Your home was on the other side of town, so that was away. You were too small to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go to the Pokecenter. Now you never had to heal your own Pokemon, because you don\u2019t have any. However you have talked to Nurse Joy, and have bonded with her. You doubt she actually remembers you due to how much people she meets, but you know she is nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you walk around some more, you hear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cChikorita!\u201d</span> A voice said as you instantly hid. You were out in the open, as you could do nothing at the point no matter how much you want. It would take a solid fifteen seconds to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing small is terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as a giant Pokemon come into view, and it was the grass starter. The Pokemon didn\u2019t stop you though, cause instead it just kept running. You watch it leave your view, and then you see a giant girl chasing after the Pokemon. With brown hair and a big white hat. A red and blue coulour scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikorita! Calm down!\u201d She yelled for a long while chasing her. She was chasing her Pokemon and left quickly as you breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not deny that... she was giant. The giant girl, didn\u2019t look that old but seemed so big to you. You need to get someone\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around some more, avoiding giant steps as you remember this street. You could go to the Pokemon Center, but... you could also go to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t that far as well, in fact the same distance. it may sound crazy, but you need to feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are having a bit of a mini heart attack at the moment. Being so small, and everything towering over you, you need someone you can feel safe with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunnily enough, that might by the Johto Gym Leader Jasmine. Now you don\u2019t know her personally, as you have never been in that kind of lifestyle. What you have heard about her though makes her sound kind, gentle and perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting her attention might be what you want. Plus as a Gym Leader, she has connections and powerful Pokemon! She can help you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was your plan, to the Gym. You go to walk and suddenly realise you were going the same direction of the giant trainer and the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move and go through, of course having trouble because even though it is one block around, that is far too much for you. You just know you will feel tired when you get to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd tired you did feel, very tired to the point where you wanted to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were not even at the gym at the moment. You barely cross the street!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay down, tired and on the outside of the Gym. That was far too taxing for you. Even worse, it seemed, because you did have to avoid and dodge some giants and giantesses that were around you. You did not want to be found by just a random person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have rethought your plan and actually have been looking forward to meeting Jasmine. She sounded perfect, and she was cute. A blessing in disguise maybe... maybe not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only imagine where Mew would be at this point. She just shrunk you and left, and she clearly wants you to follow and play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she have gone that far? If you remember the books correctly, Mew has been rumored to know every move. Which raises more problems clearly. If she knows Teleport.... or Extreme Speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh that was not something you wanted. How long are you gonna stay small?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up onto your feet, and you plan to move, however you stop when you realise a problem. You were... stuck outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun basically down as you move around. It was not like the gym was closed, as you can see lights inside. The problem is... the door is a slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels weight on the pressure on the floor, and it opens up in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for weight, well you don\u2019t have that all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d You yell, as no one was near you. You jump and try to make the door open, if only for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t going to, and you were stuck outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do? You can\u2019t get into the gym by yourself, you are far too small to make weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus the Pokecenter is far too away now. Looking around... you spot a home not so far away with a slightly open window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may be degrading, but you might have to go and live in that house for the night. You won\u2019t get spotted by whoever lives in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo maybe... you have to live under giants.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staying in someone's house, even if only for one night and because you were in desperate need, felt wrong. After all, if anyone living in there spotted you, there was no telling what kind of punishment they would have inflicted upon you, the highest chances being you getting simply tossed back out or, worse, stepped on, which could perfectly happen even if whoever lived in the house remained unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... you needed a shelter for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, swallowing your fear, you slowly took a couple steps away from the gym and towards the house, but something held you back: a girl, who you recognized as the person you saw before, was running towards the gym, her Chikorita running beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can still make it.\" you heard her say in a low tone, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chika!</span>\" the Pokemon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your heart swelling. The girl was heading your way... she could open the door of the gym for you!... Just then, you recalled where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess could open the door for you alright... <i>if you managed to not get stepped on by her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you realized this, the shoe of the girl was already hovering above you, crafting a huge shadow; hastily, you jumped out of the way as the large foot came crashing next to you, lingering for a moment before it disappeared as the door automatically opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you stood back up and, while the door was closing back up, you hastily slid inside. Being tiny did have some advantages, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, the door closed back up behind you, trapping you inside until someone came to open the door again, but you were fine with it: you planned to get someone's attention, possibly the gym leader Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of Jasmine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm late,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noted the girl from before apologizing  to another girl. A stunningly beautiful girl: Jasmine, the steel-type gym leader, who was just standing in front of the other girl, offering a feeble smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Chikorita ran off and I had to get it back. I'm sorry.\" the other girl spoke. You noted how quiet she was. When you previously 'met' her, you could hear her voice loud and clear as she called out to her Pokemon to stop; now, you could barely even hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... don't worry, that's alright.\" Jasmine replied, blushing a bit. Her tone was just slightly higher than the other girl's and, geez, between these two ladies, you could barely hear a word. Good thing your reduced state made everything sound louder. <br>\r\n\"We can have our match now, if you're, um, up for it. I don't mind.\" Jasmine finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl, whose name was still unclear to you, smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" she said gratefully, only causing Jasmine's blush to gain even more ground on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, apparently, these two were going to have a gym battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even having to think twice, you stood aside and sat by a wall: there was no way you could get the attention of one of the two giantesses while they fought, and you didn't want to be anywhere near the battlefield when you were this vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, watching giant Pokemon fight... that could be entertaining. Since you couldn't get their attention right now, you might as well watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as both trainer and leader walked on opposite sides of the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, since you're the challenger, you get the first move.\" Jasmine instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other just nodded her head to signal that she had understood, reaching in her bag to grab a Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could toss it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiko!</span>\" the green Pokemon beside the girl chimed, causing her to halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go first, don't you?\" she asked quietly, getting a confident nod from her Pokemon,<br>\r\n\"Okay then. You're up, Chikorita,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy cry, Chikorita ran to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rose an eyebrow. A grass-type against a certain steel-type? You were no trainer, but even you knew that such fight was uneven. This girl must have been a newbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then,\" Jasmine said, tossing a Pokeball,<br>\r\n\"Magnemite, come on out, please,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon Jasmine called popped out and cried its name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the battle began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, you just watched the two trainers giving silent commands and their Pokemon obeying, clashing with each other in an admittedly pretty good fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if the unknown girl at been at a disadvantage before, she fought like an expert trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, her Chikorita took down Jasmine's Magnemite, and put up a good fight against her Magneton as well before the green Pokemon was called back by her trainer and was switched with a Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your point of view, the Pokemon looked magnificent, majestic even. And, expectedly, it took down Jasmine's Magneton in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the type advantage, Ninetales stood no chance against Jasmine's strongest Pokemon: Steelix. The steel behemoth only used one Earthquake to knock out the poor vulpine while also shaking the whole gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blessed your decision to stay aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she returned her Ninetales, the other trainer smirked, though you couldn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blastoise,\" she called, tossing her Pokeball; a large, blue, bipedal turtle came out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Blastoise!</span>\" it cried its name, nearly deafening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hydro Pump, go,\" the trainer said. Her Pokemon obeyed without hesitation and pointed the two cannons in its shell towards Steelix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steelix, dodge!\" Jasmine yelled, worried for her Pokemon. This was the very first time you heard her voice so loud, and it was as beautiful as Jasmine herself was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, as fast as Steelix was, it still got hit by Hydro Pump and got sent flying into a wall by the sheer force of the water; it didn't get up after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Jasmine mumbled, rushing to her Pokemon to check if it was already, before returning Steelix to its Pokeball; then, she turned to the girl with a smile,<br>\r\n\"Well, um... looks like you win,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" the other replied, her Chikorita jumping around in elation, happy for her trainer's latest victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid trainer returned her Blastoise and approached Jasmine, who held out a gym badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also got up, deciding that this was a great moment to try and get the attention of one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been, um, a great battle,\" Jasmine admitted with a small blush,<br>\r\n\"So here's the Mineral Badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" she said, accepting the prize and storing it away, before saying,<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll be going now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope to see you again, Leaf,\" she said, before smiling and blushing again, <br>\r\n\"I look forward to a rematch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou halted. 'Leaf'? Was that the name of the trainer of Chikorita?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, realization dawned on you, while the two giantesses shook hands: this 'Leaf' was a traveling trainer, so if you could get her attention, you could convince her to help you find Mew during her journey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were a bit unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you didn't know if she'd be willing to help you out, and were far more sure about Jasmine to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to decide, you noted the two titanesses finally parting ways as Leaf began walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you had to do, whoever you had to pick, you had to do it quickly: Leaf was leaving!</span></div></div>",

After Leaf left the gym, Jasmine let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* That's the last one.\" Jasmine said. \"Now I can go join my friends on vacation!\" You didn't know that Jasmine had was planning to go on vacation. Then again, it was summer and now you wondered who her friend were. Your questioned was answered as you heard the door open as two girls walked in. One of them had fiery red hair and eyes, she wore a black shirt that was tied up in the front and under it was a red tube bra with a picture of a flame. She wore very baggy teal jeans that have three red knots on the bottom of each leg. Her jeans were held up by some sort of white cloth that had some sort of detail on one of the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl had reddish brown hair and blue eyes, Her hair was tied up by one pastel teal hair clip that resembled a flower. She wore a  pastel teal skintight suit and light blue gloves. The suit didn't cover her whole body as it exposes her belly. Just like her suit and flower accessory, she wore pastel teal shorts that expose her legs up towards her pelvis. She had straps that bucked her on the front and some that leaded to her thighs. She had a light blue holster on her right leg which match the color of her gloves, straps, and the base of her boots. The top of the boots were more of a teal color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew seen these girls before, it was Flannery and Skyla! You didn't know that Jasmine knew Hoenn's Fire-type Gym Leader and Sinnoh's Air-type Gym Leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine! I'm so happy to see you again!\" Skyla said as she went over to Jasmine to hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy to see you too Skyla!\" Jasmine said, hugging her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jasmine, ready to go?\" Flannery asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost, let me get my bag from my room.\" Jasmine answered. \"You don't mind waiting a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, take your time. We'll wait by the bleachers.\" Flannery said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have enough time, you were gonna have to join them in their vacation. You started ran towards the three girls. You saw Flannery and Skyla walking towards you, unaware that you were in their path. You dodged and weaved your way past the girl's gigantic feet and somehow made it unscratched. As soon as You made it passed them, Jasmine was already gone to get her bag. you decided to wait for her and jump on her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minute later.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for Jasmine to come back and you gained back a bit of your stamina. You then heard the sound of footsteps and rolling wheels. You were happy to see that Jasmine founder her bag. Her bag matched her dress and had a cute little Magnemite key-chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the wait!\" Jasmine apologized to Flannery and Skyla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Jasmine.\" Skyla said \"Now we can go to the hotel!\" You quickly grabbed onto the suitcase's key-chain as it passed by you. You were able to open the bag enough that you were able to slip inside. Once inside, you landed on some of her cloths. You thought this was good time to take a nap. You got into a comfortable position and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up, still in the suitcase. You stretched your arms and gave out a yawn. You had know idea what time it was nor where were you outside the suitcase, so you went to the bags opening from before and peeked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it wasn't a hotel, but it was a room of sorts. It resembled a small house with stairs leading to the second floor, the room had also a kitchen from where you were located. When you climbed out, you saw that the suitcases were leaning on the wall. Flannery's, from what you guessed, had a flames on it and a Torkoal key-chain. Skyla had a Sky theme on her suitcase and a Swana key-chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to see Jasmine, Skyla, and Flannery on the couch together, eating popcorn and watching a movie. The movie had Pokemon talking in English. You didn't know what the movie was about and you didn't have time, at the same time, you were getting a bit hungry. You saw that Skyla was holding a bowl of popcorn for the others to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the couch they were seated at and shouted at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Jasmine! Flannery! Skyla! Down Here! Help!\" You shouted at them, but it was no use, they had no reaction fro your screaming. The only thing to do now is to go for some skin contact. You saw that Flannery was still wearing her jeans, which would make the climb easier. Not that it would matter, but you were confident with your climbing skills and could try to climb up Jasmine or Skyla. You were still hungry and thought that maybe you could grab on popcorn kernel from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you go for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Climb up Jasmine and try to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Climb up Skyla and try and get her attention. (You then come to a choice between to continue climbing Skyla or Enter the popcorn bowl. Choosing the bowl will lead to an unaware vore route that you \"may\" get eaten by Jasmine, Skyla, or Flannery. Of course for the unaware vore route their would be chose to where they hear you and don't get eaten and one to where you are eaten, but don't die. I know the rules say \"No choice chapters.\" I'll try to make it as long as possible.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC:Climb up Flannery and try and get her attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two titaness girls began to spread and separate each other, you look left and right seeing them go. You were gonna have to make your choice, stay with Jasmine or go with this Leaf!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling pressured, you didn\u2019t have time to really think about it... as you just had to go! Your eyes open as you turn right, running to the trainer and not the gym leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run as fast as you can to catch up to this giant girl. Luckily she was waving goodbye and slowing her pace, which let you easily move and jump on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping over onto her sneaker as you hugged the shoelaces. You held for a long while, making sure you were safe and not going to be thrown around randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked for a long while, leaving you as you see her move around and go over to the door. Opening it up when it featured her weight, and then she left. Every step that she took, sent you for a wide as you just kept grabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it for a long while, you realise this might be the better options. Sure, there was a lot of evidence why staying with Jasmine was the better option, but this girl... her Pokemon was stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a Blastoise! And she bet Jasmine with her Pokemon. She was a trainer, so she was a traveller and... if anyone can help you not only find Mew, but also get your height back it might be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, you don\u2019t know anything about Leaf, except for the fact that she was a trainer, and she was... well a bit pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine, pretty as well wouldn\u2019t have the power to leave. She was a Gym Leader and had responsibilities, so this was the better option. At least that\u2019s what you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, Leaf was walking looking at her newly gotten badge, That made fourteen. Fourteen badges she has. Eight from Kanto and now Six from Johto. Granted because of her badges, these Pokemon battles have never been easy, but they were fun and she loved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most people are out to be the very best, Leaf was more out there for the adventure. When she gets the 8 from Johto, she plans to go to the other regions and get the Gym Leader badges there. After all she had to keep it up like her friends Red and Blue. Blue, who became a Gym Leader, and Red... who just kind of disappeared from the face of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked she put the badge in her Johto case and smiled. Putting it near her Kanto badge case in her bag. She was glad Blastoise was able to finish it up, but she would be lying if she was happy that she had to rely on her Pokemon. She has been with Blastoise since it was a Squirtle, so of course the Pokemon was strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita was the starter she got when she came to Johto, and well... she was a fighter. The amount of times Leaf had to chase that Pokemon to keep it in line was a bit crazy, but she was strong. Sadly, not strong enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was glad to have her in her team. Looking around at the sky, it was getting dark. Stay a night at the Pokecenter, and then continue her journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the pace, as you hugged the foot even more. How fast was this girl going, so fast as you were gonna get hurt if you let go. You did move away from her shoelaces, and climb up to her baggy sock. Much easier to get a hold on as she walks. You just hug on for dear life, knowing this was gonna be your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her walk in the direction of the Pokecenter, and pretty quickly she was there. Something that was a bit mind boggling as it would of taken you quite the journey, but for Leaf... she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in, and this was the first time you really grasped your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many people, inside of the Pokecenter. Everyone of them towered over you, to the point where you did not want to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, there was some Pokemon scattered around, closer to seeing you. A Corsola not so far away but it\u2019s female trainer. A towering young boy feeding his Rattata and Ratticate, both Pokemon having the power to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Leaf didn\u2019t pay them any mind as she walked up close. You were facing a counter, but Leaf was facing Nurse Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, i\u2019d like to rent a room.\u201d Leaf said as you heard the voice of Nurse Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood, now are you going to want a living room, or a Pokemon room.\u201d She said as Leaf knew the difference. Wasn\u2019t the first Pokecenter she stayed at. A living room is just for her, simply to sleep and is the size for a human. While a Pokemon room is a lot more spacice, to accomidated for Pokemon. A lot more expensive though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just a living room. Actually, if you can heal them as well, that would be great!\u201d She smiled and sure enough, her Pokemon got healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the chime and the room number that Leaf got, as she started to walk. You still hugging the sock of the girl as she walked down the halls. Away from all the giant people you ran the risk of being found by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf got to her door, twisting the key and pushing her way through. She pushed her way through and went into the room. A smile on her face as she was going to have a good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you also dispatched from the sock, taking a bit of a break as you were now in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you have to do now is get her attention, should be simple enough. All you got to do is _________</span></div></div>",

She removed her hat, placing next to Chikorita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer then went to lay on the bed, but halted in her tracks as she heard a faint noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening close, she could hear it again, over and over; and the more she listened, the more she figured out that it was someone's voice, calling out her name, but it was very distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor behind her, you called one more time,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, finally, the teen giantess turned around, but didn't look down right away, instead shooting silent glances around the room to locate whoever was calling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here!\" you yelled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly, the giantess heard you, because she glanced down, spotting you by her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from a slightly surprised look on her face, Leaf had literally no reaction to her discovery of a small man no taller than the peak of her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, were quite impressed by the towering height of the giantess and, for a moment, you nearly forgot why you were here, but you quickly found your composure and spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, h-hi!\" you said with a wave,<br>\r\n\"You're... Leaf, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf remained unmoving for a couple moments more, before she slowly made a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched a the brunette bent her legs, making her less towering but still quite big; her hand found her way to you as you were picked up by Leaf, who then stood back up, holding you between her fingers, not saying a word, although there was an inquisitive stare in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... h-hi,\" you repeated, not knowing how else you could strike a conversation with a nearly-mute giantess,<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sure you have a lot of questions, so let me explain please,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still said nothing, but moved her free hand, gesturing that your request was granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... so, first things first, I'm here because... well, because I saw you back at Jasmine's gym,\" you admitted. Leaf rose an eyebrow; on the bed, Chikorita kept napping, blissfully unaware of what was happening.<br>\r\n\"I was headed there because I wanted to get Jasmine's help, but then I ended up watching your match with her... speaking of which, you did pretty good out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf didn't show the slightest hint of a smile at your compliment, so you decided to go on,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So, after you finished, I thought I'd follow you, hoping that... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">don't mind the nerve, please</font>... hoping that maybe you could help me!\" you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf tilted her head to a side, letting her hair cascade down, still wearing an inquisitive expression, though it was more one of curiosity than one of suspicion now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... oh, right, I missed the most important part,\" you said, proceeding to explain,<br>\r\n\"You see, I'm so tiny because of an odd... 'experience' I had today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you began explaining everything, from how you were woken up by Mew, to how she played with you, finishing with said legendary shrinking you to this size before taking off, challenging you to go and find her in before leaving, gone to an unknown destination, and that was why you followed Leaf, hoping she could lend a hand and help you find Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of your tale, Leaf looked a little skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped - didn't she believe you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... I promise that everything I said is true, I don't know how I could-\" you trailed off, remembering something,<br>\r\n\"Wait, I actually do! Hold on...\" you said, digging in your pocket to retrieve your PokeNav. Who knew those pictures you took of Mew would help this much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you found the photo you were looking for on your device, you offered it to Leaf,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here...\" you said, before realizing how stupid this was. Your PokeNav was probably nothing more that a grain of sand to Leaf.<br>\r\n\"Uh... I don't know if you can see it...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf said nothing. Instead, she moved two fingers over, slowly and carefully picking the device from your hand. Sadly, even with how careful she was being, your PokeNav was far too small to be handed by someone so big. The result was that it got crushed the moment Leaf moved her hand and, surprised, let go of the pieces, which fell to the floor while Leaf blushed and shot you a sorrowful stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at whatever remained of your PokeNav, now officially hopeless. How else could you prove your good faith to Leaf, now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted when a large finger gently nestled itself between your chin and neck and pulled your head up, forcing you to look back at Leaf: she was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guessed you wouldn't risk all the trouble of following her and making up the whole 'Mew' story for nothing; if you had any bad intentions, you certainly wouldn't have willingly gotten her attention, not when you were about two inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... believe me?\" you asked, not able to mask the anxiety you were feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Leaf spoke, for the first time since you got her attention,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\" she said. You recalled just how quiet she was, and yet she had a wonderful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was no time to lose yourself over a pretty girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... s-so? Will you help me, please?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf's smile became slightly bigger, though not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered another nod. It may have been a simple gesture, but it made you feel massively relieved, to the point you couldn't help yourself from shouting, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Leaf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the smile of the teenage girl just grew a bit larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\"</span></div></div>",

Still you were glad this giant girl seemed to be nice. Moving down onto the bed, she sat down as she placed you in her palm. Letting you stand without much problem as she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Leaf has never been the most... social of people. It\u2019s not that she disliked people, far from it though. It is just she is not the most talkative, or the most socially accepted. A good contrast with the loud Blue and the also silent Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she can talk, and she needs to know more. \u201cSo Mew wants you to follow her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wants me to go find her. Then and only then she will grow my size big. Or at least I hope she will. The thing is, I can\u2019t make the journey myself. With how small I am, not to mention I don\u2019t have any other Pokemon, don\u2019t have much options.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cobviously.\u201d She said as that stung a bit, but she was being realistic. \u201cWhich is why you came to me, cause of my Pokemon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I saw your gym battle. I was back there and that\u2019s actually when I realised I wanted to get your attention. You were so strong, and you know... as a trainer you will want to catch a legendary right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, that was very true. However she was sort of doing her own thing at the moment. She looked down for a couple of seconds until she looked back at you. Determination in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it have to be instantly?\u201d She questioned as you look at her confused. \u201cYou see, i\u2019ve got six badges in this region, two away from a complete set. As you can understand, I want to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... okay I understand. Well, I guess drop me down and i\u2019ll go find another trainer to ask. Pokecenter would be full of it.\u201d You say a bit dejected, but thankfully she picked you back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I will still help you, but it won\u2019t be my primary objective. If you can accept that, I will be glad to go any Mew sightings on the way and try to help you.\u201d She said as that was interesting offer. She wanted the badges, but it seems she will help you if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s the best offer i\u2019m going to get. If i\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t even know where Mew would be. That Pokemon is a traveller right?\u201d You question as she nodded. Leaf has heard stories about the Pokemon like you have. \u201cSo I guess, i\u2019ll take your generous offer. Better than being by myself trying to track the legendary down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d She said smiling. You saw it her way. \u201cWhich means you get to stay with me.\u201d Leaf said, a bit bigger smile on her face. Glad you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiko?\u201d A voice said as you crane over. You completely forgotten about the Pokemon, the giant thing looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... hi?\u201d You say as Leaf lowered you down closer to the curious Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikorita, this is (Your Name)\u201d She said to her Pokemon. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be travelling with us, so treat him well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass type looked at you, a bit curious about you until finally she smiled. A big smile on her face as honestly... it did not calm you down. The smile seemed a bit... mischievous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like Leaf saw that as well. Grabbing the Pokemon\u2019s own leaf and tugging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like that, if you think thoughts like that I will put you back in your Pokeball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikorita!\u201d It said panicking and jumping around as it broke free. You got to admit, it was kind of cute when you saw the giant Pokemon pout to you, moving away and back to the bed, laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... young Pokemon?\u201d You say as Leaf nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung and stubborn. She got free earlier today, spotting a Spearow or something. I had to chase her all around the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah I know... I kind of saw it when I came in.\u201d You say as she looks at you for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool.\u201d She said as monotone as possible, as you expected more from that. \u201cNow, you lived in this city?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah. Geez, what am I going to do, not like I can keep up with the bills.\u201d You say to her thinking about real adult things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure things will work out in the end.\u201d She said as you had to assume. You don\u2019t like thinking about it, and Leaf could see. moving her other hand down, she grabbed something from the bag, opening it up. \u201cSee, six badges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... yeah I can.\u201d You say as you look over them, pretty impressed by her actions. \u201cWow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also have all of the Kanto badges. My team is on par with the elite four, and the best the gym leaders have to offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, guess I made a good choice.\u201d you say jokingly, although she didn\u2019t laugh. Leaf did find it funny though. \u201cWhich two are you missing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ones from Blackthorn City and Goldenrod City.\u201d She said as you blinked a couple of times at her. \u201cI suppose you aren\u2019t a trainer so you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d She said giving you the benefit of the doubt, something needed. \u201cThe gym leaders there are Whitney, who uses Normal and Clair, who uses Dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope Mew are at one of those towns.\u201d You say as that seems to be the thing that was primarily on your mind. Still she can\u2019t blame you, you were shrunken by the legendary and you want to get your height back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she can\u2019t see running into Mew soon. If she gets the chance, she will leap for it, but she doesn\u2019t see it happening. She looked down to you, as Leaf decided ________________</span></div></div>",

Keep our guest company in the meantime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wha-?\" you said, surprised by what Leaf just said, but you had no time to protest; by the time the giantess placed you on the bed, Chikorita had already gotten on all fours and was crying her name happily in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun.\" Leaf said as she got up, heading to a door that led to a small bathroom, disappearing inside as she closed the door, leaving you behind with Chikorita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid grass-type wasted no time and leaped in your direction, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiko!</span>\" she cried excitedly, not even giving you time to turn to face her as she laid down, bringing her paws around you, leaving you no way out of her 'embrace'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiko, chiko!</span>\" she kept saying, though you couldn't understand what she was actually saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only hazard a guess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, yeah, it's nice to meet you too, Chikorita...\" you said, not really sure whether that was the correct answer or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was the answer, Chikorita's smile widened as she leaned in closer. The air began carrying an overwhelming scent of fresh grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi, chiko,</span>\" the Pokemon spoke as she opened her mouth, her tongue slowly coming out as she gave you a couple of friendly licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you would have disliked it, but Chikorita's tongue tickled you, causing you to laugh uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, s-stop it!\" you stammered, unable to keep yourself from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that, Chikorita retracted her tongue in her mouth and grinned, before she brought the leaf on her head to you and began using it to keep tickling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chikorita, stop girl!\" you yelled, but she didn't listen and kept going for about a minute more, until you felt that you had no more air left in your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then, the Pokemon giantess pulled back, wearing a smile on her verdant face, and sat by you while waiting for you to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a couple of minutes, but you were eventually able to stop laughing and retrieve your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up, shooting a glance and a smile in direction of the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess this means that you like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Chikorita's smile became mischievous again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">How could I not like Leaf's cute little boyfriend...</span></u>\" she said, giggling to herself, perfectly aware that you had no idea what she was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing Leaf wasn't around to make the threat to return her to her pokeball into a reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really hated it in that sphere. Not that it was uncomfortable or anything, but Chikorita was a free spirit who hated being confined within such a limited space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh...\" you said, unable to break through the language barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita just giggled, her smile returning to a more friendly one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ta.</span>\" she simply said, waving a paw, telling you to not give it much thought. Then, she smirked once more,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the green Pokemon only let her grin widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in once more, then brought down the leaf on her head; somehow, you suddenly found yourself on laying on top of the leaf, before Chikorita flipped it, causing you to have a short flight, eventually landing on the back of the grass-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiko!</span>\" she said as you readjusted yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what was that for?\" you asked, but were completely ignored as the Pokemon began jumping around on the bed with you on her back; the result was that you looked like you were trying to hold on a Rapidash as it galloped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chikorita!\" you called, trying to get the Pokemon to stop as you began feeling nauseous, although, despite dizzying, the ride on the grass-type's back was kind of... fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita knew that, and, young and stubborn like Leaf told she was, she had no intention of stopping. It was the exact opposite, she was about to spice things up, which she did when she took a great leap and jumped from the bed to the floor, skillfully landing on all fours while also nearly throwing you off of her back; you dug your hands in the soft skin of the Pokemon after that, not planning on becoming a red stain on the floor so shook after you managed to get help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn elation, Chikorita began leaping around the room, truly acting like a Rapidash as she tried to throw you off while you hung on with all your strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, you laid belly-down onto the back of the Pokemon and pressed your knees into it as well, hanging on as hard as you could; each time you felt that you were about to let go, you tightened your grip, not even bothering wasting your breath as you knew that it would be pointless: Chikorita wasn't going to stop until she willed it, or until Leaf came out and stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Chikorita decided to stop on her own much much before Leaf came out of the bathroom; with one last jump, she leapt back on the bed and and flopped to the side, causing you slide off, marking the end of the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" you moaned, feeling sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita got back onto her legs and strolled over to where you were laying, leaning to give you a couple of gentle licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly sat back; Chikorita backed up and sat down by you, staring at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Enjoyed the ride?</span></u>\" she asked in her own language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... actually fun!\" you said her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been one thrilling ride, that was undeniable, but it had been pretty fun as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita's red eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi~!</span>\" she cooed, leaning in, beginning to nuzzle you. You returned the display of affection by rubbing a hand onto her cheek, making the Pokemon give soft cries of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door to the bathroom opened, letting Leaf walk out; you noted that she had her light blue top off, and was now in a black, sleeveless shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the eyes of the teen locked on the sight of Chikorita coddling you, and a smile appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're done.\" you unnecessarily stated, getting a nod from Leaf, who walked towards the bed, picking you from Chikorita's attentions, much to the Pokemon's annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chii...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself?\" Leaf playfully teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf let her smile grow a bit larger - she was so cute when she did that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since I plan to resume the journey early tomorrow morning, it's time to go to sleep.\" Leaf explained, sitting on top of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but where will I be sleeping then?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf shot you another smile. </span></div></div>",

Now, we are going to go to sleep right now.\u201d She said simply, moving over and grabbing you. She grabbed you from the Pokemon\u2019s back as she went over and began to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on the bed and getting comfy, now in nothing but a black top and black bottoms. Mainly because it was comfy, plus no one usually saw her in these. Guess she was going to change that with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cChikorita!\u201d </span>Her Pokemon yelled, jumping up and getting close. Leaf was a bit confused about this. The grass type usually slept at the foot of the bed, guess it was different at the moment. Thinking for a couple of seconds, she pieced it together that it was you. Her Pokemon has really taken a liking to you, hopefully the rest will as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... how am I going to sleep, on the pillow?\u201d You question, however looking at her Pokemon she has already decided she wanted to sleep with you. Taking a couple of steps back, you go to move but suddenly you feel yourself pulled around. Placed onto the bed as Leaf went under the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted it high and her huge body went under, her head on the pillow as she seems so much more casual at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Okay, guess I will just find whahh!\u201d You got cut off as you feel a hand come and bring you around. Dragging you around with her power as you felt yourself pinned to something that you did not expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held you, but what was pushing your back. It was soft, almost really. Confused about it, until you piece together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-L-Leaf? Why are you hugging me against your chest.\u201d You say really flustered about it. Behind you was her... boobs. It was actually boobs, not what you were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get cold,m\u201d She said simply, and you were a bit shocked seeing that she was not embarrassed about it at all. In fact, she was more then welcoming to it. Which left you confused for obvious reasons. This girl sure was a strange one. \u201cNot to mention, this is for my Pokemon.\u201d She said and though you were confused, you could see the giant Pokemon looking down at you. Leaf opened her hands away from you, when suddenly you could see her Pokemon dive into them. You suddenly got what was happening, as she brought you closer to the hug, and in front of you was the giant stomach of Chikorita, the Pokemon feeling you against her as she wore a Poke smile compared to you. She held you for a long while as you look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like i\u2019m in the middle of a sandwich.\u201d You say to her as she Leaf smiled and you could hear her Pokemon giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be warm here. Goodnight.\u201d Leaf said simply, as not only was she very direct, she was very caring. She is someone you really have to get use to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cChikorita!!\u201d</span> It said. You could see it\u2019s giant head looking down to you happily as it was technically sleeping wit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh goodnight Leaf. I guess, Goodnight Chikorita.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cGoodnight little guy, I promise I\u2019ll be the first thing you see when you wake up!\u201d </span></u>She said happily, as all three of you close your eyes. Right now, this was going to be fun and interesting, the unique step in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, it was because of feeling the pillow that was against you front go away. With a bit of confusion about it, you look around when suddenly... you could see a smiling face in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... good morning?\u201d You say to the Pokemon. You can tell by the window, the sun was barely coming up. Why would the Pokemon wake you up, and why is her face so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cHehehe, told you that i\u2019d be the first one you see when you wake up,\u201d</span></u> Chikorita said, as of course you could not actually understand what she was saying. Not one bit. Although her intentions were really obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her body around and... well you learned that she knew Vine Whip, cause two of them come out of her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved them to you, gently and smoothly lifted you up. Bringing you into the air and away from the grip of the trainer. Turning your head, you could see Leaf still sleeping on the bed, and you in the hand. The vines wrapped around you as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cReady to have some morning fun?\u201d</span></u> She questioned, as she moved down and got off the bed. Making sure not to wake her trainer at any point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Chikorita?\u201d You question for a long while as she moved down. She moved down to the ground and smiled. \u201cJust... nothing too violent okay.\u201d You say to her finally, as she brought you down. Her vine letting go as you see the giant leaf Pokemon looking down at you.<br>\r\n\u2028She seemed very eager to play with you, but she still let you rub your eye and wake yourself up. Waking yourself up and getting up as you wear a smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d You say as suddenly she looked back. \u201cOh right quiet. Well i\u2019m a bit awake now, so I guess i\u2019m up for a little fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt will help you rethink and not focus on the... problem at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cOkay, well i\u2019m really excited, and when I woke up you were the first thing that came into my mind. We have to make sure we don\u2019t wake my trainer up though. Anyway, let\u2019s play!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></u><br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t understand any of that, but it was clear what was happening.</span></div></div>",

Chikorita, I'd like you to remind that I'm really fragile, and that Leaf would probably be upset if you hurt me...\" you said, hoping that the green Pokemon would simply leave you alone, no matter if you had to humiliate yourself to achieve such goal: your safety came before your pride in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Chikorita's smirk went from mischievous to smug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">I'll keep that in mind. However, it's not like I'll hurt you...</span></u>\" she cried, before her smirk went back to being mischievous,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">That is, if you can run fast enough.</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiko, chiko!</span>\" Chikorita said, her vines one more emerging from the sides of her neck,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">You have five seconds before I put these bad boys to use!</span></u>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor good measure, the towering Pokemon began whipping the ground extremely near where you were standing, causing you to jump out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chi-\" a second whip to the floor made you jump back, and a third caused you to turn tail and start running from the Pokemon as fast as your tiny legs could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, you felt the ground begins to thump under your very feet as you heard the familiar cry of an overexcited Chikorita chasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that, you sped up while shooting a desperate glance in direction of Leaf, who was still sleeping in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LE-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Oh no, you don't!</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Vine Whip hit the floor next to you, cutting your cry for help short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, you switched direction and began running to another side of the room, with Chikorita emulating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon giantess was certainly gaining ground, and you were going to be powerless to stop her sudden burst of mischief once she reached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't she like you just yesterday!? Just what had gotten into Chikorita!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of options, you just kept running, with Chikorita's vines occasionally hitting the floor near you, each time threatening to give you a heart attack, yet Chikorita herself seemed to have no interest in catching you, seemingly more keen on enjoying her little game of cat and mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, you began 'running' out of breath and started slowing down. Something Chikorita picked up on, and wasn't really fond of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Aw, c'mon you Slowpoke!

No fair!</span></u>\" she cried as she reached the bed, making a poor attempt to get underneath as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly - and luckily for you - she was too big to slide under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chikoooo...</span>\" she cried in annoyance, before remembering about her vines; if she could just slide those under the bed, she could get you and could keep playing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi, chiko!</span>\" the grass-type laughed mischievously as she peeked under the bed where you were hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her red eye staring at you, but you knew she couldn't reach you, which filled you with relief... at least, until she began sliding one of her vines in, letting it snake its way towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Peek-a-b-</span></u><span class=\"clgreen\">ko!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vine stopped dead in its tracks, then retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita disappeared from sight, replaced by the more reassuring sight of a hazel eye which you recognized as Leaf's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved beyond belief, you slowly made your way out of your hiding spot, where an awake and very annoyed-looking giantess was waiting, holding Chikorita by the leaf on top of her head; you stood by the Leaf's bare feet, watching as Chikorita desperately tried to break free from her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repressed the urge to laugh at her, who was getting the Pokemon version of an earful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you turned your attention to Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Good morning, Leaf,\" you greeted, before looking away, embarrassed,<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the save.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Leaf let go of Chikorita, who scampered away, and bent down, offering you a hand to climb on; once you did, the giantess rose back and, smiling reassuringly, began stroking your back with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for that.\" she murmured, as quiet as ever,<br>\r\n\"I guess it was my mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! It wasn't, just... what's gotten into her?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf exhaled, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She likes chasing small things, like yesterday's Spearow.\" she explained,<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's okay, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not okay, it was all but okay: your back was stinging like hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf smiled sorrowfully, then cheerfully,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that I'm up, it's time I go get ready. I... we have a journey to continue,\" she said, as quiet as ever,<br>\r\n\"And as for you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave me with Chikorita!\" you quickly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiik...</span>\" the Pokemon spoke from a corner in the room, looking much like a kid after being scolded by their mother, which was basically what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf shot a brief glare in direction of her Pokemon, then looked back at you and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't just leave you sitting around, especially not with Chikorita. Not anymore, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Leaf was quick to think of a solution.</span></div></div>",

Holding it as you question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to call Chikorita back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, i\u2019m just giving her a babysitter.\u201d She said simply as she threw the Pokeball. It opened up and you saw a Pokemon come out of the light and materialise itself. Looking to the Pokemon, it was unmistakable what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellow with red highlights, a regal position, on all fours and most importantly, Nine tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... okay?\u201d You say as the Pokemon stretched out of the Pokeball, Chikorita being just as confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf learned her way forward and placed you right onto the ground in front of the giant fire Pokemon. Her eyes instantly locked onto you, a little bit shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to get ready, Ninetails, can you look after my little friend and make sure Chikorita is nowhere near him.\u201d Leaf said as the Pokemon looked up from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Leaf, I don\u2019t think this is-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNinetails.\u201d</span> The Pokemon interrupted you, very loudly as you look to it, then back to Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s a good Pokemon,\u201d Leaf murmured. You don\u2019t know if that was because she just woke up, or that is how she usually is. \u201cGood luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf walked and went to the bathroom, closing it behind you as you look to the fellow human leave. The shower turning on soon after that and then... a sound behind you. It sounded kind of like a purr, or whatever the fox equilivent is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you could see Ninetails, smiling down at you. It\u2019s tail up and dancing behind her. Even from this scary angle, she really looked majestic. You have never seen one so up close before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t say anything, but instead Ninetails brought her paw over you, and you knew what was going to happen. She brought it down slowly on you, as she pinned down. Smiling as she held the little human tight under her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t uncomfortable, but clearly it was to keep you under her paw and make sure you weren\u2019t going to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would Leaf thinking leaving you alone with two Pokemon would be better than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd well, it was. Ninetails was one of the first couple of Pokemon Leaf got, back when she was a Vulpix. Hence there was a strong bond between the two. She trusts Ninetails and for good reason. While she has her paw on you, she wasn\u2019t going to try anything besides that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cyellow\">A little human, how curious?\u201d</span> Ninetails said with a smile, <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThis is so odd?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cMew shrunk him down.\u201d</span></span> Chikorita picked up moving away from the tails. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHe\u2019s gonna be travelling with us now!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cIs he now? Well, I like that.\u201d </span>She said, her toothy grin down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHehe, Me too. Ninetails, I want to play with him too!\u201d </span>Chikorita said moving her way in, but the Pokemon got blocked as a couple of tails got in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cLeaf wants me to make sure you don\u2019t play with him, and I will. You just sit over there and watch.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey no fair!\u201d </span>Chikorita complained, only to get a chuckle from the other Pokemon. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYou\u2019re playing with him!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cLeaf didn\u2019t say anything about me playing with him, just you. You can try to... take him from me. If you are feeling bored enough?\u201d </span>She questioned, daring the grass type to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cFine, whatever he likes me more.\u201d </span>Chikorita said not even going down that route. Not only is Ninetails evolved and a stronger Pokemon, she also had the type advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWe will see if he still feels that way, after i\u2019ve had my fun with him.\u201d</span> Ninetails said her eyes back down onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest under the paw, watching the entire interaction. So Ninetails is protecting you, it does seem that way as she shooed Chikorita away. Plus her paw, while on you was not hurting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNine?\u201d</span> She questioned, as you had your eyes opened due to suddenly being talked to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... hello?\u201d You say as she smiled down. Slowly but surely, the Pokemon brought it\u2019s head down to you, or more accurately it\u2019s nose. It came right for you and you let the nose not only poke your chest, but sniff you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNinetails.\u201d</span> She said, a grin on her mouth as she seems to like the way you smell. Which is really weird, cause you haven\u2019t taking a shower since yesterday morning. Before the events with Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she raised her paw off of you, as you feel fine at the moment. Slowly getting up, until finally, you feel something else coming for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of her tails, as it came for you and wrapped around you. You raised your arms as you feel a soft tail envelope you and soon enough grab you. Lifting you into the air and high above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Woah!\u201d You say as you feel the tail move, bringing you close to the Ninetail\u2019s smirk. Okay, so this Pokemon is playful, and seems to really like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she hasn\u2019t hurt you yet, and if anything is going out of it\u2019s way to not to. Also seems to be a bit of a tease, as she turned her head to Chikorita, the Pokemon pouting and angry in the corner as she wanted to have fun with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this Pokemon wasn\u2019t so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Careful Ninetails, just in case you... actually this feels pretty soft.\u201d You say feeling her tail as she smirked even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWell look at that, he likes me more already.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cNo he doesn\u2019t!\u201d </span>Chikorita said, as maybe she shouldn\u2019t of been so violent towards you. Now half mad about herself for doing it. That was a dumb move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Ninetails, she took her glance back to you and finally has decided what she was going to do with you and your small body.</span></div></div>",

Plus, she was very loyal to Leaf, so if Leaf gave specific orders not to let Chikorita play with you, then Chikorita herself wasn't going to lay a single paw on you until Ninetales wasn't called back to her Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling to herself, Chikorita turned away from Ninetales, a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales turned back to you, gave a soft cry of her name and fully removed her paw from before sitting in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks?\" you said, grateful but not still willing to let your guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Ninetales gave a soft, reassuring cry of her name, before you noted that her tails were wiggling behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before one of them extended towards you; now, you were no Pokemon Professor, but you had read that a Ninetales had a certain ability to place a curse on anyone stupid enough to touch their tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those tails were about to touch YOU right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek!\" you yelled, jumping back,<br>\r\n\"You're trying to curse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail stopped in mid-air for a second; the golden-furred Pokemon blinked twice, before she let out a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Don't be silly.</span></u>\" she barked, the tail resuming its descent towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped back once more, only to bump into a fluffy, warm wall; looking back, you noted that the wall you had bumped was just another one of the several tails of Ninetales, which you had just touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body froze up as terror settled it, but the Pokemon only laughed as she wrapped the same tail you bumped into around your body and lifted it off the ground, letting you lay on it as if it was a beanbag chair. A large beanbag chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh?\" you stammered, noticing that nothing was happening; if anything, you were just put somewhere a hundredfold comfier than the under-paw of Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">I just thought I'd give you a more comfortable place to lay on than the floor, sweetie,</span></u>\" she cooed, or rather purred, moving her tail around so that it looked like a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing, and resisted the urge to give the tail a hug. It was so smooth! It felt like laying on a warm cloud that was laying on top of another cloud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales smirked briefly - Chikorita was probably busy biting her leaf off at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Nine, Nine-tales,</span>\" she spoke, sounding just as soothing as her trainer was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost felt like going to sleep again, after Chikorita had woken you up so early in the morning; you nearly gave in to the temptation, but made a great effort to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more tails joined you, one landing on top of you and the other joining the one that was already under you, forming an ocean of fur you couldn't hope to swim out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... warm...\" you muttered, hypnotized by the warmth the Pokemon emitted and by the smoothness of her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales chuckled and glanced at Chikorita with a look that screamed triumphantly, 'He's mine'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chikoo!</span>\" the grass-type cried, annoyed, rushing towards Ninetales, who merely moved the remaining six tails to form a barrier that kept Chikorita from reaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Tut tut.</span></u>\" the Fox Pokemon said, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Nine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith  a groan, Chikorita once more walked away, a sour look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales simply smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, for some time, there was complete silence in the room, until Leaf came out of the bathroom, fully dressed and ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, seeing her two Pokemon and not you made the trainer look at Ninetales with a curious expression, only to offer a relived smile when the vulpine parted two of her tails, revealing you laying on the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, girl,\" Leaf said while leaning in to pick you with a hand, using the other to pet her Pokemon on top of her head and under her chin, causing her to growl happily in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Leaf called the Pokemon back in her Pokeball, not before she had given you one last smile though; then, the brunette headed over the bed, grabbed her bag and hat and put them on, instructing Chikorita to follow as she walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf eventually got back to the lobby of the Pokemon Center, where she paid her rent for the night to the Nurse before leaving; the sun of Olivine City showered both you, her and Chikorita, the sound of the tranquil sea filling the ears of the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice day,\" you commented, before looking down,<br>\r\n\"Perfect for a beach day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled not to think about Leaf wearing a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same Leaf just giggled to herself in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... where are you going next?\" you wondered, before letting out a sigh,<br>\r\n\"Or, I guess, where are WE going next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess brought two fingers to your back and began petting, much like she did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're going to...\"</span></div></div>",

Really close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither have I,\u201d She said, even though you two were close she was not really being loud. Showing how quiet she was use to. \u201cThe Gym Leader there i\u2019ve heard uses Normal Types. So I will be going there first. If we see Mew along the way, we of course will detour, however that\u2019s the plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell honestly, that\u2019s all I can hope for.\u201d You say wearing a smile back to her. She headed around and walked outside, her fingers covering you as she didn\u2019t want you to get seen in the Pokecenter. After handing the key back to Nurse Joy and getting all her things in order, she began to leave. She even recalled Chikorita, as a bit of punishment for playing with you before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left and walked away with you going through the door. It was going to take a day of travel. If she didn\u2019t get sidetracked she could make it before night, however as a Pokemon Trainer, sidetracks are very prominent. Walking back up to where Mew shrunk you, she plans to go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stuck in her fingers for a long while, as she made sure to not only hold you but make sure you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to the edge of the city, and as the number of people went down she started to pull you out. Pulling you out and placing you on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let you sit there as you could see the giant world above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, so we\u2019re finally going now.\u201d You say to her as she shifted her eye around and looked at you in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall.\u201d She warned as you appreciated. \u201cWe are, the Route for Goldenrod requires me to move through Ecruteak City, and then down to Goldenrod.\u201d She said giving you the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, I guess i\u2019ll be on the lookout for Mew.\u201d You say to her, as she can\u2019t help but frown a bit. She doesn\u2019t see this legendary showing us as even a real chance. Still you were being hopeful, which of course was a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked for a little bit more you commented. \u201cHey, that\u2019s where I got shrunk.\u201d You say pointing to the place you were sleeping. \u201cCan we check it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf looked at you, seeing it as a little detour. She listened and she got moving, heading over. \u201cWhy would you just sleep in the wild?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s near the city, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. I know, i\u2019m pretty stupid.\u201d You say as she can\u2019t argue about it. Moving and going away, she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, let\u2019s just keep going. I want to get to Goldenrod before dark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go with her because... well you don\u2019t really have a choice in the matter.

She will want to use her strongest Pokemon considering how many badges i\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer name is Whitney.\u201d She said as you try to recall any info about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah her... i\u2019ve think i\u2019ve heard her in passing. She\u2019s the Goldenrod one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Leaf said about to show you that she has done her research. \u201cThere has been a lot of stories about her stubborn and childish she is, so that could be annoying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d You say thinking about a girl described as that. Would be more than trouble for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for strategy, I will just bring in my strong Pokemon and overpower her. Although her Milktank could be trouble. Blastoise should be able to outlast that Milktank though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight... Blastoise. I saw it the other day, was it your first Pokemon?\u201d You question as she did get a smile about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was my first one, back when he was just a Squirtle. He\u2019s grown with me, and I wouldn\u2019t have most of my badges without him.\u201d Leaf said with a smile as you can\u2019t help but wear a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now I know three of your Pokemon. Speaking of which... your Chikorita, I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s only like that because she likes you.\u201d Leaf said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, After this punishment i\u2019m sure she will be more careful with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That\u2019s good I guess.\u201d You say back to her with a smile. Now far into the route connecting the two cities you ask her more. \u201cSo what other Pokemon do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually have a lot more, to the point where my PC is pretty full.\u201d Leaf said with a smile. \u201cI have a Sandshrew, a Pigeot, A Ditto, A Doduo-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what Pokemon do you have on you?\u201d You question even more just wanting to know. She looked at you for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have only four on me, just in case I need to catch some more. There is Chikorita, Blastoise, Ninetails and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t finish that, as you both heard a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head, while you got a bit scared and hugged her neck. A little bit frightened, but given your size it made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What was that?\u201d You question just wanting to be sure. Moving your eye around and looking over to Leaf. She was prepared, grabbing her Pokeball and ready to toss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be a trainer looking for a battle, it could be a Wild Pokemon she could honestly catch. Regardless, she was going to show you her fourth Pokemon she was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked to the sound, she saw that it was ____________</span></div></div>",

Judging by the way he was dressed, he appeared to be one of those bug-catchers she couldn't get enough of beating back in Kanto, and even here in Johto, they kept 'bugging' her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf giggled at her own lame joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you! My Pokemon evolved just recently, so let's have a battle and put it to the test!\" the other trainer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Leaf's shoulder, you shot the guy a bothered look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we even care?\" you whispered to Leaf, who giggled,<br>\r\n\"Just walk away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet you, and watch.\" Leaf replied, so quietly that the bug-catcher heard nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess shot the trainer in front of her a confident smile and held her Pokeball up, accepting the challenge; the bug-catcher grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" he shouted, holding out a Pokeball as well, <br>\r\n\"Then let's begin with this, Metapod!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the Pokeball was tossed, a shell-covered green Pokemon popped out, causing Leaf to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese guys really had a one-sided mind, and Metapod was their trademark Pokemon; the only worse people were those fishermen trying to take her on with their team consisting solely of Magikarp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the Pokeball she was holding, Leaf pondered something for a moment, before putting it back, deciding to show off later. Instead, she grabbed a second Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninetales.\" she called, tossing her Pokeball, letting the majestic, nine-tailed fox come out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">What, do I have to play the babysitter again?</span></u>\" she cried, before looking in front of her, noticing some guy with a Metapod; much like her trainer, Ninetales sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was even worse than babysitting Chikorita!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, Ninetales turned to shoot Leaf a glare, but spotted you on her shoulder and the frown instantly turned into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Okay, guess I'm doing this...</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have the first move!\" the bug-catcher spoke confidently, leading you to wonder if he was even aware that his Metapod not only had a huge type disadvantage, but was facing a fully evolved Pokemon as well; that, and Metapod commonly knew only how to use Harden, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninetales, Flamethrower.\" Leaf commanded, interrupting your thoughts as you focused on the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales did as told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was pretty predictable... only it wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metapod, use String Shot!\" the trainer ordered; his Pokemon instantly shot a thick string from its mouth... only it wasn't aiming at its opponent, but rather aimed at a nearby branch. The string stuck to it, causing Metapod to literally fly away, dodging the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, surprised. Could String Shot even be used like that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Metapod, use Harden and attack!\" the bug-catcher commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf huffed. Harden, to attack? Come on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the giantess was shocked when Metapod followed the order, hardening its shell, before using the momentum of String Shot to fling itself at Ninetales, who hastily jumped back as the other Pokemon smashed the ground with a steel-hard shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf was surprised, and so were you, but your giant caretaker soon smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A combination of Harden and String Shot to use a defensive move as an attack... clever.\" Leaf commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the bug-catchers she had faced so far were as dumb as their Metapods' shells were hard, but this one made the exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be interesting, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle between Ninetales and Metapod continued only for a bit longer, before the vixen finally managed to hit the opponent, knocking it out with one, super-effective blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was a Parasect, who put up more than a fight that Metapod did, and even managed to paralyze Ninetales with Stun Spore, but in the end, it was no match for the much more experienced fire-type commanded by Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left the bug-catcher only with one Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here comes my ace! Venomoth!\" he called out as he threw his last Pokeball, letting out a large, purple-grey moth with huge eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf hesitated for a moment, then held Ninetales' Pokeball up and called her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's paralyzed, so I'll let her rest,\" she whispered to you, before holding out another Pokeball,<br>\r\n\"Now, remember my fourth Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragonite.\" Leaf spoke, throwing her Pok- did she just say 'Dragonite'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes glued to the sphere, you watched as it opened and out came a yellow dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were bewildered, Dragonite were so rare to find that people believed they didn't exist! How did Leaf manage to catch such a powerful beast...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the bug-catcher seemed as surprised as you were, but didn't give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Venomoth, use-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extreme Speed.\" Leaf ordered; Dragonite flew towards its opponent, so fast that it practically disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenomoth didn't know what hit it when he was sent flying and crashed into a tree, getting knocked out in one attack; by the time the bug-catcher looked back at Leaf, she was already calling back a very satisfied-looking Dragonite back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're so powerful! I didn't stand a chance!\" Leaf's has-been opponent stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf simply smiled and turned around, wordlessly waving as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're so powerful! I wouldn't stand a chance!\" you stuttered once Leaf put some distance between her and her ex-opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush. Bug-types aren't that powerful, but they are pretty bothersome, as you saw with Ninetales... who I'm going to have to heal once we get to Goldenrod.\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to know what you're doing very well...\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am the third most Powerful trainer in Kanto, so I'd say so.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very modest, are you?\" you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf brought a hand to you and poked you in the middle of the chest in response, knocking the air out of your lungs and nearly causing you to fall off of her shoulder; luckily, you were quick enough to grab onto a strand of hair and pulled yourself back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What was that for!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf stuck her tongue out in response and kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, hoping you weren't going to meet anymore trainers... and that you weren't going to face anymore surprises from Leaf along the way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Leaf honestly destroyed that Pokemon Trainer with no care, she went on with her journey. She began to move for a long time, as you two chat. So she had a Dragonite. Apparently she caught her in the Safari when she was just a Dratini, and trained her up to a powerful Pokemon. To say she was impressed about it would be an understatement. This Pokemon not only had high stats, it took to a Pokemon battle like it was bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, seems like you lucked out. I mean, can you even beat a Dragonite?\u201d You question her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only lost twice. Once when I was using my Blastoise in a test match. He skilfully defeated her. To say she was angry about that would be an understatement. On the other side, it was a Tyranitar.\u201d She said as you listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, a Tyranitar bet it?\u201d You say back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the oddest thing to me. There was this trainer, a couple of years younger then me and with red hair. Said his name was Silver. He confronted me, and both of us fought for a long time. I won the battle, but his Pokemon were so much stronger than I thought it was. Not to mention, the way he faced me... it was almost like he had a vendetta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, glad I ended up with you rather than him.\u201d You say with a smile. \u201cAlso, when it comes to Pokemon, you\u2019re really passionate. You talk so much more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I?\u201d She questioned as she moved on, almost like it was some kind of joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cHop.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cHop Hop.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cPip! pip! Hoppip!\u201d</span> A sound said as you paid attention. Turning your head and looking at a herd of Hoppips. The Pink Pokemon all in a bunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey look at that, a Bunch of Hoppip\u2019s.\u201d You say to her, however one faint look at her and she just kept on looking. Getting you to question. \u201cWhat not going to catch it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are not really interesting to me. I want to catch Pokemon I like, not the ones I don\u2019t.\u201d She said as you guess you could understand that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell can\u2019t argue there. Still, personally I really liked them.\u201d You say to her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe you should of caught one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a while and laugh. \u201cYeah, and carry around a beach ball size Pokeball. I\u2019ve never actually caught a Pokemon before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you will, on this journey of yours.\u201d She said with a smile, as you did give that a long think. Maybe you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally here, not much trouble it seems.\u201d She said with a smile. Despite that admittedly courageous trainer, it has been smooth sailing to Goldenrod. Smiling as she walked around, to the inner city as she looked around. Now while she could go over and face the gym right now, she does decide not to do that. There was about... an hour and a half of sunlight, and there was a couple of places she wanted to go to. Not to mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeaf... i\u2019m hungry.\u201d You whine to her, as you really have not eaten anything all day. She wasn\u2019t exactly the one to carry food with her, well human food that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the city she moved you around and held in her palm. You two discussed this and came to the conclusion it was the best way. Her fingers up to stop your sight from most people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am too, but i\u2019m not complaining about it.\u201d She said simply. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some food, but after that there are a couple of spots I want to check out. Apparently there is a day care on the outskirts, not to mention a Bike Shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Bike Shop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiding a Bike would of cut that trip time in third, i\u2019ve been meaning to get one my last one broke.\u201d She said as you gave her a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do buy one, can you buy one with a basket so I can ride up there.\u201d Despite her not showing it, Leaf found this idea to be super cute. She was so going to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst food though, and where was she going. Not to be a girl too stubborn, she moved around and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to a civilian. An old lady in fact. \u201cHi, i\u2019m just a trainer who was visiting. I was wondering, if you can tell me where the best place to eat will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello dear,\u201d The woman said, as you hide behind the not threatening girl\u2019s fingers. \u201cWell there is this delightful sweet shop not too far from here, down that street. If you and your little boyfriend wants to go to eat somewhere, I would say there. Hi there sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so she\u2019s waving you and that means spotted you. You peek your head out at the old woman and wave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a giant smile as she just left, and you had to comment. \u201cShe seemed worryingly too relaxed about seeing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(She\u2019s the Daycare Woman by the way)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf moved on and followed her instructions, walking down the street as she kept her eye out. It was really easy to spot it and she wore a smile. She was hungry just like you, so she was going to look forward to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked a couple of steps closer, when she suddenly stopped. There was a lot of people in there, so maybe she should hide you better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if you were going to be this small for a while, you were going to have to get use to being in a crowd of giant people. She did the polite thing and looked down to you, giving you the question there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to hide, or be out in the open?\u201d She questioned. You paused for a couple of seconds as you look at her. Really giving it another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think _________\u201d</span></div></div>",

I just happened to notice your little boyfriend, why is he so small, how is it possible, he's very cute, I'm almost kind of jealous-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl kept speaking, you saw Leaf blushing as the pink-head mentioned that you were her boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, seeing as Leaf was saying nothing, you spoke up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss,\" you said, raising your voice a little, getting her to stop to look at you,<br>\r\n\"I'm so small because of a Pokemon... and we're not dating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means you're available!\" she exclaimed, leaning in so close that Leaf had to take three steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who're you?\" she asked, shooting a wary look<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stopped for a moment, blushed, then began rubbing the back of her head in a flustered manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I'm sorry, I got really excited!\" she apologized.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell about that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, you got the chance to take a good look at her; she was wearing a white and pink shirt and shorts upon striped socks fitted into a pair of sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Whitney, by the way.\" 'Whitney' finally introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... 'Whitney'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Leaf exchanged a look, before she turned to the pink-headed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the gym leader here, by any chance?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yup! That would be me!\" she said in a cheerful tone, before offering a knowing smile,<br>\r\n\"Why, do you want to take on my gym?\" she asked, her eyes then fixing on you as she winked,<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like I c-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be your challenger.\" Leaf quietly stepped in and, for a moment, Whitney's gaze and hers met in a competitive manner... right before Leaf's tummy loudly reminded her that she had other plans before the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... right after we catch some lunch.\" Leaf muttered with a blush; your own stomach grumbled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case...\" she said, grabbing Leaf by the hand, starting to drag her back to the shop, catching Leaf by surprise, <br>\r\n\"I'll be happy to treat both you and your little friend to lunch! I wouldn't want you taking me on on an empty stomach, hehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Leaf could reply, she realized that nothing was going to stop Whitney and quietly grabbed her hat, moving it over to her shoulder, muttering,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump in. I'll save something for you, promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think twice and did as told, understanding that Leaf meant to hide you so you had no more unwanted attention; once you landed, Leaf put her hat back on as she was dragged back into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, both trainers walked back to the Goldenrod Gym; along the way, Leaf let you out of your 'safe spot' to let you eat whatever she had gotten for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the two giantesses you were with were having a conversation, though you were far more focused on filling your stomach than listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me,\" Whitney was saying,<br>\r\n\"How many badges do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have six.\" Leaf replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, you must be super tough! I'll have to use my best Pokemon to defeat you! Hehehe!\" the gym leader replied excitedly, thrilled by the idea of an actual challenge; she usually beat her opponents rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney and Leaf eventually arrived to the gym, where the former, smirking confidently, headed straight for the battlefield; Leaf followed quietly, standing on her end of the field while the pink-haired gym leader stood on the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney wore a smirk of determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's get started straightaway! You don't need me telling you the rules, do you?\" she asked, holding a Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf shook her head, then grabbed her own Pokeball; the two trainers then tossed their spheres in the air, officially starting the match.</span></div></div>",

You see it land down in front of Leaf, as Chikorita came out. Ready and raring to go. You wear a smile seeing her once again, although you were glad you were not near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Whitney, she tossed out her Pokeball and out came Girafarig. Both of them ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo get her Chikorita.\u201d Leaf said as you speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You got this!\u201d Chikorita turned her head, seeing you and grew a smile. Not only was she going to prove herself, she was gonna impress you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady!\u201d Whitney said very loud about it. So the battle began. She brought out Chikorita first because as her weakest, it makes sense to face Whitney\u2019s weakest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever... well she was not on the level of the Pokemon she was facing. You could see Chikorita really try and beat the Pokemon. A Razor Leaf as well as Vine Whips. Neither of them were going to work, as Girafarig held the Pokemon in place with Psychic, and hit it with a Shadow Ball! Your eyes wide open as you see the Pokemon down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne hit...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReturn.\u201d Leaf said as she looked at the Pokeball. \u201cThank you for trying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarely any damage to Girafarig! Easy win!\u201d Whitney said with a playful taunt. Leaf responded with tossing her own Pokeball, as down came Ninetails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon ready to fight, and when it looked at you, she was going to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the battle continued again from the loud girl and the quiet girl. The fight lasted for a long while, as both of them were high level although Ninetails clearly had the advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the way she was moving, just elegantly dodging around and avoiding it. The way she moved was... memorising in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it took a good Will O Wisp, Flamethrower combination to get it. The Pokemon got hit hard, and it fell back. After a few more, the Pokemon was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetails turned back to you two, and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI hope that impressed you.\u201d</span> She said, doing what Chikorita tried. That could prove troublesome for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Just because you bet one, don\u2019t get cocky! Here comes Clefable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new Pokemon came down and landed in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\u201cClef!\u201d</span> It said ready for battle. Seeming like a giant pillow to you. You actually enjoy watching this as it started. Leaf giving out quiet commands, Whitney giving loud commands. It would seem they were quite different, still got along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Clefable against Ninetails, it was a lot closer. Ninetails was a bit hurt from her bout with Girafarig, but she was willing to go. The Clefable had a lot of moves though. Light Screen to stop Flamethrower, Will O Wisp couldn\u2019t get a good hit in and none of her other moves worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Clefable had a good Thunder and although Ninetails dodged a lot, one hit that happened really hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t good, she can\u2019t take another!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf didn\u2019t waver though, as she made sure to use her Pokemon\u2019s talented movement to not only avoid, but get her hits in. When the Will O Wisp was hit, she started to make good moves. Light Screen didn\u2019t work on every side, and with the amount of time she moved around Clefable was a sitting Ducklett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem it finally ended. Another well placed Flamethrower to send the Pokemon down. However Clefable got one move as well, a powerful Thunder Wave that left the Pokemon stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo although Whitney is down one Pokemon, Ninetails couldn\u2019t survive. Still she came back and wore a smile on her face. Twitching because of the Thunder Wave. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cO-Once again. I co-ome out-t Vict-toriu-us.\u201d </span>She said as she was not ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinetails return.\u201d Leaf said bringing her Pokemon back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got to get rid of this last one and Ninetails will be easy pickings! Come on out Milktank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant cow did just that, dropping right into the middle as it flexed.<span class=\"cpink\"> \u201cMilk!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the ace. You gotta be careful.\u201d You look to Leaf\u2019s face as she had a serious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ace is better.\u201d And with that, she brought her ball and tossed it down. Tossing it down onto the field as you see her giant and large Blastoise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy.\u201d You had to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBlast!\u201d</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy win!\u201d She said, as they both started to act. Blastoise going in as well as Milktank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know who was going to win. You could see that Milktank was getting the advantage though. Both took good hits, but with Stomp and Milk Drink, Milktank got the better out of the two. Blastoise also had more range moves such as Hydro Pump. He\u2019s ace not being able to be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilktank healed and Blastoise got hurt. \u201cLeaf, what are we going to do!?\u201d You question wanting to know. Looking to the side and seeing the giant Pokemon trainer that was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she was confident, waiting and biding her time. You don\u2019t know what, but as it turns out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s start the Rollout!\u201d Whitney said to her Pokemon as it rolled and started going to Blastoise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow! Blastoise Skull Bash!\u201d Leaf yelled, passionate about the fight. Both of them go together, hitting hard as it made you freak out. Like two cannons firing into each other. Blastoise pushed the Pokemon back making it fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Hey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Milktank is locked in that move. While it does get stronger, so can Blastoise. Withdraw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon did just that, sharpening it\u2019s defence as Milktank came once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney was stuck in a loop, and the Blastoise won. A couple more conflicts of hits, and Milktank stop spinning, out of the fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing! We won!\u201d You say as you see the Blastoise smile about it as well. Leaf was of course glad she won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney on the other hand though ____________</span></div></div>",

Bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, whenever trainers came to her gym, she would beat them in a matter of minutes; of course though, sometimes an exceptionally skilled trainer would come and they managed to beat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just so... frustrating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nhh... it's not fair!\" she complained at the top of her lungs,<br>\r\n\"It's unfair! That's what it is! I was supposed to win, not you! Ahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Leaf exchanged an awkward look. The giantess sure wasn't kidding when she said Whitney was childish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the same Whitney, she wasn't going to accept defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending a glare in Leaf's direction, she decided she wasn't going to allow this. She was still the gym leader, after all, and as such she had the right to demand a rematch, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when her gaze casually shifted on you as Leaf returned her Blastoise, Whitney obtained a wide smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps not a traditional rematach, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, putting on a solemn expression, Whitney cleared her throat and approached her former opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-hem,\" she said in a cutesy voice,<br>\r\n\"You did well, challenger, you truly showed your immense skills as a Pokemon trainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-!\" Whitney said, pausing to give some dramatic tone to what she was going to say next,<br>\r\n\"I'm not giving my gym badge yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf's smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you exclaimed, indignant, jumping on your feet on her shoulder, <br>\r\n\"She beat you fair and square, you've got to give her your badge! Those are the rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney glared in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, quiet you! It's my gym, I make the rules!\" Whitney retorted, her childish self returning with great strength; then, adopting a solemn expression once more, Whitney placed her arms behind her back,<br>\r\n\"Leaf did a decent job beating me. However, there was two of you here, so the  challenge is incomplete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Two of you'...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the only person aside from Leaf was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Me?\" you spoke, incredulous. Even Leaf looked surprised,<br>\r\n\"I was just a spectator! What have I got to do with any of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney smirked mischievously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll find you have something to do, and that's taking me on yourself!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Leaf quietly said,<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you exclaimed in a much louder tone, though your stature didn't make your voice much louder than Leaf's,<br>\r\n\"I have no Pokemon! How am I supposed to do that?\" you asked, growing more irritated with this brat of a gym leader by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't talking about a Pokemon battle, you dummy.\" Whitney giggled in an admittedly cute manner that made Leaf groan on the inside,<br>\r\n\"You're taking me on in person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am! Don't worry, it'll be a simple game... well, simpler for me.\" Whitney said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Leaf, who just shrugged, nearly causing you to fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be...?\" you wondered, not believing you were really going through with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and you get on the opposite side of the field and I'll place you down; your job is to run all the way back here while I try to catch you. Simple, right?\" Whitney explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, simple... if you were normal-sized! Like this, it was like you had to run across two football fields at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you weren't opposing, and neither was Leaf, Whitney continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win, your friend gets the badge,\" she said, holding her badge out; then, she sent a smirk your way,<br>\r\n\"But if I win, I get something too... you!\" she squealed like a schoolgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Were gym leaders supposed to make demands? This was really, really getting on your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you looked at Leaf for consultation, discovering that she was staring back at you with an expression between one of determination and one of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice was up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could simply decline, but... Leaf had helped you, so you guessed it was your moment to pay your debt to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" you sighed massively,<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, Whitney squealed, while Leaf wore a small smile on her face; one of her hands then traveled to you as she picked you off of her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Win.\" she whispered to you,<br>\r\n\"For both me and you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in response as you were handed to Whitney, who began walking to the opposite side of her gym, giggling in a girlish manner along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you laughing at?\" you questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Whitney shot you a wolfish grin,<br>\r\n\"Just thinking of all the fun we're going to have together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now you officially had to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Whitney finally reached the other end of the field, she did a silly pirouette and faced Leaf; then, as promised, she bent to let you down beside her running shoes, before she rose slightly, hands on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll give you a - heh - small headstart. You have five seconds to get as far as you can before I come after you, and be warned that I'm not going to lose!\" she said, rising back to her impressive, full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she rose the five fingers of her left hand; getting the hint, you sprinted away, hearing Whitney's giggle as her thumb went down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after another, her fingers went down, with the pink-haired gym leader singing a countdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One.\" she chirped, wasting no more time as she began running after you, who hadn't even cleared a quarter of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing booming footsteps behind you, you sped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was when your 'challenge' began.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a tough game, one that was pretty much designed to make sure you can\u2019t win. You are suppose to run away from a girl, who can easily not only stay on your tail, but grab you. She has every advantage in this situation and you had none. As you run you could feel her footsteps behind, moving right after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not going to win this. You got to try though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, look at you go. You are so cute when you run!\u201d Whitney said with a giggle as she caught up to you, but just to toy with you she didn\u2019t reach down yet. Her hands behind her back as she happily strolls. \u201cWhen I get you, I can get like a Ratatta ball for you! It would look so adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore the voice above and just keep running. So she simply just kept talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you are gonna love your new life with me. I will be super nice to you, I will let you sleep with me, and i\u2019ll feed you sweets for breakfast and carry you around with me. Maybe in like a pocket, oh this pocket!\u201d She said pointing to the pocket next to her chest. \u201cYou would look like super adorable there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore her giant teasing words and just get running. You were barely one third of the way, and you could see Leaf with a worried expression. This was not looking good for her badge, or for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, time to win now!\u201d She said confidently as she bent her giant body. Her fingers coming for you as Leaf held her breath. Was this going to be the end of it. That Gym battle was over, will she lose like that? She can challenge Whitney again, but you are gonna lose your freedom! Your life will belong to this pink haired gym leader! No choice of getting Mew. She closed her eyes though, a little bit scared. However once she heard no reaction she opened them up, seeing you... still running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney a bit confused as well. \u201cH-Hey, get here!\u201d She yelled as she brought her fingers to you, only for you to jump over it like a hurdle running once again. \u201cWhat the hay, he\u2019s faster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf looked as well, seeing you were sprinting with your speed. It made no sense, you should be caught. She narrowed her eyes trying to get a better look at your face. Tired yes, but determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, well it was a mix of determination and adrenaline. You will make this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop running!\u201d Whitney said as she reached for you, her fingers grabbing you but you quickly slip your way out of it. Whitney getting nothing as you run out of her reach. \u201cAre you kidding me, stop it!\u201d Whitney whined as she moved around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to stop this, so she moved around and put her foot at the halfway mark. Stomping her shoe knowing you won\u2019t be able to run through it. Then she can just grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however moved and climbed over it, almost not stopping your momentum as she was left confused about it. She did not know why you were able to do this so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost to Leaf, she will not lose to you. With a bit of an angry scream, she went to grab you. Only for you to get more determination and run even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You can do it! We can win this!\u201d Leaf yelled above as you see the towering girl. She was so far, but with her cheering you on, you can do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much Whitney went to grab you, you dodged left and right. Strafing out of her reach. The one time she seemed to be able to get you, you quickly stopped and ran back. Running between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d She questioned seeing you go behind and turning around. However when she did that you did a turn once again, going back to Leaf as you confused Whitney for a second. When she realised you were running the right way again, you did get some good distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That\u2019s no fair!\u201d She whined as she moved ahead. If she can\u2019t stop you, she will block you. She moved ahead of you and dropped her body. Just laying down as she smirked at you. No way you were gonna get past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s got it all. You have to climb her in order to get past, and she can grab you then. If you try to go above her head, she can get you there. She\u2019s got you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw this... and turned down. Simple as that as you ran by her feet. Running past it as she panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! Don\u2019t!\u201d She yelled as she actually attempted to stomp on you! You move around though, and now you were on the homestretch to Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf crouching down with her hands reaching for you, as well as Whitney chasing you aiming to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sprint with all your heart. Until you feel fingers wrap around you. You heart beat stops for a second as you try to figure out who\u2019s fingers these were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get pulled forward, right into a hugging chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did it, you actually did it.\u201d Leaf said as you look up to her. Smiling as you did it. Leaf was beyond happy about this as she held you tight. When she pulled out, she let you rest on her palm, and you needed a very good rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have my Pokemon, and you to thank for this gym badge.\u201d She said with a smile. She doesn\u2019t expect a response, from all the running you ended up doing it is fair for you to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... lost.\u201d Whitney said. Leaf looked ahead at the gym leader, and dropped onto her knees. When suddenly tears began to pour. \u201cWhahhhh!!!\u201d She said, crying like a baby. Throwing Leaf off. never did she expect a gym leader to act like this?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaf shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Can't we just leave and come back later? Who knows, maybe she'll be better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and ready to make another challenge.\" Leaf commented, looking at you,<br>\r\n\"Not happening, pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, then looked back at Whitney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then something tells me we're gonna be here for quite some time...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not staying here five minutes longer.\" she declared, admittedly sick of Whitney's attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf mentally swore to herself that, once she got out of this gym, she would never ask its leader for a rematch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, gently placing you back on top of her shoulder, Leaf strolled towards Whitney, who was busily rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" Leaf began, only to be targeted by a fiery glare sent from the pink-haired gym leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What more do you want? Isn't it enough that you've beaten me twice, y-you-you-you... you meanies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh, what a drama queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf remained deadpan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney didn't reply, but shot another glare. Clearly, she wasn't in the mood for being asked her badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, just what is wro-\" you tried to speak, but were interrupted when Leaf drove her finger into your chest, poking and silencing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the giantess got on her knees as well and placed a hand on Whitney's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she hated to do it, Leaf knew she had to comfort her former opponent, or she was never going to get out with the badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, before I came here, I was told that you were an exceptionally strong leader, and you really are,\" she said with that quiet voice of hers, a voice that you learned only ever rose whenever Leaf got really passionate about something,<br>\r\n\"But you can't always win. Sometimes you'll lose, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leaf spoke soothingly, realization hit you - did the admittedly pretty gym leader act like this with every trainer that beat her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says you!\" she exclaimed, pointing a finger to Leaf, <br>\r\n\"You just got lucky! I'd have completely trashed you if you weren't so lucky! It's so unfair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was probably a bit lucky,\" Leaf admitted,<br>\r\n\"And my friend here was probably even luckier than I was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you grumbled, before muttering,<br>\r\n\"That's the thanks I get for helping... I'll mind my own business next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Because you're a great trainer, but no one can always win. It's how life works. You just got to keep trying and show life that a few losses can't keep you down. That's the kind of person a trainer as strong as you is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney, who had remained silent, looked away; you were still a bit annoyed by Leaf's earlier comment about your luck, but were also shocked to hear her speech. It was the kind of speech a big sister would give, sweet and encouraging at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a side of Leaf you had not seen so far, a side far from the teasing one she showed when you were around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Leaf offered her hand with a smile; Whitney blushed, realizing the tantrum she had thrown over no reason. But, she couldn't help it. She hated losing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, she accepted Leaf's hand and the two stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...\" Whitney admitted, accurately averting Leaf's gaze,<br>\r\n\"You're a super strong trainer, and your friend over there is quite a runner...\" she praised, winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, wondering how could she be back to teasing already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, since you... defeated... me twice, you can have the Plain Badge.\" Whitney finished, digging in a pocket, picking out her badge, placing it on Leaf's awaiting hand; with a smile, your caretaker promptly put it away lest Whitney changed her mind and whispered,<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Leaf turned around and began heading out, her hand rising as she waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Whitney didn't respond, but shot you a glance and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fun she would have had with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" you yelled one you were outside, away from the moody gym leader,<br>\r\n\"I was starting to think we were going to spend the night in her gym!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too pessimistic.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Said miss 'I'm not staying here five minutes longer'.\" you retorted playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf gained a blush and didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, what are we doing next?\" you asked,<br>\r\n\"You mentioned you wanted to get a back, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf's eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right.\" she said,<br>\r\n\"But I also need to head to the Pokemon Center to have my team healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, after that, do you think we could stick around, at least for a bit?\" you asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't gotten out of Olivine City much, so you were pleasantly surprised to see new places, even if in a dire situation such as yours,<br>\r\n\"It's pretty here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I want to get my last badge soon.\" she said,<br>\r\n\"And then we can focus on finding Mew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon. We can just take a walk around and then we can leave,\" you suggested, though your mind was screaming you that finding Mew was a priority; you shushed the voice. Being this small couldn't keep you from having some fun, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf looked at you and pondered the suggestion. </span></div></div>",

Get a bike, checkout the daycare!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Plus, we really should be inside tonight rather than camp outside.\u201d You say to her as she gave you a confused look. \u201cB-Because it would be much safer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not in danger.\u201d She said to you. \u201cAnd if we get attacked by Pokemon, I can fend them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but... you know.\u201d You say to her as truly she didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t fully piece together what you were trying to insinuate, until she thought about it some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second, you have camped outside before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, If I got to say it, no! I have never done that, not even once.\u201d You say defending yourself. Truthfully, she was a bit thrown off about it, but she still wore a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, but we are gonna do it tomorrow night. It\u2019s a long trip to the next city.\u201d She said with a smile, moving around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, who knows, we might find Mew!\u201d You say joking about it, as she was looking at you a bit sad. That plan of yours is still there, and she was hoping you were going to be over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored it and moved ahead, going to the centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I out now?\u201d You question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, i\u2019ll tell you when.\u201d She said walking to her room. You being thrown around inside of her bag hitting her Pokeballs, her berries and pretty much everything you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can come out.\u201d She said finally, pulling you out as you get grabbed. Brought right to her face as you see a room, much like the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this the same Pokecenter in Olivine City?\u201d You joke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll Pokemon centres are the same, region based at least. I heard that they switch them up every now and then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s unique.\u201d You say to her as she couldn\u2019t help but smile a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think that\u2019s unique, you should of seen this Nurse Joy. Just like the other one.\u201d She joked moving over to her bed. \u201cMy Pokemon are healed though, and I think it\u2019s fair that they can come out. I even got the extended suite for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head around, seeing the giant extension made for Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, wait does that mean i\u2019m going to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee my Pokemon again, yes. Don\u2019t worry you are going to be safe with Ninetails, and Chikorita does feel bad.\u201d She said as you were glad hearing that. \u201cPlus, as a reward they can see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight... what about the other two?\u201d You question just wanting to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Dragonite has to stay, the next gym is Dragon but I do think I am going to switch out Blastoise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwitch him out? Why? That Pokemon won you the last match.\u201d You say to her as she smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did, but I can\u2019t keep relying on that. I\u2019ve had him fight in every gym. I need to switch it up. Even at the cost of a lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right. Well who you are going to get?\u201d You question Leaf interested as she dropped you onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard that she uses five Pokemon, and considering this is the last badge for me in this region, maybe even six. So I am going to get three more my reserves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, which ones are they?\u201d You say as she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a Dewgong, she\u2019s pretty powerful and an Ice Type would be powerful against her dragons.\u201d Leaf said as she gave it some real thought about it. Really glad as she was going to continue. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that she has a Kingdra. A Flaaffy might be able to face that Pokemon, although I am going to have to train that Flaffy. As for the last one, well I haven\u2019t decided. I\u2019m going to the PC right now to transfer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d You say with a smile as you were optimistic about her life. That was not going to remain, cause she smiled on her face going around. She went over and grabbed her Pokeballs, and your excitement went to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on out you three!\u201d She said tossing it. Right down to the ground as you see all three come. The Leaf starter, the fox Pokemon and the giant dragon. All three of them into the extended area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay you three!\u201d Leaf said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get the rest of the team, you just stay here and he\u2019s in charge!\u201d She said pointing right at you on the bed. All three of the Pokemon looking at you, two of them smiling and you were unsure of Dragonite. That\u2019s the only Pokemon you have not really met. If you were being honest you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, just give away my position. That\u2019s exciting.\u201d You say to her as she laughs about it finding it more than just a bit funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, they won\u2019t hurt you. I\u2019ll be back soon with more Pokemon.\u201d And with that she left. Truth be told you thought that three were more than enough but you didn\u2019t choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to all three of them backing up and unsure of what you are going to do. \u201cH-Hey. Good job today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, coming back aren\u2019t you.\u201d Ninetails said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you can\u2019t keep away from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fair, you had him last time! It\u2019s my turn to have him!\u201d Chikorita complained as the giant Dragon spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is he? Why is he so small?\u201d It tilted it\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, you haven\u2019t met him yet. He\u2019s been staying with Leaf since the last gym! Mew shrunk him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now he is here for us. You two best not get involved in the matter. I want him alone with me.\u201d Ninetails as all three of them get interested about it.</span></div></div>",

After all, the golden fox had been gentle to you in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ninetales...\" you saluted; in response, the vixen leaned in and, crying her name softly, she placed her head into your lap... or, at least, she tried, because when she did, you were pushed on your back with the head of a giant Pokemon laying atop your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon giantess giggled softly. She didn't mind that position and, judging from your lack of movement, you either didn't as well or you couldn't move, both of which made the vixen quite happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike another Pokemon in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl, Chikorita left a still confused Dragonite behind and rushed to the vixen who, much like she had done earlier, formed a barrier by merely raising her tails, blocking the younger Pokemon entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Sorry darling, losers weepers. </span></u>\" Ninetales mocked playfully, referring to Chikorita's earlier defeat against a certain Girafarig; with even more tails to deal with than the last time, Chikorita let out a frustrated growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">C-Chikoo!</span>\" she complained as, each move she made, Ninetales shifted her tails, blocking any attempt of Chikorita's to at least catch a glimpse of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you were being nuzzled by a huge fox and noticed nothing, although, even if you did notice, you would have probably done nothing anyway; Chikorita still had a long way to go to regain your trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales kept cuddling you for some more time while keeping Chikorita away; then, a mischievous idea popped in the head of the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Dragonite hadn't met you yet, and she was just 'keeping you safe from Chikorita'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, leaning in to you after briefly rising her head, Ninetales whispered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Sorry sweetie, our time is up. </span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one of her tails departed from the others, allowing Chikorita to get past the barrier; however, the same tail slid under you and rose you up before the green Pokemon could swipe you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Hey, Dragonite,</span></u>\" Ninetales called to the third Pokemon that was in the room, who hadn't made a move since she found out about you; she would have liked to play with you as well, but she was pretty big and feared she would hurt you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was one of the times she regretted evolving from Dragonair, back when she had a slim, elegant and beautiful figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales' snapped her out of the world of memories,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Catch.</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clkhaki\">Huh?</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment was very fast, and yet seemingly endless to you; Ninetales suddenly flipped her tail, which acted as a catapult and tossed you towards Dragonite, so fast that you nearly didn't notice when the dragon caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally recovered from the overwhelming nausea, you noted that you were sitting on a somewhat rough surface and slowly looked up, noticing the Dragonite from before smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart missed a beat: this beast was so immense compared to you that you feared a single squeeze of her claws would end you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she didn't seem to be harboring any malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clkhaki\">Dra.</span>\" she said, 'Hello'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi, Dragonite...\" you replied, before hastily crying,<br>\r\n\"Be careful, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite smiled gently and moved a claw over your back, beginning to stroke you as gently as she could, trying to reassure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, you've introduced yourselves, now give him here!</span></u>\" Chikorita cried, now running to Dragonite, not immediately realizing the huge size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite shot a glance in Ninetales' direction, discovering her staring with a smirk; returning the smirk, Dragonite looked down at Chikorita, who had gripped on of the dragon's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Dragonite lazily flapped her wings and began fluttering, with a now agitated Chikorita fighting not to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">D-Dragonite!</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite only smiled, then looked at you and... tossed you. High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could scream, Dragonite did a quick spin in mid-air and threw off Chikorita as well, tossing her up too, before the dragon caught the two of you on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite then began flying around with her 'passengers' on her back; it felt thrilling, like a rollercoaster ride, though you would have enjoyed it more if you weren't busy worrying about Chikorita, whom you were sharing the ride with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made sure to put some distance between you and her, but as it turned out, it was completely pointless, since the green Pokemon simply moved over to you and used a paw to pin you to her stomach as she held onto Dragonite with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of this, Ninetales simply watched with a satisfied smile; sure, she may have said she wanted you for herself, but Dragonite was a good teammate who hadn't had the opportunity to meet you; however, Ninetales still made a mental note to make up for lost time the next time she had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight lasted a while more, with Dragonite growing more bold in her acrobatics, resulting in you having to hold on to Chikorita, who held on to the dragon; eventually though, the fun stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and in came Leaf, three Pokeballs in hand; the sight that came to her eyes made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see you're having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Dragonite stopped and, letting out a happy cry, landed, letting Chikorita snatch you up and jump down whole crying her name excitedly; even you had to admit that the experience was a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chikorita, bring him to me.\" she ordered and, albeit very reluctantly, Chikorita picked you by the scruff of your shirt and carried you to Leaf, gently letting you onto her awaiting hand before retreating to where Ninetales and Dragonite were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are you done?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess nodded her head, then tossed her Pokeballs, out of which came a Dewgong and a Flaaffy, just as promised; the third one was a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wigglytuff?\" you asked, noting a large pink and white bunny going to greet her friends; Leaf nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was one of the Pokemon I had back in Kanto.\" she explained, heading to her bed and collapsing on it, letting out a tired sigh,<br>\r\n\"As a fairy-type, she's going to be a great advantage against the gym leader's dragon-types, whoever they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Aren't you going to introduce me to your Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beat. That, and Chikorita's probably on the job already.\" she said, moving the hand you were on to her stomach, dropping you on it; then, you watched as Leaf took off her hat and placed it on her face, groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look exhausted.\" you unnecessarily pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' voice came muffled from under her hat, making it even harder for her to be heard,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Whitney girl wore me out... in more than one way.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reminded of your earlier 'challenge' against Whitney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're telling me that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf sighed and took the hat off of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time I have to battle someone like her, I'm just going to steal the badge and get away.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's wrong, isn't it?\" you rhetorically asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Leaf shot you a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? That's how I got my Squirtle to begin with.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped laughing, not sure how to react to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story. Too tired.\" Leaf quickly dismissed you, though she smiled as she remembered some of her adventures back in Kanto that led her to meet Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-kay?\" you hesitated. Seriously, this girl seemed to become more mysterious the more time you spent with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um... what now?\" you asked her, deciding to drop the subject and move on to another one.<br>\r\n\"I think it's a bit early to just go to sleep, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf looked up, pensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still some time left before bedtime, she mused, and perhaps she could use that time to go out for a while, check out the bike shop and catch some dinner... also, that would also give her the opportunity to spend some time with you without her Pokemon, who she could just leave here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was also very tired right now...</span></div></div>",

So moving around and getting back, she laid on the bed and got off her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but i\u2019m going to sleep. If we go to sleep early, we can hopefully be out of this town with all our business early.\u201d She said as you guess that made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSucks, i\u2019m still feeling like doing something. S-\u201d You trailed off, as you turn your head and look around. You turn as you see her reaching her shirt and taking it off. \u201cWait a second, your changing here!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll cover myself with the blanket. Relax.\u201d She joked as you guess that was what was happening.

No matter how great the sight would be.

You look at her for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still a bit awake, sucks we are going to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe? You don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to.

Go play with my Pokemon.\u201d She said as you look at her for a couple of seconds. Really confused about what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s... very unsafe. I need you to get them in line and, by the looks of it they are conspiring against me.\u201d You say as you turn your head and see the six Pokemon, all of them in a group and Chikorita barking her name at them. Probably telling them about you. You were getting a bunch of glances from them, every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you were board, it\u2019s either sleep or them.\u201d She said as you look back and forth so much. Sitting on the fence a bit as Leaf didn\u2019t have time for this. \u201cIf you are not gonna make the choice, then I will make it for you.\u201d With that, she brought her fingers around and grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey?\u201d You say freaking out, as she brought you down to the ground! She brought you down to the ground and you see her giant face looming over the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait a second, you are not about to leave me be, right? Your joking?\u201d You question her hoping, but she just moved her face away from view and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurned off the lights. Well to this part of the place. The Pokemon extension was still well lit for them. You look to the ground of Pokemon. They all noticed that Leaf went to sleep, and you are  guessing by that guess the figured you were with them. You were kind of hiding in the dark beside the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, why not.\u201d You say just giving in. You force your legs to move forward, stepping forward and getting up to the giant Pokemon. You walk to the group, as you see them get bigger and bigger as you get closer to the horizon. Finally you were under and all of them noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cChiko!\u201d </span>She cheered. Your favourite grass type jumping it\u2019s way forward and coming down to you. Laying on it\u2019s stomach as you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Chikorita.\u201d You say to her moving your small hand and tapping her nose playfully. Mind if I talk to the group?\u201d You question her as she nodded. Dropping her head and on her leaf. \u201cY-You want me to... okay.\u201d You say as you step onto the leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a burger, she flipped you with her leaf. Flipping you around and letting you get onto the head. It was a little weird, but it was fine as the Pokemon turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look ahead and all the Pokemon were looking at you! Not only the new ones, but the old ones as well. How awkward was this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... hi. Sure Chikorita told you three about me.\u201d You say to the new Pokemon. \u201cI\u2019m (Your Name).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">Flaaffy!\u201d</span> The electric type cheered, seeming to like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cDewgong?\u201d</span> The water ice type said tilting it\u2019s head, almost like she still didn\u2019t believe what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\u201cWigglytuff.\u201d</span> The fairy type puffed. Pouting a bit. She didn\u2019t seem that happy with you? What did you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, please to meet you. Well, Leaf has gone to sleep, and... i\u2019m still up to play with you all.\u201d You say sending them a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Pokemon seemed excited for this, except for Wigglytuff who didn\u2019t look anymore happy about it? Did this Fairy type not like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cHehe, you got kicked out of the bed!\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t get kicked out of the bed Chikori- Hey!\u201d You say freaking out as you suddenly feel a force jump and tackle you. You feel yourself, getting rubbed against something soft. Wool? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cppink\">\u201cHi there!\u201d</span></u> The Flaffy said, as it continued to hug you. She seems to really like you, and oh boy was it soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two were having fun, Chikorita was left stunned. <u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cW-Wait, did he know what I said?</span></u>\u201d She said bewildered. Most of the Pokemon didn\u2019t notice, not even you. She did though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d </span></u>Ninetails says walking past. <u><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThat Pokemon and Humans with strong enough bonds can break through the language, and understand each other through emotions.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\"><br>\r\n\u201cI-Is that what happened? Is my bond with him that strong.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></u><br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNo of course not, you are just crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></u><br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></u><br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Let's do it,\" Leaf spoke, adopting a slight blush,<br>\r\n\"I owe you after all,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... do?\" you questioned. The giantess giggled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you won me the badge, remember?\" she pointed out, moving to grab you from her stomach before sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... I owed you that, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you deserve a reward for it. Plus,\" Leaf said,<br>\r\n\"I really want to check the bike shop out, then I'll get us some dinner. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun!\" you replied, causing the giantess to giggle once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully holding you, Leaf got up and picked the keys of the room she had rented before walking to the door; when she reached it, she stopped to look at her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't scared of leaving them alone: her loyal companions were strong enough to look out for themselves. Still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading out for a while,\" she announced,<br>\r\n\"I've, uh, got something to do. No fighting, okay? Save that for the battlefield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf's Pokemon cried their names in response, though before the trainer could leave, one of them ran towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chikorita.\" Leaf quietly spoke as the grass-type stopped in front of her, smiling up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi-Chiko!</span>\" she cried happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing she wants to tag along,\" you said, Chikorita smiling in your direction and nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" she conceded, gesturing for Chikorita to follow as she headed out with you in hand; Chikorita happily obeyed, though not before having turned to shoot Ninetales one last, smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden-furred vixen replied by turned her back to Chikorita, giving an annoyed flip of her tails, before she disappeared from sight as Leaf closed and locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun hadn't set yet, but it wasn't long until then, and the lights in Goldenrod were already lit; a gentle breeze blew past you as you sat onto Leaf's shoulder while she walked through the streets with Chikorita happily trotting beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty here,\" Leaf commented at some point, looking around: there were people happily chatting or simply walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" you agreed, before asking,<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to check out, first? I know there's a huge department store in this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting.\" Leaf replied with a smile,<br>\r\n\"But I told you, I want to check the bike shop, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lady makes the call, Leaf,\" you joked, causing her to giggle. She liked this, she liked your company, though she was never going to admit it; beside her, Chikorita pouted, jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but Leaf eventually found the shop she was searching for, hid you in her hat like earlier for good measure and entered; within ten minutes, Leaf got out of the store with a new bike that had a little basket that was meant for you to ride in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess took off her hat, only to place you right in the basket as she mounted her new bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\" she asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, it's cool,\" you said, leaning back,<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be great, traveling like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, glad you think that,\" Leaf replied, before smirking,<br>\r\n\"Now, make way for your new roomie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even think what she meant by that, a certain green Pokemon excitedly climbed her way onto the bike as fast as a lightning and jumped into the basket along with you, nearly squashing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chikorita, be more careful!\" you cried, frightened, causing the green behemoth to giggle; since you got Leaf's help, you began forgetting how much more fragile you were from time to time, and Chikorita seemed intent on reminding you of that every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf watched both her Pokemon and her small friend together in the basket and couldn't but think that the scene was pretty adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a moment, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you, two let's put this bike to the test,\" she whispered. Then, without any kind of warning, she began peddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf rode her new bike around the city for a while, enjoying every second of it, having missed the feeling of the speed and the wind in her hair. It was such a good sensation, the feeling of true freedom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you were once again forced to hold on to Chikorita as Leaf rode too fast for your likings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, the trainer stopped in front of a large building that, according to a sign nearby, was the Radio Tower of Goldenrod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun,\" Leaf commented. Chikorita cheered in agreement, having enjoyed the ride very much... and the fact that you were stuck with her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you agreed as well, poking your head out of the basket to face Leaf,<br>\r\n\"I think we'll get to Blackthorn City in no time now, haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf nodded in response, agreeing with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you saw her looking at the sky: the sun had settled a while ago, but she didn't seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should head back,\" she said, turning to you,<br>\r\n\"I'll pick something for us to eat on the way, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay with that.\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ta.</span>\"<br>\r\n\"And Chikorita's too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a giggle, Leaf nodded her head and prepared to ride the way back to the Pokemon Center; you once more grabbed onto Chikorita, who just cooed her name in delight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You proved to be indecisive when Leaf casually passed you by and walked out of the gym satisfied with her new badge. Just like that, one of the doors of opportunity that were wide open for you had closed, much like the automatic doors of Jasmine\u2019s gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself collapse to your knees as you started down at the floor with despair in your eyes when you realized that your winning odds had decreased drastically. While you still had Jasmine as an option, it would\u2019ve helped out so much to call out to Leaf as well. Having multiple options is way better than having one disappear forever. What a blunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, look at the bright side: you still had Jasmine, and she would definitely help you out if you were to ask her. She really is just that kind. So maybe there is still hope for you after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChi....chika?\u201d Chikorita spoke sounding confused. Your head shot back up immediately when you hear the sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that Chikorita was still here inside the gym for some reason. Did she lock herself in by not going through the automatic doors fast enough? But that doesn\u2019t make sense since the doors should work for pokemon too, so what\u2019s the deal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika?\u201d Chikorita cries again now with more curiosity. You didn\u2019t have a clue what she was curious about. If anything, you should be curious about why she was still here. That was until you realized who she was speaking too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c........m-me?\u201d You said pointing to yourself, which only piqued her interest. You had now realized that Chikorita was starting at you, unable to understand what she was seeing. You felt yourself starting to get cold sweat while Leaf went back into the gym when she also realized Chikorita didn\u2019t follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Chikorita, you can\u2019t stay behind like that, we need to get to the next gym.\u201d Leaf said gently to Chikorita as she kept starting at you. \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Jasmine asked checking to see if something was wrong. \u201cNo nothing, Chikorita just gets distracted easily. Come on girl, let\u2019s go.\u201d Leaf said not thinking much of her behavior. At least you now you know that her trusty companion was female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika!\u201d she cried out before running into your direction. You have been spotted! You instantly fell into a panic as you quickly scrabbled for a way to escape. You first tried to run into the open but you got halted when Chikorita leaped in front of you to block your path and that was all she wrote when you quickly found yourself cornered, as she slowly kept walking to you closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What are you doing?\u201d Leaf said, with it being her turn to be confused. \u201cI\u2019ll see if i can help.\u201d Jasmine responded to the commotion. You reckoned that she was coming here as well since you could feel the ground shaking with each step she took. Not that it matters right now, you need to keep eye on the most immediate threat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you didn\u2019t think too much about what you were going to do if had gotten the attention of someone since you were cowering in fear when faced with one. While normally cute looking, due to the size differences, Chikorita\u2019s presences became intimidating and bone chillingly scary up close as she looked down at your small body. You held tightly onto your heart as you felt the green titan coming closer and cornering you even further. Is this really it? The end? You didn\u2019t even come close to finding Mew and your journey ends here along with your life?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft without any options, you just sat there, staring at the Chikorita that was going to decide your fate. In the end....</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It began to really dawn on you how insane this situation has become. Simple games of harmless fun have ended up with you no taller than a single blade of grass. Anyone could crush you without them ever knowing, the extent of your options was almost nonexistent and even if you were to be discovered, things could get even more sour if they were to see you as a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were convinced that Mew knew that you had to deal with all of these problems when she had shrunk you when you remembered her saying <span class=\"cppink\">\u201dCome find me!\u201d</span>. She must have known how ridiculously impossible living like this was going to be when she made herself the only method to end it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why did she do this to you? Was this some kind of test? At least it would somewhat justify all of this if this was the \u201cProve your worth by reaching me\u201d sort of thing. Otherwise, this was going to be the worst game of hide and seek you ever had the misfortune of playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotting feeling of despair then slowly began to build inside of you. There was simply no way you were able to find Mew. Finding her at normal size would be near to impossible on it\u2019s own let alone as the size of an ant. An already massive world has become massive-er, and how would you even begin traversing it and finding her. She might already be out of the Sinnoh region and at the other side of the earth for all you know, so you might as well stay put and get used to living as a few inches tall. It\u2019s the best option you have anyway....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....no, that cannot be the case. Something just felt wrong with leaving things like that, never getting to explore and witness the wonders waiting out there to be discovered and seen. You couldn\u2019t let that happen, you had to give it everything you got to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. Maybe this is what Mew is trying to test you for; your determination to go through thick and thin in order to reach your goal. Yeah, that\u2019s got to be it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, with this new found hope, you quickly began to look for a way to get out of the jungle of grass you were in since you couldn\u2019t see well if someone was coming near you or not. You would then either miss your chance to get the attention of someone passing by or get crushed in a truly pathetic manner. Either way, you now know what you need to do: you\u2019re going to find Mew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you reached a rock extending even higher up than the grass. The surface was fortunately rough enough to allow you to climb it up and reach higher altitude. This would fix both issues of being completely unnoticeable inside the grass as well as your lack of vision, killing two bird with one stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheesy pun aside, after some scaling, you finally managed to get on top of the rock. Along with giving you a better perspective of the forest you were also able to make out the town you were near: Sandgem Town. Now you remembered that you came to this forest in the first place to look for more pokemon to add to your team after you got your starter from Professor Rowan. Funny isn\u2019t it? After making your first step into your journey as a pokemon trainer, it was abruptly halted with a playful Mew shrinking you for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....oh wait, that\u2019s it! You could use you pokemon to traverse through this dangerous world. Then you wouldn\u2019t be as valuable as you are now, so all you need to do is....huh? Where\u2019s your pokeball?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked as you realized that your pokeball that contained your pokeman was no longer in your pocket, same with your Pokenav. You must have dropped inside the grass, though you weren\u2019t sure whether it was before or after you were shrunk. Just fantastic either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now? You could either go back inside the grass to go looking for your stuff or first get some help from the townsfolk. You didn\u2019t know how you were going to do it but it would definitely improve your odds if you managed to. Then again, anything could happen while you were in this state, so maybe it was best to go prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were pondering with this dilemma for what your first play was going to be, you...</span></div></div>",

That you were being watched, and that eyes were on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got even worse, when you could actually hear the loud sound of something rustling behind you. Scared, you knew you had to look and see what it was. You do the slowest turn you could, as you see a giant figure on the outskirts of the tall grass. With it\u2019s eyes right on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue body, four legged electric type, who has used it\u2019s keen eyes to spot you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShinx...\u201d</span> It said, as it was looking right at you. This was not good, you don\u2019t know what this Pokemon wants but it sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wild Pokemon sees you. You try to hold your own on the rock, but that became more difficult as the Pokemon moved it\u2019s way closer to you. It stepped on the grass, and you could see the grass you were in get knocked down and trampled on by it\u2019s paws. That grass was like a forest to you, and this Pokemon simply walked it\u2019s way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got really close to you, to the point where it\u2019s face was covering most of your sight. You two just look at each other for a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally, the giant behemoth of a Pokemon opened its Maw. Your eyes go wide, seeing it\u2019s sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Pokemon most people would say is cute, is giant to you! Even worse, it\u2019s looking to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShiii!!!\u201d</span> It said moving it\u2019s head forward. You acted quick. jumping out of the way from the Pokemon. Dodging it\u2019s attack and off the rock. Hitting the ground, you slid down on some grass as it soften your fall a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was too close, why did that Shinx try eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShinx?\u201d</span> It questioned, as you could hear it climb the rock and survey the land. Looking around for where you went. Seeing the giant electric type perched, you slowly move under the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure you were out of view before the Pokemon could find you. Thankfully you had a lot of cover, so it was not an easy job for the Pokemon to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see it though, and it seemed to be looking at you very interestedly. To the point where you were a little bit worried at the moment. All you have to do is hide and make sure you were not going to be found. The Pokemon will lose interest before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was your first plan, but you came across a better one... cause through the grass, you could see a bit of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open as you realise that was your Pokeball! If you go and bring out your Pokemon, they can fight this Shinx! They can protect you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile you run over and plan to get real close to the ball. Still making sure you were not going to be found through the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to it and... well it was too big. You couldn\u2019t even fathom that you use to carry around this giant ball. It was so big, to the point where you could easily climb it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich turns out was something you had to do, cause the little button in the middle was far above the ground. Since that was how to open it, well you got to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving ahead and getting close, you start scaling the ball. It was smooth, but you were determined so you climbed it without little effort. Getting to the button, until another problem arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t... press the button. \u201cCome on! Come on get pressed! I need you right now...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201c...Shinx...\u201d</span> The Pokemon said as you turn your head, seeing it looking at the ball, and a smile on it\u2019s face. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShinx!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you right now!\u201d You say pushing with all your strength. Trying to get your Pokemon out, as Shinx wanted to get you to. The Pokemon leaped it\u2019s way off the grass, trampling all the tree size grass that was under you. You were so small you had to make your under them, Shinx was just going to make her way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a towering goliath making her way to you. You close your eyes and coward, a little afraid as you just keep pushing the button with everything you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither you were gonna get your Pokemon out, or you were a goner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Pokemon made it\u2019s final way to the grass, it saw that you were stuck to the ball. Now Shinx was a young Pokemon, and it didn\u2019t know that you were trying to call a Pokemon. Instead it just thought you were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see it come close, until finally it\u2019s face was basically right behind you. Turning your head, you see the frightening side, until finally... it moved it\u2019s nose to your back, almost pushing the button in when it pushed you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, okay. Come out now!\u201d You say as you did not want this. The Shinx was treating you like a plaything. At normal size, at least you could deal with this Pokemon. At your size, you were at it\u2019s mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, you were at it\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShinx!\u201d</span> It cheered, almost defeaning you as it seemed to like that you were stuck. You weren\u2019t going to run anymore, and it was going to have food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see right down it\u2019s throat as you could it\u2019s teeth, it\u2019s tongue and everything else in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!\u201d You say trying to kick the Pokemon back. Trying to get it to back up and get away from you. The Pokemon was not caring though, as it planned to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith strength now backed by fear, you take one final weak push on the button. Knowing if you don\u2019t get a Pokemon out right then... you were a goner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

You try to cling onto it, but its slippery surface doesn't give you much of a grip. You feel your body sink down into the maw, but stop right when your head reaches the Shinx's lips.

You try to shimmy your way out of the mouth through the small entrance that allows your head to see outside, but the pressure of the tongue on you doesn't allow you to even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why hasn't the Shinx eaten me though?</i> That thought repeats through your head. The Shinx seemed so adamant on eating you before, why wont it eat you now. Maybe it wants to savor your taste? And where is it taking you anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last answer is swiftly answered, as the Shinx stops at an open field surrounded by bushes. There, it lowers its head and lets you out of their mouth. You land face first onto the dirt. <i>Couldn't the Shinx let me out softer at least,</i> you complain to yourself, getting yourself off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clteal\">Shiiii!</span>\" The Shinx calls out in excitement behind you. You turn around to see the Shinx's giant form towering over you. You can tell by their body language, the way that the Pokemon's backside is raised in the air with their tail wagging, means that they want to play with you. If you tried to play with the giant, you'd surely be crushed by it, whether on purpose or accident. You try to slowly back away, but even that makes the Shinx jump at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shinx's paws land right in front of you, causing you to lose your balance and land on your back.

They easily pin you down, but luckily for you, the Shinx does it lightly, though enough for you to not escape. It then quickly lets go of you and jumps back. <i>Is it playing with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get yourself back up from the ground again, and walk slowly to the Shinx.

The Shinx looks at you with their playful golden eyes, waiting for you to do something. You decide to try to get close to the Pokemon again, holding out one of your hands towards its ruby red nose. The Shinx this time presses its fluffy cheek right on you, putting the weight of their whole head right on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, it didn't hurt you, well not dramatically. You did still feel discomfort when your back got slammed to the dirt by the wall of light blue fluff, but the fur of the Shinx surprisingly felt... nice. You rubbed your hands on the soft fur pressing on you. The Shinx in response began to purr. Huh, who knew that Shinx's purr. After a few seconds of rubbing, the Shinx lifts their head up a bit for you to stand up, but still reach their head. They then tilt their head, as you scratch behind their ears. That's when you notice something interesting looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shinx's tuft on the top of their head. Normally, no one would actually pay attention to it, but you knew something about it. If the tuft of hair is long that means that the gender of the Shinx is male, and seeing how even behind the Shinx's ear it touches your head, the Shinx you've been dealing with is a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clteal\">Shaaa~</span>\" The Shinx yawns in relaxation, as he rolls over to his back, right over you.

After a few seconds of punching at the stem you fall to the dirt floor, red faced and breathing hard. What a mess you somehow got yourself in. You take a few second breather before getting up again. You need to find someplace that is not giant Pokemon infested, and try to find that Mew. Of course that's easier said than done, that Mew could have dragged you anywhere, and could have gone anywhere. She might not even be in Galar anymore, you don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath again, try to think positive...... <i>That's not positive thinking me, that's nothing.</i> At least you can make a little light on the situation. Maybe getting some high ground can help you gain your bearings. You look around to see any high ground when you see a log on the ground. That'll do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the log, severely overestimating how much strength you have in climbing. You grapple onto the side of it, before ungrappling it instantly, you do NOT have the strength for that.

Talk about a lucky break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up it to find that you are indeed in the wild area, and you're not far off from where you fell asleep, which was a few minutes walk from Motostoke.

You couldn\u2019t help but wear a smile on your face as you go chase her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to where she is snoring, and eventually find her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour little Pokemon, suddenly not being so little. Like a Dragonite on it\u2019s treasure, it was laying all the way on your giant backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really shocked about this honestly, she has always been a bed hog. You remember countless nights where you wake up, only to find her in her sleep pushing your head off the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get close to the towering Pokemon, until finally you wore a smile. \u201cYamper! Wake up!\u201d You shout to your Pokemon, thinking that because you are close she would hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not, meaning you were gonna have to go again. Moving close you start scaling the backpack. Using your hands as you lift your way up close to her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing your size won\u2019t let you do much damage, you start pounding and punching her paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYamper! Yamper! Yamper! ya-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard you yell her name, and she felt the touch as she began to wake up. She nudged you with her paw, knocking you down and getting you to collapse off of your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on your rear as you look at the giant Pokemon wake up. Slowly opening it\u2019s eyes as it gave out an adorable yawn..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u2028\u201cPer?\u201d I</span>t questioned looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown here!\u201d You yell to your Pokemon, as she craned her head down and spotted you. Your Pokemon looking at you for a couple of seconds as you can tell it\u2019s thoughts at the moment. She got up from her backpack bed, moving closer to you as you take several steps back back, letting her get down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cute little Pokemon, now towering over you like a threat. Still you were not moving, as this was a Pokemon you were comfortable around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep... it\u2019s me.\u201d You say to her as she looked at you even more. \u201cTook a lousy time for a nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon just looked at you, until finally... she gave a smile. A big smile that showed her reaction to this. Moving her face closer, she brought her nose to you and nuzzled you with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wet nose against your stomach as you couldn\u2019t help but laugh at it. \u201cOkay, okay. I know.\u201d You say to her as you try to push the nose back, only for Yamper to bring her tongue around and give you a big lick. One that shook you as she liked you this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, listen Yamper. I got shrunk by a Mew just than. I need your help. Maybe it\u2019s still close. We got to get going!\u201d You say as she understood. Lowering her head for you to get on. You smile at your Pokemon as you take the invitation to climb her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her neck you get onto her back as you look back. \u201cGotta leave the backpack here. Good thing I don\u2019t another Pokemon. Let\u2019s go Yamper!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYamp! Yamp!\u201d </span>it said loudly jumping around, almost getting you to fall of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! Calm down, tiny passenger remember.\u201d You say to your Pokemon as she did just that. Moving around and  getting out of the tall grass. Seeing the Wild Area once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, for most trainers, it\u2019s a giant area with lots of different zones and even more Pokemon than that. For you, it was more than giant, it was massive. Like the size of a whole country by itself. You can see the towering city in the distant, almost like the horizon itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYamp!\u201d </span>Your Pokemon barked, looking back at you. Your Pokemon loved the sight it had. You were so cute on her back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... don\u2019t know where to go honestly. She wants me to find her, but I don\u2019t know where Mew is?\u201d You question looking around. \u201cPlus, there are so many Pokemon here, I don\u2019t want to be near them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to admit, it was like every Pokemon was Dynamaxed from your perspective. Although Yamper is loyal, she is not really the strongest Pokemon. If she runs into a wild encounter, there is a chance she will win, but lose as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else can you do though, but chase Mew. Wait... if you remember correctly? Isn\u2019t the professor of Galar into Dynamax and the research on that part. If you find them, you might be able to get big again without even the help of Mew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be amazing, cause let\u2019s face it is the better option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYamper, hide!\u201d You say as she reacted. Getting down onto her stomach as you see a giant walk past. That raised the problem as well, you were so small everything was a threat to you. If someone wanted to battle you, you were gonna have to say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr else they might literally battle you! Pokemon Trainers, and In the wild zone more accurately are far more competitive than otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYamper?\u201d </span>Your Pokemon questioned as you thought about it some more. Your Pokemon did love having her tiny trainer on her neck, but it was clear you wanted to get big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour loving Pokemon though, she just wanted to play. She was far too playful, and this was a once in a lifetime moment. She most likely will help you, but a part of Yamper wants to have fun with you now that you were toy size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Yamper, I think I know what we are going to do.

You traveled across distant plains and bridges that seemed to span half a kilometer, despite knowing that the exact bridge was only 5 meters long earlier in a week. You peered around, gauging the various trainers that traveled through the Wild Area. You were looking for someone young and kind, as they would help you without ulterior motives, unlike some adults that would probably abuse the heck out of your small stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Most of the people in the Wild Area were big camper guys, breaking the rule about being young. They looked nice, sure, but people always gain a dark side to them as they grow up, it's just that most people tend to keep the darkness inside for fear of public prosecution or humiliation. After a whole day of adventuring you had almost given up for the day, wanting to tell Yamper to run into a bush somewhere to sleep the night, but it was then that fortune struck. You saw a camp with a bonfire in the near distance and ordered Yamper to run towards it. With a quick cry of its name, it bolted to the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inspected the trainer and saw that they were nice to their pokemon and were relatively young. It might've just been your reluctance to sleep in the open tonight, but you ordered Yamper to approach the trainer.

All four of them aware. Sure, Wild Pokemon coming for a fight wasn\u2019t anything new in the Wild Area, but at the same time it was not something that was usual. Especially for a Pokemon like Yamper, so weak. Not to mention her team was... well to put it nicely scary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yamper got close it started shaking and you got to admit, you did to. All four of her Pokemon towered over you, and they looked down scarily. Liepard was the first to spot you, and it looked like Toxicroak and Scrafty was next, none of the Pokemon taking the eyes off.

Sorry for intruding and uh-\u201d You didn\u2019t finish that sentence, as the Toxicroak\u2019s face was worryingly close. And... did that Liepard just lick her lips. Oh boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarnie was still looking after you. \u201cYou are real, I can\u2019t believe it. How can someone be so small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a real long story.\u201d You say to her with a laugh. \u201cMaybe I can tell you, you know... without your scary Pokemon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Pokemon has been called many things, and scary is always the most accurate. Not to mention for your size. She can just imagine what they look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would... but you don\u2019t know hot much of a hassle that is.\u201d She said simply as she looked down. \u201cMorpeko can you get down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cMorpeko!\u201d</span> it whined as Marnie looked at her seriously. The Pokemon jumped down, but shot you a glare as it went down. Great... As you were looking at the Pokemon, you suddenly felt fingers on you as you panic for a second. Screaming as you get pulled and placed onto a lap. Her pink dress under you as you feel it under you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, should feel safe there. My name is Marnie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIh uh... (Your Name)\u201d You say as this was weird. Your first interaction with a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, mind telling me how you got so small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it wants me to chase it. So if you can imagine... pretty screwed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be.\u201d Marnie said simply as she listened. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of Mew. Heard she flies wherever she wants, knows Teleport, knows Transform an-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... I know. Not looking good and-\u201d You trail off, looking to the giant cat Pokemon that was trying to intimidate your little dog Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiepard, knock that off!\u201d Marnie said with a snap of her fingers. As soon as that happened the Liepard looked away, and your Yamper jumped it\u2019s way to you. Well to Marnie\u2019a lap, two forefeet on her lap with the back on the ground. It was barking at you as you try to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Yamper. It\u2019s fine, Marnie is a nice girl. Her Pokemon may be scary, but they won\u2019t do anything right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey won\u2019t do anything to you Yamper. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d Marnie said with a smile down to her Pokemon, which did calm it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait... to Yamper?\u201d You say noticing the words, but she was not going to linger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should recall your Pokemon, just so it doesn\u2019t feel unsafe.\u201d Marnie said as she seemed to care for your Pokemon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would, but my Pokeball is over there. Remember, not big enough to carry it.\u201d You say as she understood, and actually got up. She got up and headed towards your bag, grabbing it with you in her hand. She put it down and grabbed the Pokeball, your Yamper excited to get away from all the scary and strong Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarnie returned your Pokemon, as it went back and into the Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might be for the best, I mean Yamper was pretty scared of your Pokemon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Marnie questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... well a little bit. Especially that Liepard that seems to be glaring at me for a long while.\u201d You say as she smiled. Looking at her Pokemon it quickly changed it\u2019s look. Marnie looked back at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow ____________\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are in the middle of pondering what your next course of action should be, when you hear a rustle of grass from somewhere near the log you are on. You freeze, holding your breath. Maybe it's a Skwovet scurrying to a nearby berry pile, or maybe a Zigzagoon running around. Yeah, that's it, just a rowdy Zigzagoon hustling and bustling. You get your mind back in track on think of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until you hear another bush rustle at the edge of the log. You snap your neck to where the noise was made, but nothing was there. You run to the edge to try and see it better, but still nothing. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to get the high ground after all, making you more visible. You got to move now, even if you don't know where you are going to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can, you feel a slight vibration from the other side of the log. Something just jumped on, and is probably standing right behind you. Heart pounding like a hammer, you turn around to view your new friend. On the other side of the log, you see an orange-maroon colored fox-like Pokemon with a bag-like tail you recognize as a <span class=\"cmaroon\">Nickit</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Nic?</span>\" You hear it say, tilting its head. To you, it sounded pretty feminine <i>Maybe she's curious?</i> You think,<i> I need to be cautious though. She just may be hungry for a me shaped snack.</i> You slowly try to walk back while watching her, but your heels reach empty air before you can make a single step. You're trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nickit swiftly approaches you, barely making any noise or vibrations on the ground at all, until she's right in front of your face. She presses her wet nose right on your chest, pressing you a little bit off of the edge. \"Uhhh.... Nice Nickit...\" You nervously say, rubbing her muzzle. She then pulls back her nose, and you notice that she's....... smiling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Ni ni ni ni ni ni~.</span>\" Is she laughing!? Oh, this cannot be any good. You are almost immediately proven right when the Nickit opens her mouth, letting you see all of it. Her tongue hanging out, her pearly whites showing bright which can surely crush you, and her breath taking out any of the cool air around you. Your heart practically stops, the Nickit is going to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, without even thinking, fall off of the log backwards. She snaps her teeth at you, nipping your shirt, and tearing off a good part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww...\" You land on the the dirt with a thud. \"Geez, that hurt...\" You can barely move, much less try to stand up and run. You look at where you fell to see Nickit's head leaning over the log, looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Ni ni ni ni ni ni!</span>\" That's not good. You try to stand back up, but you collapse again right after, inciting more laughter from the Nickit above you. This must be such a treat to her, watching her prey struggle for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear a sound from the log, as the Nickit has jumped right off of it. You shriek in fear, as her front paws are directly aimed at you. She's surely going to crush you doing that. You brace yourself, preparing to become nothing but a red stain on her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><b>Thomp.</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh!? You feel pressure all over your body, but it's more like if someone threw a heavy blanket over you than an actual paw. You just then remembered what the Pokedex said about Nickits. \"They have incredibly soft pads that compress lightly when in contact with the ground, allowing them to move silently without being noticed.\" She was just trying to scare you, and she sure succeeded, laughing even harder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves her paw off of your face and torso, keeping them on your legs just so that you don't run away. \"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Nicki~!</span>\" She says happily, before opening her mouth again like before. You close your eyes, accepting your fate, when you feel the front on your shirt being lifted. You open your eyes again to see that it's in the the Nickit's mouth, as she lifts you up by it, your legs are dragged from her paws. She then starts to walk, making you swing gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, this cannot get any worst...\" You mutter. The Nickit quickly lets go of your shirt then grabs it again, making you scream out a little. \"NOT FUNNY!\" You yell, as the Nickit snickers. Where is she taking you anyways?</span></div></div>",

Plus, any pokemon will be dangerous to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're currently in the route 2 of Melemele island of Alola!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention that you just arrive to Alola yesterday for take your vacations in this region! That's right, you come from Galar region. Few days ago... You decide to take your vacations in Alola region for also discover new pokemon and learn about the Z-moves. Of course, you bring a pokemon from your region with you and your pokemon is a female Indeedee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeedee is your first and only pokemon that you have right now. She deeply care of you, She don't really like fight and she is not good neither, but she really enjoy to pampering you. Your Indeedee doesn't really like been in a poke ball so you keep her out of her poke ball for the respect and she always walk by your side and she doesn't like when you go out without her even if you're able to take care of yourself. You and your Indeedee have a deep bond that she learns to speak telepathy but only with you in your mind. As she's not good for battle, you planning to get a Alola starter pokemon for the trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were in vacation, you planned to participating at the Alola trial. But now... There a big problem. You wake early in your apartment while your Indeedee's still sleeping, so you decide to take some air in the outside. After a while, you decide to take a nap on the grass and then this happen... Mew wakes you up, playing with you and then... shrink you down and leave you like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no hope to find Mew, you try to head back to your apartment. It has taking a while to making back as you travel the tall grasses and trying to avoid to encounter wilds pokemons who will a huge problematic as they are like dynamaxed to you! Eventually you make it but now there two problems. First, you have to climb the stairs which they're three times bigger than you! And second, the door of your apartment is closed and there no way you can open it and knocking the door won't help neither because you're too tiny for someone could heard you knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo frustrating, you cursed Mew for the mess she gets you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: With other option, you decide to head to the city and try to find help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Suddenly the door of your apartment open as your giant Indeedee come out and begin to looking for you!

No one even heard you, inside of the apartment or out. not even when you added screaming to the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! Come on open up! I know you are in the Indeedee, come on!\u201d you say banging until you had to give up. not strong enough to really do anything. You pout about it as you take several steps back, trying to figure out how you are gonna get in there. You can wait for your Pokemon to open it, but that is going to take ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Creak*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe not...\u201d You say as you turn around, seeing the doorknob twist and turn until finally, it was pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not only see the giant apartment that you were staying in, that seems to have changed to a whole new region, but your giant Pokemon in front of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeedee, was massive! Now normally she was not that tall, in fact you would say the word average to describe her size. To you now though, well she is Dynamaxed! Even bigger than that possibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take several steps back just marvelling at her size, as this was the first time she has ever truly towered over you. You\u2019ve always been bigger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeedee?\u201d It said, peeking it\u2019s head out and looking around. Clearly it\u2019s worried about you. She has always been kind and always thinking of you. To the point where she looks after you a bit too much. In the Pokedex, it has been said that the female ones have a sort of a babysitter\u2019s emotion, and you would say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she saw you weren\u2019t there though, that\u2019s when you suddenly realise. Indeedee was gonna close the door. You don\u2019t have time to yell her name, so you have to start running and following her! Sprinting into the apartment as fast as you could really. Not holding anything back as you just want to get in there. You run for a long time, as the close gets closer and closer to the point where it was shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it gets shut on you, you literally have no other option! You could wait until it opens up again, or you could just get in there now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd get in there now is what you did. Sprinting and running inside as you get to the other side. The door closed, and the force that was used sent you flying. A gust of wind so powerful it sent you flying just in front of your Pokemon\u2019s paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Indeedee noticed, as she still thought you were outside, thinking about you in a worried manner. She turned her giant body and walked away, as you saw her giant dangerous paw walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did feel a bit bad for telling her to stay inside, but you know a Galor Pokemon in Alola was just begging to be taken. Plus you have heard of Team Skull, so you were just not risking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she seemed bored.<br>\r\n\u2028As she walked around, she went over to your bed and started laying on it, her big stomach on for show as you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you were starting to feel tired and a bit out of it, Indeedee would let you lay your head on her stomach. You swear it was softer than any pillow that has been created. At your size now, it would be less of a pillow and more of the bed itself. Thinking about it for a couple of seconds, you question what you are going to do at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon was so far away, and it was not like you could risk waiting for it to come and step on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a couple of seconds as you suddenly remember. Focusing your mind, to intend to talk to her that. \u2018Indeedee, listen I know this might sound weird but I need your help. I\u2019m small and on the floor. Please pick me up.\u2019 You thought hard as you look up to her for any reaction. Only to be quickly reminded that she starts the talk, while you can not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown, you move down and rethink your game plan. What are you going to do at this point? Being small and useless sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou at the giant room you were staying at and frown. Are you really going to have to climb your giant bed, you don\u2019t want to but it seems you are gonna have to if you want to last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving around and getting close under, you move your hands around and try to think for a couple of seconds how you are going to get up there. Climb really is your best option?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s sad but it\u2019s the truth. Breathing in and closing your eyes, you get going and start making your way up. Slowly but surely, a simple Joltik climbing the way up. I went up for a real long time, going as high as I can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeedee not even being aware, as you had to make your way up. Even if you get her attention, what are you going to do. Indeedee is not strong enough to fight a Mew! Then again we probably won\u2019t even be able to find it in the end. You are NOT living the rest of your life this size, and you can\u2019t Dynamax humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown as you finally get up on top. Looking at your laying Pokemon as she has not even paid attention to you at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you were close to her, real close. You need to go around and get to her face. At that point, she has not only got to see you, but help you as well. After all, Indeedee loves you, and she is willing to do it for you.</span></div></div>",

Travelled the large tall grasses without getting caught by wild pokemon, climbing the stairs, getting inside of your apartment by luck, go after your giant beast maid pokemon and having to climbing your bed which it was even more challenging than climbing the stairs! It's like if you're doing extreme dangerous exercises... Oh man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, you sit down next to your giant pokemon to take a break for a moment, your shirt is already all sweaty by your own sweat. Looking at her round shape bottom body, you could imagined how comfortable would been if you laying on the top as you see her stomach raising up and down by her breath. Speaking of her belly, Indeedee has asking you a weird question about herself \"Hum... Master, I have a question... D-do... Do you think I look fat?\" she asking you shyly and of course, you reply \"*Chuckle* Of course not! You just have a round shaped on your bottom just like the other females!\" and for cheer her up you doing raspberries on her belly which it work as she's amusing and it get it out of her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway... Back to the reality, you snap out as you must continue. \"(Come on *Your name*.)\" you say to yourself \"(We almost there.)\" you walk on your bed passing by her side and at last, you reach to the side of her head as she still starting at the cell. You take a deep breath and here go nothing you begin to call her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeedee! Wake up!\" you scream as your giant Indeedee jump back in alert \"Dee?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeedee get up and look around still sitting on your bed. \"[Master? Where are you?]\" *That her poke speech which you can't understand what it saying*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeedee! Down here!\" you yell as she look down and saw your tiny form waving at her that cause her to jump back again, let out \"Indee!?\" noises and fell off of the bed. Not too long, she quickly get up and come take a close look at you. Putting her both hands paws on her mouth as she's immediately recognized you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Oh my...] she say with concerned expression before she begins to speak with telepathy. \"{Master *Your name*! Is that really you?!}\" *That's her telepathy speech and remember only YOU could heard her voice.* You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{What happened to you? Why are you so small?}\" she asks in shock, she's clearly worry about you right now and maybe worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Its a long story...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew moments later, after you explain her everything of what happened. Indeedee takes you on the table and serves you a flesh water glass. Without hesitation, you dive your head in and drinking the water as you can, because you need it. After you done the conversation continue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Thank you, Indeedee! I was seriously thirsty and it just what I needing!\" you say but it doesn't change the fact that your pokemon is not really happy for your situation as she's sit on the chair facing to your tiny size with a serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{So, let me get the straight. You met a legendary pokemon named Mew who come to playing with you and at the end it decides to shrink you down and challenges you to find it, correct?}\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. But now that's the problem, I don't know where is it and I can't tell if it still in Melemele island or-\" but then you get cut by your pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{How many times I have to tell you?} she says \"Huh?\" \"{You shouldn't go out without me.}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Indeedee! I'm 13 and soon 14 in few months and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{So, even small pokemons could be dangerous no matter how old you are!} she cut you again \"{Just look at yourself! We just arrived here and you got yourself shrunk by that legendary pokemon and what worst could happen to you?}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look even if you were been with me, you may end up to be shrunk as well. Plus you're not really good in battle. The only offensive move you know is Stored power and the rest of the moves are Play nice, Helping hand and Heal pulse whice you always use this move to heal my wounds every times I getting hurt. How cou-\" you getting cut again but this time it was by a loud slamming on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{ITS STILL NO EXCUSE TO GO OUT ALONE!}\" she shouting angrily in you mind. For the first time you get scared by your own pokemon even if you were at your normal size and she is a lot shorter than you, you'll still be scared when she's get angry. Then you saw tears come out of her eyes, she's... about to cry? \"{When you were gone... I was worried about you... you left without let me know... what if you get eating by another pokemon and I will never know about that you... you...}\" she cut her telepathy and begin to crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you feel guilty to that, she's right. How could you know you'll get yourself into trouble. This time you do get in trouble and this is by far the worse one. If you doesn't made it back, Indeedee will never know your fate and she's deeply care about you as you care about her as well. So, you walk towards your giant crying Indeedee and begin to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeedee...\" you call her as she looks at you \"I'm... sorry for the trouble... you're right I shouldn't go out alone like this... I didn't mean to hurt you that much but...\" she listens your words as you continue \"...But I promise I will never go out alone again and I want you to stay with me, because your my friend Indeedee... MY best friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{...Y-you will?}\" she asks as she wimp out her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will... promise.\" suddenly you feel a force enveloped as you begin to floating into air and you getting dragging towards your giant Indeedee who just catches you with her both hands and cuddly you against her nuzzle as she squeaking with joy by saying in her language \"Thank you! Thank you! THANK YOU!!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moments, she's finally calm down and bring you to her eyes level. \"{Thank you, master. Now, we'll find Mew and returned you at your normal size! But first...}\" then the happy moment stopped when Indeedee brings you closer to her face, sniff you and then back her head away in disgust and says.\"{...you need to take a bath. You smell sweat.}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed by her words, you sniff yourself and... yeah, she's right. \"Hum... good idea, Indeedee.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the bathroom, you were hiding in a case taking off your clothes while Indeedee prepared the bath. You going admit you're kinda uncomfortable be nude with the presence of Indeedee, even if it's a pokemon she still a female and you're a boy, you still feel it's kinda inappropriate. Then you hear Indeedee call you out. \"{Alright master, the bath is ready.}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Here we go.\" you come out of the case covering your private part, you walk on the corner and you see Indeedee has...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Fills up a small bowl as bath perfect for your size and she lets you wash yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Fills up a small bowl as bath perfect for your size but she insists to clean you by herself even if you could do it by yourself and make you feel really embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Fills up the bath of bathroom which it at size of large pool and there too much water. You tell her but she telling it's not just for you but for both of us. That's mean you taking a bath with your giant Indeedee! And make even more embarrassing and uncomfortable.</span></div></div>",

That Mew has shrunken you to a size that's even smaller than a Joltik and now, you are in great danger right now! Before meeting the mystical Pokemon, you were trying to get out of the forest and being too tried, you fell asleep. After you woken up, you saw her floating above you and for unknown reason, has shrunken you and abandoned you in this spot. You could've heard her say something about a little game in human language. You shrugged it off and thought that you are hearing things so right now, all you have to do is to get out of here alive before any Pokemon make a meal out of you. Not only that, but your new size makes your attempt at finding the exit even more of a challenge. Could this be what Mew is trying to do? Giving you an even more difficult adventure to make things more interesting? Guess so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the bushes at the center and make your way across it. This is the most riskest route you ever taken; the bushes are too dark to see and you could ended up getting spotted by a wild Pokemon. While you pushed the branches away as you go, you look around to make sure there's no danger around here. So far so good, there's nothing around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally got of bushes, completely unharmed. However, you are aware that this is only the beginning of your tiny adventure in this forest. You concluded that this is going to take days to find an exit around here and you are not sure how are you going to survive any longer. What you really need is something to speed things up like hitching a ride on a wild Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard something that wasn't so far from where you are. It almost sounded like a series of footsteps which later disappears afterwards. There's no denining that this is a sign that someone must be around. With that, you think about going to that person and hitch a ride on them to get out of this forest; you highly doubt that they will ever find you due to your very tiny size, but maybe you'll try to get their attention later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to your left of where you hear the noise and make a run towards the source. You can see a giant figure that is just standing at a clearing and by the looks of it, this person appears to be female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

Now you read the paper long enough, and you knew who this woman was since you lived in Eterna City. It was Gardenia, the grass type Gym Leader. This could not be better, you were near a Gym Leader. A smile on your face as you need to get going and get her attention. If anyone can help you it would be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus better then being with all the wild Pokemon in the forest who would want to eat you. You get going and start moving, but you have to stop yourself as she bended over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will admit, you have a bit of a perverted size, and seeing her giant ass sticking out like that. Well you just had to stare in awe. You have never seen it in person, but you have heard that she had a nice ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can testify. Not to mention your small size made it even bigger and you were being honest, even better. Guess there was one advantage to being so small. She walked around, walking around and looking some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her at the moment, as you chase her around. Not getting her attention just yet, but waiting and biding your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich turned out to be the right move, as suddenly she bent over to pick something up again. Giving you a good view of her tight booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this time you noticed something else, what she was picking up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was picking up flowers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one looks good.\u201d She said under her breath, surely not expecting a small person to be listening. \u201cI home she likes them. Oh tonight just has to be perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now you were a little curious about it. What does she mean by that. Sure you could get her attention, but you were going to follow and see what she means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around, grabbing more flowers until you put your thought into gear. Since you don\u2019t want to get her attention just yet, you are still gonna be prepared. So you go over and jump onto her boot. Dirt and grass on it as she turned her body around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, that should be nice. Just got to put it in a vase.\u201d She said to herself as you look at the giant girl. So it was going to be a present?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlowers from Eterna City. Seems about fitting for her, but who is she giving it too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at her curious for a couple of seconds until she said something you were honestly not expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis night has to be perfect, for Candice.\u201d Gardenia said with a type of determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were left stunned and thinking about this. This was for Candice, the Ice gym leader from Snowbelle City. You guess it makes sense, Gym Leaders would be friends, considering they share the same position. She must be coming down to visit her friend. That\u2019s what you thought, and didn\u2019t put more into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like jumping on her boot was the right move, cause as soon as you made that together, she started to move and walk away. She left and walked away going out of the forest. You freak out for a couple of seconds as you made sure you were safe and not going to be thrown around. Holding yourself as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, Gardenia would of been in the forest so many times, and seems to want to leave so you were safe. You were safe and not going to be thrown around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Gardenia knew her way out. In no time at all, she left the forest, making it seem easily if anything. Every step that she took though she covered a lot of ground, and you feel like you would of done pretty good yourself if you did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out and crossed the bridge to her city. Looking at it, you remember knowing it, but not at this size. What should you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell hang on for dear life. Why would you let go and be loose in the city, while you can hang on and be safe. So you do just that, as she walked around and away. Away for a long time as she got to her Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way in as she the doors opened, and she hurried her way to her quarters. You have no idea why she was so quick to impress Candice, but seeing that she was so busy, that was not good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should wait on getting her attention and help. Don\u2019t want to ruin her day and make her hate you. Granted you have heard that she was a nice woman, so chances are she won\u2019t do that. Still to be safe though and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought went away, as she entered her personal quarters and you saw... well you would say a screw chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandles ready to be light, clean as a whistle with a purple tone over it, as well as petals on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is planning to... she is planning to bed Candice. That\u2019s why she was so passionate about it, because well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know she was a lesbian? Regardless, you were in her room so you get off the boot. Getting to the side as you see the giant gym leader move around and get close to one of the desks. Putting the flowers in a jar and hanging it in a really nice place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you going to do? You can\u2019t get her attention now! She was obviously planning something big, and if you interrupted that, well you wouldn\u2019t be happy about it so you doubt she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hide and watch the whole scene. Getting their attention tomorrow and... well maybe get a view if things did get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour other option, well your other option was... a long shot to say the least.</span></div></div>",

Regardless Mew is already gone and you don't know where is she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe what Mew has done to you. She shrunk you down to 1 or 2 inches and leaves you like this. This is the worst thing that just happen to you! And what worse is also you have no pokemon partner! That's right, you're a 12 years old pokemon trainer who still have not caught a single pokemon and have no partner. There no way you will be able to find Mew at your new size and plus any wild pokemons will be very dangerous to you! They're all going to be like dynamaxed! Good thing you're not too far from Aspertia city, otherwise you'll have too survive from the wild. So, with no other option you decide to trying find help as possible as you head towards the city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Aspertia city, Bianca the 16 years old trainer who work as professor Juniper's assistance has just give the Unova starters to two new pokemon trainers Hugh and Nate/Rosa (You decide in the next chapter) walk down from the stairs chatting with the protagonist. The protagonist wondering about the last remain pokemon and Bianca replies \"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find a trainer eventually or otherwise I will take good care of it. Anyway, I have to head back to professor Juniper's lab so take care of your pokemon and good luck for your journey, bye!\" she waves at the protagonist as they wave back. However, at the moment she ran, she end up to trip by klutz and falls on the ground as the protagonist ran over to help her to get up and the poke ball that contain the last starter is sending fly out of the box...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you, you made in town without problem but now \"Oh my Arceus...\" the city is so huge! How are you getting attention of someone at your tiny size? You could easily get stepped and even end up to... *Funeral coffin dancing meme video* No! You'll survive and find a way to return at your normal size. But you wonder if peoples will believe that you got shrunk by Mew? Well, you do have the proof with your selfie picture with Mew but it also shrunk with you and it would be impossible for the normal sized person to see the picture not even a magnifying glass will help because your pokenav is kinda at the size of speck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your thought get interrupted by a large poke ball who is twice bigger than you landing right infront of you cause you to fall on your butt on the ground. \"What the...\" this is all you could say before the poke ball suddenly open front your eyes as the pokemon come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sitting on the ground, what you see is jaw drop. Infront you, there a like dynamaxed ______ standing there confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note this pokemon will becomes your first partner, but you must following the logic by what pokemon that Hugh and the protagonist have pick early.

However, she saw no one, which was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy, along with other two Pokemon, had been used to sit around in Professor Juniper's lab, awaiting for a trainer to come pick their first Pokemon; if she was called out, then that must mean that she was picked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the grass-type was vaguely excited about meeting her new trainer. Problem was, she couldn't find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you just sat there, eyes wide open and not making a motion; in front of you, the large Snivy didn't appear to have noticed, and you weren't sure whether that was a good or bad thing. You could see her massive, scaly stomach extending far above, where her head was turning left and right as the behemoth apparently looked for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you decided not to draw attention towards you and to shy away as quietly as possible, lest the Snivy ended up mistaking you for a snack and treating you as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you got back on your feet and began backing up. However, the motion caused the grass to rustle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy?</span>\" the large Pokemon called as she turned her head and looked down, finally spotting something in the grass. Or better, she spotted some<i>one</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">S-Snivy?</span>\" she stuttered, leaning down on her slim legs, getting onto her belly to better look at you, who were frozen by fear, which only amplified as you found yourself face to eye with the green and yellow giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seemed the Pokemon had no interest in causing you harm; instead, it looked like she was studying you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy felt confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was supposed to meet a trainer, that was why she had heard from Professor Juniper as well as her assistant Bianca, yet all she found was what appeared to be an incredibly small human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting her head slightly, giving a soft cry of her name, Snivy came to the conclusion that her trainer... must have been you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense. You must have been the one picking her, releasing you from her Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing this, the Pokemon shot you a haughty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\" she said, sounding... disappointed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please don't eat me!\" you blurted out once you regained enough courage to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni? Vy.</span>\" the Pokemon replied, shaking her head with a sigh. How had she even ended up with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you were her trainer now, so she supposed she had to stick with you... though it really looked like you were the one who needed to stick with someone right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the giantess rose slightly, muttering her own name a couple times, before reaching out a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\" she said, urging you to climb on with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks?\" you uncertainly said, surprised by this turn of events. Instead of eating you, it looked like the Snivy was actually lending you a hand... quite literally in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed on top of the paw, the giant Pokemon rose it back up as she herself rose to her feet and stood still, contemplating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared back at the Pokemon, unsure what you should have said. What was she even going to do to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you had to try and get her to help you out, maybe by asking her to bring you to someone or something like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know if she was going to listen or if she was even going to understand you, but... it was worth a shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey,\" you stuttered, still a bit afraid,<br>\r\n\"Look, I know that this may seem confusing and, trust me, it is, but I really, really need your help right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I met a, uh... Pokemon that did this to me earlier, that made me shrink to this size, and I need to find a way to get it back. So, can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the Snivy appeared to understand what you said, and the surprise became greater when you saw her nodding her head, signaling that she agreed to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're... going to help me out?\" you wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Vy.</span>\" the grass-type replied affirmatively, nodding her head once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... this was a relief, you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec, why are you helping me though?\" you asked. Snivy were supposed to be pretty cold Pokemon, from what you knew, but this one was willing to help you out even though she had just met you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the giantess gave a perplexed cry, then pointed to the ground; turning around, you saw the Pokeball she popped out of earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\" you said, trying to figure out what that meant; and, when the Snivy then pointed to you, it helped you realized that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You think I'm your trainer?\" you muttered under your breath, looking back at the green giantess, who nodded her head,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put a hand to your head, pensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had all been one major mistake... but one you could work with, because you really had no other choice; if this Snivy believed you were her trainer, you could convince her to do as you said, as long as you watched the way you said it: Snivy and their evolutions were extremely prideful creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay Snivy, first off...\" you trailed off, causing 'your' Pokemon to tilt her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't deny that the idea of actually having a Pokemon thrilled you, but you couldn't think about that right now, even though you really had no idea what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you go after Mew? Return home to sort things out? Find help from someone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head started aching, and you distractedly looked down, spotting Snivy's Pokeball again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, you supposed you shouldn't just leave that laying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Snivy, can you pick that Pokeball for me, please?\" you asked as nicely as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon nodded, then bent to pick the Pokeball, which she offered to you; it was about twice your size, making it impossible for you to carry, but pressing the button in the middle should do the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, once you did, the Pokeball shrank to the size of a soccer ball and fell next to you on Snivy's verdant palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you said, picking the sphere up, before looking back at the giantess, who was waiting orders from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure about what you should have done, you began pondering your next course of action. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can't believe how lucky you got there, getting your first pokemon partner shortly after been shrunk by Mew. However, your happy time has sooner turns down when you realize something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poke ball just arrives from nowhere and almost landing right on you. Then Snivy pops out from it and thinks you're her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to feel that pokemon already belong to someone else and keep that pokemon may be a bad idea even if you wanted to. But stealing pokemon is no good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the best option is helping the pokemon to find it real owner, maybe the person will repay you by helped you to return at your normal size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the big poke ball that you hold with your both arms, it a little heavy for your size but you manage to carried this. You sigh, you hate breaking the new but you have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling guilty, you begin to explained to your pokemon that you would love to keep it. \"Um... well... listen, Snivy...\" you says as she pays attention \"...I-I'm going to be honest... I don't know if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! There you are, Snivy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly get interrupted by a feminine person who comes from behind Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vy?\" she turns her attention toward the call, holding you with her poke ball in her hands. And you saw a teenage blonde girl wearing a orange jacket, green jeans, green hat with a white bow and wearing glasses approached you and Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(She must been it owner.)\" you think and you get really nervous as the giantess arrives and towering you. Facing toward a small pokemon like Snivy is already make you feel smaller, but facing a normal sized human make you feel even more smaller and you don't want to imagined how large pokemons are going to be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost thought losing you after I trip. At least you're seem to be alright.\" Bianca says as Snivy blinks and looks at you, then realizes that you're not one of the trainer who is waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiance crouch down toward Snivy still not noticed what she's holding and brings her hand for the poke ball. \"Anyway, lets return you in your poke ball an-\" before she could finish, Snivy suddenly tosses you and her poke ball into Bianca's hand, the grass snake look piss off as she crosses her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca does notice her attitude, before she could asked what wrong with her. She felt something moving on her palm, she looks down and saw a person helding the poke ball in hand. Bianca takes a close look adjusting her glasses for make sure if she's not dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... H-hi there...\" you say awkwardly as her green eyes wided. \"Wh-WHAT!\" she scream as she almost falls on the floor as you hold yourself on her palm from her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca!\" another person that sound like a pre-teen girl arrives with a pig who follow her behind. \"Have you found it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Rosa but...\" she replies and shows the tiny person at her as Rosa's surprised by what she see in front her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? Why are you so small?\" one of the girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, you have explained what happened. About you met Mew, it playing with you, you taken a selfie with this pokemon and at the end Mew shrinks you down and leave you in that way, unless you find it. And then the part you meet Snivy and here we are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's what happened.\" you finished your story. The girls seem found it hard to believe that you meet the legendary pokemon Mew, but judging by your size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, I'm telling the truth and I did have a proof but...\" you look at your pokenav where you have the picture but it shrunk with you and there no way they could see the picture at your normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I believe you.\" Bianca says and Rosa believes as well. \"Thank you, girls.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, my name's Bianca. I'm assistant of professor Juniper, nice to meet you.\" she introduces herself to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Rosa, pokemon trainer and this is my partner, Tepig!\" she picks up her pokemon to show you as he greets you with a cry \"Tepig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is (Your name) and I'm a pokemon trainer too but... I kinda don't have a pokemon, yet...\" you awkwardly introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't have a pokemon.\" Rosa says and you nodded. Poor you, Rosa and Bianca feel really bad for you. Even Snivy who still out of her poke ball has listening the conversation. First she was still angry at you but until she heard that you have no pokemon, she begins to felt bad for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep thought, Snivy believes it would been a good idea to become your first pokemon. Maybe having a tiny trainer would not be that bad at all. Then a vile come out from Snivy's shoulder and reach for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment you feel something wrapped around your body, drag you off from Bianca's hand and bring you to Snivy's body. \"Snivy? What are you doing?\" the girls watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy doesn't replies as she brings you close her and presses you against her chest giving you a big hug. \"S-snivy!?\" you cried in embarrassing as she patted you head gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggle as they admire its cute. The Snivy looks at Bianca and tries something as she pointed at herself and then at you. Not too long before they get the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want be his pokemon, right?\" she asks and Snivy nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea! I'm sure professor Juniper will be okay with it. So what do you think?\" Bianca asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your answer, you look up at the giant Snivy who smiled down at you. Then you smile back, wide your arms and hug her back as you say \"I have no objection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its decided, Snivy is yours now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pokemon received music*<br>\r\nYou have received Snivy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Huh? Did I just heard a music?...)\" you look around \"(Nah! Must be my imagination.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I got my first pokemon but it still doesn't solves the problem of my size. Now what?\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know, you could come with us! Tepig and I will help you to find Mew and convince it to return you at normal size. Beside it'll be fun having more companions on our journey right, Tepig?\" Rosa suggests as Tepig agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or... I could take you to professor Juniper. I'm sure she and Fennel will find a way to fix you.\" Bianca says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... It seems not be bad their ideals. You always wanted to begin your pokemon journey as a trainer and become champion but at your new size... it'll been much harder. But at least, you'll have another trainer by your side. But if you go with Bianca to Juniper's lab, it maybe the best option but it'll probably going to be boring to wait, but at least you could probably play with your Snivy will during the wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at your new partner Snivy who seems to have no objection of your decision. So, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

The main reason was that it wasn't guaranteed that the professors could fix you, while Mew promised it would grow you back if you found it, meaning that going out would give better odds of growing then just staying still at a lab. Another reason was sort of silly, it's just that ever since you were young you wanted to be a pokemon trainer. While this isn't exactly the situation you imagined, it would still be awesome, riding a pokemon as small as a Snivy throughout the lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls and two pokemon stared down at you as you made your choice. \"I'd like to travel with Rosa and Tepig, if you wouldn't mind having me, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Isn't that right Tepig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Te-Pig!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca sighed. \"Alright, if that's your choice I won't complain. I'll still tell the professor about you so they'll be looking into it while you're keeping each other company. You should expect a call from them soon Rosa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the attention of your new partner Snivy by tapping on the vine that is still holding you. \"Hey Snivy, are you okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy put her paw up in a gesture mimicking an army salute. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Sni-Vy!\",</span> which you took to mean yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter plenty of precautions from Bianca including giving you her X-Transceiver number and such Bianca went her separate way towards the lab, while you stayed on Snivy's head as Snivy walked alongside Rosa. Rosa had tried to hold you herself but Snivy vehemently refused, seemingly very attached and protective of you. You trusted Rosa but said nothing, knowing that Snivy didn't mean any harm and shouldn't be reprimanded for something so minor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio of you walked through the gate and into the route outside of the town. Thankfully Snivy was a somewhat tall pokemon, as you could just barely look over the grass while on Snivy's head. You shuddered to think of how terrifying grass would be while blinded by it. You and Rosa talked through X-Transceivers, mostly to not make Rosa look crazy for talking to herself. While on your way to the next town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Hugh shows up and challenges Rosa to a battle. Wether Hugh finds out about you or not is up to you.<br>\r\nB: You work together with Snivy to catch a pokemon, either Snivy herself throwing the ball or you dropping it on a fainted pokemon.<br>\r\nC: Nothing happens and you successfully make it to the next town!<br>\r\nD: As promised, a call from Professor Juniper comes.<br>\r\nE: Rosa is the one that catches a new pokemon, which means a brand new Pokemon to introduce you to.</span></div></div>",

You and Rosa contine chatting to getting known each others. Then the conversation gets interrupted by a boy with a Oshawott standing on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rosa!\" Hugh calls her as he approaches the group who turned their attention at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi! Hugh, how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Oshawott and I have caught a lot pokemons. And how about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we just starting our journey... and we still haven't done anything, yet.\" Rosa puts one of her hand behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you listen the conversation from the two giants trainers who towering you, while your Snivy is distracted by a certain sea otter pokemon who keep staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Snivy turns her attention at Oshawott, his eyes begin to gleaming with a wide smile and blushing. Oshawott waves at Snivy in excitement as she rolls her eyes, letting out a sigh and wave back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong of the three starters, Snivy was the only female in the trio. Her relation with Tepig is neutral, but with Oshawott... its another story. Oshawott really likes Snivy and he even trying to flirt with her. Well... Snivy doesn't really hate Oshawott, but its just she's sometime annoyed by that otter when he tries to impressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Oshawott approaches Snivy, he pauses when he notices there something on her head or more like someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wott.. Osha-Oshawott?\" *\"Um... Snivy, you have an human on your head?\"*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy simply giggle, bring one of her vines, pull you off of her head, bring you to her paws and hold you close to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy vy sni-Vy, snivy vy vy sni.\" *\"So you finally notice it, Oshawott. This is (Your name) and he's my trainer.\"*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what is going on with the two pokemons but the fact your Snivy is showing you to Oshawott. You decide to introduce yourself to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Hi, my name is (Your name)... and I'm her trainer. Nice to meet you, Oshawott!\" you greet at the giant sea otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOshawott was stunned with jawdropped, he cannot believed what he just see, an tiny male human in the hands of Snivy. In same time Oshawott felt kinda... jealous. He wishes he could be in your place, been held by Snivy as a giantess would be... *dreaming*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Rosa &amp; Hugh, Hugh were about to asking a rematch. But until he notices Snivy standing next to Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.... is that Snivy?\" that caught your attention and Snivy's as well. \"What is it doing here? I thought Bianca had take it back to Juniper. Don't tell me that you convince her to give it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa giggles \"Not really, she's not mine. Snivy got her own trainer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Hugh looks around but there no one else. \"But where is the trainer? I don't it anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa giggles again and replies \"He's right there.\" she pointed at Snivy \"Take a close look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Hugh does what Rosa says as he crouch down in front Snivy. The snake pokemon who stared at him sighes and raise you up to give him a good view on you as you awkwardly wave your arm at him. Hugh's red eyes wided and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE F-\" that could be heard from the towns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of explanation about what happened, Hugh finds it hard to believed that you met the legendary pokemon Mew &amp; think that you must be shrunk by the Team Plasma which he hates them because they stole the Purrloin of his little sister and he will do everything to get it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you the truth, I also have a proof! I had taken a selfie with Mew and the picture is in my pokenav. But it shrunk with me and I don't think you could see this at your normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless if you could send the picture to my X-Transceiver\" Hugh says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment and slap yourself on your head. Why you don't think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I will try to send it to Rosa's\" you say since you know her number. You hope it'll working and success Rosa receives the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa looks in her X-Transceiver, Hugh takes a look as well and they could clearly the picture of you with Mew sitting on your laps. Both were amazed by the fact you truly met Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you believe me now?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" Hugh replies \"But is professor Juniper aware about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... We haven't receive a call from her, yet. But she should call us soon.\" Rosa explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Hugh \"Now then, how about we have a pokemon battle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you, Rosa and even the pokemons were surprised by his suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: As Hugh were say, he still want to take a rematch against Rosa. So, you and Snivy watch the match between Rosa and Hugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Hugh decides to challenge you instead Rosa. For your first battle, its your Snivy vs his Oshawott. You may have a chance to win, because Snivy has advantage against water. Unless if Oshawott got a lot stronger than you could expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Hugh decides to challenging both of you and Rosa in a double battle and he introduces his second pokemon.</span></div></div>",

It'll probably take us a while, though.\" Rosa answered, shooting you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sn-snivy.</span>\" Snivy chimed in. You patted her on the head,<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're fine walking all the way there?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni.</span>\" your Pokemon replied, nodding her head slightly, careful not to throw you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good sign, you guessed; usually, it took some work to gain a Snivy's trust, but this one seemed to have a decent amount of that in you; sadly, you couldn't say the same for Rosa, whom your Snivy won't even let touch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed she just had to learn to trust other people aside from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, your attempt at striking up a conversation failed miserably, as the trip continued as silent as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that changed the moment your X-Transceiver began ringing as an unknown number appeared on the display,  causing both Snivy and Rosa to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" the latter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, then cautiously picked up the call, wondering who it was; your question was answered when the image of a brown-haired woman with green eyes appeared on the screen, wearing a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! This is Professor Juniper, from Nuvema Town,\" the woman politely introduced herself, <br>\r\n\"And you must be the trainer Bianca had told me about, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you hesitated, unsure how to reply,<br>\r\n\"I think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca says that one of the Pokeballs she was supposed to deliver ended up getting lost, but someone found it and the Pokemon inside was fine with them being her trainer.\" the Professor explained,<br>\r\n\"Would that be you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you answered, blushing a bit,<br>\r\n\"I hope that's not a problem, um... Professor,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Professor Juniper smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all,\" she said, while Rose knelt beside Snivy to try and follow the conversation; Snivy just leered at the trainer and took a few steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally, I think that if a Pokemon chooses a specific trainer, then it's tantamount to a trainer choosing a Pokemon.\" the Professor continued, before waving a hand dismissively, <br>\r\n\"Anyway, that's not what I called you for. Bianca contacted me earlier, telling me about you; she referred about a... particularity of yours, developed upon your encounter with the legendary Pokemon Mew. I was hoping you could give me some details about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. Start from the beginning, please,\" Professor Juniper encouraged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you replied, feeling a bit uncomfortable,<br>\r\n\"So, it began earlier today, when I was sleeping on the outskirts of town. I was woken up and discovered that a Mew was there with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then proceeded to explain all that had happen during the short time you spent with Mew, from her playing silly games with you to her shrinking you down to size, challenging you to find her before taking off; then, you explained your encounter with Snivy, then with Bianca and Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then we decided to travel together, in search of Mew.\" you finished, Rose doing a silly victory pose beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of your tale, Professor Juniper looked slightly skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she said, adopting a serious expression,<br>\r\n\"Look, can you demonstrate what you are saying in any way? You don't need to, but I would appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I had a picture, but... hold on,\" you said. It would be much easier showing your proof to the professor, since you could simply send her the selfie you had taken with Mew. You guessed that tech was a blessing, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few moments of silence, during which the Professor appeared to be looking somewhere else, before she finally looked back at you with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is undoubtedly a Mew. Thanks for sharing,\" she told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way to... y'know, fix me?\" you asked, not bothering to hide the anxiety in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni-snivy!</span>\" Snivy intervened, curious about that as well; having a doll-sized trainer was sort of cool, but she guessed that having a full-sized one meant she didn't have to take care of you all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor looked to the side with a flustered smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... not any that I know of,\" she replied, causing you to groan,<br>\r\n\"But I can at least try to find a way, so that, even if you don't find Mew, we can at least give it a shot ourselves. Because, I'm sorry to say, I think the chances of finding that Mew again are considerably low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez...\" Rosa complained,<br>\r\n\"It's almost like you <i>don't</i> want us to find Mew, Professor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that, I'm sure everything is going to be just fine.\" Professor Juniper reassured,<br>\r\n\"So, I'll be going now, I wish you two the best of luck. And, take good care of your Snivy, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor offered one last smile, before she ended the conversation, leaving you back with Rosa and Snivy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief.\" the former commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, though I'm hoping to find Mew as well. It would give this journey much more sense.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and speaking of journey, we should probably.\" Rosa said playfully, getting back up,<br>\r\n\"C'mon, on to Floccesy Town!\" she said, marching forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy looked at her with contempt, which you noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that, at least she's eager.\" you chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Vy.</span>\" Snivy huffed with a shrug as she went to follow Rosa. </span></div></div>",

Because she the only one who could carrying all the stuffs in her bag, while you're too tiny for carry them and Snivy cannot just carried the stuffs all by herself. And in your bag that shrunk with you, you only have your town map and some of your clothes like pyjama, swimsuit, coat, costume and some other trainers outfit, and at least you can change yourself later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you finally made it to Flocessy Town without encounter any wild pokemon yet. As Rosa leads the way, you suddenly getting stop by a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there, trainer!\" the voice calls from the high as Rosa and your Snivy stop walking look up and you as well and saw a man standing on the top of the cliff and then he suddenly jump off the cliff and lands right on his feets in front the gang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed by this man how he landing from the high cliff without getting hurt. You wonder how he do this, but regardless you don't even want to try it, it would been suicide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon, the man turns towards Rosa, you recognized this man, it's Alder the champion of Unova! Well, he was the champion but now he's retired for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo pay attention at the conversation as Alder examines the teenage trainer girl as you still were amazed by meeting the former champion. Then Alder turns his attention towards your Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he thinks that pokemon is Rosa's partner but until... \"And I guess that pokemon is y-\" he pauses when he notices there something on the pokemon's head as he crouch down to take a close look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, you realize that Alder had finally noticed you as you getting nervous. However, Snivy notices it too, quickly she snatches you from her head with one of her vines, brings you to her arms and holds you against her chest in a protective pose like if she's holding her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Darn it, Snivy!)\" you muffled \"(We seriously going to talk about it!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa laughs about Snivy's action and decides to explained at about what happened for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, not too far in the bushes, a shadow figure with greenish blue eyes watches the trainers chatting with the former champion but what is really caught it attention is the tiny human who ride on Snivy's head. For some reason its interested it as it smirk, revealed it teeths and chuckle. It seems to have some planned to have fun with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rosa finishes to explained your situation. Alder understands, it goods to known that Juniper's aware about it, he also surprising by the fact you met the legendary Mew which he never meets this one before. But in the other side, he still concerned of your situation, he wonders if it really a good idea for you to go in journey at this size, he would like to help you but he doesn't really have much free time for this, at least you have Rosa to help you, but still not sure about it. At the end, he decides to go with, hoping you stay safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alder leads the two news trainers in the town, the mystery figure watches them headed to the town and it decides to go after them. Before it come out from it hiding spot, it suddenly glows dark purple and begin to changing form and what come out from the bushes is a youngster boy with a creepy smile expression who walks bizarrely on his two legs and heads towards the town. A gray tail is visible on his rear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you, Alder leads Rosa and you still riding on your Snivy to the college. Rosa asks Alder if he has see her friend Hugh, she almost forgot that she had two town maps, one for herself and the other for Hugh, and she must gives it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlder says he does have see a boy with his Oshawott pass by and headed to the route 20. Rosa decides to go find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm going find him.\" she look down at you and say \"You come?\" you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" she ran towards the route 20 with Snivy who went after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Alder calls but too late, he was about to suggested you to stay but they already gone. Alder still have some questions to asked you but now it'll have to wait as he sighes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for their return, Alder notices a strange boy passes in front him. He was about to get his attention when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Alder!\" a young girl calls him as he turns his attention towards the girl who approach of him. \"Mister Alder, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A moment, young one...\" Alder turns back and... \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange boy is already out of the sight and he's nowhere to been found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his grin, he wonder where the boy just go? \"Strange, I have a bad feel about...\"</span></div></div>",

Revealed to be a small gray fox with a ponytail on the top of his head, which this pokemon is none other than Zorua the tricky fox! And then, he continues to following his target (you) as he remained hiding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you, arrived at Floccesy Ranch entrance. You, Rosa, Snivy and Tepig notice a small blue creature playing at bouncing on it large blue tail ball. This pokemon is known as Azurill, as Rosa scan this one with her pokedex and it revealed to be pokemon normal and... fairy type?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy type? I never heard this before...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa was about to say the same thing until she remember something. Early when she received the pokedex, Bianca has mentioned that professor Juniper has received new information from Kalos region that a new type pokemon has been discover and they have to update the Unova dex for the new info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondering how do they haven't discover this before. While Rosa replies with the sign \"I dunno\". Anyway, leaving the Azurill alone, because it doesn't seem to be alone as there two Azumarills approached the little one, that must be it parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two approach the farm, you saw two farmers with one Herdier. Rosa suggests to asked them if they have see Hugh. But you got a ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosa, wait! I got idea!\" you yell as the giantess trainer stops, turn her attention to you and crouch down for better hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you go to ask them while Snivy and I will wait on the bench.\" you reply. That surprised her even your Snivy. \"Look I know... but I don't want to freak them out if they saw me at this size. But I also want to speak with Snivy alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vy?\" your Snivy says by what she just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa didn't like the idea to split out but if it's important to speak with your pokemon in private. She sighes \"Alright, but just don't go too far. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you watch the giantess goes up to her full height and walk toward the farmers with her Tepig who follow her alongside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zorua watches the group separated in two direction. Its now his chance to play a trick with you, a smile grows on his face as he just got a ideal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rosa, Rosa asks at the farmers if they have see a boy with blue hair, red eyes, with a red jacket, etc. They say they do have see him and he helped them to find their lost Herdier. She thanks them and before go after Hugh, she must head back to get you and Snivy. As she goes back, suddenly a wild Riolu jumps out from the tall grasses, landing right in front Rosa, blocking her way and it doesn't seems to want let her pass without a fight. Guess Rosa haven't no choice but accepted the challenge and beside she could try to catch that Riolu if she could. With her Tepig ready, the fight begin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you, your Snivy walks toward the bench with you still sitting on her head, she uses her vine to pick you up and place you on the bench. Then Snivy hops on the bench, sits right next to you and listens what you have to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you want to talk is about her attitude toward Rosa and you would like your Snivy gives her some respect. Because when she leers at Rosa, stepped back from her and hold you tight against her chest, you feel like a doll that the pokemon doesn't want to be taken away. And you don't want it go too far or worst. You trust Rosa as a friend and Snivy should do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to tell at your Snivy about this, a shadow figure approach. \"Alright, Snivy. We need talk about...\" *Shadow looming above you* \"...Rosa? You're back already? So, what they say?\" however you notice a smirk on her expression as she's just standing in front you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Rosa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa still say nothing, instead she brings her hand toward you trying to pick you up. Snivy notices that and hisses at her, but Rosa ignores her as her hand reached toward you and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Whip*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy use Vine whip on Rosa's hand as she steps back screaming in pain. And what you heard it's not Rosa's voice but a pokemon noise and when she turns it revealed there a tail above of her rear. That make you realize that's not Rosa as the illusion wore off revealed the imposter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... a Zorua?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Zorua glare at Snivy and prepare to attacked her and the pokemon battle begins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: As his plan failed, Zorua got a idea to trying to convince you to let him join in your journey, you're happy to let him in but Snivy in other... She's not certain to trust that fox. Plus, Rosa have the empty poke ball, so you have to wait her return. But can you really trust that pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Before you or your Snivy could do anything, Zorua fled. You thinking about to go after him but you get interrupt by the real Rosa who come back with a new pokemon she caughts Riolu and leads you to find Hugh. However, Zorua have not say his last word...</span></div></div>",

What's up, Snivy?\" you asked; noting that she had finally gotten your attention, the Pokemon lowered her arm and pointed it forward, to where Rosa was standing without moving,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Rosa?\" you called, but she didn't hear you, so you quickly searched for her X-Transceiver number on your own device; once she heard it ringing, Rosa looked at it, then back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What's up?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You zoned out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa blushed and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry...

But it'll help us bond with our Pokemon, with each other and it'll be tons of fun, too!\" Rosa replied excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really know how to reply, so instead you looked down at Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" you asked, but she didn't listen, as she and Rosa's Tepig were busy talking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clred\">Perhaps it's better if we don't battle. I mean, wouldn't want to burn you or something...</span></u>\" the fire-type teased with a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Shut up.</span></u>\" she replied with a decent amount of annoyance in her voice, before she turned to you,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">I'm fine with it.</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I'm just going to assume that's a yes.\" you said, turning to Rosa,<br>\r\n\"So I'm in, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTh giantess smiled and began walking away, stopping when she put some distance between you and her; while she dropped her bag, your Snivy quietly picked you off of her head and placed you on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy?</span>\" she asked you, for the first time displaying a slight glint of concern in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be fine, I think.\" you reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy hesitated, but then adopted a straight face again as she nodded and turned her back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Let's do this, then.</span></u>\" she cried, noting how Rosa's Tepig was already waiting, and so was his trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, are you two ready?\" Rose asked; then without really waiting for an answer, she declared,<br>\r\n\"We'll make the first move! Tepig, use Tackle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Tepig sprinted towards Snivy at full speed, catching you off guard - for such a small Pokemon, he sure was fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to give a command as well, but when you opened your mouth to, you realized something: you had no idea what moves Snivy knew, aside from Vine Whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh...\" you hesitated as Tepig approached your Pokemon...<br>\r\n\"Dodge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the very last second, Snivy jumped out of the way, resulting in Tepig stopping his run as his opponent swiftly landed beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, use Vine Whip Snivy!\" you ordered, though noticing that your Pokemon was shooting you a diffident look; regardless, she did as told... but Tepig seemed completely unfazed by the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A grass-type move won't have much effect on a fire-type...\" Rosa pointed out, before adding,<br>\r\n\"But it'll be super-effective the other way around! Use Ember, Tepig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red and black swine followed the order and shot a wave of hot air through his nostrils, hitting Snivy, who cried her name in pain; Rosa's assault wasn't finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tepig, use Tackle once more!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Snivy was off-guard, Tepig charged at her and hit her, sending her flying; then, on Rosa's command, Tepig jumped surprisingly high and struck his opponent with tackle once more; this resulted in Snivy crashing to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. You didn't expect to win your first battle, but you didn't expect to lose this fast, either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy!\" you called, running towards where you saw Snivy landing; on the other side of the field, Rosa watched, shooting an apologetic look, before looking at Tepig,<br>\r\n\"I guess we went a little overboard there, Tepig...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">Tepig...</span>\" the small swine agreed, though he felt a smirk crawling on his cheeks.<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"clred\">Told her so...</span></i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you finally reached your Pokemon and rushed up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy, are you okay?\" you asked in concerned manner; you doubted a couple of Tackles had done much damage to her, but she was definitely hurt.<br>\r\n\"C'mon girl, talk to me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your relief, you saw Snivy opening her brown eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sn-snivy...</span>\" she moaned, before you saw her expression changing as she eyed you; she looked very...</span></div></div>",

How about you?</span></u>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, don't worry.\" you replied, guessing what she said to you and apparently guessing right, because she nodded and began to stand up; while she did, you felt the inexplicable need to comfort her, even though she seemed to barely care about losing her first battle.<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's fine, anyway. Life's not always about winning, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy began dusting herself off, muttering her own name under her breath in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the grass-type lowered her paw for you to climb on, which you did, before Rosa and her Tepig, who wore a teasing smile on his face, approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, are the two of you alright?\" the giantess asked, lowering herself to examine Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Tepig couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clred\">Did I hurt you that much, Snivy?</span></u>\" he said teasingly, earning a cold stare from the grass-type, who didn't even reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine.\" you answered Rosa, before sheepishly looking down,<br>\r\n\"Though I guess I did <i>that</i> bad for my first battle, hehehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not nearly as bad as you believe, but... definitely could've gone way better.\" Rosa said, before wearing a reassuring smile,<br>\r\n\"But, hey, we're all inexperienced here, so don't worry much about it.

I'm not saying it was your fault!\" you reassured,<br>\r\n\"I mean, I didn't even know what moves you could use back there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Tepig began laughing and Snivy groaned, once more looking at you with the same haughty look she looked at you when you first met her earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, don't give me that look, I didn't even know this was going to happen at the beginning of the day!\" you defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can fix that easily!\" she said as she pulled out her Pokedex from her bag, before looking at Snivy,<br>\r\n\"Now Snivy, do you mind giving me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy hissed and stepped back, clutching you to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay! You keep him, girl!\" Rosa hastily said, before pointing her Pokedex at your Pokemon,<br>\r\n\"Let's see... okay, Snivy knows three moves: Tackle, Leer and Vine Whip, though you already knew about that last one since you used it against Tepig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it barely did a scratch on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTepig adopted a smug look and began waving his paw,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">Te-piiig...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it was a grass-type move against a fire-type, you dummy! I've already told you!\" Rosa said with a laugh,<br>\r\n\"Snivy's a grass type, so her moves will be very effective on water, ground and rock-types, while they'll barely do anything to fire, poison and flying ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" she said,<br>\r\n\"Now, let's talk about strategy- oh, wait.\" she said, turning to dig into her bag once more, emerging with a red bottle that looked like a spray of some sort,<br>\r\n\"First, give this to Snivy. It'll help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were handed the bottle, that was easy the same size as you were, if not slightly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks?\" you said,<br>\r\n\"What is this, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A super potion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Okay.\" you said, turning to Snivy, comically holding the bottle like you were hugging it,<br>\r\n\"Okay Snivy, this'll help you feel better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy nodded her head, complying, as you began spraying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Rosa sat down on the edge of the route, with her Tepig happily jumping on her lap; Snivy sat down beside her, you on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of ironic how you were basically the opposite of Rosa with her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now let's talk combos,\" Rosa resumed from where left off,<br>\r\n\"You saw what I did back there, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went all-out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong... well, not really, but the point is: have you seen how we used Tepig's moves?\" the giantess asked, not waiting for an answer,<br>\r\n\"Tepig used Ember to blind Snivy, then he attacked while she couldn't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clred\">Ouch...</span></u>\" Tepig mocked, earning a growl from Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it now,\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"But how can I do that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... with the moves Snivy knows, a combination of Leer, which can lower a Pokemon's defense, and Tackle can be very effective.\" Rosa explained, putting a finger to her chin in a cute thinking pose,<br>\r\n\"Or maybe, you could use Vine Whip to incapacitate your opponent, that would be very useful, too. Limiting your opponent's movements while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... While Snivy attacks them...\" you continued, starting to understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never really studied about Pokemon and their moves before, but you were starting to understand, which was good: you certainly couldn't take on Mew, if that was the case, with the level of experience you had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Will result in a great attack!\" Rosa happily finished,<br>\r\n\"I see you're getting the 'hang' of it, hehehe. However, you should know that those combos won't always help if the moves are ineffective against other types. Don't worry though, Snivy'll learn more moves later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that.\" you said, recalling a gym battle you witnessed to, once: the challenger used a Serperior, and it was incredibly fast, not to mention powerful - it literally blew away the gym leader's own Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould your Snivy become that much powerful as well? Well, with enough practice, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, about abilities...\" Rosa continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa kept explaining things for a while more, about how moves could be used with a Pokemon's abilities to create devastating consequences on an opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your case, Snivy had the ability 'Overgrow', which powered up grass-type moves whenever Snivy's health was lowered enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRisky, but pretty useful if you needed to turn the tables in a hard battle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened closely to the advice you were given and, judging from the look on her face, Snivy was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, Rosa stopped talking and looked at her X-transceiver. Her eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at the time!\" she said, looking up - the sun was slowly setting,<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize it was that late! Aw man, we're going to have to spend the night in Floccesy Town...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound bad...\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that's assuming we get there in time!\" Rosa said, her Tepig jumping off as she stood up; however, the giantess then hesitated, seemingly thinking. Or better, rethinking,<br>\r\n\"... But hey, there's probably still a bit before the sun sets. So, why don't you and Snivy practice a bit?\" she suggested with a confident smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You just contradicted yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sn-Snivy.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, geez...\" she said,<br>\r\n\"But I think you should practice, for a little bit at least. Y'know, to put what I've told you to the test. I'll leave it up to you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure, you looked down at Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What d'you say?\" you asked. The grass-type shrugged,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that left the choice up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a moment. There would be plenty of time to practice later, you guessed, but maybe you should take some time to do as Rosa suggested?</span></div></div>",

As for Mew, she can't hide forever, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually fairly sure she can,\" you said dejectedly,<br>\r\n\"How do you explain she remained uncaught so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa's expression fell as well as she realized she had no reply for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... ehh... w-well, you should look on the bright side!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment those words left your mouth, Snivy let out an indignant cry and poked you twice in the side to remind you that she was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes... sorry, Snivy, hehe...\" you apologized while your Pokemon crossed her arms,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there's me, of course!\" Rosa continued, earning a glare from Snivy that caused the giantess to rise her hands,<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't give me that look, I wanna help, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy just grumbled her own name in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What I mean is, this could be much worse, y'know,\" Rosa addressed you again, crossing her legs and placing her hands on her knees,<br>\r\n\"You could be alone, for example. Think of what would have happened if Snivy hadn't found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as told: if Snivy never popped out of that Pokeball, Bianca would probably have never found you, and you would be stuck on your own, to fend for yourself against pretty much anything; now, you had a partner, a companion who was willing to keep an eye on the two of you, and Professor Juniper who was conveniently working to find a way to restore your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You do have a point.\" you conceded, looking back at Rosa, who smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd see it my way.\" she said, before drawing her bag closer to her,<br>\r\n\"Now, who's hungry? I didn't pack much food, as I thought we'd be in Town by now, but hey, at that size, pretty much anything can be a whole meal to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of food, the apparently hungry Tepig skipped towards his trainer and waited for her to pull out dinner, tail wagging in anticipation as he cried his name over and over, asking for his belly to be filled; Snivy rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess we can put that into the 'being tiny pros list'.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa too giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was fairly quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating, you had a chance to look around, discovering that what Rosa had said before was true: the only thing occupying most of the space was Rosa herself; you and the two relatively small Pokemon didn't take much room, either, so that left enough space for the four of you to sleep comfortably in one place, though the thought was still somewhat embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Snivy let out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tired, girl?\" you asked, figuring that after the two battles she had with Tepig, she must have been exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni.</span>\" she answered, before looking in Rosa's direction warily; then, without warning, Snivy gripped you and removed you from her head, placing you onto the floor before coiling her entire body around you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni-vy.</span>\" she spoke to Rosa, warning her of consequences if the trainer happened to even try to touch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" you said to Rosa, looking around: green walls surrounded you, making it impossible to escape unless you climbed Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" she said,<br>\r\n\"Your Snivy seems to like you a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much.\" you replied, before pointing out,<br>\r\n\"Tepig too seems to think highly of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention, Tepig jumped onto his trainer's lap with a happy cry of his name, the got comfortable and laid down much like a Lillipup would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'aw...\" Rosa cooed, beginning to pet the fire-type, who closed his eyes in relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, both he and your Snivy fell asleep, one on Rosa's lap and the other coiled around you, acting as a fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit unsure what to do, you decided to catch some sleep well and sat with your back against Snivy's body, by her scaly stomach, judging from the sounds that came from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... 'night, then.\" you said to Rosa, closing your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess just smiled, finding the scene adorable. </span></div></div>",

The events of the day were flying through your mind over and over, keeping you from reaching dreamland. Meeting the mythical pokemon Mew, then Mew shrinking you for its idea of a game. Meeting your new partner and going on an adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Snivy, she may be protective of you, but that's only a good thing in this situation, where nearly everything is a risk to your life, you only wished she wouldn't be so against Rosa as well. As you were thinking this, you felt two pillars of flesh surround you, and instinctively started struggling. After a second or so, you realized why you shouldn't really be struggling because the only person in the tent with you was Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let yourself calm down and the fingers eventually deposit you on an open hand. Rosa then calls you with her X-Transceiver to overcome the sound barrier between the two of you. You pick up and say, \"Hey Rosa, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa responded. \"Nothing much, just wanted to talk without Snivy constantly glaring at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, by the way. Snivy means well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's no problem. It's pretty much a good thing you have such a protective partner to watch over you at your size. I've heard stories about starter pokemon being really disobedient to trainers, and at your size, a bad starter could've resulted in you being eaten before Bianca ever found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Yeah, I'm really grateful Snivy is how she is. I just wish she could tone it down around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa laughed unintentionally, so she couldn't keep the volume down. Snivy and Tepig immediately woke up, which lead to Snivy realizing you were missing. Snivy looked around frantically, before spotting you on Rosa's hand. Her vines shot out at you at light speed and grabbed you from your perch and pulled you back into the scaly body of Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"He's mine! He's my trainer! Leave him alone!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you and Rosa heard, however, was, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Snivy Sni! Snivy Snivy Vy! Snivy!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy resumed the same position as before, but this time made sure to keep her arms around you and her vines covering the gap above you. It seems Snivy is really pulling out all the stops for this one, and not even Rosa could sneak you out of there undetected. Thankfully, your X-Transceiver was still in your hands, so you hear Rosa say, \"Good Night\", before hearing the call cut out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that talk with Rosa, your mind is cleared a lot more, so you're able to sleep soundly almost instantly.

However, it wasn't what you were expecting as your surroundings are quickly changing. Once that's over, you soon found yourself in a brand-new location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a grassy field, you are standing on a rocky mountain path that is incredibly hot; you are even sweating right now. You soon realized that Mew must've teleported you here, but why? From the looks of it, this appears to be on a large mountain with a steam air around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew, why did you bring me here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"In order to experience an amazing moment of your life.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused at what she meant by that as you highly doubt you will even experience anything good in the middle of a large volcano. With nothing left to do, you decided to go down and try to find some way to get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you travelled down, you began to notice something familiar about this place. While you never visited here before, you did read a book about a large volcano a long time ago. This volcano is known as Mt Chimney and is very tall; about 5000 feet tall to be exact! Kinda think of it, you did see the vast landscape of Hoenn at last. You immediately discovered that this IS Mt Chimney and because of it's great size, you can see nearly everything around the region. Honestly if you were at your original size, you would love to sit here and just take a look at sights from the mountain; you can even see your hometown of Petalburg City from up here. Is this what Mew wanted you to experience? You guess that must be the case, but it didn't really make any sense on why she shrank you for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sightseeing for a while, you go back to your journey downwards. You couldn't stand here any longer due to the heat and going lower will make everything less hot for you to survive. You travel across the rocky terrain that makes up the mountainous route and realized that the more you travel down, the less warmer it gets. However, you suddenly felt something hot nearby and it almost feels like warm liquid coming from below. You slowly walk to the cliff and look down. You see a small lake that looks like a hot spring, but there's something there that really surprised you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting on the hot springs is a girl but it's not just any girl, it's someone you think you recognized. She has long red hair that is tied in a ponytail, making it look spiky. The only thing she's wearing is a black bikini. Yep, this is none other than Flannery, the fire gym leader of Lavaridge Town. The reason you know her is because you once saw a battle between her and a trainer on TV once and ever since you saw her, you thought she was very hot like the fire Pokemon she uses, but in a good way. You also really wanted to see and get closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally realized what Mew meant by getting an amazing moment. The reason she shrank you and got you here was so you could get close to Flannery in secret. You could just take advantage of this new size and go see her up close without her even knowing your existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her and was about to go down until you see a beach towel right next to the springs. It looks like she might be going to there to dry herself and relax under the sun. You thought of waiting for her to do so and go exploring across her body. Next to the towel, you can see a bag that may belong to her and began to think about going inside to explore around her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How could you let this happen! You feel like a bit of an idiot, knowing how you didn\u2019t take this as serious as you really should. Mew was a legendary, not only that but one of the most powerful ones. You know you thought it was just a cute playful Pokemon, but in retrospect that was stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you paid the price, you were what... two inches tall at the moment. Maybe even less than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the ocean in front of you, you try to think about what you can do. The Mew flew that way, so no way you were gonna cross it. Although you do have a water Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a Pokemon Trainer, with Pokemon. Here in the Hoenn Region, you started your journey a while ago. Now with six badges and ready for your seventh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence is why you were at Mossdeep City. Ready to challenge the psychic twins Tate and Liza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon, were even brought around to counter them. You only had two on you, as the rest were in your PC. A female Banette as well as a Male Crawdaunt. Both use to punish their types when you challenge them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that is pretty much not the plan at the moment. Then again, that was not the worst thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose two, they were psychics right? Maybe they can use their powers to help you! Granted, that was quite a leap but it was better than the alternative. Your Crawdaunt is not a fast Pokemon, at all. So chasing Mew was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Banette was fast, and could levitate. Let\u2019s just say though... you would much rather be a bigger size than deal with that mischievous Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... the twins seem to be your best option. Looking back into the city from the shore, you swallow and you then move in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took, a real long while for you to actually get to the gym. You were so small, and everyone risked stepping on you. So it was understandable why you were having trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t matter though, as you were by yourself right now at the front of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you get in there? The doors were giant and much too big for you to actually make your way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to figure out a way, even pushing your way into the door. You were far too weak though, so that was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... better then nothing.\u201d You say as you reach for your Pokeball. \u201cCrawdaunt, come on out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, your Pokeball shrunk with you, but not the Pokemon. You crab was giant! Towering over you like a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraw?\u201d it said, looking it\u2019s way around. Needless to say, it was expecting a battle, not to be outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Crawdaunt down here!\u201d You shout up to him for a long while.  He listened, and looked down. His giant face close to you, as he was shocked about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraw!!!\u201d He said as he brought his claw down. Your eyes wide open as you jump back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah! Don\u2019t pick me up!\u201d You say to your giant Pokemon as thankfully he listened. \u201cGreat, look I need you to open this door. Please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon, like most (Not Banette) is loyal, so he listens. Waddling his way over and... breaking the door with one Crab Hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay, I guess that works. Um... come back before you get found and blamed.\u201d You say to the Pokemon as you return him. Although you were weak and powerless, at least you have your two strong Pokemon. Granted you were pretty sure you weren\u2019t going to bring out Banette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery since you got her as a Shuppet across on the mainland, she has been trouble. Pranks, Scares and Mischief was her game. When she evolved into Banette, she even found a way to get into more mischief. A variant of Curse was her favourite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much, she links your body\u2019s feeling to hers, as she then starts to either hurt herself, to hurt you, or tickle herself to tickle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, she turned the ticklish option into the worse of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, as you move over towards the door, that was now opened. You walk among the shattered glass, getting in as you look around. Now where were you going to go? You have never been to this place before, so you might as well guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a hallway not so far away, so you logically take it. Taking long steps as you move forward and in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway was big, but empty which left you confused. Guess there was not much people in this Gym. You have no idea why, but since it lowered your chance of actually getting stepped on, you were not going to question it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you just kept moving as you arrived at something that interested you. A giant door to the side, with the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Twins Room\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, this was where you were going to find them. You could hear shifting inside, so at least one of them had to be in. How are you going to get in their this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Crawdaunt can break his way in and... oh no, wait. The door was slightly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that made things much simpler, so you simply move your way. Getting right between the door and the wall as you step in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two shared the same room, and apparently it wasn\u2019t split into two. In fact it seemed to be shared, as their beds were right next to each other in the middle of the room. A large desk on one side, a closet as well as drawers on the other side. The room didn\u2019t look like it was catered to a boy or a girl, or either. It just seemed like an average room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the room wasn\u2019t the thing you were interested in. Instead it was the giant twins that you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked and saw that ______________</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked and saw it was one of the two twin gym leaders! The girl one, Liza you think her name is. You could not be happier about how this turned out, you need to go and get her attention right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was meditating on the ground right now, her legs crossed her and her feet bare. You need to get her attention simple as that. You don\u2019t know much about psychics, but you know they have powers. Powers that might be able to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all it was a psychic Pokemon that shrunk you, maybe  a psychic person can help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get real closed to the giant sitting girl, looking how intimidating she was. Not only that, but a bit pretty. For her age at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be deep in thought, so you were wondering how you were going to get her attention. You don\u2019t want to shock her, you want her to remain calm and not to jump to conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for a bit, you found how you are gonna get this giant girls attention. You move around, getting real close to her foot as you feel it for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you push, rubbing it as you try to make sure she feels it. You push as hard as you can, really putting your back into it. All in front of you was her giant clean sole, which could probably easily step on you. So it was a good thing you were getting her attention now, rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Liza, she was awaken out of her meditation, feeling something against her foot. While she was focusing er power, she still noticed it. Which was good, as she looked down at her sole, seeing you! Not seeing you as a doll, or a small Pokemon, but as a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyebrows lifted looking at you, a little bit shocked about it but not enough to actually throw her off. How did this happen? Why is a small boy rubbing her feet? You looked older than her, and if she looks hard she can see two small Pokeball\u2019s on your belt. Pausing for a couple of seconds she looks at you as she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... can I help you?\u201d You jump and jerk at her sudden talks, almost tripping back. Something she found adorable, and was the reason why Liza wore a smile on her face as you look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, you found me. Wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought.\u201d You say with a smile, as this could not be better. You move around as she still had her legs crossed, going before her as you tidy yourself up. You look up to her towering form as you begin to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, hi... Liza! Big fan first off. I\u2019m a Pokemon trainer, who is actually here to challenge you and your brother funnily enough.\u201d You say to her as she listened. Still it was intimidating in front of her. \u201cAnyway...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, go on.\u201d She said giving you motivation to keep on talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was planning on facing you and your brother, and then I went to sleep. Then a Mew showed up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Mew?\u201d She questioned, surprised at that bit. \u201cIs that why you are small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I played around with the Mew... and it shrunk me. My own fault really. So, the Mew wanted me to chase it, but considering that... I can\u2019t this size. I came to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she has pieced it together. That\u2019s why you were here, because you thought that Liza with her psychic powers could help. Sadly, she could not. Moving her hand to her back she looked sheepishly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I know why you are here then and i\u2019ve never have grown something with my powers, not even affect something\u2019s size. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d You say in a deadpanned expression. \u201cGuess I should of expected it. It was a long shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your name by the way?\u201d She questioned down to you as you realise you haven\u2019t told her yet. You reply and she smiles. Moving her giant body around. She wasn\u2019t aware of the effect this was going to have on you. Moving her giant body and laying down on her stomach, bringing her face closer to you as she rests her two knuckles under her chin. Her feet kicking around as she smiles at you. \u201cNice name, so... if I were going to guess, Mew would be the only way you could grow big. I doubt any other psychic Pokemon could overpower Mew\u2019s.\u201d She said logically. \u201cAlthough if you find a Pokemon that knows Growth, and they somehow use it on you. You could have Mew\u2019s shrink on you, but you could use the growth as well to counter it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide. \u201cL-Liza you are a genius!\u201d You say happy. That could be a good strategy you could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough that is also farfetched. Growth is an internal move, and it doesn\u2019t use the way it\u2019s described. It can\u2019t just magically Dynamax. So I guess Mew is still your bet.\u201d She said looking over. Only now realising she just kind of stepped on your dreams. \u201cOh uh... sorry. Think about it like this way, there is a lot more fun things to do with your size than normal! You could eat food so much bigger than you, a bottle of water would last you a day. Um... you can have a giant king\u2019s size bed regardless of what you are actually on. You never have to wait in lines, you could move through under the feet. Am I helping?\u201d The caring girl questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little. Well, thanks for hearing me out Liza. Guess, I got to go find Mew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy yourself?\u201d She questioned as you turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I got strong Pokemon, they were probably going to beat you and your brother if i\u2019m being honest. Anyway, goodbye Liza!\u201d You say waving. Is this the end?</span></div></div>",

Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza placed her hands behind her back and adopted a solemn expression that you best described as adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, trainer, it would be very dangerous for someone your size to challenge the world by yourself.\" Liza explained, <br>\r\n\"I think it would be very unwise of you to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did have a point, you guessed, but that didn't change the fact that you needed to find Mew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" you said, before offering a smile,<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that but, y'know, I'm not on my own. I have my Pokemon with me. They're to thank if I even got in here... though now I guess it was a bit pointless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that!\" she chided, before realizing she had shouted and placing a hand over her mouth, blushing; then, timidly, she resumed,<br>\r\n\"Excuse me... but I still think you won't be completely safe. Even if you did find Mew, I doubt you could defeat it in battle since it's one of the mightiest legendaries... and it's also sooo cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liza adopted dreamy eyes while thinking of Mew, you pondered her words and discovered that they made perfect sense: your Pokemon may have been strong enough to take on Liza and Tate and maybe win, but were they strong enough to take on a legendary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't mention that.\" you pointed out,<br>\r\n\"She told me to go find her, not fight her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza finally stopped daydreaming about finding a Mew herself and finally turned back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a gir... wait. Hehehe, sorry,\" the young giantess giggled, realizing she had lost the main track of her thoughts; she focused back on you and once more adopted a serious expression,<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's like you say, trainer, but there's still no telling if Mew is going to give you back your size even if you manage to find her.\" Liza pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her for a few seconds, wondering just what she was trying to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a shrug, you said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. But what other choice do I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, you could always...\" she mumbled the last part so lowly that not even you could hear her, not that there was anybody else to listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza's face flushed bright red once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...\" she said, closing her eyes,<br>\r\n\"That maybe you could stay... with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell between you and the giantess; you kept your gaze glued to her while she once again looked away, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why?\" you asked,<br>\r\n\"Why would you want me to stay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Liza finally turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, I wish to, um, assist you,\" she kindly replied, bending to place her hand palm-up in front of you; getting the hint, you climbed on as she rose up, lifting her palm as well.<br>\r\n\"You know, I can't help you with your size, at least for now, but I can take care of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza was sure she had concealed it well, but she was actually thrilled by the idea of taking care of a small person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... that's very kind of you, but... you're a gym leader, no?\" you pointed out. She nodded,<br>\r\n\"If I stayed, I'd be stuck in this city, and I need to find Mew. I don't think you would be able to leave this gym, and therefore I wouldn't be able to go and seek for Mew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza bit her lip - you had a solid point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... We'll think of something,\" she replied after a long hesitation. Then, she shot a smile that was intended to be reassuring,<br>\r\n\"I could always try to make my Pokemon to learn some Psychic move that might help you grow... or I could even learn it myself... or maybe Tate's psychic powers and mine could be strong enough to actually grow you. I'm sure we'll come up with something, eventually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Liza fell silent and you fell into thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer you were given was admittedly pretty good and surely the best you had since it was also the sole one; on one hand, the gym leader was right, staying would be much safer than just traveling aimlessly until you found Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you had Pokemon, and were fairly sure that, with them, your chances of survival were as good as anyone's... as long as your Banette didn't come up with something mischievous that implied with your new size... yeah, you guessed Banette was was going to sit in her Pokeball for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you focused back on Liza's offer and pondered it for a few more minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you made your choice, then?\" the giantess spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at her.</span></div></div>",

I have more pressing things to worry about at the moment.\u201d You say to her, finding your rules. \u201cSo... let me just figure this out, get my height back and we can do it later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d She said stomping her foot down once again, getting you to panic. \u201cWe are having one right now, it\u2019s the Gym Leader rule. once you enter a Gym, you can\u2019t lose until the battle is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a real rule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is, trust me i\u2019m a Gym Leader.\u201d She said with a smile down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to do this, but it was not like you were gonna convince this giant girl otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, fine whatever. My Pokemon won\u2019t hear my commands and I won\u2019t be able to see the battle at all, but no it\u2019s fine. Just carry me over to the battlefield.\u201d You said not that enthusiastic about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, actually this will be just as good.\u201d She says to you, taking you over and placing you down in the middle. She placed you down into the middle of the room as you see her trying to move stuff under the bed creating more floor space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, isn\u2019t it a little...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were gonna say small weren\u2019t you?\u201d She questioned with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you want to ruin your room.

You were so confused about it, and you were not really sure how you were going to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no Pokemon!\u201d You say back to her as she just rolls her eyes around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t use mine either. It will be Gym Leader, versus Challenger!\u201d She said happily and with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, this is a once in a lifetime event, I never get to be bigger than my challenger! You are gonna be the most fun challenge!\u201d She said with a laugh and a giggle. You just look to the towering little girl, unsure of what she was truly doing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause I want to, and you can\u2019t escape until you go.\u201d She said as you realise the true danger you were in. If she was not going to let you go unless you do this, you can do nothing about it. You pause and look at her for a couple of seconds before accepting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fine. I\u2019ll do this but you got to let me leave afterwards! You have got to!\u201d You say to her as she smiled down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are just so cute,\u201d She said bringing her finger down to you and patting you on the nose. Her finger being big enough to push on your face. \u201cYep, don\u2019t worry you can leave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood be-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you beat me that is.\u201d She said as you look at the giant psychic twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t, i\u2019m gonna go around and keep you! I want to keep you, and make you mine. So that\u2019s on line. You win, you get the badge and you can leave, if you don\u2019t I get you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so left confused about this, cause it did not make any sense to you. You have no idea why she would do this, but the stakes have never been higher. Should you just say no, should you just reject her idea? Walk away. What\u2019s the worst she can do if you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the theory to the test, you get moving and prepare to leave. However her giant bare foot comes down onto you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, trying to escape are we. You got to play, or I might just step in the wrong place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Did you just threaten to kill me!\u201d You panic at her, as she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA threat is nothing wrong, plus I doubt I would actually kill you. Anyway, so you are playing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess since I don\u2019t have a choice!\u201d You shout to her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily Liza stepped over you as she closed the door. Despite her interest changing 18 degrees, she was still talking the same way before. Does she not see what she is doing to you, She is forcing you into a game you don\u2019t want to play with vicious threats and if you lose, you are hers forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so the game is simple.\u201d Liza said standing opposite of you. Just seeing her so big, it was pretty clear the advantage she had over this. Hopefully she picks something you can actually win. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a battle, you against me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, clearly this girl is too smart for that. Did she just say you against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiza, there is no way I can actually win that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, I know that\u2019s the beauty of it and... the match will officially commence!\u201d She shouted and just like that, it was on. The match was afoot and it was time to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes wide open, as you brain tries to attack you with things you can do, but what can you do!?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were left undisturbed, staring at the sky in the direction Mew took off for a long time, your mind processing what just happened: Mew, a supposedly sweet and playful Pokemon, had shrunk you down to size and left you in the middle of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't exactly correct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were currently by the lake shore of Lake Verity, where you had been napping until Mew showed up and did... this. So now, you were basically stuck in the wild, shrunk and alone; even if Twinleaf Town was near, you weren't even sure you could reach by night at this size, and that was assuming you didn't get lost in the forest of grass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization dawned on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were no longer a human being, but an insect barely bigger than a speck of dust on the Sinnoh region. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic began settling in as you felt your legs shaking, forcing you to sit down to think of a way out of this; okay, being this tiny would seem admittedly somewhat cool, but the perspective of what could happen to you while you were like this... scared you. A lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there for a long while, trying to calm the beating of your heart while also trying to calm yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be something you could do, you just had to keep calm; slowly, very slowly, your heart stopped rattling your chest and your breathing became steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you had to do was pretty clear: you had to find Mew. There was one major problem though: you had no idea where Mew went or if you could even get out by this patch of grass by the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaunted, you turned to face the same lake, trying to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as much as you tried to focus, you couldn't find a solution that didn't involve finding Mew, a task that was currently impossible since you had no Pokemon or help whatsoever right now; the only thing you had was your PokeKron, which you used to take a picture of the mischievous legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wondered if the pink Pokemon was happily waiting for you, to make your move maybe watching you from somewhere nearby, in a twisted game of hide and seek. Or perhaps she had already forgotten you moments after she took off, really leaving you to fend for yourself in a world of giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, fear rose in you, nearly causing you to hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get out of here. You had to find help. You had to avoid ending in the stomach of a Pokemon or on the bottom of someone's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began realizing the true danger of the situation you were in, you felt tempted to cower back down and cry; the world around you began looking much scarier all of a sudden, starting with the 'trees' around you that were starting to tower over you menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you sat down, hidden as well as you could in the grass, and didn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you tried to convince yourself that this was all a dream, just a dream, a dream you could get out of by simply waking up, a feeble illusion caused by your subconscious, a mirage... but, with how much you tried, you couldn't wake up, and you eventually had to accept that you were living in hard reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing that, you sank back into thought, but your brain was a maze, and you were stuck in the middle of it with the solution to this situation at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you managed to get a headache without having found a way to improve your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough, enough! You had to stop thinking and start moving, or else you were going to stay here forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got on your feet and, without thinking anymore, you began running. You at least had to get out of this patch of grass, then... you decided cross that bridge when you came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a while, but eventually managed to emerge from the forest of leafless trees; luckily, there were no Pokemon around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall victories, you guessed as you began pondering your next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, getting back to Twinleaf Town seemed the best thing to do right now, also because you really saw no other option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bitterly realized that, had you had a Pokemon, they'd help you out... and maybe you wouldn't even be in this mess to begin with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, knowing you didn't have the time for regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided: you had to get back to the town!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still reeling from what had just transpired, you couldn\u2019t believe how rotten your luck had become! Not too long ago, you earned your first gym badge with the help of your only partner. After that, you got to spend a few relaxing days in Rustboro city to celebrate your first win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne, Rustboro\u2019s gym leader, was even kind enough to let you attend a few of her advanced courses at the Pokemon school. The courses you attended were all about the Hoen region\u2019s gym leaders. Who they were, what types they used, and what cities they all lived in. She even briefly discussed the time of years all the gym leaders were always taking time off. With all of that extra information, you thought you could have planned out a pretty good journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of those good results and generosity were wasted because of your unfortunate encounter with a legendary Pokemon. And that wasn\u2019t something you ever thought would be considered unfortunate. Most people would kill for a chance to meet a legendary Pokemon, let alone get some pictures with one. Then again, they didn\u2019t know that meeting a legendary apparently ended with them being shrunk and challenged to find the same ultra rare Pokemon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out an angry huff of breath, trying to calm yourself down a bit. There was no use in being angry right now. Well, there was a good reason for your anger, but it was pointless to dwell on it. It wouldn\u2019t help you find Mew, and it could distract you so much that you wouldn\u2019t even notice any danger before it struck. You had to focus on what you should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit calmer now, you take some time to go over what you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now you were on the outskirts of Rustboro city, near the large lake that acted as a sort of gate to the city. You remember how cool the extensive walkway over the lake seemed when you first came to Rustboro; and that double battle that you managed to win with only your one partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of your partner, you recalled they told you they were going to stay by the shore of the lake while you slept. You briefly wondered if having your partner with you might have stopped this from happening. Maybe Mew wouldn\u2019t have been as eager to play with you if you had them with you. It\u2019s not like your partner could necessarily fight off Mew, but you assumed Mew wouldn\u2019t like being seen by any sort of group. She probably preferred individuals so she could do stuff like she did to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t remember anything else especially important about where you were. You had no reason to count how many people were around before you fell asleep. But, you guessed it was safe to say that there was no one too close by. Otherwise, they would have spotted Mew and scared her away. Of course, someone could have shown up by now without you knowing. The grass around you was so tall that it prevented you from seeing very far away. So being concerned about other people right now was pretty much irrelevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thing went for wild Pokemon. If one found you without your partner, you probably had no choice but to deal with it yourself. But there was even less of a chance for you to see a wild Pokemon before it found you. So neither of those things were something you had to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was decide between going to find your partner or going back to Rustboror. Both options had their pros, cons, and dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to Rustboro was probably immediately safer, but the long term danger was greater. You believed the city was slightly closer to you than the lake. That was good because you\u2019d be out in the wild less and less likely to run into a wild Pokemon. You were also more generally visible in a city than tucked away in grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was that you had no idea who you should go to for help there. The only person that came to mind was Roxanne, who had been exceptionally nice to you. She probably would be a big help, but the problem was getting to her. The only places you knew she could be were her gym and the school, which were both far inside the city. Getting to either of them would mean having to get past a lot of people and who knows what else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich led you to your other option of going to the lake and finding your partner. You knew that you could one hundred percent trust your partner to help you, and they were a lot closer than the gym and school! Yet\u2026 that meant you had to be out in the wild for longer. The chances of running into a wild Pokemon was a lot higher and the limited vision was very worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try to find a trainer wandering around nearby. Their presence would probably scare away or at least distract any wild Pokemon. But they could also miss you completely and crush you by accident. Then again, avoiding being crushed by one person would be a lot easier than avoiding an entire city full of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tough decision, but you had to choose quickly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though you had spent a long time sorting out your options and going over how difficult of a decision this would be, you made your choice pretty quickly. The moment you thought about making a decision, only one of your options seemed to be the right one. Finding your Pokemon partner just felt like the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I didn\u2019t have to waste time thinking things over.\u201d You manage to laugh, in spite of your grim situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking in a direction before stopping dead in your tracks. You had to make sure that you were actually heading towards the lake. The \u201ctall\u201d grass was still cutting off most of your view, so you couldn\u2019t really see for yourself. There wasn\u2019t an easy way to figure that out, so you just had to try something to improve your chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought you come up with an idea. You quickly wet your finger and try holding it up high in the air, hoping you could feel the direction of the wind. Just as quickly as you brought it up, you brought your finger down and shook it dry. Figuring out what direction the wind was blowing was pointless. The two things didn\u2019t have any correlation and wouldn\u2019t help you find the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could try to smell for it? Like the ocean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the lake didn\u2019t really have a distinct smell. You were just desperate for a way to guarantee that you would go to the lake. But, you didn\u2019t have a way to make sure so you just had to take a chance. So with a sigh you start heading, you assumed, south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, once I get to her, everything will be fine.\u201d You tried to assure yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging on to whatever confidence you could muster, you kept moving forward. Even though you were doing your best to stay calm, you were constantly on edge. The grass around you encumbered your vision a lot more than you were comfortable with. Every time you moved to push aside more grass, it felt like your heart stopped. At any moment you could part the grass and come face to face with a wild Pokemon, which could easily be the end of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that a Pokemon could always wander up and find you, but you weren\u2019t as worried about that. If that could happen, you\u2019d probably hear it rustling the grass before you found it\u2026 or it found you. At least then you\u2019d have some way to avoid it or at least be prepared to face a giant Pokemon. Even if ending up in the gullet of a Tailow or some other Pokemon was inevitable, you would prefer for it to not be a sudden surprise.Of course you could also get poisoned to death or paralyzed by a giant Shroomish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t a fan of the grim thoughts you were having, but they were the only things that popped into your head right now. At any moment something you didn\u2019t notice could pop out and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParting another tuft of grass, you instinctively scream when you see something unfamiliar. Your scream quickly dies out though, since what you saw was actually good. You had found the lake! And what\u2019s more, you could see your partner too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, I knew I\u2019d be fine the whole time.\u201d You lie to yourself. \u201cNothing can catch me by surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are immediately proven wrong as a Zigzagoon comes zooming out of some of the tall grass nearby, causing you to scream and fall. Thankfully the creature hadn\u2019t noticed you and simply ran off somewhere, but you still felt the sting of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh. ...I just gotta get Mawile\u2019s attention and then I won\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u201d You mumble, scratching at your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never been so happy to see Mawile before. Even though she was still far away from you, just seeing her made everything feel alright. She was your faithful partner, and you had known her for awhile before you two even started the gym challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two didn\u2019t have some sappy story about how she hatched from an egg that you raised since you were a kid. In fact, you two started out on less than stellar standings. She was a Pokemon with a bit of a reputation around your hometown. A feisty Mawile with a little scar on her left ear who was way too eager to fight. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for the people working outside to find KOed Pokemon because of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just as willing to mess with humans as she was wild Pokemon. She stole stuff from the local market a lot and would sometimes go around town checking to see if people\u2019s homes were locked. They always were, but everyone guessed that Mawile probably would have stolen from any place that wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople from outside of town were some of the most frequent victims. It became a monthly bet for the whole town: how many travelers would show up without their backpack or luggage because of her? She was a regular old trouble maker, but she was also good enough to become your partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happened to be a frequent victim of hers. She never really harmed a human, at least not too much, but she was still able to take stuff from you a lot. Mostly food, which you never felt too bad about losing. But sometimes she\u2019d take something a bit more important like a coat or an umbrella, that kind of bothered you. But she was so intimidating you just couldn\u2019t stop yourself from giving her what she wanted. You heard that some Pokemon had that sort of ability \u201cIntimidate\u201d or something like that. Mawile\u2019s ability must\u2019ve been \u201cIntimidate EX\u201d you used to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day though, all of that caught up to her. She must have stolen one to many backpacks or something, because a bunch of Pokemon hunters showed up at your home town. Well\u2026 hunters sounds worse than what they were. They were just a special division of Pokemon rangers who dealt with troublesome Pokemon. You always thought they were meant for natural disasters, not a local bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, the rangers ended up making short work of her. A few days after they showed up, Mawile was in town under ranger supervision. The first time they got her, they put her in a big cage so they could report back to their headquarters. But she ended up escaping by pulling some of the bars apart; the cage was meant for much bigger Pokemon after all. But they snatched her again real quick, put her in handcuffs; which looked strangely hilarious; and kept her under supervision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of days later, everyone in town was told that Mawile was going to be shipped away. She had caused enough trouble in the area and was going to be relocated somewhere more open with a lower population count. She would only be kept in town one more day for a checkup at the Pokemon Center, which was open for people to watch for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, you felt compelled to go and see Mawile off for the last time. She had never been that bad, so you sort of liked her... in a vitriolic way. You watched her whole check up, done by the rangers\u2019 own doctor instead of the local nurse. You were surprised when she actually behaved the whole time. But you realized quickly that it was because she seemed depressed. Her usual fire was replaced by bored submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason that hit you hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really sure what you were thinking, you ended up talking to the Pokemon rangers that night. You discussed the possibility of you\u2026 becoming Mawile\u2019s trainer. They were blunt and asked why you would want that. You simply said that you felt attached to her. The rangers laughed, but agreed to let you ask if she\u2019d be your partner. They also made you sign a waiver, saying that you would be responsible for Mawile\u2019s misbehavior from now on. It might\u2019ve been meant to scare you away, but it didn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all ended up working out. Mawile became a real, genuinely great partner. She caused minor amounts of trouble at first, and you two always butted heads, but you and her ended up enjoying each other\u2019s company. She\u2019s dropped her overall aggression and no longer openly steals things. You could still remember how she reacted when you asked her to be your partner. She was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cM-Mawile?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, you were woken from your dream-like reminiscing state. Towering in front of you was the partner who\u2019s past you had been happily thinking about. She looked down at you with an almost unreadable expression, though you could see a bit of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you were a bit confused as well. Had you really already made your way over to Mawile.Last time you looked the walk out in the open should have taken you a while. But, apparently, you did the whole thing while fondly thinking about the past!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey Mawile.\u201d You call up to her awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s me\u2026 your partner. Ahaha, I sort of just wandered up to you like this without realizing.\u201d You spoke, unsure what to say right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile\u2019s mouth closed and opened again, still processing what she was looking at. Without saying anything, she gently grabbed you in one of her hands and raised you off the ground. She continued to stare at you silently, struggling to make any progress in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two stare at each other for a while, you slowly begin to recognize a change in her expression. Soon, you were able to figure out what exactly Mawile was feeling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did you change something while you were gone?\u201d</span></u> Mawile asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are totally enjoying this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d You ask Mawile with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile shook her free hand slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little huh?\u201d You say skeptically. \u201cThen why are you trying not to laugh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMawile?\u201d</span> The giantess asked, a corner of her mouth clearly twitching upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t always understand what you\u2019re saying, but I can read your expressions. Just admit that you like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s not exactly something I\u2019ll complain about.\u201d</span></u> Mawile let her poorly hidden smile make itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it. I just hope you don\u2019t enjoy this too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI\u2019ll try not to look as pleased as I really am all the time.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing it would probably be better for you, Mawile let go of her grip around you and left you standing on her open palm. She chuckled at the sight, but it quickly became a resigned sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMaw\u2026 Mawile, wile?\u201d</span> Your partner seemed curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to know what happened to me? Well, I\u2019m glad to see some outward concern for once.\u201d You smile slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile gave you a serious look and used her free hand to flick you in the arm. You knew that she was trying to be gentle, but the hit still stung. But, all she was trying to do was tell you to be serious, so you couldn\u2019t be mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be serious. This might sound a little weird, but it's the truth and you\u2019ll have to believe me. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile nodded her head and uttered her name quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now, it didn\u2019t happen that long ago. I was minding my own business when\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t-\t\t-\t\t-\t\t-\t\t-\t\t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the last thing I did was come back here to get your attention.\u201d You concluded your explanation. You went over everything that happened before you met with Mawile. There wasn\u2019t that much to tell, but you did your best to remember everything because any of it could be important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile, for her part, remained quiet and serious the whole time. Though she sort of smiled when you told her you had taken selfies with the legendary Pok\u00e9mon. Other than that, she was completely attentive and you noticed her fingers occasionally curling closer to you. You wanted to assume that it was her naturally reacting protectively, but considering her you also could chalk it up to just a bit of nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you were finished, Mawile sighed wearily. <u><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cSo that pink puff ball did this to you? Why couldn\u2019t she have gotten someone other than Boss?\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Mawile thinking to herself and speak up. \u201cHey, Mawile!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Pokemon quickly turned to look at you again. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMawile?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to interrupt your thoughts, but I just wanted your attention on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile just gave you a confused look, her scarred ear drooping slightly. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWile?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t really have a reason I guess. I just feel like anything could happen to me. I\u2019m just paranoid that a Taillow or something will gobble me out of your hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile\u2019s fingers curled closer again but went back to normal almost instantly. Your partner looked at you warmly, a confident smile on her face. Muttering her name, she raised her other hand and clenched it into a fist. You recognized the message instantly. Mawile would beat the crap out of anyone who even tried to touch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, you scratch your cheek with a finger and laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 really good to hear Mawile, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile let her fist loosen and confidently leaned back. <u><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cDid you expect anything else from me?\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one thing\u2026\u201d You begin seriously, making Mawile look concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s make sure you don\u2019t beat up the people trying to help me.\u201d You smiled slyly at your giant partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMaw!\u201d</span> Mawile groaned and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were almost like normal between you two.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat there in absolute disbelief for a while, your mind trying to process what had just happened: a Mew, an extremely rare and powerful, not-for-nothing legendary Pokemon showed up and things led to this, to you being shrunken down while the legendary left you be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you even supposed to do now? You were completely powerless to stop anything that fate decided to throw your way! Heck, you couldn't even see past these blades of grass you were surrounded by!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd worst of all, you were alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up at the last thought, which you discarded as incorrect: you weren't exactly alone, you reminded yourself as a small wave of relief washed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered your two Pokemon come with you, and they just happened to hate being confined in their Pokeballs, which was why you kept them out all the time; they weren't around back when Mew showed up and shrunk you, but they must have been nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, without hesitation, you decided to go find them to get their attention and, possibly, help. You were sure they'd help you; after all, both were especially fond of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>They've got to be...</i>' you thought to yourself as you traveled through the forest of grass, trying to find a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on...\" you mumbled, pushing blade after blade out of the way so that you could pass, wondering where your partners were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, you would find them before the sun set; you had recently met and challenged Morty, the gym leader of Ecruteak Town; in a conversation with him after you won, he told you that ghost-type Pokemon had a tendency to show themselves around town at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that conversation, you tried to avoid move during nighttime. Unlike one of your Pokemon, but she could handle ghosts by herself without issue, you thought with sudden pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped back to reality - you had to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, as you pushed away a few more blades of grass, you noted that you had finally managed to get out of the patch of grass you were in. And not too far, much to your relief, were your loyal Pokemon, seemingly sleeping next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust seeing their figures took you back in time: finding an Eevee was somewhat rare, but finding two at the same time proved that you were particularly... well, maybe more than you had been now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had captured them both, making them your partners in battle, and you always did your best to treat them as well as you could; in return, they did their best in battle and never complained about how they were treated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the time, they both became very attached to you; so much in fact that one of them eventually evolved into an Espeon one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only Eevee you had left was pretty envious, but you comforted her, telling that she would evolve at some point as well, though, when you said that, you never expected it to happen that same night, when your other Eevee evolved into Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evolution of your two Eevee made you feel joyous. Not because they grew stronger, faster and tougher, but because Eevee only evolved into Espeon or Umbreon when they were extremely happy, and that proved that your two former Eevee truly loved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a somewhat nostalgic sigh, before shaking your head to rid it of such thoughts: this was no time to lose yourself in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began moving again and hastily made your way to Umbreon, who was napping with her head in her paws and her tail hanging. She liked sleeping during the day, but became very active during the dark hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder, given her type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also became very serious ever since she evolved, though she still cared deeply about you, and that was why you chose to head to her; Espeon, despite caring for you as well, was much more playful than her dark-type counterpart was when it came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving swiftly, you positioned yourself right in front of Umbreon's muzzle, feeling her warm breath blowing from her nostrils and into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umbreon! Wake up!\" you called, getting no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried several more times, until you eventually saw her ears twitching and Umbreon herself rising her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-furred giantess turned to the side to let out a deep yawn, before pointing her red eyes in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Umbreon became alert as she saw you standing before her at two inches or less tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">U-Umb?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Umbreon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Um, umbreon!?</span>\" she exclaimed in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, easily figuring out what she was asking, and began explaining; when you finished telling her about your encounter with Mew, Umbreon turned to the still sleeping Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">Espy, wake up!</span></u>\" she called, getting no reply, which triggered Umbreon to drive her hind left leg into the psychic-type's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't surprised, the two of them always had some kind of rivalry, especially since they evolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">Ow!</span></u>\" Espeon yelled as she rose, fully awake, shooting Umbreon a glare,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">What's the big idea!?</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Umbreon pointed her paw to you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Um.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Umbreon's paw, Espeon gazed down and spotted you, adopting the same look of confusion and shock the dark-type had when she first discovered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Esp, espeon!?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you sighed and once more you began telling about your encounter with Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of your tale, Espeon looked at you skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">Seriously? Are you sure you didn't just hit your head when you laid down?</span></u>\" she said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">How do you explain his size then?</span></u>\" Umbreon chimed in, leading Espeon to sigh,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">I can't.</span></u>\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon smirked briefly, before returning serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">Well, we certainly can't leave him like that.</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">And here I though <i>I</i> was the psychic.</span></u>\" Espeon sneered, causing Umbreon to sigh,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">Espy, this is serious! We've got to do something!</span></u>\" she chided.<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">What are we supposed to do?</span></u>\" the psychic-type retorted, before looking down in disappointment,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">I'm... I'm not even sure I could grow him again: my Psychic is no match against Mew's...</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led Umbreon to look down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, while the two behemoths chatted among themselves, you watched them saying their own names over and over while trying to think of something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could you even do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't figure anything out, but you certainly couldn't stay here forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling observed, you suddenly looked up: Espeon and Umbreon were staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if, perhaps, the two had thought of something. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In retrospect, maybe you should of done something instead of just watching the legendary fly away. You wanted to respect it, since it was being friendly and playful. You\u2019ve heard tales of Mew, and to be honest... you could of taken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your first move was to whip out your Pokeball and challenge her, you could of beaten and then captured Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were after all, one of the best trainers in the world. You\u2019ve travelled the land with your Pokemon. All of them being top level defeating Gym Leaders and Elite Fours everywhere you went. You have travelled to every region, and your Pokemon reflected on that strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now you were in Kalos, trying to catch a Flabebe. You\u2019ve heard of their sizes, and you were interested in. Guess you were about that size right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went into a sitting position, looking at the new world. You really should of tried catching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... maybe you still can. Your Flygon, it\u2019s a fast Pokemon! Of course it should be able to catch up to Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile you found that your Pokeball shrunk with you, so you unlatch it from your belt and you begin to toss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlygon, come on out!\u201d You shout to your Pokemon. However, another problem rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon shrunk too!\u201d Flygon was a big Pokemon, but now it was nothing but an insect compared to everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlygon looked around for a couple of seconds, as it was confused and you felt bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlygon, I... return!\u201d You say panicking. How strong would your Pokemon be now. It\u2019s like they all have been reversed Dynamaxed. This is not good, and you imagine it will be the same with all your Pokemon!<br>\r\n\u2028Your Dusknoir, your Tyranitar, Your Nidoqueen. Every Pokemon of yours would be so weak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo chasing Mew it out of the option, as she has crippled your team. Might as well go over and try to get back to town. Will not be that hard, considering you didn\u2019t go out too far. Not wanting to paralyse your Pokemon, you want to keep them i your Pokeball until you have to bring them out. Looking ahead though, you could see a Flabebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was taller then you, and it didn\u2019t even notice you. That is a major problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the tall grass, walking over to the dirt path as it seemed to stretch on for years. How small can you really be! You were not happy about this, but there was nothing you could really do anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust walk down the path, until you see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cSwirl!\u201d</span> A Pokemon said getting you to freeze. You turn your head, seeing a Swirlix near you, and even worse it was making it\u2019s way to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was such a little Pokemon, but the giant Kalos region Pokemon intimidated you more then it should. Not like you were gonna just let it come near. A bit concerned you brought out a Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-Electivire, go!\u201d You shout, sending your strongest electric type. As he landed onto the ground, he was shrunk and was looking at a giant ball of a Pokemon. Towering over him as he was intimidated. Electivire was never intimidated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn\u2019t help that the giant Swirlix had it\u2019s tongue out and was wagging it around a bit playfully. It is gonna try to eat your Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElectivire!\u201d You shout to him. \u201cIgnore the size difference, just use Thunder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened, sending a powerful lightning blast. One so powerful that normal size it could take down a Wailord in one hit, at this size though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck Swirlix, and it didn\u2019t care at all! This first evolution, which hasn\u2019t been trained is tanking Electivire\u2019s most powerful attack. This is not good. Your eyes wide open as you start to get concerned. The Swirlix moved forward, and you acted quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Return Electivire!\u201d You shout and return him to the Pokeball, just in time for the Pokemon to stomp it\u2019s foot down where your Pokemon would of been. Retreating your Pokemon as you look to the Pokemon with new fear. It was literally invincible, at least to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were big, you had company with Red and Cynthia, at this size though. You couldn\u2019t even beat a bug catcher! You had to run, running away from the Pokemon as you try to get away. You turned your head, seeing if you were gonna get any reaction from the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swirlix looked at you, and went along it\u2019s day. It wasn\u2019t even bothering with you, that\u2019s how insignificant you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you were taking it. Making your way across as you breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell are you gonna do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just kept walking down the street, just kept walking without much interest. You were small, and your Pokemon was useless. You just keep trying to talk to yourself, trying to convince that you were not truly useless. Maybe that Swirlix had an ability that helped it resist Electivire, or maybe it was a much higher level than you thought. Anything that can convince you that maybe it wasn\u2019t so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you walk around and try to get around, down the road. It was an empty road, with the lake on one side, and tall grass on the other. You would eventually see a Pokemon, but you made sure not to dwell on that and even increase your speed to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t want to get another encounter like that Swirlix. That Swirlix... it was so weak. Any other way, you would of beaten it but not hear. Worst thing is, you don\u2019t even know what a Human would look like, and how they would treat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so small, if they wanted they could kidnap you. Not like your Pokemon will be able to save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sad notion to think about. Eventually you walked down the road some more until _______________</span></div></div>",

You were so close to the city, you ignored what was happening behind you and just kept on walking. This turned out to be a major problem, cause something was behind you. At least it wasn\u2019t a Pokemon you suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk forward, the booms keep getting louder and louder until finally you saw a giant shoe slam to your side. You freaked out and jumped, falling to the side as you could not believe it. That shoe was matched with another one on the other side, stepping down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh...\u201d A voice said, as you turn your body. It was... a young schoolgirl! Brown skin, brown hair and a a giant body that scared you. You looked up to her, barely being able to look up at her. You even look under her skirt, even if you did not mean to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so big, and she was looking down. \u201cA little guy?\u201d She questioned as you nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes I am... little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhEaring your voice, she giggled finding it a bit funny. \u201cI\u2019m not little, you\u2019re little! Wait... have I seen you before.\u201d She said as turned her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever met her, so you were not going to answer. It would seem that she actually knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second, I do! I\u2019ve seen you on TV!\u201d She said happily. She moved her hand around and reached down for you. You back up but all she did was put her finger on your head. \u201cAlthough you were not so big, were you?\u201d She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was bigger! A Pokemon shrunk me.\u201d You say putting her finger off your head. She laughed and giggled about it, her eyes on you as you go walking away. She had her eye down onto you, when suddenly she smiled. Standing tall, she moved her foot around and blocked your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer giant shoe almost stomping you as you look up. She seemed so much more intimidating standing up like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wanna have a Pokemon battle!\u201d She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a trainer? Normally, you would wipe the floor with this kid, but you were not really sure you should do that. Not with your Pokemon in their weakened forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d You say to her about to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait a second.\u201d She said taking steps around and getting in front of you. She got in front making sure you were not going to be able to do anything as she was in front of you. You couldn\u2019t pass him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I wanna see how good I am against the best in the world!\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my Pokemon are pretty weak at the moment. Shrunken with me. We can do it later, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, scared?\u201d She said, a playful smile on her face as she looked down to you. She wore a smile as she brought her shoe forward and knocked you back. The School girl giving you quite the hit as you fell onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, face me.\u201d She said happily, kicking you around with her shoe. She did this a couple more times, toying with you and laughing above as you try to get away. She didn\u2019t let you though, as she toyed with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d You shout to her as she wore a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! This is gonna be fun!\u201d She taking a couple of steps back and getting away. You look to her for a couple of seconds, not really sure if you were gonna be okay with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, Fletchling!\u201d She said sending her Pokeball out. You saw a giant fire bird come down, towering over you like a Molstres as you look up to it. If this Pokemon wanted to, it could even swallow you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFletch?\u201d It said ready. It was a simple Pokemon, one that beginners would have. This is not good. If you lose to this thing, it\u2019s gonna be embarssing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElectivire! Come on out!\u201d You shout giving it out. Tossing it forward as it fell right down. Youe Electric type there, as it stared at the giant Bird, as well as the giant Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s Electivire! It looks so cute down there! I just wanna put it in a cage and make it run around there. Hehehe.\u201d She laughed as you swallowed your fear. Electivire thrown off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Whatever, let\u2019s go!\u201d you shout to her. You had the type advantage, a higher level. Maybe you can do this, against this intimidating, but weak bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school girl you were facing, wore a smile as she wanted some fun. \u201cHey, that idea before gives me an... idea. How about we make a bet!\u201d She said as you look at her, fear in your eyes. \u201cIf you win, I\u2019ll... I don\u2019t know carry you to that town you were walking to. If I win though, you gotta be my pet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What! No!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you are one of the best in the world, no way you can lose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d You shout, not getting goated into this one. She looked at you for a couple of seconds, until finally she just rolled her eyes about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, you are taking it anyway. Whether you like it or not!\u201d She said as she wore a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, ready for battle!\u201d She said getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to stick close to the battle, so you were in danger. Otherwise you won\u2019t be able to tell your Pokemon. You swallow your fear, as you look at her for a couple of seconds until you swallow your fear. \u201cElectivire! We got to win this! It\u2019s just a bird, a big one yes... but we can beat this Flying Type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElectivire!\u201d it said, hearing your words and getting excited about it. He was getting his courage back, and you suppose that was really good.</span></div></div>",
