Seeing that it was... a Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s face, right in front of yours and blinking a couple of times back at you. Several blinks over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly scurry back as you look at the Legendary that was in front of you. You can\u2019t believe it! It was Mew, the Pokemon Mew! The legendary Mew! It looked at you as you sat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you slept on the outskirts of town today, no bit of you thought that you would actually be found on a legendary. You just wanted some rest on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy... hello there Mew!\u201d You say excitedly and with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Mew loved. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew!!\u201d</span> She said as she flew over and around your head. Taking several laps as it giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? You woke me up.\u201d You say with a laugh as you can\u2019t really be mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t answer, instead it flew high into the air, and then down at you. Your eyes open as you see it ram into your chest. Just enough to send you down on your back. You look down and see it laying on your chest and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew! Mew!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight... i\u2019ve heard that you are playful. Guess you are.\u201d You say as it flew off, only for a second as it then went under your shirt. \u201cH-Hey! Mew cut that out!\u201d You say with a laugh as it flew out and laughed itself. \u201cYou really are playful, just messing with a human like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew.\u201d </span>It said simply as it flew down to you, over your head as you feel it\u2019s small feet on your head. Suddenly it kicked your hair around, making it wild as you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay go ahead.\u201d You say as it messed up your hair even more. So for a long time you were gonna have bed hair, just great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew eventually got off, flying right in front of you as it turned around. Turning around and pointing it\u2019s tail to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayfully, she wagged it in front of your face and tickled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, Mew! Hehehe! Mew seriously!\u201d You say as Mew laughs itself. It was probably laughing as much as you were. You know you could probably just hit the tail away, but clearly it was having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let it have fun until it pulled away. Looking to the sky. \u201cMan what time is it? I did take a long nap didn\u2019t I?\u201d You say as you pull out your Pokenav. Pulling it and looking at the time. Only for Mew to come back down and land on your lap. Sitting there in a very cute manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Mew, say cheese!\u201d You say as you get the camera and go in for a Selfie. \u201cOr uh... Say Mew I guess...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew!\u201d</span> it said back, as you took the photo. There you go, proof that you met Mew. You don\u2019t want to risk and try to capture it at the moment. You two were getting along and lets face it... Mew would be far too powerful for any trainer you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I guess I got to go Mew. It was-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cMew!\u201d</span> it said as it flew up high. High above you and looking at you. You could tell it had anticipation, and you were gonna deduct what it wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more? Sure... go ahead. One more.\u201d You say as she it laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew took it\u2019s time thinking about it, until finally it got what it wanted to do. Smiling it flew right in front of your face, and suddenly... it\u2019s eyes glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s using a move, you didn\u2019t expect it but you guess it was. You wait to see what was happening, when suddenly you realised something. Was... Mew flying up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was above your head line, far above it. It kept going up. You were really confused, and it grew even more as you could feel the grass under you... get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a long while, until you suddenly realise something. Looking at the tree closet to you, it was bigger than it should be. Looking back to Mew, she was far above you and the grass was bigger than it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMew, are you shrinking me!\u201d You say as it didn\u2019t give a reaction. Instead you just went down and down, until one grass blade was enough for your entire hand to rest on. You stand up, not making much of a difference as you were now shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew\u2019s eyes stopped glowing, as it flew down to you. Doing a loop and looking. When suddenly it giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mew, this isn\u2019t fun! I-\u201d You trailed off, as you see Mew get closer. It was like a Dynamax version of itself, much bigger and much more powerful. You fall onto your rear as it gets closer, it\u2019s nose almost knocking you at this point as you can\u2019t believe the size difference.<br>\r\n\u2028Finally it flew up into the air. Far into the air as you could see it turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mew. Where are you-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew started to fly away, not before looking back at you and saying something. Not what Pokemon say, not her name. But words, and more than that a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cCome find me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Mew flew into the air. You could only watch as the giant Pokemon flew far into the air. As far and high it could go, until the giant Pokemon was out of sight, and you were left... by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a giant new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so I left it blank for the people who want to add and customise the story their way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was unreal, and yet it somehow was: you had been woken up by a playful - and almost all powerful - legendary who had put you through a series of silly games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't mind at first, since there was no real harm in letting said legendary in have some fun with you for a bit while also entertaining you, but things had gone south when Mew's playfulness turned into mischief and she shrunk you down to a pathetically small stature. You were barely bigger than the paw of an Eevee at this size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, if that wasn't enough, the mysterious move Mew had used to shrink you had also managed to turn a simple patch of grass into a thick forest, leaving you lost in the middle of it, so close and yet so far from Olivine City, in Johto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, basically, you were screwed, no matter how you looked at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your legs trembling, you slowly sat down on the ground, pondering your next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you had to do was clear: you had to find Mew and get her to give you back your size. After all, she was the one telling you to find her, no? The only question now was, how could you find Mew, who took off in a random direction? It would be already much if you managed to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned to yourself, thinking that the pesky legend was probably laughing while thinking about you now. Did she think of this as some game? Because you weren't enjoying yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" you muttered, putting a hand over your head while looking down, trying to figure a way out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, there wasn't much you could do while like this, but you couldn't stay like this, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at the sky, noting that the sun was about to set. If you had to do something, you had to move before night fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other thoughts you had suddenly vanished as an idea sprang in your mind. You still had your PokeNav! You could dial someone and ask them to come to your aid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally thanking Mew for at least shrinking your belongings along with you, you picked out the tool that was going to save you and searched for someone to call, hoping that they would believe you and not just laugh at your situation or even call you crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually picked a number and the PokeNav began dialing, but the result was unsatisfying: voicemail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn...\" you mumbled as you quickly dialed someone else, getting the same result, the same result you got for about three other times before finally giving up in frustration and putting your PokeNav back in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. What now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely alone. You didn't even have a Pokemon that could help you out in this dire situation; you briefly wondered if they would have shrunken along with you if you happened to have pokeballs on you at the time it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there for about five more minutes, surrounded by grass and enveloped in quiet. Then, you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever happened next, you decided to cross that bridge when you came to it; right now, you had to at least get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, remembering which direction you came from, you began a run through the towering blades of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, it didn't take you that long to get out of the 'woods'; you were actually able to find your way out in about five minutes, which was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got out, found yourself by the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately turned to head for Olivine City, but a thought halted you before you could take your first step: Mew had gone in the exact opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, you should have tried to go after her... you shook your head. The pink legendary was probably long gone by now!... But what if she wasn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered the last and only words she said you before taking off, 'Come find me'. Perhaps, that last game she wanted to play was a more wicked version of hide and seek? Perhaps Mew was just hiding close by and you had to find her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she wasn't, then you were just going to waste precious time and possibly stumble into some Pokemon or person, and it could end badly either way: you could get eaten by the former, crushed underfoot by the latter if you weren't careful enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought alone made you shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there by the road for a long while, trying to decide whether you should go find Mew or go to the city and get someone to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, after a long hesitation, you made a choice and hoped you didn't end up regretting it.</span></div></div>",

No if you wanted to get your height back, you were going to have to rely on someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who... well you were about to know, cause you were moving into Olivine City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way over, hearing the beach move as you know you need to go. You couldn\u2019t see much from your perspective, except for the giant towering lighthouse you can see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get close, but you know... it will take forever. No point waiting though, cause you need to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a couple of hours, you got into town! You got into the city, breathing hard and tired. After all, you were barely a couple of inches tall, and a small stroll was like a marathon to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you were in town, and you were moving in. The sun was going down, so you really should get someone\u2019s attention before the dark comes. Your home was on the other side of town, so that was away. You were too small to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go to the Pokecenter. Now you never had to heal your own Pokemon, because you don\u2019t have any. However you have talked to Nurse Joy, and have bonded with her. You doubt she actually remembers you due to how much people she meets, but you know she is nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you walk around some more, you hear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cChikorita!\u201d</span> A voice said as you instantly hid. You were out in the open, as you could do nothing at the point no matter how much you want. It would take a solid fifteen seconds to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing small is terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as a giant Pokemon come into view, and it was the grass starter. The Pokemon didn\u2019t stop you though, cause instead it just kept running. You watch it leave your view, and then you see a giant girl chasing after the Pokemon. With brown hair and a big white hat. A red and blue coulour scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikorita! Calm down!\u201d She yelled for a long while chasing her. She was chasing her Pokemon and left quickly as you breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not deny that... she was giant. The giant girl, didn\u2019t look that old but seemed so big to you. You need to get someone\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around some more, avoiding giant steps as you remember this street. You could go to the Pokemon Center, but... you could also go to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t that far as well, in fact the same distance. it may sound crazy, but you need to feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are having a bit of a mini heart attack at the moment. Being so small, and everything towering over you, you need someone you can feel safe with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunnily enough, that might by the Johto Gym Leader Jasmine. Now you don\u2019t know her personally, as you have never been in that kind of lifestyle. What you have heard about her though makes her sound kind, gentle and perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting her attention might be what you want. Plus as a Gym Leader, she has connections and powerful Pokemon! She can help you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was your plan, to the Gym. You go to walk and suddenly realise you were going the same direction of the giant trainer and the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move and go through, of course having trouble because even though it is one block around, that is far too much for you. You just know you will feel tired when you get to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd tired you did feel, very tired to the point where you wanted to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were not even at the gym at the moment. You barely cross the street!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay down, tired and on the outside of the Gym. That was far too taxing for you. Even worse, it seemed, because you did have to avoid and dodge some giants and giantesses that were around you. You did not want to be found by just a random person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have rethought your plan and actually have been looking forward to meeting Jasmine. She sounded perfect, and she was cute. A blessing in disguise maybe... maybe not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only imagine where Mew would be at this point. She just shrunk you and left, and she clearly wants you to follow and play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she have gone that far? If you remember the books correctly, Mew has been rumored to know every move. Which raises more problems clearly. If she knows Teleport.... or Extreme Speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh that was not something you wanted. How long are you gonna stay small?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up onto your feet, and you plan to move, however you stop when you realise a problem. You were... stuck outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun basically down as you move around. It was not like the gym was closed, as you can see lights inside. The problem is... the door is a slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels weight on the pressure on the floor, and it opens up in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for weight, well you don\u2019t have that all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d You yell, as no one was near you. You jump and try to make the door open, if only for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t going to, and you were stuck outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do? You can\u2019t get into the gym by yourself, you are far too small to make weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus the Pokecenter is far too away now. Looking around... you spot a home not so far away with a slightly open window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may be degrading, but you might have to go and live in that house for the night. You won\u2019t get spotted by whoever lives in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo maybe... you have to live under giants.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staying in someone's house, even if only for one night and because you were in desperate need, felt wrong. After all, if anyone living in there spotted you, there was no telling what kind of punishment they would have inflicted upon you, the highest chances being you getting simply tossed back out or, worse, stepped on, which could perfectly happen even if whoever lived in the house remained unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... you needed a shelter for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, swallowing your fear, you slowly took a couple steps away from the gym and towards the house, but something held you back: a girl, who you recognized as the person you saw before, was running towards the gym, her Chikorita running beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can still make it.\" you heard her say in a low tone, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chika!</span>\" the Pokemon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your heart swelling. The girl was heading your way... she could open the door of the gym for you!... Just then, you recalled where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess could open the door for you alright... <i>if you managed to not get stepped on by her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you realized this, the shoe of the girl was already hovering above you, crafting a huge shadow; hastily, you jumped out of the way as the large foot came crashing next to you, lingering for a moment before it disappeared as the door automatically opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you stood back up and, while the door was closing back up, you hastily slid inside. Being tiny did have some advantages, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, the door closed back up behind you, trapping you inside until someone came to open the door again, but you were fine with it: you planned to get someone's attention, possibly the gym leader Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of Jasmine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm late,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noted the girl from before apologizing  to another girl. A stunningly beautiful girl: Jasmine, the steel-type gym leader, who was just standing in front of the other girl, offering a feeble smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Chikorita ran off and I had to get it back. I'm sorry.\" the other girl spoke. You noted how quiet she was. When you previously 'met' her, you could hear her voice loud and clear as she called out to her Pokemon to stop; now, you could barely even hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... don't worry, that's alright.\" Jasmine replied, blushing a bit. Her tone was just slightly higher than the other girl's and, geez, between these two ladies, you could barely hear a word. Good thing your reduced state made everything sound louder. <br>\r\n\"We can have our match now, if you're, um, up for it. I don't mind.\" Jasmine finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl, whose name was still unclear to you, smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" she said gratefully, only causing Jasmine's blush to gain even more ground on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, apparently, these two were going to have a gym battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even having to think twice, you stood aside and sat by a wall: there was no way you could get the attention of one of the two giantesses while they fought, and you didn't want to be anywhere near the battlefield when you were this vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, watching giant Pokemon fight... that could be entertaining. Since you couldn't get their attention right now, you might as well watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as both trainer and leader walked on opposite sides of the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, since you're the challenger, you get the first move.\" Jasmine instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other just nodded her head to signal that she had understood, reaching in her bag to grab a Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could toss it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiko!</span>\" the green Pokemon beside the girl chimed, causing her to halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go first, don't you?\" she asked quietly, getting a confident nod from her Pokemon,<br>\r\n\"Okay then. You're up, Chikorita,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy cry, Chikorita ran to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rose an eyebrow. A grass-type against a certain steel-type? You were no trainer, but even you knew that such fight was uneven. This girl must have been a newbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then,\" Jasmine said, tossing a Pokeball,<br>\r\n\"Magnemite, come on out, please,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon Jasmine called popped out and cried its name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the battle began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, you just watched the two trainers giving silent commands and their Pokemon obeying, clashing with each other in an admittedly pretty good fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if the unknown girl at been at a disadvantage before, she fought like an expert trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, her Chikorita took down Jasmine's Magnemite, and put up a good fight against her Magneton as well before the green Pokemon was called back by her trainer and was switched with a Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your point of view, the Pokemon looked magnificent, majestic even. And, expectedly, it took down Jasmine's Magneton in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the type advantage, Ninetales stood no chance against Jasmine's strongest Pokemon: Steelix. The steel behemoth only used one Earthquake to knock out the poor vulpine while also shaking the whole gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blessed your decision to stay aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she returned her Ninetales, the other trainer smirked, though you couldn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blastoise,\" she called, tossing her Pokeball; a large, blue, bipedal turtle came out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Blastoise!</span>\" it cried its name, nearly deafening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hydro Pump, go,\" the trainer said. Her Pokemon obeyed without hesitation and pointed the two cannons in its shell towards Steelix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steelix, dodge!\" Jasmine yelled, worried for her Pokemon. This was the very first time you heard her voice so loud, and it was as beautiful as Jasmine herself was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, as fast as Steelix was, it still got hit by Hydro Pump and got sent flying into a wall by the sheer force of the water; it didn't get up after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Jasmine mumbled, rushing to her Pokemon to check if it was already, before returning Steelix to its Pokeball; then, she turned to the girl with a smile,<br>\r\n\"Well, um... looks like you win,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" the other replied, her Chikorita jumping around in elation, happy for her trainer's latest victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid trainer returned her Blastoise and approached Jasmine, who held out a gym badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also got up, deciding that this was a great moment to try and get the attention of one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been, um, a great battle,\" Jasmine admitted with a small blush,<br>\r\n\"So here's the Mineral Badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" she said, accepting the prize and storing it away, before saying,<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll be going now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope to see you again, Leaf,\" she said, before smiling and blushing again, <br>\r\n\"I look forward to a rematch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou halted. 'Leaf'? Was that the name of the trainer of Chikorita?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, realization dawned on you, while the two giantesses shook hands: this 'Leaf' was a traveling trainer, so if you could get her attention, you could convince her to help you find Mew during her journey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were a bit unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you didn't know if she'd be willing to help you out, and were far more sure about Jasmine to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to decide, you noted the two titanesses finally parting ways as Leaf began walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you had to do, whoever you had to pick, you had to do it quickly: Leaf was leaving!</span></div></div>",

After Leaf left the gym, Jasmine let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* That's the last one.\" Jasmine said. \"Now I can go join my friends on vacation!\" You didn't know that Jasmine had was planning to go on vacation. Then again, it was summer and now you wondered who her friend were. Your questioned was answered as you heard the door open as two girls walked in. One of them had fiery red hair and eyes, she wore a black shirt that was tied up in the front and under it was a red tube bra with a picture of a flame. She wore very baggy teal jeans that have three red knots on the bottom of each leg. Her jeans were held up by some sort of white cloth that had some sort of detail on one of the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl had reddish brown hair and blue eyes, Her hair was tied up by one pastel teal hair clip that resembled a flower. She wore a  pastel teal skintight suit and light blue gloves. The suit didn't cover her whole body as it exposes her belly. Just like her suit and flower accessory, she wore pastel teal shorts that expose her legs up towards her pelvis. She had straps that bucked her on the front and some that leaded to her thighs. She had a light blue holster on her right leg which match the color of her gloves, straps, and the base of her boots. The top of the boots were more of a teal color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew seen these girls before, it was Flannery and Skyla! You didn't know that Jasmine knew Hoenn's Fire-type Gym Leader and Sinnoh's Air-type Gym Leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine! I'm so happy to see you again!\" Skyla said as she went over to Jasmine to hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy to see you too Skyla!\" Jasmine said, hugging her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jasmine, ready to go?\" Flannery asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost, let me get my bag from my room.\" Jasmine answered. \"You don't mind waiting a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, take your time. We'll wait by the bleachers.\" Flannery said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have enough time, you were gonna have to join them in their vacation. You started ran towards the three girls. You saw Flannery and Skyla walking towards you, unaware that you were in their path. You dodged and weaved your way past the girl's gigantic feet and somehow made it unscratched. As soon as You made it passed them, Jasmine was already gone to get her bag. you decided to wait for her and jump on her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minute later.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for Jasmine to come back and you gained back a bit of your stamina. You then heard the sound of footsteps and rolling wheels. You were happy to see that Jasmine founder her bag. Her bag matched her dress and had a cute little Magnemite key-chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the wait!\" Jasmine apologized to Flannery and Skyla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Jasmine.\" Skyla said \"Now we can go to the hotel!\" You quickly grabbed onto the suitcase's key-chain as it passed by you. You were able to open the bag enough that you were able to slip inside. Once inside, you landed on some of her cloths. You thought this was good time to take a nap. You got into a comfortable position and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up, still in the suitcase. You stretched your arms and gave out a yawn. You had know idea what time it was nor where were you outside the suitcase, so you went to the bags opening from before and peeked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it wasn't a hotel, but it was a room of sorts. It resembled a small house with stairs leading to the second floor, the room had also a kitchen from where you were located. When you climbed out, you saw that the suitcases were leaning on the wall. Flannery's, from what you guessed, had a flames on it and a Torkoal key-chain. Skyla had a Sky theme on her suitcase and a Swana key-chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to see Jasmine, Skyla, and Flannery on the couch together, eating popcorn and watching a movie. The movie had Pokemon talking in English. You didn't know what the movie was about and you didn't have time, at the same time, you were getting a bit hungry. You saw that Skyla was holding a bowl of popcorn for the others to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the couch they were seated at and shouted at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Jasmine! Flannery! Skyla! Down Here! Help!\" You shouted at them, but it was no use, they had no reaction fro your screaming. The only thing to do now is to go for some skin contact. You saw that Flannery was still wearing her jeans, which would make the climb easier. Not that it would matter, but you were confident with your climbing skills and could try to climb up Jasmine or Skyla. You were still hungry and thought that maybe you could grab on popcorn kernel from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you go for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Climb up Jasmine and try to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Climb up Skyla and try and get her attention. (You then come to a choice between to continue climbing Skyla or Enter the popcorn bowl. Choosing the bowl will lead to an unaware vore route that you \"may\" get eaten by Jasmine, Skyla, or Flannery. Of course for the unaware vore route their would be chose to where they hear you and don't get eaten and one to where you are eaten, but don't die. I know the rules say \"No choice chapters.\" I'll try to make it as long as possible.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC:Climb up Flannery and try and get her attention.</span></div></div>",

She had already taken off her sandals, which was a good thing since getting crushed by her sandals would be way more painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grabbed onto her toe, she shook you off and you fell back on the floor. Apparently Jasmine was wiggling her toes. Probably a way to stay warm. You haven't realized until now that the room was freezing cold! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sooner I get her attention, the better!\" You thought to yourself. You grabbed onto her toe again and held on this time. You climbed up and holstered yourself up onto her foot. As you gazed up, you knew it could take you a few minutes to get to her ear. You didn't want to waste time! Being small was tough as it already is! You quickly walked across her foot and began to climb up her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit longer since her leg was long. Though it wasn't as difficult as climbing up her foot. You weren't paying attention to the movie nor the girl's laughter. Your only focus now was getting noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've eventually reached her thigh leg and immediately saw something that made you blush bright red. You were looking at Jasmine's light green panties! You couldn't help but stare at it. It was almost like it was calling towards you.

Though you were curious to see if the Steel Gym Leader could hear you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine! Jasmine!\" You yelled out to her. Nothing. You couldn't be that small, right?

You were gonna have to make your choice, stay with Jasmine or go with this Leaf!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling pressured, you didn\u2019t have time to really think about it... as you just had to go! Your eyes open as you turn right, running to the trainer and not the gym leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run as fast as you can to catch up to this giant girl. Luckily she was waving goodbye and slowing her pace, which let you easily move and jump on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping over onto her sneaker as you hugged the shoelaces. You held for a long while, making sure you were safe and not going to be thrown around randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked for a long while, leaving you as you see her move around and go over to the door. Opening it up when it featured her weight, and then she left. Every step that she took, sent you for a wide as you just kept grabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it for a long while, you realise this might be the better options. Sure, there was a lot of evidence why staying with Jasmine was the better option, but this girl... her Pokemon was stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a Blastoise! And she bet Jasmine with her Pokemon. She was a trainer, so she was a traveller and... if anyone can help you not only find Mew, but also get your height back it might be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, you don\u2019t know anything about Leaf, except for the fact that she was a trainer, and she was... well a bit pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine, pretty as well wouldn\u2019t have the power to leave. She was a Gym Leader and had responsibilities, so this was the better option. At least that\u2019s what you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, Leaf was walking looking at her newly gotten badge, That made fourteen. Fourteen badges she has. Eight from Kanto and now Six from Johto. Granted because of her badges, these Pokemon battles have never been easy, but they were fun and she loved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most people are out to be the very best, Leaf was more out there for the adventure. When she gets the 8 from Johto, she plans to go to the other regions and get the Gym Leader badges there. After all she had to keep it up like her friends Red and Blue. Blue, who became a Gym Leader, and Red... who just kind of disappeared from the face of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked she put the badge in her Johto case and smiled. Putting it near her Kanto badge case in her bag. She was glad Blastoise was able to finish it up, but she would be lying if she was happy that she had to rely on her Pokemon. She has been with Blastoise since it was a Squirtle, so of course the Pokemon was strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita was the starter she got when she came to Johto, and well... she was a fighter. The amount of times Leaf had to chase that Pokemon to keep it in line was a bit crazy, but she was strong. Sadly, not strong enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was glad to have her in her team. Looking around at the sky, it was getting dark. Stay a night at the Pokecenter, and then continue her journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the pace, as you hugged the foot even more. How fast was this girl going, so fast as you were gonna get hurt if you let go. You did move away from her shoelaces, and climb up to her baggy sock. Much easier to get a hold on as she walks. You just hug on for dear life, knowing this was gonna be your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her walk in the direction of the Pokecenter, and pretty quickly she was there. Something that was a bit mind boggling as it would of taken you quite the journey, but for Leaf... she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in, and this was the first time you really grasped your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many people, inside of the Pokecenter. Everyone of them towered over you, to the point where you did not want to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, there was some Pokemon scattered around, closer to seeing you. A Corsola not so far away but it\u2019s female trainer. A towering young boy feeding his Rattata and Ratticate, both Pokemon having the power to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Leaf didn\u2019t pay them any mind as she walked up close. You were facing a counter, but Leaf was facing Nurse Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, i\u2019d like to rent a room.\u201d Leaf said as you heard the voice of Nurse Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood, now are you going to want a living room, or a Pokemon room.\u201d She said as Leaf knew the difference. Wasn\u2019t the first Pokecenter she stayed at. A living room is just for her, simply to sleep and is the size for a human. While a Pokemon room is a lot more spacice, to accomidated for Pokemon. A lot more expensive though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just a living room. Actually, if you can heal them as well, that would be great!\u201d She smiled and sure enough, her Pokemon got healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the chime and the room number that Leaf got, as she started to walk. You still hugging the sock of the girl as she walked down the halls. Away from all the giant people you ran the risk of being found by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf got to her door, twisting the key and pushing her way through. She pushed her way through and went into the room. A smile on her face as she was going to have a good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you also dispatched from the sock, taking a bit of a break as you were now in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you have to do now is get her attention, should be simple enough. All you got to do is _________</span></div></div>",

She removed her hat, placing next to Chikorita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer then went to lay on the bed, but halted in her tracks as she heard a faint noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening close, she could hear it again, over and over; and the more she listened, the more she figured out that it was someone's voice, calling out her name, but it was very distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor behind her, you called one more time,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, finally, the teen giantess turned around, but didn't look down right away, instead shooting silent glances around the room to locate whoever was calling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here!\" you yelled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly, the giantess heard you, because she glanced down, spotting you by her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from a slightly surprised look on her face, Leaf had literally no reaction to her discovery of a small man no taller than the peak of her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, were quite impressed by the towering height of the giantess and, for a moment, you nearly forgot why you were here, but you quickly found your composure and spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, h-hi!\" you said with a wave,<br>\r\n\"You're... Leaf, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf remained unmoving for a couple moments more, before she slowly made a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched a the brunette bent her legs, making her less towering but still quite big; her hand found her way to you as you were picked up by Leaf, who then stood back up, holding you between her fingers, not saying a word, although there was an inquisitive stare in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... h-hi,\" you repeated, not knowing how else you could strike a conversation with a nearly-mute giantess,<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sure you have a lot of questions, so let me explain please,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still said nothing, but moved her free hand, gesturing that your request was granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... so, first things first, I'm here because... well, because I saw you back at Jasmine's gym,\" you admitted. Leaf rose an eyebrow; on the bed, Chikorita kept napping, blissfully unaware of what was happening.<br>\r\n\"I was headed there because I wanted to get Jasmine's help, but then I ended up watching your match with her... speaking of which, you did pretty good out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf didn't show the slightest hint of a smile at your compliment, so you decided to go on,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So, after you finished, I thought I'd follow you, hoping that... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">don't mind the nerve, please</font>... hoping that maybe you could help me!\" you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf tilted her head to a side, letting her hair cascade down, still wearing an inquisitive expression, though it was more one of curiosity than one of suspicion now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... oh, right, I missed the most important part,\" you said, proceeding to explain,<br>\r\n\"You see, I'm so tiny because of an odd... 'experience' I had today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you began explaining everything, from how you were woken up by Mew, to how she played with you, finishing with said legendary shrinking you to this size before taking off, challenging you to go and find her in before leaving, gone to an unknown destination, and that was why you followed Leaf, hoping she could lend a hand and help you find Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of your tale, Leaf looked a little skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped - didn't she believe you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... I promise that everything I said is true, I don't know how I could-\" you trailed off, remembering something,<br>\r\n\"Wait, I actually do! Hold on...\" you said, digging in your pocket to retrieve your PokeNav. Who knew those pictures you took of Mew would help this much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you found the photo you were looking for on your device, you offered it to Leaf,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here...\" you said, before realizing how stupid this was. Your PokeNav was probably nothing more that a grain of sand to Leaf.<br>\r\n\"Uh... I don't know if you can see it...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf said nothing. Instead, she moved two fingers over, slowly and carefully picking the device from your hand. Sadly, even with how careful she was being, your PokeNav was far too small to be handed by someone so big. The result was that it got crushed the moment Leaf moved her hand and, surprised, let go of the pieces, which fell to the floor while Leaf blushed and shot you a sorrowful stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at whatever remained of your PokeNav, now officially hopeless. How else could you prove your good faith to Leaf, now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted when a large finger gently nestled itself between your chin and neck and pulled your head up, forcing you to look back at Leaf: she was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guessed you wouldn't risk all the trouble of following her and making up the whole 'Mew' story for nothing; if you had any bad intentions, you certainly wouldn't have willingly gotten her attention, not when you were about two inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... believe me?\" you asked, not able to mask the anxiety you were feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Leaf spoke, for the first time since you got her attention,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\" she said. You recalled just how quiet she was, and yet she had a wonderful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was no time to lose yourself over a pretty girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... s-so? Will you help me, please?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf's smile became slightly bigger, though not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered another nod. It may have been a simple gesture, but it made you feel massively relieved, to the point you couldn't help yourself from shouting, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Leaf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the smile of the teenage girl just grew a bit larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\"</span></div></div>",

With how small I am, not to mention I don\u2019t have any other Pokemon, don\u2019t have much options.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cobviously.\u201d She said as that stung a bit, but she was being realistic. \u201cWhich is why you came to me, cause of my Pokemon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I saw your gym battle. I was back there and that\u2019s actually when I realised I wanted to get your attention. You were so strong, and you know... as a trainer you will want to catch a legendary right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, that was very true. However she was sort of doing her own thing at the moment. She looked down for a couple of seconds until she looked back at you. Determination in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it have to be instantly?\u201d She questioned as you look at her confused. \u201cYou see, i\u2019ve got six badges in this region, two away from a complete set. As you can understand, I want to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... okay I understand. Well, I guess drop me down and i\u2019ll go find another trainer to ask. Pokecenter would be full of it.\u201d You say a bit dejected, but thankfully she picked you back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I will still help you, but it won\u2019t be my primary objective. If you can accept that, I will be glad to go any Mew sightings on the way and try to help you.\u201d She said as that was interesting offer. She wanted the badges, but it seems she will help you if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s the best offer i\u2019m going to get. If i\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t even know where Mew would be. That Pokemon is a traveller right?\u201d You question as she nodded. Leaf has heard stories about the Pokemon like you have. \u201cSo I guess, i\u2019ll take your generous offer. Better than being by myself trying to track the legendary down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d She said smiling. You saw it her way. \u201cWhich means you get to stay with me.\u201d Leaf said, a bit bigger smile on her face. Glad you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiko?\u201d A voice said as you crane over. You completely forgotten about the Pokemon, the giant thing looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... hi?\u201d You say as Leaf lowered you down closer to the curious Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikorita, this is (Your Name)\u201d She said to her Pokemon. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be travelling with us, so treat him well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass type looked at you, a bit curious about you until finally she smiled. A big smile on her face as honestly... it did not calm you down. The smile seemed a bit... mischievous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like Leaf saw that as well. Grabbing the Pokemon\u2019s own leaf and tugging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like that, if you think thoughts like that I will put you back in your Pokeball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikorita!\u201d It said panicking and jumping around as it broke free. You got to admit, it was kind of cute when you saw the giant Pokemon pout to you, moving away and back to the bed, laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... young Pokemon?\u201d You say as Leaf nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung and stubborn. She got free earlier today, spotting a Spearow or something. I had to chase her all around the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah I know... I kind of saw it when I came in.\u201d You say as she looks at you for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool.\u201d She said as monotone as possible, as you expected more from that. \u201cNow, you lived in this city?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah. Geez, what am I going to do, not like I can keep up with the bills.\u201d You say to her thinking about real adult things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure things will work out in the end.\u201d She said as you had to assume. You don\u2019t like thinking about it, and Leaf could see. moving her other hand down, she grabbed something from the bag, opening it up. \u201cSee, six badges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... yeah I can.\u201d You say as you look over them, pretty impressed by her actions. \u201cWow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also have all of the Kanto badges. My team is on par with the elite four, and the best the gym leaders have to offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, guess I made a good choice.\u201d you say jokingly, although she didn\u2019t laugh. Leaf did find it funny though. \u201cWhich two are you missing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ones from Blackthorn City and Goldenrod City.\u201d She said as you blinked a couple of times at her. \u201cI suppose you aren\u2019t a trainer so you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d She said giving you the benefit of the doubt, something needed. \u201cThe gym leaders there are Whitney, who uses Normal and Clair, who uses Dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope Mew are at one of those towns.\u201d You say as that seems to be the thing that was primarily on your mind. Still she can\u2019t blame you, you were shrunken by the legendary and you want to get your height back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she can\u2019t see running into Mew soon. If she gets the chance, she will leap for it, but she doesn\u2019t see it happening. She looked down to you, as Leaf decided ________________</span></div></div>",

Keep our guest company in the meantime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wha-?\" you said, surprised by what Leaf just said, but you had no time to protest; by the time the giantess placed you on the bed, Chikorita had already gotten on all fours and was crying her name happily in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun.\" Leaf said as she got up, heading to a door that led to a small bathroom, disappearing inside as she closed the door, leaving you behind with Chikorita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid grass-type wasted no time and leaped in your direction, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiko!</span>\" she cried excitedly, not even giving you time to turn to face her as she laid down, bringing her paws around you, leaving you no way out of her 'embrace'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiko, chiko!</span>\" she kept saying, though you couldn't understand what she was actually saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only hazard a guess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, yeah, it's nice to meet you too, Chikorita...\" you said, not really sure whether that was the correct answer or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was the answer, Chikorita's smile widened as she leaned in closer. The air began carrying an overwhelming scent of fresh grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi, chiko,</span>\" the Pokemon spoke as she opened her mouth, her tongue slowly coming out as she gave you a couple of friendly licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you would have disliked it, but Chikorita's tongue tickled you, causing you to laugh uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, s-stop it!\" you stammered, unable to keep yourself from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that, Chikorita retracted her tongue in her mouth and grinned, before she brought the leaf on her head to you and began using it to keep tickling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chikorita, stop girl!\" you yelled, but she didn't listen and kept going for about a minute more, until you felt that you had no more air left in your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then, the Pokemon giantess pulled back, wearing a smile on her verdant face, and sat by you while waiting for you to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a couple of minutes, but you were eventually able to stop laughing and retrieve your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up, shooting a glance and a smile in direction of the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess this means that you like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Chikorita's smile became mischievous again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">How could I not like Leaf's cute little boyfriend...</span></u>\" she said, giggling to herself, perfectly aware that you had no idea what she was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing Leaf wasn't around to make the threat to return her to her pokeball into a reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really hated it in that sphere. Not that it was uncomfortable or anything, but Chikorita was a free spirit who hated being confined within such a limited space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh...\" you said, unable to break through the language barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita just giggled, her smile returning to a more friendly one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ta.</span>\" she simply said, waving a paw, telling you to not give it much thought. Then, she smirked once more,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the green Pokemon only let her grin widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in once more, then brought down the leaf on her head; somehow, you suddenly found yourself on laying on top of the leaf, before Chikorita flipped it, causing you to have a short flight, eventually landing on the back of the grass-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiko!</span>\" she said as you readjusted yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what was that for?\" you asked, but were completely ignored as the Pokemon began jumping around on the bed with you on her back; the result was that you looked like you were trying to hold on a Rapidash as it galloped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chikorita!\" you called, trying to get the Pokemon to stop as you began feeling nauseous, although, despite dizzying, the ride on the grass-type's back was kind of... fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita knew that, and, young and stubborn like Leaf told she was, she had no intention of stopping. It was the exact opposite, she was about to spice things up, which she did when she took a great leap and jumped from the bed to the floor, skillfully landing on all fours while also nearly throwing you off of her back; you dug your hands in the soft skin of the Pokemon after that, not planning on becoming a red stain on the floor so shook after you managed to get help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn elation, Chikorita began leaping around the room, truly acting like a Rapidash as she tried to throw you off while you hung on with all your strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, you laid belly-down onto the back of the Pokemon and pressed your knees into it as well, hanging on as hard as you could; each time you felt that you were about to let go, you tightened your grip, not even bothering wasting your breath as you knew that it would be pointless: Chikorita wasn't going to stop until she willed it, or until Leaf came out and stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Chikorita decided to stop on her own much much before Leaf came out of the bathroom; with one last jump, she leapt back on the bed and and flopped to the side, causing you slide off, marking the end of the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" you moaned, feeling sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita got back onto her legs and strolled over to where you were laying, leaning to give you a couple of gentle licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly sat back; Chikorita backed up and sat down by you, staring at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Enjoyed the ride?</span></u>\" she asked in her own language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... actually fun!\" you said her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been one thrilling ride, that was undeniable, but it had been pretty fun as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita's red eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi~!</span>\" she cooed, leaning in, beginning to nuzzle you. You returned the display of affection by rubbing a hand onto her cheek, making the Pokemon give soft cries of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door to the bathroom opened, letting Leaf walk out; you noted that she had her light blue top off, and was now in a black, sleeveless shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the eyes of the teen locked on the sight of Chikorita coddling you, and a smile appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're done.\" you unnecessarily stated, getting a nod from Leaf, who walked towards the bed, picking you from Chikorita's attentions, much to the Pokemon's annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chii...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself?\" Leaf playfully teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf let her smile grow a bit larger - she was so cute when she did that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since I plan to resume the journey early tomorrow morning, it's time to go to sleep.\" Leaf explained, sitting on top of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but where will I be sleeping then?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf shot you another smile. </span></div></div>",

Now, we are going to go to sleep right now.\u201d She said simply, moving over and grabbing you. She grabbed you from the Pokemon\u2019s back as she went over and began to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on the bed and getting comfy, now in nothing but a black top and black bottoms. Mainly because it was comfy, plus no one usually saw her in these. Guess she was going to change that with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cChikorita!\u201d </span>Her Pokemon yelled, jumping up and getting close. Leaf was a bit confused about this. The grass type usually slept at the foot of the bed, guess it was different at the moment. Thinking for a couple of seconds, she pieced it together that it was you. Her Pokemon has really taken a liking to you, hopefully the rest will as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... how am I going to sleep, on the pillow?\u201d You question, however looking at her Pokemon she has already decided she wanted to sleep with you. Taking a couple of steps back, you go to move but suddenly you feel yourself pulled around. Placed onto the bed as Leaf went under the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted it high and her huge body went under, her head on the pillow as she seems so much more casual at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Okay, guess I will just find whahh!\u201d You got cut off as you feel a hand come and bring you around. Dragging you around with her power as you felt yourself pinned to something that you did not expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held you, but what was pushing your back. It was soft, almost really. Confused about it, until you piece together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-L-Leaf? Why are you hugging me against your chest.\u201d You say really flustered about it. Behind you was her... boobs. It was actually boobs, not what you were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get cold,m\u201d She said simply, and you were a bit shocked seeing that she was not embarrassed about it at all. In fact, she was more then welcoming to it. Which left you confused for obvious reasons. This girl sure was a strange one. \u201cNot to mention, this is for my Pokemon.\u201d She said and though you were confused, you could see the giant Pokemon looking down at you. Leaf opened her hands away from you, when suddenly you could see her Pokemon dive into them. You suddenly got what was happening, as she brought you closer to the hug, and in front of you was the giant stomach of Chikorita, the Pokemon feeling you against her as she wore a Poke smile compared to you. She held you for a long while as you look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like i\u2019m in the middle of a sandwich.\u201d You say to her as she Leaf smiled and you could hear her Pokemon giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be warm here. Goodnight.\u201d Leaf said simply, as not only was she very direct, she was very caring. She is someone you really have to get use to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cChikorita!!\u201d</span> It said. You could see it\u2019s giant head looking down to you happily as it was technically sleeping wit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh goodnight Leaf. I guess, Goodnight Chikorita.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cGoodnight little guy, I promise I\u2019ll be the first thing you see when you wake up!\u201d </span></u>She said happily, as all three of you close your eyes. Right now, this was going to be fun and interesting, the unique step in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, it was because of feeling the pillow that was against you front go away. With a bit of confusion about it, you look around when suddenly... you could see a smiling face in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... good morning?\u201d You say to the Pokemon. You can tell by the window, the sun was barely coming up. Why would the Pokemon wake you up, and why is her face so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cHehehe, told you that i\u2019d be the first one you see when you wake up,\u201d</span></u> Chikorita said, as of course you could not actually understand what she was saying. Not one bit. Although her intentions were really obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her body around and... well you learned that she knew Vine Whip, cause two of them come out of her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved them to you, gently and smoothly lifted you up. Bringing you into the air and away from the grip of the trainer. Turning your head, you could see Leaf still sleeping on the bed, and you in the hand. The vines wrapped around you as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cReady to have some morning fun?\u201d</span></u> She questioned, as she moved down and got off the bed. Making sure not to wake her trainer at any point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Chikorita?\u201d You question for a long while as she moved down. She moved down to the ground and smiled. \u201cJust... nothing too violent okay.\u201d You say to her finally, as she brought you down. Her vine letting go as you see the giant leaf Pokemon looking down at you.<br>\r\n\u2028She seemed very eager to play with you, but she still let you rub your eye and wake yourself up. Waking yourself up and getting up as you wear a smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d You say as suddenly she looked back. \u201cOh right quiet. Well i\u2019m a bit awake now, so I guess i\u2019m up for a little fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt will help you rethink and not focus on the... problem at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cOkay, well i\u2019m really excited, and when I woke up you were the first thing that came into my mind. We have to make sure we don\u2019t wake my trainer up though. Anyway, let\u2019s play!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></u><br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t understand any of that, but it was clear what was happening.</span></div></div>",

Chikorita, I'd like you to remind that I'm really fragile, and that Leaf would probably be upset if you hurt me...\" you said, hoping that the green Pokemon would simply leave you alone, no matter if you had to humiliate yourself to achieve such goal: your safety came before your pride in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Chikorita's smirk went from mischievous to smug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">I'll keep that in mind.

Just what had gotten into Chikorita!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of options, you just kept running, with Chikorita's vines occasionally hitting the floor near you, each time threatening to give you a heart attack, yet Chikorita herself seemed to have no interest in catching you, seemingly more keen on enjoying her little game of cat and mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, you began 'running' out of breath and started slowing down.

Try to at least make this a little challenging for me!</span></u>\" she cried, once more extending her vines, this time actually hitting you, not strong enough to hurt you, but definitely enough to make you feel a jolt of pain that made you sprint faster a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt one or two more times, and you were fairly sure that your shirt was now ripped open, you could tell as you felt cold on your burning back... which was actually a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn't go on, you had to come up with something, fast... and you did, once you saw where you were headed: the bed Leaf was sleeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking twice, you sprinted as fast as you could and jumped under the bed to escape Chikorita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Aw, come on! No fair!</span></u>\" she cried as she reached the bed, making a poor attempt to get underneath as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly - and luckily for you - she was too big to slide under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chikoooo...</span>\" she cried in annoyance, before remembering about her vines; if she could just slide those under the bed, she could get you and could keep playing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi, chiko!</span>\" the grass-type laughed mischievously as she peeked under the bed where you were hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her red eye staring at you, but you knew she couldn't reach you, which filled you with relief... at least, until she began sliding one of her vines in, letting it snake its way towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Peek-a-b-</span></u><span class=\"clgreen\">ko!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vine stopped dead in its tracks, then retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita disappeared from sight, replaced by the more reassuring sight of a hazel eye which you recognized as Leaf's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved beyond belief, you slowly made your way out of your hiding spot, where an awake and very annoyed-looking giantess was waiting, holding Chikorita by the leaf on top of her head; you stood by the Leaf's bare feet, watching as Chikorita desperately tried to break free from her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repressed the urge to laugh at her, who was getting the Pokemon version of an earful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you turned your attention to Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Good morning, Leaf,\" you greeted, before looking away, embarrassed,<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the save.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Leaf let go of Chikorita, who scampered away, and bent down, offering you a hand to climb on; once you did, the giantess rose back and, smiling reassuringly, began stroking your back with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for that.\" she murmured, as quiet as ever,<br>\r\n\"I guess it was my mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! It wasn't, just... what's gotten into her?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf exhaled, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She likes chasing small things, like yesterday's Spearow.\" she explained,<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's okay, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not okay, it was all but okay: your back was stinging like hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf smiled sorrowfully, then cheerfully,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that I'm up, it's time I go get ready. I... we have a journey to continue,\" she said, as quiet as ever,<br>\r\n\"And as for you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave me with Chikorita!\" you quickly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chiik...</span>\" the Pokemon spoke from a corner in the room, looking much like a kid after being scolded by their mother, which was basically what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf shot a brief glare in direction of her Pokemon, then looked back at you and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't just leave you sitting around, especially not with Chikorita. Not anymore, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Leaf was quick to think of a solution.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaf smiled as she thought of a good idea. Heading over to her bag, with you still in her hand you watch as she grabs a Pokeball. Holding it as you question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to call Chikorita back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, i\u2019m just giving her a babysitter.\u201d She said simply as she threw the Pokeball. It opened up and you saw a Pokemon come out of the light and materialise itself. Looking to the Pokemon, it was unmistakable what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellow with red highlights, a regal position, on all fours and most importantly, Nine tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... okay?\u201d You say as the Pokemon stretched out of the Pokeball, Chikorita being just as confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf learned her way forward and placed you right onto the ground in front of the giant fire Pokemon. Her eyes instantly locked onto you, a little bit shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to get ready, Ninetails, can you look after my little friend and make sure Chikorita is nowhere near him.\u201d Leaf said as the Pokemon looked up from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Leaf, I don\u2019t think this is-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNinetails.\u201d</span> The Pokemon interrupted you, very loudly as you look to it, then back to Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s a good Pokemon,\u201d Leaf murmured. You don\u2019t know if that was because she just woke up, or that is how she usually is. \u201cGood luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf walked and went to the bathroom, closing it behind you as you look to the fellow human leave. The shower turning on soon after that and then... a sound behind you. It sounded kind of like a purr, or whatever the fox equilivent is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you could see Ninetails, smiling down at you. It\u2019s tail up and dancing behind her. Even from this scary angle, she really looked majestic. You have never seen one so up close before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t say anything, but instead Ninetails brought her paw over you, and you knew what was going to happen. She brought it down slowly on you, as she pinned down. Smiling as she held the little human tight under her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t uncomfortable, but clearly it was to keep you under her paw and make sure you weren\u2019t going to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would Leaf thinking leaving you alone with two Pokemon would be better than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd well, it was. Ninetails was one of the first couple of Pokemon Leaf got, back when she was a Vulpix. Hence there was a strong bond between the two. She trusts Ninetails and for good reason. While she has her paw on you, she wasn\u2019t going to try anything besides that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cyellow\">A little human, how curious?\u201d</span> Ninetails said with a smile, <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThis is so odd?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cMew shrunk him down.\u201d</span></span> Chikorita picked up moving away from the tails. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHe\u2019s gonna be travelling with us now!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cIs he now? Well, I like that.\u201d </span>She said, her toothy grin down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHehe, Me too. Ninetails, I want to play with him too!\u201d </span>Chikorita said moving her way in, but the Pokemon got blocked as a couple of tails got in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cLeaf wants me to make sure you don\u2019t play with him, and I will. You just sit over there and watch.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey no fair!\u201d </span>Chikorita complained, only to get a chuckle from the other Pokemon. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYou\u2019re playing with him!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cLeaf didn\u2019t say anything about me playing with him, just you. You can try to... take him from me. If you are feeling bored enough?\u201d </span>She questioned, daring the grass type to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cFine, whatever he likes me more.\u201d </span>Chikorita said not even going down that route. Not only is Ninetails evolved and a stronger Pokemon, she also had the type advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWe will see if he still feels that way, after i\u2019ve had my fun with him.\u201d</span> Ninetails said her eyes back down onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest under the paw, watching the entire interaction. So Ninetails is protecting you, it does seem that way as she shooed Chikorita away. Plus her paw, while on you was not hurting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNine?\u201d</span> She questioned, as you had your eyes opened due to suddenly being talked to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... hello?\u201d You say as she smiled down. Slowly but surely, the Pokemon brought it\u2019s head down to you, or more accurately it\u2019s nose. It came right for you and you let the nose not only poke your chest, but sniff you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNinetails.\u201d</span> She said, a grin on her mouth as she seems to like the way you smell. Which is really weird, cause you haven\u2019t taking a shower since yesterday morning. Before the events with Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she raised her paw off of you, as you feel fine at the moment. Slowly getting up, until finally, you feel something else coming for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of her tails, as it came for you and wrapped around you. You raised your arms as you feel a soft tail envelope you and soon enough grab you. Lifting you into the air and high above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Woah!\u201d You say as you feel the tail move, bringing you close to the Ninetail\u2019s smirk. Okay, so this Pokemon is playful, and seems to really like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she hasn\u2019t hurt you yet, and if anything is going out of it\u2019s way to not to. Also seems to be a bit of a tease, as she turned her head to Chikorita, the Pokemon pouting and angry in the corner as she wanted to have fun with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this Pokemon wasn\u2019t so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Careful Ninetails, just in case you... actually this feels pretty soft.\u201d You say feeling her tail as she smirked even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWell look at that, he likes me more already.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cNo he doesn\u2019t!\u201d </span>Chikorita said, as maybe she shouldn\u2019t of been so violent towards you. Now half mad about herself for doing it. That was a dumb move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Ninetails, she took her glance back to you and finally has decided what she was going to do with you and your small body.</span></div></div>",

Plus, she was very loyal to Leaf, so if Leaf gave specific orders not to let Chikorita play with you, then Chikorita herself wasn't going to lay a single paw on you until Ninetales wasn't called back to her Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling to herself, Chikorita turned away from Ninetales, a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales turned back to you, gave a soft cry of her name and fully removed her paw from before sitting in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks?\" you said, grateful but not still willing to let your guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Ninetales gave a soft, reassuring cry of her name, before you noted that her tails were wiggling behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before one of them extended towards you; now, you were no Pokemon Professor, but you had read that a Ninetales had a certain ability to place a curse on anyone stupid enough to touch their tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those tails were about to touch YOU right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek!\" you yelled, jumping back,<br>\r\n\"You're trying to curse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail stopped in mid-air for a second; the golden-furred Pokemon blinked twice, before she let out a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Don't be silly.</span></u>\" she barked, the tail resuming its descent towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped back once more, only to bump into a fluffy, warm wall; looking back, you noted that the wall you had bumped was just another one of the several tails of Ninetales, which you had just touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body froze up as terror settled it, but the Pokemon only laughed as she wrapped the same tail you bumped into around your body and lifted it off the ground, letting you lay on it as if it was a beanbag chair. A large beanbag chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh?\" you stammered, noticing that nothing was happening; if anything, you were just put somewhere a hundredfold comfier than the under-paw of Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">I just thought I'd give you a more comfortable place to lay on than the floor, sweetie,</span></u>\" she cooed, or rather purred, moving her tail around so that it looked like a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing, and resisted the urge to give the tail a hug. It was so smooth! It felt like laying on a warm cloud that was laying on top of another cloud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales smirked briefly - Chikorita was probably busy biting her leaf off at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Nine, Nine-tales,</span>\" she spoke, sounding just as soothing as her trainer was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost felt like going to sleep again, after Chikorita had woken you up so early in the morning; you nearly gave in to the temptation, but made a great effort to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more tails joined you, one landing on top of you and the other joining the one that was already under you, forming an ocean of fur you couldn't hope to swim out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... warm...\" you muttered, hypnotized by the warmth the Pokemon emitted and by the smoothness of her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales chuckled and glanced at Chikorita with a look that screamed triumphantly, 'He's mine'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chikoo!</span>\" the grass-type cried, annoyed, rushing towards Ninetales, who merely moved the remaining six tails to form a barrier that kept Chikorita from reaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Tut tut.</span></u>\" the Fox Pokemon said, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Nine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith  a groan, Chikorita once more walked away, a sour look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales simply smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, for some time, there was complete silence in the room, until Leaf came out of the bathroom, fully dressed and ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, seeing her two Pokemon and not you made the trainer look at Ninetales with a curious expression, only to offer a relived smile when the vulpine parted two of her tails, revealing you laying on the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, girl,\" Leaf said while leaning in to pick you with a hand, using the other to pet her Pokemon on top of her head and under her chin, causing her to growl happily in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Leaf called the Pokemon back in her Pokeball, not before she had given you one last smile though; then, the brunette headed over the bed, grabbed her bag and hat and put them on, instructing Chikorita to follow as she walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf eventually got back to the lobby of the Pokemon Center, where she paid her rent for the night to the Nurse before leaving; the sun of Olivine City showered both you, her and Chikorita, the sound of the tranquil sea filling the ears of the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice day,\" you commented, before looking down,<br>\r\n\"Perfect for a beach day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled not to think about Leaf wearing a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same Leaf just giggled to herself in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... where are you going next?\" you wondered, before letting out a sigh,<br>\r\n\"Or, I guess, where are WE going next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess brought two fingers to your back and began petting, much like she did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're going to...\"</span></div></div>",

Really close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither have I,\u201d She said, even though you two were close she was not really being loud. Showing how quiet she was use to. \u201cThe Gym Leader there i\u2019ve heard uses Normal Types. So I will be going there first. If we see Mew along the way, we of course will detour, however that\u2019s the plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell honestly, that\u2019s all I can hope for.\u201d You say wearing a smile back to her. She headed around and walked outside, her fingers covering you as she didn\u2019t want you to get seen in the Pokecenter. After handing the key back to Nurse Joy and getting all her things in order, she began to leave. She even recalled Chikorita, as a bit of punishment for playing with you before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left and walked away with you going through the door. It was going to take a day of travel. If she didn\u2019t get sidetracked she could make it before night, however as a Pokemon Trainer, sidetracks are very prominent. Walking back up to where Mew shrunk you, she plans to go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stuck in her fingers for a long while, as she made sure to not only hold you but make sure you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to the edge of the city, and as the number of people went down she started to pull you out. Pulling you out and placing you on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let you sit there as you could see the giant world above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, so we\u2019re finally going now.\u201d You say to her as she shifted her eye around and looked at you in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall.\u201d She warned as you appreciated. \u201cWe are, the Route for Goldenrod requires me to move through Ecruteak City, and then down to Goldenrod.\u201d She said giving you the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, I guess i\u2019ll be on the lookout for Mew.\u201d You say to her, as she can\u2019t help but frown a bit. She doesn\u2019t see this legendary showing us as even a real chance. Still you were being hopeful, which of course was a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked for a little bit more you commented. \u201cHey, that\u2019s where I got shrunk.\u201d You say pointing to the place you were sleeping. \u201cCan we check it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf looked at you, seeing it as a little detour. She listened and she got moving, heading over. \u201cWhy would you just sleep in the wild?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s near the city, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. I know, i\u2019m pretty stupid.\u201d You say as she can\u2019t argue about it. Moving and going away, she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, let\u2019s just keep going. I want to get to Goldenrod before dark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go with her because... well you don\u2019t really have a choice in the matter. She was taking you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two walk for a little bit more in silence, until you had to speak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo uh... how are you planning on facing the Gym Leader?\u201d You say to her, figuring you should start up at a type of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a normal gym and I don\u2019t have any fighting Pokemon on my team, so of course using type advantage won\u2019t work. She will want to use her strongest Pokemon considering how many badges i\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer name is Whitney.\u201d She said as you try to recall any info about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah her... i\u2019ve think i\u2019ve heard her in passing. She\u2019s the Goldenrod one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Leaf said about to show you that she has done her research. \u201cThere has been a lot of stories about her stubborn and childish she is, so that could be annoying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d You say thinking about a girl described as that. Would be more than trouble for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for strategy, I will just bring in my strong Pokemon and overpower her. Although her Milktank could be trouble. Blastoise should be able to outlast that Milktank though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight... Blastoise. I saw it the other day, was it your first Pokemon?\u201d You question as she did get a smile about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was my first one, back when he was just a Squirtle. He\u2019s grown with me, and I wouldn\u2019t have most of my badges without him.\u201d Leaf said with a smile as you can\u2019t help but wear a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now I know three of your Pokemon. Speaking of which... your Chikorita, I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s only like that because she likes you.\u201d Leaf said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, After this punishment i\u2019m sure she will be more careful with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That\u2019s good I guess.\u201d You say back to her with a smile. Now far into the route connecting the two cities you ask her more. \u201cSo what other Pokemon do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually have a lot more, to the point where my PC is pretty full.\u201d Leaf said with a smile. \u201cI have a Sandshrew, a Pigeot, A Ditto, A Doduo-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what Pokemon do you have on you?\u201d You question even more just wanting to know. She looked at you for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have only four on me, just in case I need to catch some more. There is Chikorita, Blastoise, Ninetails and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t finish that, as you both heard a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head, while you got a bit scared and hugged her neck. A little bit frightened, but given your size it made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What was that?\u201d You question just wanting to be sure. Moving your eye around and looking over to Leaf. She was prepared, grabbing her Pokeball and ready to toss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be a trainer looking for a battle, it could be a Wild Pokemon she could honestly catch. Regardless, she was going to show you her fourth Pokemon she was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked to the sound, she saw that it was ____________</span></div></div>",

Judging by the way he was dressed, he appeared to be one of those bug-catchers she couldn't get enough of beating back in Kanto, and even here in Johto, they kept 'bugging' her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf giggled at her own lame joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you! My Pokemon evolved just recently, so let's have a battle and put it to the test!\" the other trainer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Leaf's shoulder, you shot the guy a bothered look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we even care?\" you whispered to Leaf, who giggled,<br>\r\n\"Just walk away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet you, and watch.\" Leaf replied, so quietly that the bug-catcher heard nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess shot the trainer in front of her a confident smile and held her Pokeball up, accepting the challenge; the bug-catcher grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" he shouted, holding out a Pokeball as well, <br>\r\n\"Then let's begin with this, Metapod!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the Pokeball was tossed, a shell-covered green Pokemon popped out, causing Leaf to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese guys really had a one-sided mind, and Metapod was their trademark Pokemon; the only worse people were those fishermen trying to take her on with their team consisting solely of Magikarp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the Pokeball she was holding, Leaf pondered something for a moment, before putting it back, deciding to show off later. Instead, she grabbed a second Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninetales.\" she called, tossing her Pokeball, letting the majestic, nine-tailed fox come out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">What, do I have to play the babysitter again?</span></u>\" she cried, before looking in front of her, noticing some guy with a Metapod; much like her trainer, Ninetales sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was even worse than babysitting Chikorita!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, Ninetales turned to shoot Leaf a glare, but spotted you on her shoulder and the frown instantly turned into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Okay, guess I'm doing this...</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have the first move!\" the bug-catcher spoke confidently, leading you to wonder if he was even aware that his Metapod not only had a huge type disadvantage, but was facing a fully evolved Pokemon as well; that, and Metapod commonly knew only how to use Harden, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninetales, Flamethrower.\" Leaf commanded, interrupting your thoughts as you focused on the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales did as told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was pretty predictable... only it wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metapod, use String Shot!\" the trainer ordered; his Pokemon instantly shot a thick string from its mouth... only it wasn't aiming at its opponent, but rather aimed at a nearby branch. The string stuck to it, causing Metapod to literally fly away, dodging the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, surprised. Could String Shot even be used like that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Metapod, use Harden and attack!\" the bug-catcher commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf huffed. Harden, to attack? Come on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the giantess was shocked when Metapod followed the order, hardening its shell, before using the momentum of String Shot to fling itself at Ninetales, who hastily jumped back as the other Pokemon smashed the ground with a steel-hard shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf was surprised, and so were you, but your giant caretaker soon smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A combination of Harden and String Shot to use a defensive move as an attack... clever.\" Leaf commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the bug-catchers she had faced so far were as dumb as their Metapods' shells were hard, but this one made the exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be interesting, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle between Ninetales and Metapod continued only for a bit longer, before the vixen finally managed to hit the opponent, knocking it out with one, super-effective blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was a Parasect, who put up more than a fight that Metapod did, and even managed to paralyze Ninetales with Stun Spore, but in the end, it was no match for the much more experienced fire-type commanded by Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left the bug-catcher only with one Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here comes my ace! Venomoth!\" he called out as he threw his last Pokeball, letting out a large, purple-grey moth with huge eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf hesitated for a moment, then held Ninetales' Pokeball up and called her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's paralyzed, so I'll let her rest,\" she whispered to you, before holding out another Pokeball,<br>\r\n\"Now, remember my fourth Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragonite.\" Leaf spoke, throwing her Pok- did she just say 'Dragonite'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes glued to the sphere, you watched as it opened and out came a yellow dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were bewildered, Dragonite were so rare to find that people believed they didn't exist! How did Leaf manage to catch such a powerful beast...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the bug-catcher seemed as surprised as you were, but didn't give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Venomoth, use-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extreme Speed.\" Leaf ordered; Dragonite flew towards its opponent, so fast that it practically disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenomoth didn't know what hit it when he was sent flying and crashed into a tree, getting knocked out in one attack; by the time the bug-catcher looked back at Leaf, she was already calling back a very satisfied-looking Dragonite back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're so powerful! I didn't stand a chance!\" Leaf's has-been opponent stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf simply smiled and turned around, wordlessly waving as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're so powerful! I wouldn't stand a chance!\" you stuttered once Leaf put some distance between her and her ex-opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush. Bug-types aren't that powerful, but they are pretty bothersome, as you saw with Ninetales... who I'm going to have to heal once we get to Goldenrod.\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to know what you're doing very well...\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am the third most Powerful trainer in Kanto, so I'd say so.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very modest, are you?\" you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf brought a hand to you and poked you in the middle of the chest in response, knocking the air out of your lungs and nearly causing you to fall off of her shoulder; luckily, you were quick enough to grab onto a strand of hair and pulled yourself back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What was that for!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf stuck her tongue out in response and kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, hoping you weren't going to meet anymore trainers... and that you weren't going to face anymore surprises from Leaf along the way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Leaf honestly destroyed that Pokemon Trainer with no care, she went on with her journey. She began to move for a long time, as you two chat. So she had a Dragonite. Apparently she caught her in the Safari when she was just a Dratini, and trained her up to a powerful Pokemon. To say she was impressed about it would be an understatement. This Pokemon not only had high stats, it took to a Pokemon battle like it was bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, seems like you lucked out. I mean, can you even beat a Dragonite?\u201d You question her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only lost twice. Once when I was using my Blastoise in a test match. He skilfully defeated her. To say she was angry about that would be an understatement. On the other side, it was a Tyranitar.\u201d She said as you listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, a Tyranitar bet it?\u201d You say back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the oddest thing to me. There was this trainer, a couple of years younger then me and with red hair. Said his name was Silver. He confronted me, and both of us fought for a long time. I won the battle, but his Pokemon were so much stronger than I thought it was. Not to mention, the way he faced me... it was almost like he had a vendetta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, glad I ended up with you rather than him.\u201d You say with a smile. \u201cAlso, when it comes to Pokemon, you\u2019re really passionate. You talk so much more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I?\u201d She questioned as she moved on, almost like it was some kind of joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cHop.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cHop Hop.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cPip! pip! Hoppip!\u201d</span> A sound said as you paid attention. Turning your head and looking at a herd of Hoppips. The Pink Pokemon all in a bunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey look at that, a Bunch of Hoppip\u2019s.\u201d You say to her, however one faint look at her and she just kept on looking. Getting you to question. \u201cWhat not going to catch it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are not really interesting to me. I want to catch Pokemon I like, not the ones I don\u2019t.\u201d She said as you guess you could understand that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell can\u2019t argue there. Still, personally I really liked them.\u201d You say to her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe you should of caught one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a while and laugh. \u201cYeah, and carry around a beach ball size Pokeball. I\u2019ve never actually caught a Pokemon before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you will, on this journey of yours.\u201d She said with a smile, as you did give that a long think. Maybe you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally here, not much trouble it seems.\u201d She said with a smile. Despite that admittedly courageous trainer, it has been smooth sailing to Goldenrod. Smiling as she walked around, to the inner city as she looked around. Now while she could go over and face the gym right now, she does decide not to do that. There was about... an hour and a half of sunlight, and there was a couple of places she wanted to go to. Not to mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeaf... i\u2019m hungry.\u201d You whine to her, as you really have not eaten anything all day. She wasn\u2019t exactly the one to carry food with her, well human food that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the city she moved you around and held in her palm. You two discussed this and came to the conclusion it was the best way. Her fingers up to stop your sight from most people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am too, but i\u2019m not complaining about it.\u201d She said simply. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some food, but after that there are a couple of spots I want to check out. Apparently there is a day care on the outskirts, not to mention a Bike Shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Bike Shop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiding a Bike would of cut that trip time in third, i\u2019ve been meaning to get one my last one broke.\u201d She said as you gave her a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do buy one, can you buy one with a basket so I can ride up there.\u201d Despite her not showing it, Leaf found this idea to be super cute. She was so going to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst food though, and where was she going. Not to be a girl too stubborn, she moved around and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to a civilian. An old lady in fact. \u201cHi, i\u2019m just a trainer who was visiting. I was wondering, if you can tell me where the best place to eat will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello dear,\u201d The woman said, as you hide behind the not threatening girl\u2019s fingers. \u201cWell there is this delightful sweet shop not too far from here, down that street. If you and your little boyfriend wants to go to eat somewhere, I would say there. Hi there sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so she\u2019s waving you and that means spotted you. You peek your head out at the old woman and wave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a giant smile as she just left, and you had to comment. \u201cShe seemed worryingly too relaxed about seeing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(She\u2019s the Daycare Woman by the way)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf moved on and followed her instructions, walking down the street as she kept her eye out. It was really easy to spot it and she wore a smile. She was hungry just like you, so she was going to look forward to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked a couple of steps closer, when she suddenly stopped. There was a lot of people in there, so maybe she should hide you better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if you were going to be this small for a while, you were going to have to get use to being in a crowd of giant people. She did the polite thing and looked down to you, giving you the question there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to hide, or be out in the open?\u201d She questioned. You paused for a couple of seconds as you look at her. Really giving it another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think _________\u201d</span></div></div>",

I just happened to notice your little boyfriend, why is he so small, how is it possible, he's very cute, I'm almost kind of jealous-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl kept speaking, you saw Leaf blushing as the pink-head mentioned that you were her boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, seeing as Leaf was saying nothing, you spoke up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss,\" you said, raising your voice a little, getting her to stop to look at you,<br>\r\n\"I'm so small because of a Pokemon... and we're not dating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means you're available!\" she exclaimed, leaning in so close that Leaf had to take three steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who're you?\" she asked, shooting a wary look<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stopped for a moment, blushed, then began rubbing the back of her head in a flustered manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I'm sorry, I got really excited!\" she apologized.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell about that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, you got the chance to take a good look at her; she was wearing a white and pink shirt and shorts upon striped socks fitted into a pair of sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Whitney, by the way.\" 'Whitney' finally introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... 'Whitney'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Leaf exchanged a look, before she turned to the pink-headed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the gym leader here, by any chance?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yup! That would be me!\" she said in a cheerful tone, before offering a knowing smile,<br>\r\n\"Why, do you want to take on my gym?\" she asked, her eyes then fixing on you as she winked,<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like I c-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be your challenger.\" Leaf quietly stepped in and, for a moment, Whitney's gaze and hers met in a competitive manner... right before Leaf's tummy loudly reminded her that she had other plans before the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... right after we catch some lunch.\" Leaf muttered with a blush; your own stomach grumbled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case...\" she said, grabbing Leaf by the hand, starting to drag her back to the shop, catching Leaf by surprise, <br>\r\n\"I'll be happy to treat both you and your little friend to lunch! I wouldn't want you taking me on on an empty stomach, hehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Leaf could reply, she realized that nothing was going to stop Whitney and quietly grabbed her hat, moving it over to her shoulder, muttering,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump in. I'll save something for you, promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think twice and did as told, understanding that Leaf meant to hide you so you had no more unwanted attention; once you landed, Leaf put her hat back on as she was dragged back into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, both trainers walked back to the Goldenrod Gym; along the way, Leaf let you out of your 'safe spot' to let you eat whatever she had gotten for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the two giantesses you were with were having a conversation, though you were far more focused on filling your stomach than listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me,\" Whitney was saying,<br>\r\n\"How many badges do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have six.\" Leaf replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, you must be super tough! I'll have to use my best Pokemon to defeat you! Hehehe!\" the gym leader replied excitedly, thrilled by the idea of an actual challenge; she usually beat her opponents rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney and Leaf eventually arrived to the gym, where the former, smirking confidently, headed straight for the battlefield; Leaf followed quietly, standing on her end of the field while the pink-haired gym leader stood on the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney wore a smirk of determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's get started straightaway! You don't need me telling you the rules, do you?\" she asked, holding a Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf shook her head, then grabbed her own Pokeball; the two trainers then tossed their spheres in the air, officially starting the match.</span></div></div>",

You wear a smile seeing her once again, although you were glad you were not near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Whitney, she tossed out her Pokeball and out came Girafarig.

You could see Chikorita really try and beat the Pokemon. A Razor Leaf as well as Vine Whips. Neither of them were going to work, as Girafarig held the Pokemon in place with Psychic, and hit it with a Shadow Ball!

Leaf responded with tossing her own Pokeball, as down came Ninetails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon ready to fight, and when it looked at you, she was going to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the battle continued again from the loud girl and the quiet girl. The fight lasted for a long while, as both of them were high level although Ninetails clearly had the advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the way she was moving, just elegantly dodging around and avoiding it. The way she moved was... memorising in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it took a good Will O Wisp, Flamethrower combination to get it. The Pokemon got hit hard, and it fell back. After a few more, the Pokemon was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetails turned back to you two, and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI hope that impressed you.\u201d</span> She said, doing what Chikorita tried. That could prove troublesome for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Just because you bet one, don\u2019t get cocky! Here comes Clefable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new Pokemon came down and landed in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\u201cClef!\u201d</span> It said ready for battle. Seeming like a giant pillow to you. You actually enjoy watching this as it started. Leaf giving out quiet commands, Whitney giving loud commands. It would seem they were quite different, still got along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Clefable against Ninetails, it was a lot closer. Ninetails was a bit hurt from her bout with Girafarig, but she was willing to go. The Clefable had a lot of moves though. Light Screen to stop Flamethrower, Will O Wisp couldn\u2019t get a good hit in and none of her other moves worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Clefable had a good Thunder and although Ninetails dodged a lot, one hit that happened really hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t good, she can\u2019t take another!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf didn\u2019t waver though, as she made sure to use her Pokemon\u2019s talented movement to not only avoid, but get her hits in. When the Will O Wisp was hit, she started to make good moves. Light Screen didn\u2019t work on every side, and with the amount of time she moved around Clefable was a sitting Ducklett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem it finally ended. Another well placed Flamethrower to send the Pokemon down. However Clefable got one move as well, a powerful Thunder Wave that left the Pokemon stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo although Whitney is down one Pokemon, Ninetails couldn\u2019t survive. Still she came back and wore a smile on her face. Twitching because of the Thunder Wave. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cO-Once again. I co-ome out-t Vict-toriu-us.\u201d </span>She said as she was not ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinetails return.\u201d Leaf said bringing her Pokemon back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got to get rid of this last one and Ninetails will be easy pickings! Come on out Milktank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant cow did just that, dropping right into the middle as it flexed.<span class=\"cpink\"> \u201cMilk!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the ace. You gotta be careful.\u201d You look to Leaf\u2019s face as she had a serious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ace is better.\u201d And with that, she brought her ball and tossed it down. Tossing it down onto the field as you see her giant and large Blastoise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy.\u201d You had to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBlast!\u201d</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy win!\u201d She said, as they both started to act. Blastoise going in as well as Milktank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know who was going to win. You could see that Milktank was getting the advantage though. Both took good hits, but with Stomp and Milk Drink, Milktank got the better out of the two. Blastoise also had more range moves such as Hydro Pump. He\u2019s ace not being able to be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilktank healed and Blastoise got hurt. \u201cLeaf, what are we going to do!?\u201d You question wanting to know. Looking to the side and seeing the giant Pokemon trainer that was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she was confident, waiting and biding her time. You don\u2019t know what, but as it turns out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s start the Rollout!\u201d Whitney said to her Pokemon as it rolled and started going to Blastoise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow! Blastoise Skull Bash!\u201d Leaf yelled, passionate about the fight. Both of them go together, hitting hard as it made you freak out. Like two cannons firing into each other. Blastoise pushed the Pokemon back making it fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Hey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Milktank is locked in that move. While it does get stronger, so can Blastoise. Withdraw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon did just that, sharpening it\u2019s defence as Milktank came once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney was stuck in a loop, and the Blastoise won. A couple more conflicts of hits, and Milktank stop spinning, out of the fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing! We won!\u201d You say as you see the Blastoise smile about it as well. Leaf was of course glad she won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney on the other hand though ____________</span></div></div>",

Bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, whenever trainers came to her gym, she would beat them in a matter of minutes; of course though, sometimes an exceptionally skilled trainer would come and they managed to beat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just so... frustrating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nhh... it's not fair!\" she complained at the top of her lungs,<br>\r\n\"It's unfair! That's what it is! I was supposed to win, not you! Ahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Leaf exchanged an awkward look. The giantess sure wasn't kidding when she said Whitney was childish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the same Whitney, she wasn't going to accept defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending a glare in Leaf's direction, she decided she wasn't going to allow this. She was still the gym leader, after all, and as such she had the right to demand a rematch, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when her gaze casually shifted on you as Leaf returned her Blastoise, Whitney obtained a wide smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps not a traditional rematach, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, putting on a solemn expression, Whitney cleared her throat and approached her former opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-hem,\" she said in a cutesy voice,<br>\r\n\"You did well, challenger, you truly showed your immense skills as a Pokemon trainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-!\" Whitney said, pausing to give some dramatic tone to what she was going to say next,<br>\r\n\"I'm not giving my gym badge yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf's smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you exclaimed, indignant, jumping on your feet on her shoulder, <br>\r\n\"She beat you fair and square, you've got to give her your badge! Those are the rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney glared in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, quiet you! It's my gym, I make the rules!\" Whitney retorted, her childish self returning with great strength; then, adopting a solemn expression once more, Whitney placed her arms behind her back,<br>\r\n\"Leaf did a decent job beating me. However, there was two of you here, so the  challenge is incomplete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Two of you'...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the only person aside from Leaf was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Me?\" you spoke, incredulous. Even Leaf looked surprised,<br>\r\n\"I was just a spectator! What have I got to do with any of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney smirked mischievously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll find you have something to do, and that's taking me on yourself!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Leaf quietly said,<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you exclaimed in a much louder tone, though your stature didn't make your voice much louder than Leaf's,<br>\r\n\"I have no Pokemon! How am I supposed to do that?\" you asked, growing more irritated with this brat of a gym leader by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't talking about a Pokemon battle, you dummy.\" Whitney giggled in an admittedly cute manner that made Leaf groan on the inside,<br>\r\n\"You're taking me on in person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am! Don't worry, it'll be a simple game... well, simpler for me.\" Whitney said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Leaf, who just shrugged, nearly causing you to fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be...?\" you wondered, not believing you were really going through with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and you get on the opposite side of the field and I'll place you down; your job is to run all the way back here while I try to catch you. Simple, right?\" Whitney explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, simple... if you were normal-sized! Like this, it was like you had to run across two football fields at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you weren't opposing, and neither was Leaf, Whitney continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win, your friend gets the badge,\" she said, holding her badge out; then, she sent a smirk your way,<br>\r\n\"But if I win, I get something too... you!\" she squealed like a schoolgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Were gym leaders supposed to make demands? This was really, really getting on your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you looked at Leaf for consultation, discovering that she was staring back at you with an expression between one of determination and one of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice was up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could simply decline, but... Leaf had helped you, so you guessed it was your moment to pay your debt to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" you sighed massively,<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, Whitney squealed, while Leaf wore a small smile on her face; one of her hands then traveled to you as she picked you off of her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Win.\" she whispered to you,<br>\r\n\"For both me and you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in response as you were handed to Whitney, who began walking to the opposite side of her gym, giggling in a girlish manner along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you laughing at?\" you questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Whitney shot you a wolfish grin,<br>\r\n\"Just thinking of all the fun we're going to have together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now you officially had to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Whitney finally reached the other end of the field, she did a silly pirouette and faced Leaf; then, as promised, she bent to let you down beside her running shoes, before she rose slightly, hands on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll give you a - heh - small headstart. You have five seconds to get as far as you can before I come after you, and be warned that I'm not going to lose!\" she said, rising back to her impressive, full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she rose the five fingers of her left hand; getting the hint, you sprinted away, hearing Whitney's giggle as her thumb went down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after another, her fingers went down, with the pink-haired gym leader singing a countdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One.\" she chirped, wasting no more time as she began running after you, who hadn't even cleared a quarter of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing booming footsteps behind you, you sped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was when your 'challenge' began.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a tough game, one that was pretty much designed to make sure you can\u2019t win. You are suppose to run away from a girl, who can easily not only stay on your tail, but grab you. She has every advantage in this situation and you had none. As you run you could feel her footsteps behind, moving right after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not going to win this. You got to try though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, look at you go. You are so cute when you run!\u201d Whitney said with a giggle as she caught up to you, but just to toy with you she didn\u2019t reach down yet. Her hands behind her back as she happily strolls. \u201cWhen I get you, I can get like a Ratatta ball for you! It would look so adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore the voice above and just keep running. So she simply just kept talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you are gonna love your new life with me. I will be super nice to you, I will let you sleep with me, and i\u2019ll feed you sweets for breakfast and carry you around with me. Maybe in like a pocket, oh this pocket!\u201d She said pointing to the pocket next to her chest. \u201cYou would look like super adorable there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore her giant teasing words and just get running. You were barely one third of the way, and you could see Leaf with a worried expression. This was not looking good for her badge, or for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, time to win now!\u201d She said confidently as she bent her giant body. Her fingers coming for you as Leaf held her breath. Was this going to be the end of it. That Gym battle was over, will she lose like that? She can challenge Whitney again, but you are gonna lose your freedom! Your life will belong to this pink haired gym leader! No choice of getting Mew. She closed her eyes though, a little bit scared. However once she heard no reaction she opened them up, seeing you... still running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney a bit confused as well. \u201cH-Hey, get here!\u201d She yelled as she brought her fingers to you, only for you to jump over it like a hurdle running once again. \u201cWhat the hay, he\u2019s faster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf looked as well, seeing you were sprinting with your speed. It made no sense, you should be caught. She narrowed her eyes trying to get a better look at your face. Tired yes, but determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, well it was a mix of determination and adrenaline. You will make this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop running!\u201d Whitney said as she reached for you, her fingers grabbing you but you quickly slip your way out of it. Whitney getting nothing as you run out of her reach. \u201cAre you kidding me, stop it!\u201d Whitney whined as she moved around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to stop this, so she moved around and put her foot at the halfway mark. Stomping her shoe knowing you won\u2019t be able to run through it. Then she can just grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however moved and climbed over it, almost not stopping your momentum as she was left confused about it. She did not know why you were able to do this so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost to Leaf, she will not lose to you. With a bit of an angry scream, she went to grab you. Only for you to get more determination and run even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You can do it! We can win this!\u201d Leaf yelled above as you see the towering girl. She was so far, but with her cheering you on, you can do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much Whitney went to grab you, you dodged left and right. Strafing out of her reach. The one time she seemed to be able to get you, you quickly stopped and ran back. Running between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d She questioned seeing you go behind and turning around. However when she did that you did a turn once again, going back to Leaf as you confused Whitney for a second. When she realised you were running the right way again, you did get some good distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That\u2019s no fair!\u201d She whined as she moved ahead. If she can\u2019t stop you, she will block you. She moved ahead of you and dropped her body. Just laying down as she smirked at you. No way you were gonna get past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s got it all. You have to climb her in order to get past, and she can grab you then. If you try to go above her head, she can get you there. She\u2019s got you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw this... and turned down. Simple as that as you ran by her feet. Running past it as she panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! Don\u2019t!\u201d She yelled as she actually attempted to stomp on you! You move around though, and now you were on the homestretch to Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf crouching down with her hands reaching for you, as well as Whitney chasing you aiming to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sprint with all your heart. Until you feel fingers wrap around you. You heart beat stops for a second as you try to figure out who\u2019s fingers these were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get pulled forward, right into a hugging chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did it, you actually did it.\u201d Leaf said as you look up to her. Smiling as you did it. Leaf was beyond happy about this as she held you tight. When she pulled out, she let you rest on her palm, and you needed a very good rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have my Pokemon, and you to thank for this gym badge.\u201d She said with a smile. She doesn\u2019t expect a response, from all the running you ended up doing it is fair for you to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... lost.\u201d Whitney said. Leaf looked ahead at the gym leader, and dropped onto her knees. When suddenly tears began to pour. \u201cWhahhhh!!!\u201d She said, crying like a baby. Throwing Leaf off. never did she expect a gym leader to act like this?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaf shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Can't we just leave and come back later? Who knows, maybe she'll be better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and ready to make another challenge.\" Leaf commented, looking at you,<br>\r\n\"Not happening, pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, then looked back at Whitney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then something tells me we're gonna be here for quite some time...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not staying here five minutes longer.\" she declared, admittedly sick of Whitney's attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf mentally swore to herself that, once she got out of this gym, she would never ask its leader for a rematch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, gently placing you back on top of her shoulder, Leaf strolled towards Whitney, who was busily rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" Leaf began, only to be targeted by a fiery glare sent from the pink-haired gym leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What more do you want? Isn't it enough that you've beaten me twice, y-you-you-you... you meanies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh, what a drama queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf remained deadpan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney didn't reply, but shot another glare. Clearly, she wasn't in the mood for being asked her badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, just what is wro-\" you tried to speak, but were interrupted when Leaf drove her finger into your chest, poking and silencing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the giantess got on her knees as well and placed a hand on Whitney's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she hated to do it, Leaf knew she had to comfort her former opponent, or she was never going to get out with the badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, before I came here, I was told that you were an exceptionally strong leader, and you really are,\" she said with that quiet voice of hers, a voice that you learned only ever rose whenever Leaf got really passionate about something,<br>\r\n\"But you can't always win. Sometimes you'll lose, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leaf spoke soothingly, realization hit you - did the admittedly pretty gym leader act like this with every trainer that beat her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says you!\" she exclaimed, pointing a finger to Leaf, <br>\r\n\"You just got lucky! I'd have completely trashed you if you weren't so lucky! It's so unfair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was probably a bit lucky,\" Leaf admitted,<br>\r\n\"And my friend here was probably even luckier than I was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you grumbled, before muttering,<br>\r\n\"That's the thanks I get for helping... I'll mind my own business next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Because you're a great trainer, but no one can always win. It's how life works. You just got to keep trying and show life that a few losses can't keep you down. That's the kind of person a trainer as strong as you is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney, who had remained silent, looked away; you were still a bit annoyed by Leaf's earlier comment about your luck, but were also shocked to hear her speech. It was the kind of speech a big sister would give, sweet and encouraging at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a side of Leaf you had not seen so far, a side far from the teasing one she showed when you were around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Leaf offered her hand with a smile; Whitney blushed, realizing the tantrum she had thrown over no reason. But, she couldn't help it. She hated losing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, she accepted Leaf's hand and the two stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...\" Whitney admitted, accurately averting Leaf's gaze,<br>\r\n\"You're a super strong trainer, and your friend over there is quite a runner...\" she praised, winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, wondering how could she be back to teasing already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, since you... defeated... me twice, you can have the Plain Badge.\" Whitney finished, digging in a pocket, picking out her badge, placing it on Leaf's awaiting hand; with a smile, your caretaker promptly put it away lest Whitney changed her mind and whispered,<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Leaf turned around and began heading out, her hand rising as she waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Whitney didn't respond, but shot you a glance and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fun she would have had with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" you yelled one you were outside, away from the moody gym leader,<br>\r\n\"I was starting to think we were going to spend the night in her gym!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too pessimistic.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Said miss 'I'm not staying here five minutes longer'.\" you retorted playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf gained a blush and didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, what are we doing next?\" you asked,<br>\r\n\"You mentioned you wanted to get a back, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf's eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right.\" she said,<br>\r\n\"But I also need to head to the Pokemon Center to have my team healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, after that, do you think we could stick around, at least for a bit?\" you asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't gotten out of Olivine City much, so you were pleasantly surprised to see new places, even if in a dire situation such as yours,<br>\r\n\"It's pretty here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I want to get my last badge soon.\" she said,<br>\r\n\"And then we can focus on finding Mew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon. We can just take a walk around and then we can leave,\" you suggested, though your mind was screaming you that finding Mew was a priority; you shushed the voice. Being this small couldn't keep you from having some fun, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf looked at you and pondered the suggestion. </span></div></div>",

Get a bike, checkout the daycare!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Plus, we really should be inside tonight rather than camp outside.\u201d You say to her as she gave you a confused look. \u201cB-Because it would be much safer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not in danger.\u201d She said to you. \u201cAnd if we get attacked by Pokemon, I can fend them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but... you know.\u201d You say to her as truly she didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t fully piece together what you were trying to insinuate, until she thought about it some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second, you have camped outside before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, If I got to say it, no! I have never done that, not even once.\u201d You say defending yourself. Truthfully, she was a bit thrown off about it, but she still wore a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, but we are gonna do it tomorrow night. It\u2019s a long trip to the next city.\u201d She said with a smile, moving around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, who knows, we might find Mew!\u201d You say joking about it, as she was looking at you a bit sad. That plan of yours is still there, and she was hoping you were going to be over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored it and moved ahead, going to the centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I out now?\u201d You question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, i\u2019ll tell you when.\u201d She said walking to her room. You being thrown around inside of her bag hitting her Pokeballs, her berries and pretty much everything you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can come out.\u201d She said finally, pulling you out as you get grabbed. Brought right to her face as you see a room, much like the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this the same Pokecenter in Olivine City?\u201d You joke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll Pokemon centres are the same, region based at least. I heard that they switch them up every now and then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s unique.\u201d You say to her as she couldn\u2019t help but smile a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think that\u2019s unique, you should of seen this Nurse Joy. Just like the other one.\u201d She joked moving over to her bed. \u201cMy Pokemon are healed though, and I think it\u2019s fair that they can come out. I even got the extended suite for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head around, seeing the giant extension made for Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, wait does that mean i\u2019m going to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee my Pokemon again, yes. Don\u2019t worry you are going to be safe with Ninetails, and Chikorita does feel bad.\u201d She said as you were glad hearing that. \u201cPlus, as a reward they can see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight... what about the other two?\u201d You question just wanting to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Dragonite has to stay, the next gym is Dragon but I do think I am going to switch out Blastoise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwitch him out? Why? That Pokemon won you the last match.\u201d You say to her as she smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did, but I can\u2019t keep relying on that. I\u2019ve had him fight in every gym. I need to switch it up. Even at the cost of a lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right. Well who you are going to get?\u201d You question Leaf interested as she dropped you onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard that she uses five Pokemon, and considering this is the last badge for me in this region, maybe even six. So I am going to get three more my reserves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, which ones are they?\u201d You say as she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a Dewgong, she\u2019s pretty powerful and an Ice Type would be powerful against her dragons.\u201d Leaf said as she gave it some real thought about it. Really glad as she was going to continue. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that she has a Kingdra. A Flaaffy might be able to face that Pokemon, although I am going to have to train that Flaffy. As for the last one, well I haven\u2019t decided. I\u2019m going to the PC right now to transfer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d You say with a smile as you were optimistic about her life. That was not going to remain, cause she smiled on her face going around. She went over and grabbed her Pokeballs, and your excitement went to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on out you three!\u201d She said tossing it. Right down to the ground as you see all three come. The Leaf starter, the fox Pokemon and the giant dragon. All three of them into the extended area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay you three!\u201d Leaf said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get the rest of the team, you just stay here and he\u2019s in charge!\u201d She said pointing right at you on the bed. All three of the Pokemon looking at you, two of them smiling and you were unsure of Dragonite. That\u2019s the only Pokemon you have not really met. If you were being honest you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, just give away my position. That\u2019s exciting.\u201d You say to her as she laughs about it finding it more than just a bit funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, they won\u2019t hurt you. I\u2019ll be back soon with more Pokemon.\u201d And with that she left. Truth be told you thought that three were more than enough but you didn\u2019t choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to all three of them backing up and unsure of what you are going to do. \u201cH-Hey. Good job today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cOh, coming back aren\u2019t you.\u201d</span> Ninetails said. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cIt\u2019s like you can\u2019t keep away from me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNo fair, you had him last time! It\u2019s my turn to have him!\u201d</span></span> Chikorita complained as the giant Dragon spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cWho is he? Why is he so small?\u201d</span> It tilted it\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh right, you haven\u2019t met him yet. He\u2019s been staying with Leaf since the last gym! Mew shrunk him!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAnd now he is here for us. You two best not get involved in the matter. I want him alone with me.\u201d</span> Ninetails as all three of them get interested about it.</span></div></div>",

After all, the golden fox had been gentle to you in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ninetales...\" you saluted; in response, the vixen leaned in and, crying her name softly, she placed her head into your lap... or, at least, she tried, because when she did, you were pushed on your back with the head of a giant Pokemon laying atop your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon giantess giggled softly. She didn't mind that position and, judging from your lack of movement, you either didn't as well or you couldn't move, both of which made the vixen quite happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike another Pokemon in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl, Chikorita left a still confused Dragonite behind and rushed to the vixen who, much like she had done earlier, formed a barrier by merely raising her tails, blocking the younger Pokemon entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Sorry darling, losers weepers. </span></u>\" Ninetales mocked playfully, referring to Chikorita's earlier defeat against a certain Girafarig; with even more tails to deal with than the last time, Chikorita let out a frustrated growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">C-Chikoo!</span>\" she complained as, each move she made, Ninetales shifted her tails, blocking any attempt of Chikorita's to at least catch a glimpse of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you were being nuzzled by a huge fox and noticed nothing, although, even if you did notice, you would have probably done nothing anyway; Chikorita still had a long way to go to regain your trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales kept cuddling you for some more time while keeping Chikorita away; then, a mischievous idea popped in the head of the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Dragonite hadn't met you yet, and she was just 'keeping you safe from Chikorita'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, leaning in to you after briefly rising her head, Ninetales whispered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Sorry sweetie, our time is up. </span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one of her tails departed from the others, allowing Chikorita to get past the barrier; however, the same tail slid under you and rose you up before the green Pokemon could swipe you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Hey, Dragonite,</span></u>\" Ninetales called to the third Pokemon that was in the room, who hadn't made a move since she found out about you; she would have liked to play with you as well, but she was pretty big and feared she would hurt you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was one of the times she regretted evolving from Dragonair, back when she had a slim, elegant and beautiful figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales' snapped her out of the world of memories,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cyellow\">Catch.</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clkhaki\">Huh?</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment was very fast, and yet seemingly endless to you; Ninetales suddenly flipped her tail, which acted as a catapult and tossed you towards Dragonite, so fast that you nearly didn't notice when the dragon caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally recovered from the overwhelming nausea, you noted that you were sitting on a somewhat rough surface and slowly looked up, noticing the Dragonite from before smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart missed a beat: this beast was so immense compared to you that you feared a single squeeze of her claws would end you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she didn't seem to be harboring any malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clkhaki\">Dra.</span>\" she said, 'Hello'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi, Dragonite...\" you replied, before hastily crying,<br>\r\n\"Be careful, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite smiled gently and moved a claw over your back, beginning to stroke you as gently as she could, trying to reassure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, you've introduced yourselves, now give him here!</span></u>\" Chikorita cried, now running to Dragonite, not immediately realizing the huge size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite shot a glance in Ninetales' direction, discovering her staring with a smirk; returning the smirk, Dragonite looked down at Chikorita, who had gripped on of the dragon's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Dragonite lazily flapped her wings and began fluttering, with a now agitated Chikorita fighting not to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">D-Dragonite!</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite only smiled, then looked at you and... tossed you. High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could scream, Dragonite did a quick spin in mid-air and threw off Chikorita as well, tossing her up too, before the dragon caught the two of you on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite then began flying around with her 'passengers' on her back; it felt thrilling, like a rollercoaster ride, though you would have enjoyed it more if you weren't busy worrying about Chikorita, whom you were sharing the ride with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made sure to put some distance between you and her, but as it turned out, it was completely pointless, since the green Pokemon simply moved over to you and used a paw to pin you to her stomach as she held onto Dragonite with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of this, Ninetales simply watched with a satisfied smile; sure, she may have said she wanted you for herself, but Dragonite was a good teammate who hadn't had the opportunity to meet you; however, Ninetales still made a mental note to make up for lost time the next time she had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight lasted a while more, with Dragonite growing more bold in her acrobatics, resulting in you having to hold on to Chikorita, who held on to the dragon; eventually though, the fun stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and in came Leaf, three Pokeballs in hand; the sight that came to her eyes made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see you're having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Dragonite stopped and, letting out a happy cry, landed, letting Chikorita snatch you up and jump down whole crying her name excitedly; even you had to admit that the experience was a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chikorita, bring him to me.\" she ordered and, albeit very reluctantly, Chikorita picked you by the scruff of your shirt and carried you to Leaf, gently letting you onto her awaiting hand before retreating to where Ninetales and Dragonite were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are you done?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess nodded her head, then tossed her Pokeballs, out of which came a Dewgong and a Flaaffy, just as promised; the third one was a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wigglytuff?\" you asked, noting a large pink and white bunny going to greet her friends; Leaf nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was one of the Pokemon I had back in Kanto.\" she explained, heading to her bed and collapsing on it, letting out a tired sigh,<br>\r\n\"As a fairy-type, she's going to be a great advantage against the gym leader's dragon-types, whoever they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Aren't you going to introduce me to your Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beat. That, and Chikorita's probably on the job already.\" she said, moving the hand you were on to her stomach, dropping you on it; then, you watched as Leaf took off her hat and placed it on her face, groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look exhausted.\" you unnecessarily pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' voice came muffled from under her hat, making it even harder for her to be heard,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Whitney girl wore me out... in more than one way.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reminded of your earlier 'challenge' against Whitney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're telling me that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf sighed and took the hat off of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time I have to battle someone like her, I'm just going to steal the badge and get away.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's wrong, isn't it?\" you rhetorically asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Leaf shot you a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? That's how I got my Squirtle to begin with.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped laughing, not sure how to react to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story. Too tired.\" Leaf quickly dismissed you, though she smiled as she remembered some of her adventures back in Kanto that led her to meet Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-kay?\" you hesitated. Seriously, this girl seemed to become more mysterious the more time you spent with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um... what now?\" you asked her, deciding to drop the subject and move on to another one.<br>\r\n\"I think it's a bit early to just go to sleep, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf looked up, pensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still some time left before bedtime, she mused, and perhaps she could use that time to go out for a while, check out the bike shop and catch some dinner... also, that would also give her the opportunity to spend some time with you without her Pokemon, who she could just leave here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was also very tired right now...</span></div></div>",

Go play with my Pokemon.\u201d She said as you look at her for a couple of seconds. Really confused about what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s... very unsafe. I need you to get them in line and, by the looks of it they are conspiring against me.\u201d You say as you turn your head and see the six Pokemon, all of them in a group and Chikorita barking her name at them. Probably telling them about you. You were getting a bunch of glances from them, every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you were board, it\u2019s either sleep or them.\u201d She said as you look back and forth so much. Sitting on the fence a bit as Leaf didn\u2019t have time for this. \u201cIf you are not gonna make the choice, then I will make it for you.\u201d With that, she brought her fingers around and grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey?\u201d You say freaking out, as she brought you down to the ground! She brought you down to the ground and you see her giant face looming over the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait a second, you are not about to leave me be, right? Your joking?\u201d You question her hoping, but she just moved her face away from view and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurned off the lights. Well to this part of the place. The Pokemon extension was still well lit for them. You look to the ground of Pokemon. They all noticed that Leaf went to sleep, and you are  guessing by that guess the figured you were with them. You were kind of hiding in the dark beside the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, why not.\u201d You say just giving in. You force your legs to move forward, stepping forward and getting up to the giant Pokemon. You walk to the group, as you see them get bigger and bigger as you get closer to the horizon. Finally you were under and all of them noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cChiko!\u201d </span>She cheered. Your favourite grass type jumping it\u2019s way forward and coming down to you. Laying on it\u2019s stomach as you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Chikorita.\u201d You say to her moving your small hand and tapping her nose playfully. Mind if I talk to the group?\u201d You question her as she nodded. Dropping her head and on her leaf. \u201cY-You want me to... okay.\u201d You say as you step onto the leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a burger, she flipped you with her leaf. Flipping you around and letting you get onto the head. It was a little weird, but it was fine as the Pokemon turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look ahead and all the Pokemon were looking at you! Not only the new ones, but the old ones as well. How awkward was this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... hi. Sure Chikorita told you three about me.\u201d You say to the new Pokemon. \u201cI\u2019m (Your Name).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">Flaaffy!\u201d</span> The electric type cheered, seeming to like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cDewgong?\u201d</span> The water ice type said tilting it\u2019s head, almost like she still didn\u2019t believe what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\u201cWigglytuff.\u201d</span> The fairy type puffed. Pouting a bit. She didn\u2019t seem that happy with you? What did you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, please to meet you. Well, Leaf has gone to sleep, and... i\u2019m still up to play with you all.\u201d You say sending them a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Pokemon seemed excited for this, except for Wigglytuff who didn\u2019t look anymore happy about it? Did this Fairy type not like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cHehe, you got kicked out of the bed!\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t get kicked out of the bed Chikori- Hey!\u201d You say freaking out as you suddenly feel a force jump and tackle you. You feel yourself, getting rubbed against something soft. Wool? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cppink\">\u201cHi there!\u201d</span></u> The Flaffy said, as it continued to hug you. She seems to really like you, and oh boy was it soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two were having fun, Chikorita was left stunned. <u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cW-Wait, did he know what I said?</span></u>\u201d She said bewildered. Most of the Pokemon didn\u2019t notice, not even you. She did though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d </span></u>Ninetails says walking past. <u><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThat Pokemon and Humans with strong enough bonds can break through the language, and understand each other through emotions.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\"><br>\r\n\u201cI-Is that what happened?

Let's do it,\" Leaf spoke, adopting a slight blush,<br>\r\n\"I owe you after all,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... do?\" you questioned. The giantess giggled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you won me the badge, remember?\" she pointed out, moving to grab you from her stomach before sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... I owed you that, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you deserve a reward for it. Plus,\" Leaf said,<br>\r\n\"I really want to check the bike shop out, then I'll get us some dinner. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun!\" you replied, causing the giantess to giggle once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully holding you, Leaf got up and picked the keys of the room she had rented before walking to the door; when she reached it, she stopped to look at her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't scared of leaving them alone: her loyal companions were strong enough to look out for themselves. Still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading out for a while,\" she announced,<br>\r\n\"I've, uh, got something to do. No fighting, okay? Save that for the battlefield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf's Pokemon cried their names in response, though before the trainer could leave, one of them ran towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chikorita.\" Leaf quietly spoke as the grass-type stopped in front of her, smiling up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Chi-Chiko!</span>\" she cried happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing she wants to tag along,\" you said, Chikorita smiling in your direction and nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" she conceded, gesturing for Chikorita to follow as she headed out with you in hand; Chikorita happily obeyed, though not before having turned to shoot Ninetales one last, smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden-furred vixen replied by turned her back to Chikorita, giving an annoyed flip of her tails, before she disappeared from sight as Leaf closed and locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun hadn't set yet, but it wasn't long until then, and the lights in Goldenrod were already lit; a gentle breeze blew past you as you sat onto Leaf's shoulder while she walked through the streets with Chikorita happily trotting beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty here,\" Leaf commented at some point, looking around: there were people happily chatting or simply walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" you agreed, before asking,<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to check out, first? I know there's a huge department store in this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting.\" Leaf replied with a smile,<br>\r\n\"But I told you, I want to check the bike shop, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lady makes the call, Leaf,\" you joked, causing her to giggle. She liked this, she liked your company, though she was never going to admit it; beside her, Chikorita pouted, jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but Leaf eventually found the shop she was searching for, hid you in her hat like earlier for good measure and entered; within ten minutes, Leaf got out of the store with a new bike that had a little basket that was meant for you to ride in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess took off her hat, only to place you right in the basket as she mounted her new bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\" she asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, it's cool,\" you said, leaning back,<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be great, traveling like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, glad you think that,\" Leaf replied, before smirking,<br>\r\n\"Now, make way for your new roomie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even think what she meant by that, a certain green Pokemon excitedly climbed her way onto the bike as fast as a lightning and jumped into the basket along with you, nearly squashing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chikorita, be more careful!\" you cried, frightened, causing the green behemoth to giggle; since you got Leaf's help, you began forgetting how much more fragile you were from time to time, and Chikorita seemed intent on reminding you of that every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf watched both her Pokemon and her small friend together in the basket and couldn't but think that the scene was pretty adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a moment, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you, two let's put this bike to the test,\" she whispered. Then, without any kind of warning, she began peddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf rode her new bike around the city for a while, enjoying every second of it, having missed the feeling of the speed and the wind in her hair. It was such a good sensation, the feeling of true freedom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you were once again forced to hold on to Chikorita as Leaf rode too fast for your likings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, the trainer stopped in front of a large building that, according to a sign nearby, was the Radio Tower of Goldenrod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun,\" Leaf commented. Chikorita cheered in agreement, having enjoyed the ride very much... and the fact that you were stuck with her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you agreed as well, poking your head out of the basket to face Leaf,<br>\r\n\"I think we'll get to Blackthorn City in no time now, haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf nodded in response, agreeing with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you saw her looking at the sky: the sun had settled a while ago, but she didn't seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should head back,\" she said, turning to you,<br>\r\n\"I'll pick something for us to eat on the way, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay with that.\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ta.</span>\"<br>\r\n\"And Chikorita's too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a giggle, Leaf nodded her head and prepared to ride the way back to the Pokemon Center; you once more grabbed onto Chikorita, who just cooed her name in delight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You proved to be indecisive when Leaf casually passed you by and walked out of the gym satisfied with her new badge. Just like that, one of the doors of opportunity that were wide open for you had closed, much like the automatic doors of Jasmine\u2019s gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself collapse to your knees as you started down at the floor with despair in your eyes when you realized that your winning odds had decreased drastically. While you still had Jasmine as an option, it would\u2019ve helped out so much to call out to Leaf as well. Having multiple options is way better than having one disappear forever. What a blunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, look at the bright side: you still had Jasmine, and she would definitely help you out if you were to ask her. She really is just that kind. So maybe there is still hope for you after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChi....chika?\u201d Chikorita spoke sounding confused. Your head shot back up immediately when you hear the sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that Chikorita was still here inside the gym for some reason. Did she lock herself in by not going through the automatic doors fast enough? But that doesn\u2019t make sense since the doors should work for pokemon too, so what\u2019s the deal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika?\u201d Chikorita cries again now with more curiosity. You didn\u2019t have a clue what she was curious about. If anything, you should be curious about why she was still here. That was until you realized who she was speaking too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c........m-me?\u201d You said pointing to yourself, which only piqued her interest. You had now realized that Chikorita was starting at you, unable to understand what she was seeing. You felt yourself starting to get cold sweat while Leaf went back into the gym when she also realized Chikorita didn\u2019t follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Chikorita, you can\u2019t stay behind like that, we need to get to the next gym.\u201d Leaf said gently to Chikorita as she kept starting at you. \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Jasmine asked checking to see if something was wrong. \u201cNo nothing, Chikorita just gets distracted easily. Come on girl, let\u2019s go.\u201d Leaf said not thinking much of her behavior. At least you now you know that her trusty companion was female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika!\u201d she cried out before running into your direction. You have been spotted! You instantly fell into a panic as you quickly scrabbled for a way to escape. You first tried to run into the open but you got halted when Chikorita leaped in front of you to block your path and that was all she wrote when you quickly found yourself cornered, as she slowly kept walking to you closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What are you doing?\u201d Leaf said, with it being her turn to be confused. \u201cI\u2019ll see if i can help.\u201d Jasmine responded to the commotion. You reckoned that she was coming here as well since you could feel the ground shaking with each step she took. Not that it matters right now, you need to keep eye on the most immediate threat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you didn\u2019t think too much about what you were going to do if had gotten the attention of someone since you were cowering in fear when faced with one. While normally cute looking, due to the size differences, Chikorita\u2019s presences became intimidating and bone chillingly scary up close as she looked down at your small body. You held tightly onto your heart as you felt the green titan coming closer and cornering you even further. Is this really it? The end? You didn\u2019t even come close to finding Mew and your journey ends here along with your life?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft without any options, you just sat there, staring at the Chikorita that was going to decide your fate. In the end....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It began to really dawn on you how insane this situation has become. Simple games of harmless fun have ended up with you no taller than a single blade of grass. Anyone could crush you without them ever knowing, the extent of your options was almost nonexistent and even if you were to be discovered, things could get even more sour if they were to see you as a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were convinced that Mew knew that you had to deal with all of these problems when she had shrunk you when you remembered her saying <span class=\"cppink\">\u201dCome find me!\u201d</span>. She must have known how ridiculously impossible living like this was going to be when she made herself the only method to end it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why did she do this to you? Was this some kind of test? At least it would somewhat justify all of this if this was the \u201cProve your worth by reaching me\u201d sort of thing. Otherwise, this was going to be the worst game of hide and seek you ever had the misfortune of playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotting feeling of despair then slowly began to build inside of you. There was simply no way you were able to find Mew. Finding her at normal size would be near to impossible on it\u2019s own let alone as the size of an ant. An already massive world has become massive-er, and how would you even begin traversing it and finding her. She might already be out of the Sinnoh region and at the other side of the earth for all you know, so you might as well stay put and get used to living as a few inches tall. It\u2019s the best option you have anyway....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....no, that cannot be the case. Something just felt wrong with leaving things like that, never getting to explore and witness the wonders waiting out there to be discovered and seen. You couldn\u2019t let that happen, you had to give it everything you got to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. Maybe this is what Mew is trying to test you for; your determination to go through thick and thin in order to reach your goal. Yeah, that\u2019s got to be it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, with this new found hope, you quickly began to look for a way to get out of the jungle of grass you were in since you couldn\u2019t see well if someone was coming near you or not. You would then either miss your chance to get the attention of someone passing by or get crushed in a truly pathetic manner. Either way, you now know what you need to do: you\u2019re going to find Mew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you reached a rock extending even higher up than the grass. The surface was fortunately rough enough to allow you to climb it up and reach higher altitude. This would fix both issues of being completely unnoticeable inside the grass as well as your lack of vision, killing two bird with one stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheesy pun aside, after some scaling, you finally managed to get on top of the rock. Along with giving you a better perspective of the forest you were also able to make out the town you were near: Sandgem Town. Now you remembered that you came to this forest in the first place to look for more pokemon to add to your team after you got your starter from Professor Rowan. Funny isn\u2019t it? After making your first step into your journey as a pokemon trainer, it was abruptly halted with a playful Mew shrinking you for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....oh wait, that\u2019s it! You could use you pokemon to traverse through this dangerous world. Then you wouldn\u2019t be as valuable as you are now, so all you need to do is....huh? Where\u2019s your pokeball?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked as you realized that your pokeball that contained your pokeman was no longer in your pocket, same with your Pokenav. You must have dropped inside the grass, though you weren\u2019t sure whether it was before or after you were shrunk. Just fantastic either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now? You could either go back inside the grass to go looking for your stuff or first get some help from the townsfolk. You didn\u2019t know how you were going to do it but it would definitely improve your odds if you managed to. Then again, anything could happen while you were in this state, so maybe it was best to go prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were pondering with this dilemma for what your first play was going to be, you...</span></div></div>",

Scared, you knew you had to look and see what it was. You do the slowest turn you could, as you see a giant figure on the outskirts of the tall grass. With it\u2019s eyes right on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue body, four legged electric type, who has used it\u2019s keen eyes to spot you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShinx...\u201d</span> It said, as it was looking right at you. This was not good, you don\u2019t know what this Pokemon wants but it sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wild Pokemon sees you. You try to hold your own on the rock, but that became more difficult as the Pokemon moved it\u2019s way closer to you. It stepped on the grass, and you could see the grass you were in get knocked down and trampled on by it\u2019s paws. That grass was like a forest to you, and this Pokemon simply walked it\u2019s way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got really close to you, to the point where it\u2019s face was covering most of your sight. You two just look at each other for a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally, the giant behemoth of a Pokemon opened its Maw. Your eyes go wide, seeing it\u2019s sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Pokemon most people would say is cute, is giant to you! Even worse, it\u2019s looking to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShiii!!!\u201d</span> It said moving it\u2019s head forward. You acted quick. jumping out of the way from the Pokemon. Dodging it\u2019s attack and off the rock. Hitting the ground, you slid down on some grass as it soften your fall a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was too close, why did that Shinx try eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShinx?\u201d</span> It questioned, as you could hear it climb the rock and survey the land. Looking around for where you went. Seeing the giant electric type perched, you slowly move under the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure you were out of view before the Pokemon could find you. Thankfully you had a lot of cover, so it was not an easy job for the Pokemon to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see it though, and it seemed to be looking at you very interestedly. To the point where you were a little bit worried at the moment. All you have to do is hide and make sure you were not going to be found. The Pokemon will lose interest before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was your first plan, but you came across a better one... cause through the grass, you could see a bit of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open as you realise that was your Pokeball! If you go and bring out your Pokemon, they can fight this Shinx! They can protect you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile you run over and plan to get real close to the ball. Still making sure you were not going to be found through the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to it and... well it was too big. You couldn\u2019t even fathom that you use to carry around this giant ball. It was so big, to the point where you could easily climb it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich turns out was something you had to do, cause the little button in the middle was far above the ground. Since that was how to open it, well you got to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving ahead and getting close, you start scaling the ball. It was smooth, but you were determined so you climbed it without little effort. Getting to the button, until another problem arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t... press the button. \u201cCome on! Come on get pressed! I need you right now...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201c...Shinx...\u201d</span> The Pokemon said as you turn your head, seeing it looking at the ball, and a smile on it\u2019s face. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShinx!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you right now!\u201d You say pushing with all your strength. Trying to get your Pokemon out, as Shinx wanted to get you to. The Pokemon leaped it\u2019s way off the grass, trampling all the tree size grass that was under you. You were so small you had to make your under them, Shinx was just going to make her way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a towering goliath making her way to you. You close your eyes and coward, a little afraid as you just keep pushing the button with everything you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither you were gonna get your Pokemon out, or you were a goner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Pokemon made it\u2019s final way to the grass, it saw that you were stuck to the ball. Now Shinx was a young Pokemon, and it didn\u2019t know that you were trying to call a Pokemon. Instead it just thought you were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see it come close, until finally it\u2019s face was basically right behind you. Turning your head, you see the frightening side, until finally... it moved it\u2019s nose to your back, almost pushing the button in when it pushed you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, okay. Come out now!\u201d You say as you did not want this. The Shinx was treating you like a plaything. At normal size, at least you could deal with this Pokemon. At your size, you were at it\u2019s mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, you were at it\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShinx!\u201d</span> It cheered, almost defeaning you as it seemed to like that you were stuck. You weren\u2019t going to run anymore, and it was going to have food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see right down it\u2019s throat as you could it\u2019s teeth, it\u2019s tongue and everything else in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!\u201d You say trying to kick the Pokemon back. Trying to get it to back up and get away from you. The Pokemon was not caring though, as it planned to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith strength now backed by fear, you take one final weak push on the button. Knowing if you don\u2019t get a Pokemon out right then... you were a goner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

A blinding flash comes from the ball, and you avert your eyes. The Shinx doesn\u2019t, and it yelps and stumbles back. As it reels, you wait for the light to dissipate, then look towards the ball again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding next to the Pokeball is a Chimchar, and as you expected, she is gigantic compared to you. However, the sight doesn\u2019t frighten you at all. This is your starter, and although you only met each other recently, you two have quickly grown quite attached to each other. You enjoy her cheerful, feisty attitude, and she seems to respect your ambition as a trainer. You\u2019re happy to see her, and you feel a lot more confident now that you have a friend to protect you from the Shinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you notice Chimchar seems confused. She\u2019s looking all around, and you assume she\u2019s trying to figure out where her trainer is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cCha?\u201d</span> she asks, her confusion obvious in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown here!\u201d you shout, waving your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe primate looks down at you. For several seconds, her huge gray eyes stare at your tiny form among the grass. Then, she gasps and jumps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cCha! Chim, cha char?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can explain later,\u201d you say. \u201cFor now, we\u2019ve got a wild Shinx to deal with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChimchar looks over at the feline. It\u2019s recovered from the flash, and now it growls and lowers its stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShinx! Shi!\u201d</span> it cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fire-type frowns at it. She moves past you, shaking the ground with each huge step, and puts herself between you and the wild Pok\u00e9mon. She crosses her arms and bares her fangs, and the flame on her rump flares up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look between Chimchar\u2019s legs to keep an eye on the Shinx, and as you do, a thought occurs to you. Chimchar is pretty young, and still not a strong battler. Meanwhile, you have no idea how strong this Shinx is. It\u2019s probably young too, but it might be more powerful or skilled at battling. If so, it would be a bad idea to let Chimchar fight it. If she loses, you\u2019ll be on your own again, and the Shinx would probably devour you as soon as possible. With that in mind, it might be better to flee. But you\u2019re not sure if you and Chimchar could outrun the wild Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t want to risk having Chimchar get knocked out at a time when you\u2019re so vulnerable without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChimchar!\u201d you shout at her. \u201cChange of plans! Retreat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant primate looks back at you and cocks her head to the side. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cCha? Chi?\u201d</span> she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Shinx charges and lunges at the distracted Chimchar, its jaws wide open. You point at it and shout, \u201cLook out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChimchar turns around and sees the attacking feline just in time to dodge to the side. The wild Pok\u00e9mon lands where she was standing and bites the air. You stumble back in surprise, because now the Shinx is very close to you. It\u2019s practically looming above you. It looks down at you and growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShi!\u201d</span> it cries, preparing to lunge and bite at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Chimchar won\u2019t let that happen. She spits an ember at the Shinx, who cries out and backs away from you. You look over at your starter Pok\u00e9mon and see that she\u2019s rushing towards you on all fours. Before you know it, she\u2019s reached you, and you see one of her hands coming at you. You\u2019re roughly snatched up in her fist, and you scream in surprise as your feet leave the ground. Chimchar lifts you up and holds you to her chest as she continues to run away from the Shinx, using her feet and her free hand to lope forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld in the grasp of your giant Pok\u00e9mon, you suddenly get a flashback to an old movie you watched once, in which a giant Slaking rampages in a city and kidnaps a woman. After seeing that movie, a part of you always wondered what it might feel like to be grabbed by a giant hand, and now you know the answer. Chimchar\u2019s hand is soothingly warm and soft, but her grip is also more painful than you expected, since she\u2019s squeezing you very tightly to avoid dropping you. This also means you\u2019re completely immobilized except for your head. You ignore the strong urge to squirm, since you know it would be pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire forward view is comprised of the fuzzy, cream-colored chest of your Pok\u00e9mon, so you can\u2019t see if the Shinx is pursuing you. You look over your shoulder, in the direction Chimchar is moving, and see she\u2019s going towards a tree. Without missing a beat, the primate leaps at the trunk and begins to clamber up it. She moves quickly and skillfully, even though one of her hands is occupied with holding you. You gulp as you see the ground getting farther and farther away. You hope your starter doesn\u2019t drop you by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Chimchar stops climbing the trunk and steps out onto a thick branch. She sits down and closes her eyes. She\u2019s breathing heavily. She takes a minute to catch her breath, then lifts you up to her face and smiles. You smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat job!\u201d you say. \u201cThat was a perfect escape!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cChim, chi chi,\u201d</span> she says, smirking and winking at you. Your compliment inflated her ego, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to look down at the ground to see if the Shinx is there, but you can\u2019t see past Chimchar\u2019s hand. You look at her and ask, \u201cHey, do you see the Shinx anywhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans forward and looks down from the tree branch. What does she see?</span></div></div>",

You try to cling onto it, but its slippery surface doesn't give you much of a grip. You feel your body sink down into the maw, but stop right when your head reaches the Shinx's lips.

The Shinx seemed so adamant on eating you before, why wont it eat you now. Maybe it wants to savor your taste? And where is it taking you anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last answer is swiftly answered, as the Shinx stops at an open field surrounded by bushes. There, it lowers its head and lets you out of their mouth. You land face first onto the dirt. <i>Couldn't the Shinx let me out softer at least,</i> you complain to yourself, getting yourself off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clteal\">Shiiii!</span>\" The Shinx calls out in excitement behind you. You turn around to see the Shinx's giant form towering over you. You can tell by their body language, the way that the Pokemon's backside is raised in the air with their tail wagging, means that they want to play with you. If you tried to play with the giant, you'd surely be crushed by it, whether on purpose or accident. You try to slowly back away, but even that makes the Shinx jump at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shinx's paws land right in front of you, causing you to lose your balance and land on your back. You are now in direct eyesight of the Shinx again, this time with them looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clteal\">Shinx!</span> The Pokemon's booming voice says cheerfully, as they lift a paw over you. They easily pin you down, but luckily for you, the Shinx does it lightly, though enough for you to not escape. It then quickly lets go of you and jumps back. <i>Is it playing with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get yourself back up from the ground again, and walk slowly to the Shinx. It surprising stays still for you to get very close to it, as you touch its lowered nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clteal\">Shii...</span>\" It then makes a soft noise, telling you that...</span></div></div>",

The Shinx this time presses its fluffy cheek right on you, putting the weight of their whole head right on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, it didn't hurt you, well not dramatically. You did still feel discomfort when your back got slammed to the dirt by the wall of light blue fluff, but the fur of the Shinx surprisingly felt... nice. You rubbed your hands on the soft fur pressing on you. The Shinx in response began to purr. Huh, who knew that Shinx's purr. After a few seconds of rubbing, the Shinx lifts their head up a bit for you to stand up, but still reach their head. They then tilt their head, as you scratch behind their ears. That's when you notice something interesting looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shinx's tuft on the top of their head. Normally, no one would actually pay attention to it, but you knew something about it.

Yamper! Yamper! ya-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard you yell her name, and she felt the touch as she began to wake up. She nudged you with her paw, knocking you down and getting you to collapse off of your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on your rear as you look at the giant Pokemon wake up. Slowly opening it\u2019s eyes as it gave out an adorable yawn..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u2028\u201cPer?\u201d I</span>t questioned looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown here!\u201d You yell to your Pokemon, as she craned her head down and spotted you. Your Pokemon looking at you for a couple of seconds as you can tell it\u2019s thoughts at the moment. She got up from her backpack bed, moving closer to you as you take several steps back back, letting her get down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cute little Pokemon, now towering over you like a threat. Still you were not moving, as this was a Pokemon you were comfortable around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep... it\u2019s me.\u201d You say to her as she looked at you even more. \u201cTook a lousy time for a nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon just looked at you, until finally... she gave a smile. A big smile that showed her reaction to this. Moving her face closer, she brought her nose to you and nuzzled you with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wet nose against your stomach as you couldn\u2019t help but laugh at it. \u201cOkay, okay. I know.\u201d You say to her as you try to push the nose back, only for Yamper to bring her tongue around and give you a big lick. One that shook you as she liked you this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, listen Yamper. I got shrunk by a Mew just than. I need your help. Maybe it\u2019s still close. We got to get going!\u201d You say as she understood. Lowering her head for you to get on. You smile at your Pokemon as you take the invitation to climb her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her neck you get onto her back as you look back. \u201cGotta leave the backpack here. Good thing I don\u2019t another Pokemon. Let\u2019s go Yamper!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYamp! Yamp!\u201d </span>it said loudly jumping around, almost getting you to fall of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! Calm down, tiny passenger remember.\u201d You say to your Pokemon as she did just that. Moving around and  getting out of the tall grass. Seeing the Wild Area once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, for most trainers, it\u2019s a giant area with lots of different zones and even more Pokemon than that. For you, it was more than giant, it was massive. Like the size of a whole country by itself. You can see the towering city in the distant, almost like the horizon itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYamp!\u201d </span>Your Pokemon barked, looking back at you. Your Pokemon loved the sight it had. You were so cute on her back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... don\u2019t know where to go honestly. She wants me to find her, but I don\u2019t know where Mew is?\u201d You question looking around. \u201cPlus, there are so many Pokemon here, I don\u2019t want to be near them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to admit, it was like every Pokemon was Dynamaxed from your perspective. Although Yamper is loyal, she is not really the strongest Pokemon. If she runs into a wild encounter, there is a chance she will win, but lose as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else can you do though, but chase Mew. Wait... if you remember correctly? Isn\u2019t the professor of Galar into Dynamax and the research on that part. If you find them, you might be able to get big again without even the help of Mew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be amazing, cause let\u2019s face it is the better option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYamper, hide!\u201d You say as she reacted. Getting down onto her stomach as you see a giant walk past. That raised the problem as well, you were so small everything was a threat to you. If someone wanted to battle you, you were gonna have to say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr else they might literally battle you! Pokemon Trainers, and In the wild zone more accurately are far more competitive than otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYamper?\u201d </span>Your Pokemon questioned as you thought about it some more. Your Pokemon did love having her tiny trainer on her neck, but it was clear you wanted to get big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour loving Pokemon though, she just wanted to play. She was far too playful, and this was a once in a lifetime moment. She most likely will help you, but a part of Yamper wants to have fun with you now that you were toy size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Yamper, I think I know what we are going to do. We are going to ________________\u201d</span></div></div>",

Yamper walked through the wild area, making sure to stay not only out of the way of trainers but also wild pokemon. You traveled across distant plains and bridges that seemed to span half a kilometer, despite knowing that the exact bridge was only 5 meters long earlier in a week. You peered around, gauging the various trainers that traveled through the Wild Area. You were looking for someone young and kind, as they would help you without ulterior motives, unlike some adults that would probably abuse the heck out of your small stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Most of the people in the Wild Area were big camper guys, breaking the rule about being young. They looked nice, sure, but people always gain a dark side to them as they grow up, it's just that most people tend to keep the darkness inside for fear of public prosecution or humiliation. After a whole day of adventuring you had almost given up for the day, wanting to tell Yamper to run into a bush somewhere to sleep the night, but it was then that fortune struck. You saw a camp with a bonfire in the near distance and ordered Yamper to run towards it. With a quick cry of its name, it bolted to the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inspected the trainer and saw that they were nice to their pokemon and were relatively young. It might've just been your reluctance to sleep in the open tonight, but you ordered Yamper to approach the trainer. The trainer was..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I will give a sizeable amount of GP if anyone adds to option 2 or 4)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the sun sank low, you rode Yamper towards the campsite. It was pretty small and simple, with just a tent and a fire, located next to some trees and a stream. A young girl with brown eyes and short brown hair was sitting cross-legged with her back against a tree. She was dressed in a pink shirt and skirt, a gray sweater, and large brown boots. She also had a green-and-white tam o\u2019 shanter sitting on a large rucksack beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was looking up at the sky, and you followed her gaze to see some kind of bird Pok\u00e9mon wheeling around. You shuddered as you considered how easily a bird could swoop down and devour you, but you\u2019re sure that won\u2019t happen when Yamper is here to protect you. Not to mention, this girl could provide you with even more assistance\u2014but only if she turned out to be friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamper had now entered the campsite. The tall grass gradually got shorter, and she was soon fully in the open. You took a deep breath as your Pok\u00e9mon brought you ever closer to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the girl seemed to notice movement out of the corner of her eye, as she glanced over and looked at Yamper. She smiled and said, \u201cHey! Hello there, pup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamper barked and wagged her tail energetically as she bounded towards the girl. You weren\u2019t surprised\u2014she always was eager to meet new people. But now, you wished she wasn\u2019t so excited; it was increasingly difficult to hang on to her fur. Thankfully, she soon came to a stop right in front of the girl, panting and gazing up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled more broadly, and leaned forward to get a closer look at your Pok\u00e9mon. However, she hadn\u2019t noticed you, since you were hidden behind the dog\u2019s head. You were nervous about how she would react when she saw you. But it was almost the moment of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem friendly enough,\u201d she said to your Yamper. \u201cDo you have a trainer, lassie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cPer, yamper!\u201d</span> the dog cried as she turned to the side and showed you to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her stared at each other for what felt like forever. But then, she suddenly gasped and sat upright with a jolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOch! Blimey, it\u2019s... it\u2019s a wee person! What happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounded concerned, and that restored your confidence a bit. Perhaps she really will be nice to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... it\u2019s a weird story,\u201d you tell her. \u201cBasically, a Pok\u00e9mon shrunk me, and now I need to find her to get back to normal. But I have no idea where she went, and I\u2019m obviously in pretty bad shape right now, so I was hoping I could meet someone nice to help me out. So... can you help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl hesitated for a moment. Then, she replied...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You breathed a huge sigh of relief. It felt like a big weight had been taken off your shoulders. Now you officially had a regular-sized human to help you out. This should make things a lot easier, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much!\u201d you said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much this means to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, mate,\u201d the girl said. \u201cOr maybe I should call you \u2018mite\u2019,\u201d she added with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, if you say so. Seriously, though, no need to thank me. This is the right thing to do. Wouldn\u2019t be proper to abandon you like this. Besides, it\u2019ll be fun to have another person to pass time with. It\u2019s a wee bit lonely out here sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can imagine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded, then tapped her legs with her hands. \u201cOi, Yamper\u2014come here, lassie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamper eagerly ran over and jumped into her lap, nestling in and growling happily. You barely managed to hang on to her back. Once she came to a stop, you looked up to see the girl smiling down at you. She gently stroked Yamper\u2019s head, and said, \u201cMight be a weird question, but d\u2019ye mind if I pick you up? I get the feeling it\u2019s a tad dangerous to sit on a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s back like that. You might get thrown off and break your bahookie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea what that means,\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour bum,\u201d she replied, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2014in that case, good point,\u201d you said sheepishly. You weren\u2019t too keen on being held in a giant hand, due to the inherent risk of being crushed, but you also didn\u2019t want to be tossed off your dog\u2019s back if she abruptly moved, as she was known to do. You figured being held was the least dangerous of the two options, since this girl surely had more self-control than your Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your arms as the girl reached down for you with the hand not petting Yamper. Her hand carefully closed around you, leaving your arms and head free, and she lifted you up to her smiling face. You smiled back. She was certainly being gentle with you, and it actually felt nice to be held by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d she said, \u201cmy name\u2019s Gloria. I\u2019m from Postwick. What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told Gloria your name and hometown, and then the two of you started chatting about your Pok\u00e9mon journeys so far, and what kinds of experiences you\u2019ve had along the way. Gloria occasionally threw some slang into her speech, which confused you a bit, but you could understand most of what she said. You quickly got the impression that she had slightly more experience in journeying and battling than you did, but she still only had two Pok\u00e9mon. One was a Wooloo, currently in a ball in her tent, and the other was one of the three default Galarian starters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I meet your starter?\u201d you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d love to introduce you to her\u2014bonnie li\u2019l lass, she is\u2014but she\u2019s off exploring right now. She should be close by, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a patch of tall grass outside the camp rustled. You, Gloria, and Yamper all looked at it in surprise. Yamper barked and jumped out of the girl\u2019s lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYamper, wait!\u201d you shouted. \u201cIt might be dangerous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, could be my starter,\u201d Gloria said. \u201cOi! Is that you, mate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spotted some faint trails of smoke rising from the tall grass, and then you saw the source: a Scorbunny ran out of the grass, its large furry feet emitting puffs of smoke and embers with each step. The rabbit Pok\u00e9mon stopped once it was in the open, then rubbed its snout with its paws and snorted before looking at the gathered individuals in the campsite. It seemed not to notice you due to your small size, though, and it quickly focused all its attention on Yamper, who jumped in front of it and growled, wagging her tail energetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that your starter?\u201d you asked the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria glanced down at you and said...</span></div></div>",

You had more important matters to deal with. There was a battle brewing. Scorbunny was glaring at Yamper, who continued to growl. The rabbit kept shifting its weight between its feet, preparing for a fight. Yamper copied it, as if she thought Scorbunny was trying to dance with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria suddenly looked down at you and said, \u201cOch! I got an idea, mate! How about you have your Yamper fight that Scorbunny, then I\u2019ll give you one of my spare Pok\u00e9 Balls so you can try to catch it if you win! Assuming it turns out to be wild instead of trained, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to add a new Pok\u00e9mon to my team,\u201d you said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Yamper can hear me give orders from this far away, and I\u2019d rather not get too close to a fight between giant Pok\u00e9mon. Even if you\u2019re holding me, I think it would be safer to keep away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how about you tell me what you want Yamper to do, and I\u2019ll yell over to her? Canny plan, innit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that does sound pretty good. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Gloria looked towards the two Pok\u00e9mon, and you started formulating a strategy. \u201cOkay,\u201d you began, \u201cYamper should tackle first. Take the rabbit by surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYamper, use Tackle!\u201d Gloria shouted. Her loud cry hurt your tiny ears, but at least the volume ensured your Pok\u00e9mon heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYamper!\u201d</span> the dog cried as it charged at the Scorbunny. However, Scorbunny was too quick, and easily dodged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cNy scor, ny scor!\u201d</span> the rabbit shouted, sticking out its tongue tauntingly. It started stamping the ground, and its feet began emitting puffs of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot faster than Yamper,\u201d you said. \u201cWe have to slow it down. Yamper should keep moving to make some electricity, then use Nuzzle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria shouted, \u201cYamper, run and jouk about, then use Nuzzle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog started running circles around Scorbunny. You saw her tail begin to glow and emit sparks as it generated electricity from her movement. Meanwhile, Scorbunny stood in place and kept an eye on its foe. Its right foot began to glow red as embers appeared around it, and it thumped the ground repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s charging an attack,\u201d Gloria said worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got this,\u201d you said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamper finally stopped running and lunged at Scorbunny, who failed to dodge this time. Yamper headbutted the rabbit in the chest to stun it, then rubbed her cheek against Scorbunny\u2019s face before hopping away. Scorbunny groaned and rubbed its face, twitching uncontrollably. Its ears were drooping, and you saw little sparks arcing around all over its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParalyzed,\u201d Gloria said with a grin. \u201cGood strategy! Now it won\u2019t be able to move or dodge quite as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYamper should tackle again,\u201d you said. \u201cLet\u2019s press the advantage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria gave the order, and Yamper headbutted Scorbunny once more. The rabbit raised its arms to defend against the attack, then abruptly unleashed a flaming double kick. Despite Scorbunny\u2019s paralysis, the attack came out very quickly, and both hits connected with Yamper\u2019s head. The dog cried out in pain as she was sent flying back. The rabbit twitched a bit more, but managed to cough up an ember to burn Yamper\u2019s flank. The dog yelped as her fur got singed. You winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven paralyzed, it can still fight,\u201d you muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t tell who\u2019s going to win this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Gloria worked together to continue commanding your Yamper. She and Scorbunny traded blows, and it soon became apparent that one of them had the upper hand (or paw, in this case)...</span></div></div>",

You can\u2019t win every battle. But if Yamper faints, I think I\u2019ll try to fight that Scorbunny with my Wooloo, and see if I can catch it myself. Maybe it\u2019s a wee bit shan to attack a Pok\u00e9mon that\u2019s already been through one fight, but I guess I could offer to heal it first, if it\u2019s willing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScorbunny delivered another strong kick, and Yamper cried out as she fell over. Her stubby legs waved uselessly in the air as she tried to right herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cBun scor, ny!\u201d</span> the rabbit shouted cheerily as it watched its struggling opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like this battle is just about done,\u201d Gloria said. \u201cI\u2019d better hurry and get Wooloo so I can fight next. Mate, I\u2019ll leave you here to watch over your Pok\u00e9mon. I\u2019ll be back in a mo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest, Gloria grabbed her tam o\u2019 shanter from atop her rucksack and put it on her head, then placed you on her rucksack and ran to her tent. She vanished inside, and you watched her, stammering and trying to make her stop. You didn\u2019t feel safe without her, especially since your Pok\u00e9mon was about to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at the two Pok\u00e9mon, and sure enough, Yamper was on the verge of unconsciousness. She managed to roll over and stand up just in time for Scorbunny to roundhouse kick her in the face, knocking her flat on the ground. She whined once before going limp. She had fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScorbunny stomped the ground and let out a victory cry. You shuddered as you realized you were alone with this Pok\u00e9mon, and now that its opponent was unconscious, it might very well turn its attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria?\u201d you said, looking at the nearby tent. \u201cGloria! Hey, I need some help here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tiny voice grew louder and louder as you desperately tried to get the attention of the girl in the tent. You hoped she would hear you before Scorbunny, but considering the rabbit\u2019s big ears, you weren\u2019t confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another couple seconds of yelling for Gloria...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You glanced back at Scorbunny and gasped at what you saw. Just as you feared, its sensitive ears had easily detected your cries, and it was now staring right at you. It squinted its eyes and titled its head to the side in curiosity, then ran towards you. Within moments, the enormous rabbit stood right in front of you. At your current position on the rucksack, you were almost at the same height as its big, round, orange eyes, which were intently focused on your tiny form. The rabbit\u2019s jaw hung open, and it murmured something under its breath, clearly amazed by the miniscule human before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you shivered and backed away. However, you had nowhere to run, unless you wanted to fall off the rucksack. You could do nothing but stand there as the giant Pok\u00e9mon examined you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cScor?\u201d</span> it asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy there,\u201d you said. \u201cPlease leave me alone...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cBun! Scor!\u201d</span> the rabbit cried. Then it reached for you with a paw, trying to grab you. Your heart started racing. Part of you wanted to jump off the rucksack to avoid getting caught, but you hesitated. You considered that the Scorbunny might actually be nice, so things might turn out okay if you allowed it to pick you up, whereas jumping off the rucksack would surely be very painful\u2014and then you\u2019d probably get snatched up anyway. So, you stood still and allowed Scorbunny\u2019s paw to reach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit\u2019s fuzzy fingers wrapped around you, then you were plucked off the rucksack and brought to Scorbunny\u2019s face. It raised its other paw to grasp the paw holding you, making its grip on you even more secure. You didn\u2019t bother trying to squirm. You knew it would be useless. Also, you had to admit the rabbit\u2019s grip didn\u2019t hurt. It seemed to be holding you carefully, so as not to squeeze you painfully. Plus, its paws were soft and warm, even more than Gloria\u2019s hand. In any other situation, you would have enjoyed this feeling, but you still weren\u2019t sure about this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s intentions, so you couldn\u2019t get too comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cBun bun,\u201d</span> it muttered as it observed you. It sniffed at you, then abruptly licked your face. It lasted only half a second, but left your face soaked in drool. You groaned and shook your head to try and throw some of the slobber off. Meanwhile, Scorbunny grimaced, then spat on the ground, apparently disliking your taste. You were happy about that, since this meant you probably wouldn\u2019t get eaten. However, Scorbunny still held you tightly, and it wouldn\u2019t take its eyes off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScorbunny, um... please don\u2019t hurt me,\u201d you stammered. You were afraid it might harm you in revenge for attacking it with your Pok\u00e9mon. But then you remembered Gloria had been the one yelling orders, so the Scorbunny might not realize you were really the one behind the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cScor, bun bun,\u201d</span> it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... does that mean you won\u2019t hurt me?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get a reply, you heard a loud noise from behind. You hoped it was Gloria, but it sounded like the cry of a Pok\u00e9mon instead. Maybe it was Gloria\u2019s starter Pok\u00e9mon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScorbunny looked away from you and glared at something behind you. You looked over your shoulder and saw it was looking at...</span></div></div>",

She was looking at them with a  loving smile, and seemed to be kind to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Yamper, going over there!\u201d You say to your Pokemon and point. However you Pokemon didn\u2019t move. \u201cYamper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYamp...\u201d</span> it said a bit scared, as you can understand. Looking over at the girl and her Pokemon, the Pokemon was scary. A Liepard, A Toxicroak, A Scrafty, and a Morpeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I know your scared, but we won\u2019t have to fight, and if they want to. Run like the wind. Now please?\u201d You say to your Pokemon as it looked at you, and suddenly got moving. Heading over to the campsite. You prepare for what you are going to say to the girl, as you have to piece it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, eating her food from the pot, feeding it to all her Pokemon, Marnie was enjoying her time with her Pokemon. Sure she faced some trainers, but it was just a good time with them. Especially since there was no Team Yell out where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cLiepard.\u201d </span>Her Pokemon stated turning and jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Liep-\u201d Marnie stopped talking, as she looked over and saw a little Yamper make her way to the team of Pokemon. All four of them aware. Sure, Wild Pokemon coming for a fight wasn\u2019t anything new in the Wild Area, but at the same time it was not something that was usual. Especially for a Pokemon like Yamper, so weak. Not to mention her team was... well to put it nicely scary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yamper got close it started shaking and you got to admit, you did to. All four of her Pokemon towered over you, and they looked down scarily. Liepard was the first to spot you, and it looked like Toxicroak and Scrafty was next, none of the Pokemon taking the eyes off. Morpeko jumping into her lap and looking at you from it\u2019s vantage point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, you a hungry Yamper.\u201d The giant dark haired girl said, smiling down and getting some food for your Pokemon. And like that you were reinforced that this was a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving up you walk up the head of Yamper, until you were actually at the top. \u201cUh... hello there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say that as she freaks out for a second, thinking the Pokemon was talking for a second, only to look back and see a small man on the Pokemon\u2019s head. Her eyes open as she dropped her food onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little man,\u201d She said leaning her way in. \u201cNo way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hi there. Sorry for intruding and uh-\u201d You didn\u2019t finish that sentence, as the Toxicroak\u2019s face was worryingly close. And... did that Liepard just lick her lips. Oh boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarnie was still looking after you. \u201cYou are real, I can\u2019t believe it. How can someone be so small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a real long story.\u201d You say to her with a laugh. \u201cMaybe I can tell you, you know... without your scary Pokemon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Pokemon has been called many things, and scary is always the most accurate. Not to mention for your size. She can just imagine what they look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would... but you don\u2019t know hot much of a hassle that is.\u201d She said simply as she looked down. \u201cMorpeko can you get down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cMorpeko!\u201d</span> it whined as Marnie looked at her seriously. The Pokemon jumped down, but shot you a glare as it went down. Great... As you were looking at the Pokemon, you suddenly felt fingers on you as you panic for a second. Screaming as you get pulled and placed onto a lap. Her pink dress under you as you feel it under you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, should feel safe there. My name is Marnie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIh uh... (Your Name)\u201d You say as this was weird. Your first interaction with a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, mind telling me how you got so small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it wants me to chase it. So if you can imagine... pretty screwed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be.\u201d Marnie said simply as she listened. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of Mew. Heard she flies wherever she wants, knows Teleport, knows Transform an-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... I know. Not looking good and-\u201d You trail off, looking to the giant cat Pokemon that was trying to intimidate your little dog Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiepard, knock that off!\u201d Marnie said with a snap of her fingers. As soon as that happened the Liepard looked away, and your Yamper jumped it\u2019s way to you. Well to Marnie\u2019a lap, two forefeet on her lap with the back on the ground. It was barking at you as you try to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Yamper. It\u2019s fine, Marnie is a nice girl. Her Pokemon may be scary, but they won\u2019t do anything right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey won\u2019t do anything to you Yamper. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d Marnie said with a smile down to her Pokemon, which did calm it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait... to Yamper?\u201d You say noticing the words, but she was not going to linger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should recall your Pokemon, just so it doesn\u2019t feel unsafe.\u201d Marnie said as she seemed to care for your Pokemon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would, but my Pokeball is over there. Remember, not big enough to carry it.\u201d You say as she understood, and actually got up. She got up and headed towards your bag, grabbing it with you in her hand. She put it down and grabbed the Pokeball, your Yamper excited to get away from all the scary and strong Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarnie returned your Pokemon, as it went back and into the Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might be for the best, I mean Yamper was pretty scared of your Pokemon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Marnie questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... well a little bit. Especially that Liepard that seems to be glaring at me for a long while.\u201d You say as she smiled. Looking at her Pokemon it quickly changed it\u2019s look. Marnie looked back at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow ____________\u201d</span></div></div>",

So don\u2019t try to make it a big one.\u201d She said looking to the side with a bit of uncertain face. Like she was expecting you to be making fun of her.

Moving her fingers and grabbing you. You get grabbed as Marnie turned towards her tent. Going inside as you look inside. Besides her clothes in the corner, it was just a bed, a pillow and a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much room.\u201d You had to comment as Marine looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlenty of room for you,\u201d She said back, beginning the start of bed. She moved and held her hand over the bed. Turning her hand slightly as you feel yourself fall down from her hand. Going down and bouncing in the middle of the bed. You look around and look up to her as she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d She said as you realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh right... I mean, if we are gonna be sleeping together? Does it matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarnie frowned even more, not even giving you an answer to that. She started to strip, and like she wanted you didn\u2019t look. She simply moved into her underwear, not naked. She can\u2019t deny that she didn\u2019t want you to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it started, she moved down. Going under the blanket, which threw you off as you landed on your front. You felt your whole world move around as she crawled under the blanket. When you felt the blanket stop moving, she was under you and in bed. She even let down her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell ready for bed.\u201d You say to her, clapping your hands casually. \u201cSo...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d Marnie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want, I can sleep right here.\u201d You say while over her stomach. \u201cI mean I got no problem with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you will just get taken again. I got to do this.\u201d She moved her hand around and came it to you. Bringing it over as you panic for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously I can just wait here an-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this okay!\u201d She shouted, as she brought her hand over to you. You get grabbed and lifted right up brought to Marnie\u2019s face. \u201cMight as well just going in.\u201d She swallowed her fears, as she brought you down. Bringing it down and plunging you into her boobs. You were facing down her body, your feet kicking out of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess... you can\u2019t really sleep like that.\u201d She said down to you. You agreed with her as you were already moving around. Wiggling around and turning, going into a normal position. She watched your whole body disappear into her cleavage, as she felt you try to turn in there. She was not gonna lie, it felt weird... but good. Marnie knew for her age, she had relatively large breasts. Of course not as big as girls older than her, but still impressive. Hence is why she chose to let you sleep in there, it was big enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she saw you peak your head around once again.. Your body all inside of the breasts except for your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally I can breath!\u201d You shout up to her as you look at her. \u201cHi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you comfy?\u201d Marnie questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A bit. It\u2019s like being smothered by two giant pillows, it was really something else.\u201d Marnie heard you say as she wore a smile. It was a slight one, but one that you noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarnie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly covered her mouth. \u201cL-Let\u2019s just go to sleep, you said it was pillows right?\u201d She said, looking away from you. You of course didn\u2019t think any more of it, as you got comfy right near her. Getting comfy and wiggling your way into your bed. Closing your eyes as you get comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thank you Marnie! For everything.\u201d You say to her as she watched you go to sleep. Cuddling with her breasts and passing out. It didn\u2019t take that long, as you felt beyond safe while being so close to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Marnie. she watched as you finally went to sleep, as she revealed her large smile. Why did she love seeing you there so much, it was to an insane degree.  At first, her intentions were to protect you from wild Pokemon by having you close, but now that you were there... Marnie couldn\u2019t really explain it properly, she enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening you were tossing and turning in the boobs getting comfy, Marnie watching you through the entire experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile on her face, as she went to sleep as well, glad to have you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up...\u201d You feel a giant finger prod you. Waking you up in the morning as you remember the events that happened. That giant finger must belong to Marnie. You gave out a yawn before looking up to her, still a bit groggy. \u201cGood morning Marnie...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you wake me up like that?\u201d You question as she rolled her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I moved with you in there, you\u2019d wake up anyway. I\u2019m not gonna just lie in bed waiting for you. We need to get moving, and I need to pack up my campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d offer my help but... yeah...\u201d You say to the girl in the bed. This however her got to laugh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are in the middle of pondering what your next course of action should be, when you hear a rustle of grass from somewhere near the log you are on. You freeze, holding your breath. Maybe it's a Skwovet scurrying to a nearby berry pile, or maybe a Zigzagoon running around. Yeah, that's it, just a rowdy Zigzagoon hustling and bustling. You get your mind back in track on think of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until you hear another bush rustle at the edge of the log. You snap your neck to where the noise was made, but nothing was there. You run to the edge to try and see it better, but still nothing. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to get the high ground after all, making you more visible. You got to move now, even if you don't know where you are going to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can, you feel a slight vibration from the other side of the log. Something just jumped on, and is probably standing right behind you. Heart pounding like a hammer, you turn around to view your new friend. On the other side of the log, you see an orange-maroon colored fox-like Pokemon with a bag-like tail you recognize as a <span class=\"cmaroon\">Nickit</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Nic?</span>\" You hear it say, tilting its head. To you, it sounded pretty feminine <i>Maybe she's curious?</i> You think,<i> I need to be cautious though. She just may be hungry for a me shaped snack.</i> You slowly try to walk back while watching her, but your heels reach empty air before you can make a single step. You're trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nickit swiftly approaches you, barely making any noise or vibrations on the ground at all, until she's right in front of your face. She presses her wet nose right on your chest, pressing you a little bit off of the edge. \"Uhhh.... Nice Nickit...\" You nervously say, rubbing her muzzle. She then pulls back her nose, and you notice that she's....... smiling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Ni ni ni ni ni ni~.</span>\" Is she laughing!? Oh, this cannot be any good. You are almost immediately proven right when the Nickit opens her mouth, letting you see all of it. Her tongue hanging out, her pearly whites showing bright which can surely crush you, and her breath taking out any of the cool air around you. Your heart practically stops, the Nickit is going to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, without even thinking, fall off of the log backwards. She snaps her teeth at you, nipping your shirt, and tearing off a good part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww...\" You land on the the dirt with a thud. \"Geez, that hurt...\" You can barely move, much less try to stand up and run. You look at where you fell to see Nickit's head leaning over the log, looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Ni ni ni ni ni ni!</span>\" That's not good. You try to stand back up, but you collapse again right after, inciting more laughter from the Nickit above you. This must be such a treat to her, watching her prey struggle for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear a sound from the log, as the Nickit has jumped right off of it. You shriek in fear, as her front paws are directly aimed at you. She's surely going to crush you doing that. You brace yourself, preparing to become nothing but a red stain on her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><b>Thomp.</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh!? You feel pressure all over your body, but it's more like if someone threw a heavy blanket over you than an actual paw. You just then remembered what the Pokedex said about Nickits. \"They have incredibly soft pads that compress lightly when in contact with the ground, allowing them to move silently without being noticed.\" She was just trying to scare you, and she sure succeeded, laughing even harder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves her paw off of your face and torso, keeping them on your legs just so that you don't run away. \"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Nicki~!</span>\" She says happily, before opening her mouth again like before. You close your eyes, accepting your fate, when you feel the front on your shirt being lifted. You open your eyes again to see that it's in the the Nickit's mouth, as she lifts you up by it, your legs are dragged from her paws. She then starts to walk, making you swing gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, this cannot get any worst...\" You mutter. The Nickit quickly lets go of your shirt then grabs it again, making you scream out a little. \"NOT FUNNY!\" You yell, as the Nickit snickers. Where is she taking you anyways?</span></div></div>",

Plus, any pokemon will be dangerous to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're currently in the route 2 of Melemele island of Alola!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention that you just arrive to Alola yesterday for take your vacations in this region! That's right, you come from Galar region. Few days ago... You decide to take your vacations in Alola region for also discover new pokemon and learn about the Z-moves. Of course, you bring a pokemon from your region with you and your pokemon is a female Indeedee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeedee is your first and only pokemon that you have right now. She deeply care of you, She don't really like fight and she is not good neither, but she really enjoy to pampering you. Your Indeedee doesn't really like been in a poke ball so you keep her out of her poke ball for the respect and she always walk by your side and she doesn't like when you go out without her even if you're able to take care of yourself. You and your Indeedee have a deep bond that she learns to speak telepathy but only with you in your mind. As she's not good for battle, you planning to get a Alola starter pokemon for the trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were in vacation, you planned to participating at the Alola trial. But now... There a big problem. You wake early in your apartment while your Indeedee's still sleeping, so you decide to take some air in the outside. After a while, you decide to take a nap on the grass and then this happen... Mew wakes you up, playing with you and then... shrink you down and leave you like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no hope to find Mew, you try to head back to your apartment. It has taking a while to making back as you travel the tall grasses and trying to avoid to encounter wilds pokemons who will a huge problematic as they are like dynamaxed to you! Eventually you make it but now there two problems. First, you have to climb the stairs which they're three times bigger than you! And second, the door of your apartment is closed and there no way you can open it and knocking the door won't help neither because you're too tiny for someone could heard you knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo frustrating, you cursed Mew for the mess she gets you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: With other option, you decide to head to the city and try to find help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Suddenly the door of your apartment open as your giant Indeedee come out and begin to looking for you!

Making as much sounds as you could really, and as it turns out that was not enough. No one even heard you, inside of the apartment or out. not even when you added screaming to the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! Come on open up! I know you are in the Indeedee, come on!\u201d you say banging until you had to give up. not strong enough to really do anything. You pout about it as you take several steps back, trying to figure out how you are gonna get in there. You can wait for your Pokemon to open it, but that is going to take ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Creak*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe not...\u201d You say as you turn around, seeing the doorknob twist and turn until finally, it was pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not only see the giant apartment that you were staying in, that seems to have changed to a whole new region, but your giant Pokemon in front of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeedee, was massive! Now normally she was not that tall, in fact you would say the word average to describe her size. To you now though, well she is Dynamaxed! Even bigger than that possibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take several steps back just marvelling at her size, as this was the first time she has ever truly towered over you. You\u2019ve always been bigger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeedee?\u201d It said, peeking it\u2019s head out and looking around. Clearly it\u2019s worried about you. She has always been kind and always thinking of you. To the point where she looks after you a bit too much. In the Pokedex, it has been said that the female ones have a sort of a babysitter\u2019s emotion, and you would say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she saw you weren\u2019t there though, that\u2019s when you suddenly realise. Indeedee was gonna close the door. You don\u2019t have time to yell her name, so you have to start running and following her! Sprinting into the apartment as fast as you could really. Not holding anything back as you just want to get in there. You run for a long time, as the close gets closer and closer to the point where it was shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it gets shut on you, you literally have no other option! You could wait until it opens up again, or you could just get in there now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd get in there now is what you did. Sprinting and running inside as you get to the other side. The door closed, and the force that was used sent you flying. A gust of wind so powerful it sent you flying just in front of your Pokemon\u2019s paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Indeedee noticed, as she still thought you were outside, thinking about you in a worried manner. She turned her giant body and walked away, as you saw her giant dangerous paw walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did feel a bit bad for telling her to stay inside, but you know a Galor Pokemon in Alola was just begging to be taken. Plus you have heard of Team Skull, so you were just not risking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she seemed bored.<br>\r\n\u2028As she walked around, she went over to your bed and started laying on it, her big stomach on for show as you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you were starting to feel tired and a bit out of it, Indeedee would let you lay your head on her stomach. You swear it was softer than any pillow that has been created. At your size now, it would be less of a pillow and more of the bed itself. Thinking about it for a couple of seconds, you question what you are going to do at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon was so far away, and it was not like you could risk waiting for it to come and step on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a couple of seconds as you suddenly remember. Focusing your mind, to intend to talk to her that. \u2018Indeedee, listen I know this might sound weird but I need your help. I\u2019m small and on the floor. Please pick me up.\u2019 You thought hard as you look up to her for any reaction. Only to be quickly reminded that she starts the talk, while you can not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown, you move down and rethink your game plan. What are you going to do at this point? Being small and useless sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou at the giant room you were staying at and frown. Are you really going to have to climb your giant bed, you don\u2019t want to but it seems you are gonna have to if you want to last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving around and getting close under, you move your hands around and try to think for a couple of seconds how you are going to get up there. Climb really is your best option?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s sad but it\u2019s the truth. Breathing in and closing your eyes, you get going and start making your way up. Slowly but surely, a simple Joltik climbing the way up. I went up for a real long time, going as high as I can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeedee not even being aware, as you had to make your way up. Even if you get her attention, what are you going to do. Indeedee is not strong enough to fight a Mew! Then again we probably won\u2019t even be able to find it in the end. You are NOT living the rest of your life this size, and you can\u2019t Dynamax humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown as you finally get up on top. Looking at your laying Pokemon as she has not even paid attention to you at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you were close to her, real close. You need to go around and get to her face. At that point, she has not only got to see you, but help you as well. After all, Indeedee loves you, and she is willing to do it for you.</span></div></div>",

Travelled the large tall grasses without getting caught by wild pokemon, climbing the stairs, getting inside of your apartment by luck, go after your giant beast maid pokemon and having to climbing your bed which it was even more challenging than climbing the stairs! It's like if you're doing extreme dangerous exercises... Oh man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, you sit down next to your giant pokemon to take a break for a moment, your shirt is already all sweaty by your own sweat. Looking at her round shape bottom body, you could imagined how comfortable would been if you laying on the top as you see her stomach raising up and down by her breath. Speaking of her belly, Indeedee has asking you a weird question about herself \"Hum... Master, I have a question... D-do... Do you think I look fat?\" she asking you shyly and of course, you reply \"*Chuckle* Of course not! You just have a round shaped on your bottom just like the other females!\" and for cheer her up you doing raspberries on her belly which it work as she's amusing and it get it out of her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway... Back to the reality, you snap out as you must continue. \"(Come on *Your name*.)\" you say to yourself \"(We almost there.)\" you walk on your bed passing by her side and at last, you reach to the side of her head as she still starting at the cell. You take a deep breath and here go nothing you begin to call her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeedee! Wake up!\" you scream as your giant Indeedee jump back in alert \"Dee?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeedee get up and look around still sitting on your bed. \"[Master? Where are you?]\" *That her poke speech which you can't understand what it saying*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeedee! Down here!\" you yell as she look down and saw your tiny form waving at her that cause her to jump back again, let out \"Indee!?\" noises and fell off of the bed. Not too long, she quickly get up and come take a close look at you. Putting her both hands paws on her mouth as she's immediately recognized you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Oh my...] she say with concerned expression before she begins to speak with telepathy. \"{Master *Your name*! Is that really you?!}\" *That's her telepathy speech and remember only YOU could heard her voice.* You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{What happened to you? Why are you so small?}\" she asks in shock, she's clearly worry about you right now and maybe worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Its a long story...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew moments later, after you explain her everything of what happened. Indeedee takes you on the table and serves you a flesh water glass. Without hesitation, you dive your head in and drinking the water as you can, because you need it. After you done the conversation continue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Thank you, Indeedee! I was seriously thirsty and it just what I needing!\" you say but it doesn't change the fact that your pokemon is not really happy for your situation as she's sit on the chair facing to your tiny size with a serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{So, let me get the straight. You met a legendary pokemon named Mew who come to playing with you and at the end it decides to shrink you down and challenges you to find it, correct?}\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. But now that's the problem, I don't know where is it and I can't tell if it still in Melemele island or-\" but then you get cut by your pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{How many times I have to tell you?} she says \"Huh?\" \"{You shouldn't go out without me.}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Indeedee! I'm 13 and soon 14 in few months and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{So, even small pokemons could be dangerous no matter how old you are!} she cut you again \"{Just look at yourself! We just arrived here and you got yourself shrunk by that legendary pokemon and what worst could happen to you?}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look even if you were been with me, you may end up to be shrunk as well. Plus you're not really good in battle. The only offensive move you know is Stored power and the rest of the moves are Play nice, Helping hand and Heal pulse whice you always use this move to heal my wounds every times I getting hurt. How cou-\" you getting cut again but this time it was by a loud slamming on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{ITS STILL NO EXCUSE TO GO OUT ALONE!}\" she shouting angrily in you mind. For the first time you get scared by your own pokemon even if you were at your normal size and she is a lot shorter than you, you'll still be scared when she's get angry. Then you saw tears come out of her eyes, she's... about to cry? \"{When you were gone... I was worried about you... you left without let me know... what if you get eating by another pokemon and I will never know about that you... you...}\" she cut her telepathy and begin to crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you feel guilty to that, she's right. How could you know you'll get yourself into trouble. This time you do get in trouble and this is by far the worse one. If you doesn't made it back, Indeedee will never know your fate and she's deeply care about you as you care about her as well. So, you walk towards your giant crying Indeedee and begin to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeedee...\" you call her as she looks at you \"I'm... sorry for the trouble... you're right I shouldn't go out alone like this... I didn't mean to hurt you that much but...\" she listens your words as you continue \"...But I promise I will never go out alone again and I want you to stay with me, because your my friend Indeedee... MY best friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{...Y-you will?}\" she asks as she wimp out her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will... promise.\" suddenly you feel a force enveloped as you begin to floating into air and you getting dragging towards your giant Indeedee who just catches you with her both hands and cuddly you against her nuzzle as she squeaking with joy by saying in her language \"Thank you! Thank you! THANK YOU!!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moments, she's finally calm down and bring you to her eyes level. \"{Thank you, master. Now, we'll find Mew and returned you at your normal size! But first...}\" then the happy moment stopped when Indeedee brings you closer to her face, sniff you and then back her head away in disgust and says.\"{...you need to take a bath. You smell sweat.}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed by her words, you sniff yourself and... yeah, she's right. \"Hum... good idea, Indeedee.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the bathroom, you were hiding in a case taking off your clothes while Indeedee prepared the bath. You going admit you're kinda uncomfortable be nude with the presence of Indeedee, even if it's a pokemon she still a female and you're a boy, you still feel it's kinda inappropriate. Then you hear Indeedee call you out. \"{Alright master, the bath is ready.}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Here we go.\" you come out of the case covering your private part, you walk on the corner and you see Indeedee has...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Fills up a small bowl as bath perfect for your size and she lets you wash yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Fills up a small bowl as bath perfect for your size but she insists to clean you by herself even if you could do it by yourself and make you feel really embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Fills up the bath of bathroom which it at size of large pool and there too much water.

You're the first person I tried this out with.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But my Pokemon Indeedee needs my help. She's alone in the motel room and isn't native to Alola at all.\" You try to explain to Mew, but she just doesn't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">They'll be fine being alone.</span>\" She says, now floating up in the air like she did before, but this time floating off from the motel. Laying down in the air, she sets you down in between her chest and belly. She then presses her wet nose onto your body like she did when she first shrank you with a gleeful look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think of anything else to try and convince Mew to let go of you and let you live normally, but nothing you'd say would convince her. You sigh and lay down on Mew's soft fur. Not really being able to do anything, you doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake back up, it looks like time has passed from noon to the afternoon. Looking down from your pink platform, you see clouds and... that's it really. \"Uh, Mew, where are you taking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, you're awake!</span>\" She says, avoiding your question. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I was wondering when you'd come around.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when you were about to ask again, you feel Mew begin to dive down. Looks like you don't need to ask, you were about to see it yourself. Once you pass the clouds and lower closer to the ground, you see a...</span></div></div>",

That Mew has shrunken you to a size that's even smaller than a Joltik and now, you are in great danger right now! Before meeting the mystical Pokemon, you were trying to get out of the forest and being too tried, you fell asleep. After you woken up, you saw her floating above you and for unknown reason, has shrunken you and abandoned you in this spot. You could've heard her say something about a little game in human language. You shrugged it off and thought that you are hearing things so right now, all you have to do is to get out of here alive before any Pokemon make a meal out of you. Not only that, but your new size makes your attempt at finding the exit even more of a challenge. Could this be what Mew is trying to do? Giving you an even more difficult adventure to make things more interesting? Guess so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the bushes at the center and make your way across it. This is the most riskest route you ever taken; the bushes are too dark to see and you could ended up getting spotted by a wild Pokemon. While you pushed the branches away as you go, you look around to make sure there's no danger around here. So far so good, there's nothing around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally got of bushes, completely unharmed. However, you are aware that this is only the beginning of your tiny adventure in this forest. You concluded that this is going to take days to find an exit around here and you are not sure how are you going to survive any longer. What you really need is something to speed things up like hitching a ride on a wild Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard something that wasn't so far from where you are. It almost sounded like a series of footsteps which later disappears afterwards. There's no denining that this is a sign that someone must be around. With that, you think about going to that person and hitch a ride on them to get out of this forest; you highly doubt that they will ever find you due to your very tiny size, but maybe you'll try to get their attention later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to your left of where you hear the noise and make a run towards the source. You can see a giant figure that is just standing at a clearing and by the looks of it, this person appears to be female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

Now you read the paper long enough, and you knew who this woman was since you lived in Eterna City. It was Gardenia, the grass type Gym Leader. This could not be better, you were near a Gym Leader. A smile on your face as you need to get going and get her attention. If anyone can help you it would be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus better then being with all the wild Pokemon in the forest who would want to eat you. You get going and start moving, but you have to stop yourself as she bended over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will admit, you have a bit of a perverted size, and seeing her giant ass sticking out like that. Well you just had to stare in awe. You have never seen it in person, but you have heard that she had a nice ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can testify. Not to mention your small size made it even bigger and you were being honest, even better. Guess there was one advantage to being so small. She walked around, walking around and looking some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her at the moment, as you chase her around. Not getting her attention just yet, but waiting and biding your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich turned out to be the right move, as suddenly she bent over to pick something up again. Giving you a good view of her tight booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this time you noticed something else, what she was picking up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was picking up flowers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one looks good.\u201d She said under her breath, surely not expecting a small person to be listening. \u201cI home she likes them. Oh tonight just has to be perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now you were a little curious about it. What does she mean by that. Sure you could get her attention, but you were going to follow and see what she means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around, grabbing more flowers until you put your thought into gear. Since you don\u2019t want to get her attention just yet, you are still gonna be prepared. So you go over and jump onto her boot. Dirt and grass on it as she turned her body around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, that should be nice. Just got to put it in a vase.\u201d She said to herself as you look at the giant girl. So it was going to be a present?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlowers from Eterna City. Seems about fitting for her, but who is she giving it too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at her curious for a couple of seconds until she said something you were honestly not expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis night has to be perfect, for Candice.\u201d Gardenia said with a type of determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were left stunned and thinking about this. This was for Candice, the Ice gym leader from Snowbelle City. You guess it makes sense, Gym Leaders would be friends, considering they share the same position. She must be coming down to visit her friend. That\u2019s what you thought, and didn\u2019t put more into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like jumping on her boot was the right move, cause as soon as you made that together, she started to move and walk away. She left and walked away going out of the forest. You freak out for a couple of seconds as you made sure you were safe and not going to be thrown around. Holding yourself as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, Gardenia would of been in the forest so many times, and seems to want to leave so you were safe. You were safe and not going to be thrown around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Gardenia knew her way out. In no time at all, she left the forest, making it seem easily if anything. Every step that she took though she covered a lot of ground, and you feel like you would of done pretty good yourself if you did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out and crossed the bridge to her city. Looking at it, you remember knowing it, but not at this size. What should you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell hang on for dear life. Why would you let go and be loose in the city, while you can hang on and be safe. So you do just that, as she walked around and away. Away for a long time as she got to her Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way in as she the doors opened, and she hurried her way to her quarters. You have no idea why she was so quick to impress Candice, but seeing that she was so busy, that was not good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should wait on getting her attention and help. Don\u2019t want to ruin her day and make her hate you. Granted you have heard that she was a nice woman, so chances are she won\u2019t do that. Still to be safe though and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought went away, as she entered her personal quarters and you saw... well you would say a screw chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandles ready to be light, clean as a whistle with a purple tone over it, as well as petals on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is planning to... she is planning to bed Candice. That\u2019s why she was so passionate about it, because well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know she was a lesbian? Regardless, you were in her room so you get off the boot. Getting to the side as you see the giant gym leader move around and get close to one of the desks. Putting the flowers in a jar and hanging it in a really nice place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you going to do? You can\u2019t get her attention now! She was obviously planning something big, and if you interrupted that, well you wouldn\u2019t be happy about it so you doubt she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hide and watch the whole scene. Getting their attention tomorrow and... well maybe get a view if things did get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour other option, well your other option was... a long shot to say the least.</span></div></div>",

Plus it seems to challenge you find it, but how you suppose to find Mew at your new size? Is this truly a game of Hide &amp; seek or a some kind of trap? Regardless Mew is already gone and you don't know where is she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe what Mew has done to you. She shrunk you down to 1 or 2 inches and leaves you like this. This is the worst thing that just happen to you! And what worse is also you have no pokemon partner! That's right, you're a 12 years old pokemon trainer who still have not caught a single pokemon and have no partner. There no way you will be able to find Mew at your new size and plus any wild pokemons will be very dangerous to you! They're all going to be like dynamaxed! Good thing you're not too far from Aspertia city, otherwise you'll have too survive from the wild. So, with no other option you decide to trying find help as possible as you head towards the city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Aspertia city, Bianca the 16 years old trainer who work as professor Juniper's assistance has just give the Unova starters to two new pokemon trainers Hugh and Nate/Rosa (You decide in the next chapter) walk down from the stairs chatting with the protagonist. The protagonist wondering about the last remain pokemon and Bianca replies \"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find a trainer eventually or otherwise I will take good care of it. Anyway, I have to head back to professor Juniper's lab so take care of your pokemon and good luck for your journey, bye!\" she waves at the protagonist as they wave back. However, at the moment she ran, she end up to trip by klutz and falls on the ground as the protagonist ran over to help her to get up and the poke ball that contain the last starter is sending fly out of the box...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you, you made in town without problem but now \"Oh my Arceus...\" the city is so huge! How are you getting attention of someone at your tiny size? You could easily get stepped and even end up to... *Funeral coffin dancing meme video* No! You'll survive and find a way to return at your normal size. But you wonder if peoples will believe that you got shrunk by Mew? Well, you do have the proof with your selfie picture with Mew but it also shrunk with you and it would be impossible for the normal sized person to see the picture not even a magnifying glass will help because your pokenav is kinda at the size of speck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your thought get interrupted by a large poke ball who is twice bigger than you landing right infront of you cause you to fall on your butt on the ground. \"What the...\" this is all you could say before the poke ball suddenly open front your eyes as the pokemon come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sitting on the ground, what you see is jaw drop. Infront you, there a like dynamaxed ______ standing there confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note this pokemon will becomes your first partner, but you must following the logic by what pokemon that Hugh and the protagonist have pick early.

However, she saw no one, which was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy, along with other two Pokemon, had been used to sit around in Professor Juniper's lab, awaiting for a trainer to come pick their first Pokemon; if she was called out, then that must mean that she was picked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the grass-type was vaguely excited about meeting her new trainer. Problem was, she couldn't find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you just sat there, eyes wide open and not making a motion; in front of you, the large Snivy didn't appear to have noticed, and you weren't sure whether that was a good or bad thing. You could see her massive, scaly stomach extending far above, where her head was turning left and right as the behemoth apparently looked for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you decided not to draw attention towards you and to shy away as quietly as possible, lest the Snivy ended up mistaking you for a snack and treating you as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you got back on your feet and began backing up. However, the motion caused the grass to rustle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy?</span>\" the large Pokemon called as she turned her head and looked down, finally spotting something in the grass. Or better, she spotted some<i>one</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">S-Snivy?</span>\" she stuttered, leaning down on her slim legs, getting onto her belly to better look at you, who were frozen by fear, which only amplified as you found yourself face to eye with the green and yellow giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seemed the Pokemon had no interest in causing you harm; instead, it looked like she was studying you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy felt confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was supposed to meet a trainer, that was why she had heard from Professor Juniper as well as her assistant Bianca, yet all she found was what appeared to be an incredibly small human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting her head slightly, giving a soft cry of her name, Snivy came to the conclusion that her trainer... must have been you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense. You must have been the one picking her, releasing you from her Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing this, the Pokemon shot you a haughty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\" she said, sounding... disappointed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please don't eat me!\" you blurted out once you regained enough courage to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni? Vy.</span>\" the Pokemon replied, shaking her head with a sigh. How had she even ended up with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you were her trainer now, so she supposed she had to stick with you... though it really looked like you were the one who needed to stick with someone right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the giantess rose slightly, muttering her own name a couple times, before reaching out a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\" she said, urging you to climb on with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks?\" you uncertainly said, surprised by this turn of events. Instead of eating you, it looked like the Snivy was actually lending you a hand... quite literally in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed on top of the paw, the giant Pokemon rose it back up as she herself rose to her feet and stood still, contemplating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared back at the Pokemon, unsure what you should have said. What was she even going to do to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you had to try and get her to help you out, maybe by asking her to bring you to someone or something like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know if she was going to listen or if she was even going to understand you, but... it was worth a shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey,\" you stuttered, still a bit afraid,<br>\r\n\"Look, I know that this may seem confusing and, trust me, it is, but I really, really need your help right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I met a, uh... Pokemon that did this to me earlier, that made me shrink to this size, and I need to find a way to get it back. So, can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the Snivy appeared to understand what you said, and the surprise became greater when you saw her nodding her head, signaling that she agreed to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're... going to help me out?\" you wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Vy.</span>\" the grass-type replied affirmatively, nodding her head once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... this was a relief, you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec, why are you helping me though?\" you asked. Snivy were supposed to be pretty cold Pokemon, from what you knew, but this one was willing to help you out even though she had just met you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the giantess gave a perplexed cry, then pointed to the ground; turning around, you saw the Pokeball she popped out of earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\" you said, trying to figure out what that meant; and, when the Snivy then pointed to you, it helped you realized that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You think I'm your trainer?\" you muttered under your breath, looking back at the green giantess, who nodded her head,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put a hand to your head, pensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had all been one major mistake... but one you could work with, because you really had no other choice; if this Snivy believed you were her trainer, you could convince her to do as you said, as long as you watched the way you said it: Snivy and their evolutions were extremely prideful creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay Snivy, first off...\" you trailed off, causing 'your' Pokemon to tilt her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't deny that the idea of actually having a Pokemon thrilled you, but you couldn't think about that right now, even though you really had no idea what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you go after Mew? Return home to sort things out? Find help from someone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head started aching, and you distractedly looked down, spotting Snivy's Pokeball again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, you supposed you shouldn't just leave that laying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Snivy, can you pick that Pokeball for me, please?\" you asked as nicely as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon nodded, then bent to pick the Pokeball, which she offered to you; it was about twice your size, making it impossible for you to carry, but pressing the button in the middle should do the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, once you did, the Pokeball shrank to the size of a soccer ball and fell next to you on Snivy's verdant palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you said, picking the sphere up, before looking back at the giantess, who was waiting orders from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure about what you should have done, you began pondering your next course of action. </span></div></div>",

Then Snivy pops out from it and thinks you're her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to feel that pokemon already belong to someone else and keep that pokemon may be a bad idea even if you wanted to. But stealing pokemon is no good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the best option is helping the pokemon to find it real owner, maybe the person will repay you by helped you to return at your normal size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the big poke ball that you hold with your both arms, it a little heavy for your size but you manage to carried this.

She felt something moving on her palm, she looks down and saw a person helding the poke ball in hand. Bianca takes a close look adjusting her glasses for make sure if she's not dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... H-hi there...\" you say awkwardly as her green eyes wided. \"Wh-WHAT!\" she scream as she almost falls on the floor as you hold yourself on her palm from her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca!\" another person that sound like a pre-teen girl arrives with a pig who follow her behind. \"Have you found it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Rosa but...\" she replies and shows the tiny person at her as Rosa's surprised by what she see in front her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? Why are you so small?\" one of the girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, you have explained what happened. About you met Mew, it playing with you, you taken a selfie with this pokemon and at the end Mew shrinks you down and leave you in that way, unless you find it. And then the part you meet Snivy and here we are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's what happened.\" you finished your story. The girls seem found it hard to believe that you meet the legendary pokemon Mew, but judging by your size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, I'm telling the truth and I did have a proof but...\" you look at your pokenav where you have the picture but it shrunk with you and there no way they could see the picture at your normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I believe you.\" Bianca says and Rosa believes as well. \"Thank you, girls.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, my name's Bianca. I'm assistant of professor Juniper, nice to meet you.\" she introduces herself to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Rosa, pokemon trainer and this is my partner, Tepig!\" she picks up her pokemon to show you as he greets you with a cry \"Tepig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is (Your name) and I'm a pokemon trainer too but... I kinda don't have a pokemon, yet...\" you awkwardly introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't have a pokemon.\" Rosa says and you nodded. Poor you, Rosa and Bianca feel really bad for you. Even Snivy who still out of her poke ball has listening the conversation. First she was still angry at you but until she heard that you have no pokemon, she begins to felt bad for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep thought, Snivy believes it would been a good idea to become your first pokemon. Maybe having a tiny trainer would not be that bad at all. Then a vile come out from Snivy's shoulder and reach for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment you feel something wrapped around your body, drag you off from Bianca's hand and bring you to Snivy's body. \"Snivy? What are you doing?\" the girls watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy doesn't replies as she brings you close her and presses you against her chest giving you a big hug. \"S-snivy!?\" you cried in embarrassing as she patted you head gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggle as they admire its cute. The Snivy looks at Bianca and tries something as she pointed at herself and then at you. Not too long before they get the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want be his pokemon, right?\" she asks and Snivy nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea! I'm sure professor Juniper will be okay with it. So what do you think?\" Bianca asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your answer, you look up at the giant Snivy who smiled down at you. Then you smile back, wide your arms and hug her back as you say \"I have no objection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its decided, Snivy is yours now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pokemon received music*<br>\r\nYou have received Snivy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Huh? Did I just heard a music?...)\" you look around \"(Nah! Must be my imagination.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I got my first pokemon but it still doesn't solves the problem of my size. Now what?\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know, you could come with us! Tepig and I will help you to find Mew and convince it to return you at normal size. Beside it'll be fun having more companions on our journey right, Tepig?\" Rosa suggests as Tepig agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or... I could take you to professor Juniper. I'm sure she and Fennel will find a way to fix you.\" Bianca says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... It seems not be bad their ideals. You always wanted to begin your pokemon journey as a trainer and become champion but at your new size... it'll been much harder. But at least, you'll have another trainer by your side. But if you go with Bianca to Juniper's lab, it maybe the best option but it'll probably going to be boring to wait, but at least you could probably play with your Snivy will during the wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at your new partner Snivy who seems to have no objection of your decision. So, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

The main reason was that it wasn't guaranteed that the professors could fix you, while Mew promised it would grow you back if you found it, meaning that going out would give better odds of growing then just staying still at a lab. Another reason was sort of silly, it's just that ever since you were young you wanted to be a pokemon trainer. While this isn't exactly the situation you imagined, it would still be awesome, riding a pokemon as small as a Snivy throughout the lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls and two pokemon stared down at you as you made your choice. \"I'd like to travel with Rosa and Tepig, if you wouldn't mind having me, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Isn't that right Tepig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Te-Pig!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca sighed. \"Alright, if that's your choice I won't complain. I'll still tell the professor about you so they'll be looking into it while you're keeping each other company. You should expect a call from them soon Rosa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the attention of your new partner Snivy by tapping on the vine that is still holding you. \"Hey Snivy, are you okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy put her paw up in a gesture mimicking an army salute. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Sni-Vy!\",</span> which you took to mean yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter plenty of precautions from Bianca including giving you her X-Transceiver number and such Bianca went her separate way towards the lab, while you stayed on Snivy's head as Snivy walked alongside Rosa. Rosa had tried to hold you herself but Snivy vehemently refused, seemingly very attached and protective of you. You trusted Rosa but said nothing, knowing that Snivy didn't mean any harm and shouldn't be reprimanded for something so minor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio of you walked through the gate and into the route outside of the town. Thankfully Snivy was a somewhat tall pokemon, as you could just barely look over the grass while on Snivy's head. You shuddered to think of how terrifying grass would be while blinded by it. You and Rosa talked through X-Transceivers, mostly to not make Rosa look crazy for talking to herself. While on your way to the next town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Hugh shows up and challenges Rosa to a battle. Wether Hugh finds out about you or not is up to you.<br>\r\nB: You work together with Snivy to catch a pokemon, either Snivy herself throwing the ball or you dropping it on a fainted pokemon.<br>\r\nC: Nothing happens and you successfully make it to the next town!<br>\r\nD: As promised, a call from Professor Juniper comes.<br>\r\nE: Rosa is the one that catches a new pokemon, which means a brand new Pokemon to introduce you to.</span></div></div>",

You and Rosa contine chatting to getting known each others. Then the conversation gets interrupted by a boy with a Oshawott standing on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rosa!\" Hugh calls her as he approaches the group who turned their attention at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi! Hugh, how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Oshawott and I have caught a lot pokemons. And how about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we just starting our journey... and we still haven't done anything, yet.\" Rosa puts one of her hand behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you listen the conversation from the two giants trainers who towering you, while your Snivy is distracted by a certain sea otter pokemon who keep staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Snivy turns her attention at Oshawott, his eyes begin to gleaming with a wide smile and blushing. Oshawott waves at Snivy in excitement as she rolls her eyes, letting out a sigh and wave back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong of the three starters, Snivy was the only female in the trio. Her relation with Tepig is neutral, but with Oshawott... its another story. Oshawott really likes Snivy and he even trying to flirt with her. Well... Snivy doesn't really hate Oshawott, but its just she's sometime annoyed by that otter when he tries to impressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Oshawott approaches Snivy, he pauses when he notices there something on her head or more like someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wott.. Osha-Oshawott?\" *\"Um... Snivy, you have an human on your head?\"*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy simply giggle, bring one of her vines, pull you off of her head, bring you to her paws and hold you close to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy vy sni-Vy, snivy vy vy sni.\" *\"So you finally notice it, Oshawott. This is (Your name) and he's my trainer.\"*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what is going on with the two pokemons but the fact your Snivy is showing you to Oshawott. You decide to introduce yourself to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Hi, my name is (Your name)... and I'm her trainer. Nice to meet you, Oshawott!\" you greet at the giant sea otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOshawott was stunned with jawdropped, he cannot believed what he just see, an tiny male human in the hands of Snivy. In same time Oshawott felt kinda... jealous. He wishes he could be in your place, been held by Snivy as a giantess would be... *dreaming*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Rosa &amp; Hugh, Hugh were about to asking a rematch. But until he notices Snivy standing next to Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.... is that Snivy?\" that caught your attention and Snivy's as well. \"What is it doing here? I thought Bianca had take it back to Juniper. Don't tell me that you convince her to give it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa giggles \"Not really, she's not mine. Snivy got her own trainer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Hugh looks around but there no one else. \"But where is the trainer? I don't it anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa giggles again and replies \"He's right there.\" she pointed at Snivy \"Take a close look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Hugh does what Rosa says as he crouch down in front Snivy. The snake pokemon who stared at him sighes and raise you up to give him a good view on you as you awkwardly wave your arm at him. Hugh's red eyes wided and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE F-\" that could be heard from the towns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of explanation about what happened, Hugh finds it hard to believed that you met the legendary pokemon Mew &amp; think that you must be shrunk by the Team Plasma which he hates them because they stole the Purrloin of his little sister and he will do everything to get it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you the truth, I also have a proof! I had taken a selfie with Mew and the picture is in my pokenav. But it shrunk with me and I don't think you could see this at your normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless if you could send the picture to my X-Transceiver\" Hugh says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment and slap yourself on your head. Why you don't think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I will try to send it to Rosa's\" you say since you know her number. You hope it'll working and success Rosa receives the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa looks in her X-Transceiver, Hugh takes a look as well and they could clearly the picture of you with Mew sitting on your laps. Both were amazed by the fact you truly met Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you believe me now?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" Hugh replies \"But is professor Juniper aware about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... We haven't receive a call from her, yet. But she should call us soon.\" Rosa explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Hugh \"Now then, how about we have a pokemon battle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you, Rosa and even the pokemons were surprised by his suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: As Hugh were say, he still want to take a rematch against Rosa. So, you and Snivy watch the match between Rosa and Hugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Hugh decides to challenge you instead Rosa. For your first battle, its your Snivy vs his Oshawott. You may have a chance to win, because Snivy has advantage against water. Unless if Oshawott got a lot stronger than you could expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Hugh decides to challenging both of you and Rosa in a double battle and he introduces his second pokemon.</span></div></div>",

It'll probably take us a while, though.\" Rosa answered, shooting you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sn-snivy.</span>\" Snivy chimed in. You patted her on the head,<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're fine walking all the way there?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni.</span>\" your Pokemon replied, nodding her head slightly, careful not to throw you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good sign, you guessed; usually, it took some work to gain a Snivy's trust, but this one seemed to have a decent amount of that in you; sadly, you couldn't say the same for Rosa, whom your Snivy won't even let touch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed she just had to learn to trust other people aside from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, your attempt at striking up a conversation failed miserably, as the trip continued as silent as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that changed the moment your X-Transceiver began ringing as an unknown number appeared on the display,  causing both Snivy and Rosa to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" the latter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, then cautiously picked up the call, wondering who it was; your question was answered when the image of a brown-haired woman with green eyes appeared on the screen, wearing a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! This is Professor Juniper, from Nuvema Town,\" the woman politely introduced herself, <br>\r\n\"And you must be the trainer Bianca had told me about, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you hesitated, unsure how to reply,<br>\r\n\"I think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca says that one of the Pokeballs she was supposed to deliver ended up getting lost, but someone found it and the Pokemon inside was fine with them being her trainer.\" the Professor explained,<br>\r\n\"Would that be you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you answered, blushing a bit,<br>\r\n\"I hope that's not a problem, um... Professor,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Professor Juniper smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all,\" she said, while Rose knelt beside Snivy to try and follow the conversation; Snivy just leered at the trainer and took a few steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally, I think that if a Pokemon chooses a specific trainer, then it's tantamount to a trainer choosing a Pokemon.\" the Professor continued, before waving a hand dismissively, <br>\r\n\"Anyway, that's not what I called you for. Bianca contacted me earlier, telling me about you; she referred about a... particularity of yours, developed upon your encounter with the legendary Pokemon Mew. I was hoping you could give me some details about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. Start from the beginning, please,\" Professor Juniper encouraged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you replied, feeling a bit uncomfortable,<br>\r\n\"So, it began earlier today, when I was sleeping on the outskirts of town. I was woken up and discovered that a Mew was there with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then proceeded to explain all that had happen during the short time you spent with Mew, from her playing silly games with you to her shrinking you down to size, challenging you to find her before taking off; then, you explained your encounter with Snivy, then with Bianca and Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then we decided to travel together, in search of Mew.\" you finished, Rose doing a silly victory pose beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of your tale, Professor Juniper looked slightly skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she said, adopting a serious expression,<br>\r\n\"Look, can you demonstrate what you are saying in any way? You don't need to, but I would appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I had a picture, but... hold on,\" you said. It would be much easier showing your proof to the professor, since you could simply send her the selfie you had taken with Mew. You guessed that tech was a blessing, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few moments of silence, during which the Professor appeared to be looking somewhere else, before she finally looked back at you with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is undoubtedly a Mew. Thanks for sharing,\" she told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way to... y'know, fix me?\" you asked, not bothering to hide the anxiety in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni-snivy!</span>\" Snivy intervened, curious about that as well; having a doll-sized trainer was sort of cool, but she guessed that having a full-sized one meant she didn't have to take care of you all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor looked to the side with a flustered smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... not any that I know of,\" she replied, causing you to groan,<br>\r\n\"But I can at least try to find a way, so that, even if you don't find Mew, we can at least give it a shot ourselves. Because, I'm sorry to say, I think the chances of finding that Mew again are considerably low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez...\" Rosa complained,<br>\r\n\"It's almost like you <i>don't</i> want us to find Mew, Professor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that, I'm sure everything is going to be just fine.\" Professor Juniper reassured,<br>\r\n\"So, I'll be going now, I wish you two the best of luck. And, take good care of your Snivy, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor offered one last smile, before she ended the conversation, leaving you back with Rosa and Snivy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief.\" the former commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, though I'm hoping to find Mew as well. It would give this journey much more sense.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and speaking of journey, we should probably.\" Rosa said playfully, getting back up,<br>\r\n\"C'mon, on to Floccesy Town!\" she said, marching forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy looked at her with contempt, which you noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that, at least she's eager.\" you chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Vy.</span>\" Snivy huffed with a shrug as she went to follow Rosa. </span></div></div>",

Because she the only one who could carrying all the stuffs in her bag, while you're too tiny for carry them and Snivy cannot just carried the stuffs all by herself. And in your bag that shrunk with you, you only have your town map and some of your clothes like pyjama, swimsuit, coat, costume and some other trainers outfit, and at least you can change yourself later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you finally made it to Flocessy Town without encounter any wild pokemon yet. As Rosa leads the way, you suddenly getting stop by a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there, trainer!\" the voice calls from the high as Rosa and your Snivy stop walking look up and you as well and saw a man standing on the top of the cliff and then he suddenly jump off the cliff and lands right on his feets in front the gang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed by this man how he landing from the high cliff without getting hurt. You wonder how he do this, but regardless you don't even want to try it, it would been suicide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon, the man turns towards Rosa, you recognized this man, it's Alder the champion of Unova! Well, he was the champion but now he's retired for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo pay attention at the conversation as Alder examines the teenage trainer girl as you still were amazed by meeting the former champion. Then Alder turns his attention towards your Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he thinks that pokemon is Rosa's partner but until... \"And I guess that pokemon is y-\" he pauses when he notices there something on the pokemon's head as he crouch down to take a close look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, you realize that Alder had finally noticed you as you getting nervous. However, Snivy notices it too, quickly she snatches you from her head with one of her vines, brings you to her arms and holds you against her chest in a protective pose like if she's holding her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Darn it, Snivy!)\" you muffled \"(We seriously going to talk about it!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa laughs about Snivy's action and decides to explained at about what happened for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, not too far in the bushes, a shadow figure with greenish blue eyes watches the trainers chatting with the former champion but what is really caught it attention is the tiny human who ride on Snivy's head. For some reason its interested it as it smirk, revealed it teeths and chuckle. It seems to have some planned to have fun with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rosa finishes to explained your situation. Alder understands, it goods to known that Juniper's aware about it, he also surprising by the fact you met the legendary Mew which he never meets this one before. But in the other side, he still concerned of your situation, he wonders if it really a good idea for you to go in journey at this size, he would like to help you but he doesn't really have much free time for this, at least you have Rosa to help you, but still not sure about it. At the end, he decides to go with, hoping you stay safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alder leads the two news trainers in the town, the mystery figure watches them headed to the town and it decides to go after them. Before it come out from it hiding spot, it suddenly glows dark purple and begin to changing form and what come out from the bushes is a youngster boy with a creepy smile expression who walks bizarrely on his two legs and heads towards the town. A gray tail is visible on his rear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you, Alder leads Rosa and you still riding on your Snivy to the college.

Revealed to be a small gray fox with a ponytail on the top of his head, which this pokemon is none other than Zorua the tricky fox! And then, he continues to following his target (you) as he remained hiding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you, arrived at Floccesy Ranch entrance. You, Rosa, Snivy and Tepig notice a small blue creature playing at bouncing on it large blue tail ball. This pokemon is known as Azurill, as Rosa scan this one with her pokedex and it revealed to be pokemon normal and... fairy type?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy type? I never heard this before...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa was about to say the same thing until she remember something. Early when she received the pokedex, Bianca has mentioned that professor Juniper has received new information from Kalos region that a new type pokemon has been discover and they have to update the Unova dex for the new info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondering how do they haven't discover this before. While Rosa replies with the sign \"I dunno\". Anyway, leaving the Azurill alone, because it doesn't seem to be alone as there two Azumarills approached the little one, that must be it parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two approach the farm, you saw two farmers with one Herdier. Rosa suggests to asked them if they have see Hugh. But you got a ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosa, wait! I got idea!\" you yell as the giantess trainer stops, turn her attention to you and crouch down for better hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you go to ask them while Snivy and I will wait on the bench.\" you reply. That surprised her even your Snivy. \"Look I know... but I don't want to freak them out if they saw me at this size. But I also want to speak with Snivy alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vy?\" your Snivy says by what she just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa didn't like the idea to split out but if it's important to speak with your pokemon in private. She sighes \"Alright, but just don't go too far. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you watch the giantess goes up to her full height and walk toward the farmers with her Tepig who follow her alongside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zorua watches the group separated in two direction. Its now his chance to play a trick with you, a smile grows on his face as he just got a ideal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rosa, Rosa asks at the farmers if they have see a boy with blue hair, red eyes, with a red jacket, etc. They say they do have see him and he helped them to find their lost Herdier. She thanks them and before go after Hugh, she must head back to get you and Snivy. As she goes back, suddenly a wild Riolu jumps out from the tall grasses, landing right in front Rosa, blocking her way and it doesn't seems to want let her pass without a fight. Guess Rosa haven't no choice but accepted the challenge and beside she could try to catch that Riolu if she could. With her Tepig ready, the fight begin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you, your Snivy walks toward the bench with you still sitting on her head, she uses her vine to pick you up and place you on the bench. Then Snivy hops on the bench, sits right next to you and listens what you have to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you want to talk is about her attitude toward Rosa and you would like your Snivy gives her some respect. Because when she leers at Rosa, stepped back from her and hold you tight against her chest, you feel like a doll that the pokemon doesn't want to be taken away. And you don't want it go too far or worst. You trust Rosa as a friend and Snivy should do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to tell at your Snivy about this, a shadow figure approach. \"Alright, Snivy. We need talk about...\" *Shadow looming above you* \"...Rosa? You're back already? So, what they say?\" however you notice a smirk on her expression as she's just standing in front you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Rosa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa still say nothing, instead she brings her hand toward you trying to pick you up. Snivy notices that and hisses at her, but Rosa ignores her as her hand reached toward you and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Whip*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy use Vine whip on Rosa's hand as she steps back screaming in pain. And what you heard it's not Rosa's voice but a pokemon noise and when she turns it revealed there a tail above of her rear. That make you realize that's not Rosa as the illusion wore off revealed the imposter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... a Zorua?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Zorua glare at Snivy and prepare to attacked her and the pokemon battle begins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: As his plan failed, Zorua got a idea to trying to convince you to let him join in your journey, you're happy to let him in but Snivy in other... She's not certain to trust that fox. Plus, Rosa have the empty poke ball, so you have to wait her return. But can you really trust that pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Before you or your Snivy could do anything, Zorua fled. You thinking about to go after him but you get interrupt by the real Rosa who come back with a new pokemon she caughts Riolu and leads you to find Hugh. However, Zorua have not say his last word...</span></div></div>",

But it'll help us bond with our Pokemon, with each other and it'll be tons of fun, too!\" Rosa replied excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really know how to reply, so instead you looked down at Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" you asked, but she didn't listen, as she and Rosa's Tepig were busy talking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clred\">Perhaps it's better if we don't battle.

I'm just going to assume that's a yes.\" you said, turning to Rosa,<br>\r\n\"So I'm in, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTh giantess smiled and began walking away, stopping when she put some distance between you and her; while she dropped her bag, your Snivy quietly picked you off of her head and placed you on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy?</span>\" she asked you, for the first time displaying a slight glint of concern in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be fine, I think.\" you reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy hesitated, but then adopted a straight face again as she nodded and turned her back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Let's do this, then.</span></u>\" she cried, noting how Rosa's Tepig was already waiting, and so was his trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, are you two ready?\" Rose asked; then without really waiting for an answer, she declared,<br>\r\n\"We'll make the first move! Tepig, use Tackle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Tepig sprinted towards Snivy at full speed, catching you off guard - for such a small Pokemon, he sure was fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to give a command as well, but when you opened your mouth to, you realized something: you had no idea what moves Snivy knew, aside from Vine Whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh...\" you hesitated as Tepig approached your Pokemon...<br>\r\n\"Dodge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the very last second, Snivy jumped out of the way, resulting in Tepig stopping his run as his opponent swiftly landed beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, use Vine Whip Snivy!\" you ordered, though noticing that your Pokemon was shooting you a diffident look; regardless, she did as told... but Tepig seemed completely unfazed by the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A grass-type move won't have much effect on a fire-type...\" Rosa pointed out, before adding,<br>\r\n\"But it'll be super-effective the other way around! Use Ember, Tepig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red and black swine followed the order and shot a wave of hot air through his nostrils, hitting Snivy, who cried her name in pain; Rosa's assault wasn't finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tepig, use Tackle once more!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Snivy was off-guard, Tepig charged at her and hit her, sending her flying; then, on Rosa's command, Tepig jumped surprisingly high and struck his opponent with tackle once more; this resulted in Snivy crashing to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. You didn't expect to win your first battle, but you didn't expect to lose this fast, either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy!\" you called, running towards where you saw Snivy landing; on the other side of the field, Rosa watched, shooting an apologetic look, before looking at Tepig,<br>\r\n\"I guess we went a little overboard there, Tepig...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">Tepig...</span>\" the small swine agreed, though he felt a smirk crawling on his cheeks.<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"clred\">Told her so...</span></i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you finally reached your Pokemon and rushed up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy, are you okay?\" you asked in concerned manner; you doubted a couple of Tackles had done much damage to her, but she was definitely hurt.<br>\r\n\"C'mon girl, talk to me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your relief, you saw Snivy opening her brown eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sn-snivy...</span>\" she moaned, before you saw her expression changing as she eyed you; she looked very...</span></div></div>",

How about you?</span></u>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, don't worry.\" you replied, guessing what she said to you and apparently guessing right, because she nodded and began to stand up; while she did, you felt the inexplicable need to comfort her, even though she seemed to barely care about losing her first battle.<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's fine, anyway. Life's not always about winning, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy began dusting herself off, muttering her own name under her breath in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the grass-type lowered her paw for you to climb on, which you did, before Rosa and her Tepig, who wore a teasing smile on his face, approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, are the two of you alright?\" the giantess asked, lowering herself to examine Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Tepig couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clred\">Did I hurt you that much, Snivy?</span></u>\" he said teasingly, earning a cold stare from the grass-type, who didn't even reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine.\" you answered Rosa, before sheepishly looking down,<br>\r\n\"Though I guess I did <i>that</i> bad for my first battle, hehehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not nearly as bad as you believe, but... definitely could've gone way better.\" Rosa said, before wearing a reassuring smile,<br>\r\n\"But, hey, we're all inexperienced here, so don't worry much about it. You'll learn in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did barely land a hit.\" you recalled,<br>\r\n\"How was that 'not nearly as bad as you believe'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, your Snivy sent you a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, relax! I'm not saying it was your fault!\" you reassured,<br>\r\n\"I mean, I didn't even know what moves you could use back there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Tepig began laughing and Snivy groaned, once more looking at you with the same haughty look she looked at you when you first met her earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, don't give me that look, I didn't even know this was going to happen at the beginning of the day!\" you defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can fix that easily!\" she said as she pulled out her Pokedex from her bag, before looking at Snivy,<br>\r\n\"Now Snivy, do you mind giving me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy hissed and stepped back, clutching you to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay! You keep him, girl!\" Rosa hastily said, before pointing her Pokedex at your Pokemon,<br>\r\n\"Let's see... okay, Snivy knows three moves: Tackle, Leer and Vine Whip, though you already knew about that last one since you used it against Tepig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it barely did a scratch on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTepig adopted a smug look and began waving his paw,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">Te-piiig...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it was a grass-type move against a fire-type, you dummy! I've already told you!\" Rosa said with a laugh,<br>\r\n\"Snivy's a grass type, so her moves will be very effective on water, ground and rock-types, while they'll barely do anything to fire, poison and flying ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" she said,<br>\r\n\"Now, let's talk about strategy- oh, wait.\" she said, turning to dig into her bag once more, emerging with a red bottle that looked like a spray of some sort,<br>\r\n\"First, give this to Snivy. It'll help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were handed the bottle, that was easy the same size as you were, if not slightly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks?\" you said,<br>\r\n\"What is this, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A super potion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Okay.\" you said, turning to Snivy, comically holding the bottle like you were hugging it,<br>\r\n\"Okay Snivy, this'll help you feel better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy nodded her head, complying, as you began spraying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Rosa sat down on the edge of the route, with her Tepig happily jumping on her lap; Snivy sat down beside her, you on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of ironic how you were basically the opposite of Rosa with her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now let's talk combos,\" Rosa resumed from where left off,<br>\r\n\"You saw what I did back there, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went all-out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong... well, not really, but the point is: have you seen how we used Tepig's moves?\" the giantess asked, not waiting for an answer,<br>\r\n\"Tepig used Ember to blind Snivy, then he attacked while she couldn't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clred\">Ouch...</span></u>\" Tepig mocked, earning a growl from Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it now,\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"But how can I do that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... with the moves Snivy knows, a combination of Leer, which can lower a Pokemon's defense, and Tackle can be very effective.\" Rosa explained, putting a finger to her chin in a cute thinking pose,<br>\r\n\"Or maybe, you could use Vine Whip to incapacitate your opponent, that would be very useful, too. Limiting your opponent's movements while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... While Snivy attacks them...\" you continued, starting to understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never really studied about Pokemon and their moves before, but you were starting to understand, which was good: you certainly couldn't take on Mew, if that was the case, with the level of experience you had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Will result in a great attack!\" Rosa happily finished,<br>\r\n\"I see you're getting the 'hang' of it, hehehe. However, you should know that those combos won't always help if the moves are ineffective against other types. Don't worry though, Snivy'll learn more moves later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that.\" you said, recalling a gym battle you witnessed to, once: the challenger used a Serperior, and it was incredibly fast, not to mention powerful - it literally blew away the gym leader's own Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould your Snivy become that much powerful as well? Well, with enough practice, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, about abilities...\" Rosa continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa kept explaining things for a while more, about how moves could be used with a Pokemon's abilities to create devastating consequences on an opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your case, Snivy had the ability 'Overgrow', which powered up grass-type moves whenever Snivy's health was lowered enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRisky, but pretty useful if you needed to turn the tables in a hard battle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened closely to the advice you were given and, judging from the look on her face, Snivy was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, Rosa stopped talking and looked at her X-transceiver. Her eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at the time!\" she said, looking up - the sun was slowly setting,<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize it was that late! Aw man, we're going to have to spend the night in Floccesy Town...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound bad...\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that's assuming we get there in time!\" Rosa said, her Tepig jumping off as she stood up; however, the giantess then hesitated, seemingly thinking. Or better, rethinking,<br>\r\n\"... But hey, there's probably still a bit before the sun sets. So, why don't you and Snivy practice a bit?\" she suggested with a confident smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You just contradicted yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sn-Snivy.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, geez...\" she said,<br>\r\n\"But I think you should practice, for a little bit at least. Y'know, to put what I've told you to the test. I'll leave it up to you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure, you looked down at Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What d'you say?\" you asked. The grass-type shrugged,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that left the choice up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a moment. There would be plenty of time to practice later, you guessed, but maybe you should take some time to do as Rosa suggested?</span></div></div>",

Your eyes wided by the large bike before you ask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... where your bike comes from?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From my bag, of course!\" the giantess replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its simple, I put my bike in my... huh?\" then Rosa paused a moment when she just realized that her own bag is much smaller than her bike and don't remember how she has done that. She looks down at you, Snivy and Tepig which all the three of you were focused on her before she continues. \"...well I don't know how I have done it....\" she finished awardly cause all the three of you to let yourself fall on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, lets move on.\" Rosa picks her fire pig up and places him in the basket of the bike which it has enough space for two small pokemons. When Rosa turns towards you and Snivy, she was about to pick your Snivy up but without warning Snivy grabs you from her head, holds you to her chest and jumps on Rosa and then jumps on the basket next to Tepig. That almost give you a heart attack by Snivy's action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa sighes as she sits on the seat and says \"Alright, everyone hang on and let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa drives towards to the town as Snivy and Tepig hang on the basket with you hanging in Snivy's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after the ride, you arrive at Floccesy town at last. So what happen next?</span></div></div>",

Once it was done, she turned around and winked at you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's how I did that.\" she said cutely. You gave a thumbs-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" you asked, looking around,<br>\r\n\"Should we look for a place to crash in for the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can agree on that, but there won't be no need to search: the Pokemon Center's got rooms.\" Rosa explained as she walked past Snivy with Tepig trotting by her side; the giantess stopped for a moment, looked back and gestured for Snivy to follow,<br>\r\n\"C'mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough hesitantly, Snivy obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was fairly quiet, mainly because the streets were almost deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Rosa stopped in front of a large building with a red roof, the unmistakable symbol of a Pokeball glowing lazily in the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Rosa looked at Snivy, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Snivy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass-type looked at the giantess, the sudden motion of her head causing you to bounce a bit. Rosa pointed her finger to you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I really need you to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy didn't even let her finish and hissed her name threateningly, easily guessing what Rosa was going to say; you did too, knowing where Rosa was going to say: it'd be weird for people if they saw a Snivy walk in with her trainer riding on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy.\" you stepped in, causing her to look at you,<br>\r\n\"Do as she says, give me to Rosa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni, snivy!</span>\" Snivy protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on! If she was going to try anything, she would've done it already!\" you chided, deciding to take the risk and put your foot down,<br>\r\n\"Look, I trust her, okay? Now, just give me to her, and nothing's going to happen, 'kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy looked at you in silence for a couple seconds, and so did Rosa; then, grumbling her own name, your Pokemon hesitantly obeyed and picked you from her head, handing you to Rosa, who smiled - this was the first time she got to hold you, something she found extremely cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" she said, before looking at you,<br>\r\n\"Um, I have to... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide me, I get it.\" you finished. Rosa nodded, moving you closer to her bag,<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, your Snivy won't freak out over this...\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention, you glanced back at Snivy, who was, in fact, glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine.\" you reassured, <br>\r\n\"Just for a couple minutes, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy dropped the glare, though she didn't feel very reassured. She trusted her trainer, but not the other one; so, as Rosa placed you inside of her bag, Snivy swiftly leaped from the ground her shoulder: if she was going through with this, she was at least going to keep a close eye on Rosa, whom she still didn't trust with her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid girl sighed as she headed inside, approaching the nurse, who flashed a smile,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she greeted,<br>\r\n\"How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to heal my Pokemon,\" Rosa replied with a smile of her own as she picked up Tepig, digging her other hand in her bag to retrieve his Pokeball, scaring you in the process,<br>\r\n\"And I'd also like a room for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" the nurse replied while Rosa called Tepig back, placing the Pokeball on the counter; the nurse looked at Snivy,<br>\r\n\"And your Snivy...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine.\" Rosa replied, knowing full well that the grass-type wasn't going to move from her shoulder until you were brought out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse didn't insist, but took Tepig's Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later, she returned with the same Pokeball and a key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, I hope you enjoy your stay.\" the nurse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Rosa said cheerfully, grabbing the key and her Pokeball, heading to the room she was assigned to, releasing a completely healed Tepig in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want to be healed too, Snivy?\" Rosa asked gently, getting no reply: Snivy was staring at her bag intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa rolled her eyes, suddenly looking forward to pulling you out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were finally pulled out from Rosa's bag, you were in a completely different environment; you were in a small, simply furnished room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place.\" you commented from the middle of Rosa's palm as she dropped her bag to the ground, causing Snivy to jump down as well, startled; Rosa's hat followed the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" she barely had the time to answer, right before a certain grass-type jumped up, attempting to grab you; instinctively, Rosa stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy! Seriously, quit that!\" you scolded,<br>\r\n\"Nothing is going to happen! Just trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy immediately stopped, though she looked very upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps that was a bit too harsh.\" Rosa commented, kicking off her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but jeez...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiled and walked to the bed, followed by your Snivy; she wasn't going to oppose, she decided, since it seemed to bother her trainer, but until she wasn't sure Rosa could be trusted, she wasn't going to risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, Rosa was sitting on the bed with Snivy and Tepig on each side of her and you sitting atop her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm beat...\" you moaned, stretching,<br>\r\n\"So, what now? Do we just call it a day?\" you addressed Rosa.</span></div></div>",

Please don't scare me like that!\" Bianca says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Rosa say in her normal volume but as you were close to Rosa's face, her voice booms at your X-transceiver cause to let out a hyper voice move from Bianca's X-transceiver that alert the neighbors and wild pokemons from her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too loud!\" Bianca says as Rosa quickly covers her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rosa just got a idea. \"Hold a moment...\" she whispered as she places you on the bed next to your Snivy, then goes up, grab her X-transceiver and head towards the bathroom.

There's not much to says beside getting know each other, having your first pokemon battle and learning information about your Snivy. And then here we are, at the pokemon center in Floccesy town. Still having not catching a new pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see. By the way, you don't really have to hide yourself. Professor Juniper has already contacted the pokemon centers about your status. The nurses Joys must already be aware about a trainer that got shrunk by Mew.\" Bianca explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" you and Rosa says in same time as Bianca nodded.<br>\r\nYou groaned about how pointess that was to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And about fixing your size... no much info for now, but I believe we'll find a way to fix you eventually.\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for the info...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Before we go, I have a little gift to give you, (Y/N).\" Bianca says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Due of your tiny size, I was thinking about to give a second pokemon partner.\" Bianca says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!\" you say even Rosa, Snivy and Tepig were surprised by heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but its not Oshawott, instead its one of the starter from Kanto: Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle. Actually, that was for Juniper's research, but as I was worry about you, I decide to send one of them to you. Don't worry, I have the permission of professor.\" Bianca explained. \"So which one you want? I will send you the pokemon right at way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe that you receive a Kanto starter pokemon, even Rosa's Tepig seems to be exciting to your new member, as for Snivy... well... you only hope she'll get along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which Kanto starter pokemon you pick?</span></div></div>",

Thanks for the info, Bianca!\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Anyway, take care of Bulbarsaur and good luck on your journey and you too, Rosa. Bye!\" then Bianca hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hang up you X-transceiver, Rosa comes back from the bathroom and sit down on bed carefully for not bouncing you high. Snivy was almost about to grabs you and doing her overprotective on you but at the end she didn't instead she allows Rosa to picks you up for once. Because she know that it bother you and you trust Rosa as friend, however Snivy still don't fully trust Rosa yet, so she keeps a eye on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, someone knocks at the door as nurse Joy enters in the room with a poke ball in her hand which that contain Bulbarsaur. Before nurse Joy could say something, she stops sooner when she saws a tiny boy sitting on Rosa's palm who wave at her nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're must be the young boy that professor Juniper has talking about.\" Joy says and surprisedly she remains calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.

Tepig seems to be very excited to meet your Bulbarsaur while Snivy's still neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa throws the poke ball on the bed where you, Snivy and Tepig are on and Bulbarsaur comes out from his poke ball and appeared right in front you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bulbarsaur opens his eyes, the first thing he saws is an tiny human standing in front him cause him to look confused. \"Saur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you kinda getting nervous to facing toward a giant Bulbarsaur, but you give yourself the courage to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Bulbarsaur, I'm your trainer...\" that cause at your new partner to jawdrop and widen his eyes as you continued \"Look, I know it's weird but I got shrunk by a certain psychic pokemon and I need help to find that pokemon who did that to me for it returns me to my normal size. Would you be my pokemon and helping me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulbarsaur has listening your explanation, after a moment he smiles and nodded at you. To say he accepts you to be his trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Welcome to the team, Bulbarsaur! By the way, my name is (Your name) and this is Snivy, my first partner.\" you point at Snivy as Bulbarsaur looks at her who simply wave at him.

You let Bianca know, which she simply nodded to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll send it over to the  Pokecenter and It'll be there in the morning. Just ask Nurse Joy about the gift from me, and she'll have it out for you in a jiffy. Well, I think I've taken enough of your time and Snivy looks ready to jump you as soon as this call is over, and I'd hate to delay her any longer. Sleep well, I hear the Charmander is an affectionate little lady, so you'll need all your energy to keep up with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Transceiver blinked off and, true to Bianca's words, Snivy jumped to grab you instantly. Since Rosa wasn't there to stop her this time, she successfully managed to catch you in her arms then jump up on top of a shelf that Rosa couldn't reach. Thankfully, you still had the X-Transceiver in hand, so you informed Rosa of the situation. She sighed, but ultimately accepted that Snivy probably was starving for contact with you after being forced away for so long, so she just accepted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy curled around you in a tight loving grip,  not letting anyone touch her trainer. In a weird way this made you relax there more. Eventually, Snivy fell asleep  and you followed her in sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sunlight from the morning shone upon you, you woke up, having had this sleeping schedule since you were young. Snivy was still sleeping, so you rubbed her awake, and she blearily lifted her head and said, \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy, Snivy?</span>\", which you took to mean good morning. Snivy lifted you back up and jumped back down from the shelf, which was alot scarier then going up. Thankfully, Snivy had near perfect grip and balance, and landed softly on the empty bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, empty bed? Then where's Rosa?' You thought to yourself. Not a moment later though, Rosa came into the room holding a pokeball in her hand, with Tepig's pokeball still on her waist, which could only mean one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Charmander?\" You asked her, although the answer was fairly obvious. Rosa responded with a simple \"Yep\", before opening the pokeball and releasing your new friend to the world. The Pokemon that came out was surprisingly not the standard orange color, but instead a golden yellow color, which was the shiny form of Charmander, a significantly rare genetic difference of around 1 in 6000. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Charmander came out, she looked around for her trainer, first, she looked up at Rosa and asked with a simple \"<span class=\"cyellow\">Charmander?</span>. When Rosa shook her head, Charmander looked around for anyone else that could be a trainer. When she noticed you, she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A: Sprinted over and swiped you from Snivy's grasp, angering her greatly, causing the two of them to constantly fight over you.)<br>\r\n(B: Talked to Snivy and learned about you. They eventually came to an understanding that they were the only two allowed to watch over you alone.)<br>\r\n(C: Tackled both you and Snivy to the ground in one fell swoop. It seems the part about being affectionate was slightly underplayed.)<br>\r\n(D: Refused you as her trainer, telling Snivy that you were worthless, causing a rift between Charmander and both Snivy and You.)<br>\r\n(E: Acted High and mighty, demanding you do all sorts of things for her, as she was shiny.) <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However in your case, with your size. You can\u2019t help but worry. What if she denies you, and just sends you an ember.

Because she looked to Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChar?\u201d She said, her pointed claw down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnivy.\u201d Your Pokemon nodded her head. The two of them became closer to you, as they talked above you. You were left waiting and staring at your giant Pokemon as they talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like they are making decisions about you?\u201d Rosa giggled from the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s kind of backwards.\u201d You say back to her. \u201cAlthough, I hope it\u2019s good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for a long while, until Charmander looked down to you. Her eyes on you, as she moved her hand down to you. She moved her hand and grabbed you. Now with her sharp claws, you were expecting the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was gentle. You can\u2019t argue that. You were grabbed by her two arms and raised up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously you chuckle. \u201cWell, haha, I guess I am your trainer. Hope you are okay with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChar!\u201d She chimed happily., as you think that was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait a second. Are you seriously happy about this! That\u2019s great! I promise Charmander, I will be the best trainer I can be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMander!\u201d She cheered, just as happy as she brought you in. She must of gotten some warm hugs, cause she was giving you one right now. Holding you against her chest as she gave you a big cuddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww...\u201d Rosa had to say, seeing the cute moment from the side. \u201cYou got two Pokemon already, and they are big fans about you. Maybe there is something about a small trainer that Pokemon just love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, maybe.\u201d You say against the scales of the starter. Not only do you have a Charmander as well, she was also shiny. How lucky can you really be. Suddenly, you felt yourself turned around. Your back to her scales as she crossed her arms over you. \u201cI uh... Charmander, thank you for the hug but you can let me down if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCh-Ar!\u201d She said shaking her head in a no. You figured it was that, and you were not really happy about it. She happily defied you, oh uh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Snivy, a little help here?\u201d You say to your grass Starter. However... she did the exact same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSni-Vy.\u201d She said shaking her head in a no as well. In their minds, you were there trainer who needs to be protected.. So they might as well carry you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at them for a couple of seconds, until Rosa had to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What\u2019s so funny?\u201d You wonder your way to her, as she simply laughed and found it funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cit\u2019s just... you aren\u2019t really in charge of your Pokemon are you. You went from one overprotective Pokemon, to two! You got to admit, it\u2019s a bit funny.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to Rosa, before you laughed as well. \u201cYeah, it is pretty funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, anyway now that is done! Let\u2019s get going on the road. I\u2019ll put you in my...\u201d Rosa trailed off, seeing that she was not actually going to be able to do that. She planned on putting you in her bag and walking, but with these two... maybe she won\u2019t even get you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey... can I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnivy!\u201d Your snake said, bringing her chest close to you as well as they both defended you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s not an option.\u201d Rosa said a bit confused. \u201cNow what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh... I got an idea.\u201d You say speaking up about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Charmander, you really like that doll that I bought you!\u201d Rosa said out loud, walking her way through the Pokecenter being trailed by three starters. Only one of them being hers. Once outside, she took a breather and walked with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that worked.\u201d She said with a smile. \u201cAre you gonna play doll whenever you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... depends on who we find.\u201d You say to her as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are as cute as one.\u201d Rosa said down to you as she found that funny to. She was okay with calling you cute. She\u2019s not really been one that has been on about it, calling things cute. Especially boys, but with you she said she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d You questioned to her, with her just laughing for a long while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing. Anyway, I hope you don\u2019t mind. Me trying to catch a Pokemon as well?\u201d She questioned as that was her goal. You look at her before laughing yourself. It\u2019s been very light hearted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, you might have to convince my Pokemon though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharmander, Snivy, can I go ahead and take him with me?\u201d She questioned, before continuing. \u201cYou two can come with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChar!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSniv!\u201d They both laughed, as that was really good. The both of them walked with Rosa, as Tepig jumped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have been talking about my Pokemon, but how about yours? Tepig seems really excited he\u2019s gonna get a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha!\u201d She laughed, \u201cTepig wants a friend. Your two Pokemon are too close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you wait for a long while, until finally the group arrives into the nearby forest. \u201cSo, what is the Pokemon that you want/. Like what type?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a kind one.\u201d She chuckled. She moved her way forward. \u201cWe can split up if you want?\u201d Rosa said. \u201cWith your Pokemon you should be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you wanna do?</span></div></div>",

Tepig is unable to battle... well, sort of,\" she said,<br>\r\n\"This victory goes to Snivy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" you praised while the green giantess walked back to you,<br>\r\n\"Great job, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass-type allowed herself to smile softly while she picked you up to place you on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Snivy.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter healing her Pokemon, Rosa turned to you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was incredible!

What a day!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" you muttered, your mind instinctively going back to Mew,<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rosa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you think... we'll find Mew, eventually? I mean, it probably makes little difference to you, b-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, dude?\" Rosa interrupted, looking offended,<br>\r\n\"I want to help you!

What I mean is, this could be much worse, y'know,\" Rosa addressed you again, crossing her legs and placing her hands on her knees,<br>\r\n\"You could be alone, for example. Think of what would have happened if Snivy hadn't found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as told: if Snivy never popped out of that Pokeball, Bianca would probably have never found you, and you would be stuck on your own, to fend for yourself against pretty much anything; now, you had a partner, a companion who was willing to keep an eye on the two of you, and Professor Juniper who was conveniently working to find a way to restore your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You do have a point.\" you conceded, looking back at Rosa, who smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd see it my way.\" she said, before drawing her bag closer to her,<br>\r\n\"Now, who's hungry? I didn't pack much food, as I thought we'd be in Town by now, but hey, at that size, pretty much anything can be a whole meal to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of food, the apparently hungry Tepig skipped towards his trainer and waited for her to pull out dinner, tail wagging in anticipation as he cried his name over and over, asking for his belly to be filled; Snivy rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess we can put that into the 'being tiny pros list'.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa too giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was fairly quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating, you had a chance to look around, discovering that what Rosa had said before was true: the only thing occupying most of the space was Rosa herself; you and the two relatively small Pokemon didn't take much room, either, so that left enough space for the four of you to sleep comfortably in one place, though the thought was still somewhat embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Snivy let out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tired, girl?\" you asked, figuring that after the two battles she had with Tepig, she must have been exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni.</span>\" she answered, before looking in Rosa's direction warily; then, without warning, Snivy gripped you and removed you from her head, placing you onto the floor before coiling her entire body around you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sni-vy.</span>\" she spoke to Rosa, warning her of consequences if the trainer happened to even try to touch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" you said to Rosa, looking around: green walls surrounded you, making it impossible to escape unless you climbed Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" she said,<br>\r\n\"Your Snivy seems to like you a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much.\" you replied, before pointing out,<br>\r\n\"Tepig too seems to think highly of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention, Tepig jumped onto his trainer's lap with a happy cry of his name, the got comfortable and laid down much like a Lillipup would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'aw...\" Rosa cooed, beginning to pet the fire-type, who closed his eyes in relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, both he and your Snivy fell asleep, one on Rosa's lap and the other coiled around you, acting as a fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit unsure what to do, you decided to catch some sleep well and sat with your back against Snivy's body, by her scaly stomach, judging from the sounds that came from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...

The events of the day were flying through your mind over and over, keeping you from reaching dreamland. Meeting the mythical pokemon Mew, then Mew shrinking you for its idea of a game. Meeting your new partner and going on an adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Snivy, she may be protective of you, but that's only a good thing in this situation, where nearly everything is a risk to your life, you only wished she wouldn't be so against Rosa as well. As you were thinking this, you felt two pillars of flesh surround you, and instinctively started struggling. After a second or so, you realized why you shouldn't really be struggling because the only person in the tent with you was Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let yourself calm down and the fingers eventually deposit you on an open hand. Rosa then calls you with her X-Transceiver to overcome the sound barrier between the two of you. You pick up and say, \"Hey Rosa, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa responded. \"Nothing much, just wanted to talk without Snivy constantly glaring at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, by the way. Snivy means well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's no problem. It's pretty much a good thing you have such a protective partner to watch over you at your size. I've heard stories about starter pokemon being really disobedient to trainers, and at your size, a bad starter could've resulted in you being eaten before Bianca ever found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Yeah, I'm really grateful Snivy is how she is. I just wish she could tone it down around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa laughed unintentionally, so she couldn't keep the volume down. Snivy and Tepig immediately woke up, which lead to Snivy realizing you were missing. Snivy looked around frantically, before spotting you on Rosa's hand. Her vines shot out at you at light speed and grabbed you from your perch and pulled you back into the scaly body of Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"He's mine! He's my trainer! Leave him alone!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you and Rosa heard, however, was, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Snivy Sni! Snivy Snivy Vy! Snivy!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnivy resumed the same position as before, but this time made sure to keep her arms around you and her vines covering the gap above you. It seems Snivy is really pulling out all the stops for this one, and not even Rosa could sneak you out of there undetected. Thankfully, your X-Transceiver was still in your hands, so you hear Rosa say, \"Good Night\", before hearing the call cut out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that talk with Rosa, your mind is cleared a lot more, so you're able to sleep soundly almost instantly. When you wake up...</span></div></div>",

Who knew, perhaps Snivy had rolled over in her sleep, trapping you under her? It didn't feel like it. Quite the contrary in fact, your body felt completely weightless, almost like it was submerged in water,<br>\r\n\"Is anyone here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did hear a noise though, and it sounded like... giggling? It was very muffled, so you weren't very sure about that, but it did sound pretty much like someone was trying to stifle a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello?\" you repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still got no reply, but suddenly you felt something touching you from behind; turning around, you saw nothing and no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began feeling very nervous. Just where on Earth were you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were trying to figure that out, something gripped your arms, forcing them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" you shouted, trying to break free from the invisible grip. But no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't free yourself, and whoever or whatever was holding you soon grew bored with just keeping you still, because you then started trashing around, moving much like a doll in the hands of an hyperactive kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, quit that!\" you cried once more, and whoever held you in such precarious position seemed to listen, because, with a giggle, you were let go of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack... who's there!?\" you cried, trying to sound as intimidating as you could; the results were probably hilarious to anyone listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother giggle made your ears ring, before your mysterious 'companion' finally decided to reveal themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden in fact, the familiar figure of a Pokemon appeared; it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-M...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Mew!</span>\" the pink cat-like legendary, the very one that got you in this mess, cried in a carefree manner, playfully waving a paw in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were startled by the sudden appearance. Then, you remembered the situation you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, you!\" you cried, realizing this was your opportunity to get your size back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary pointed her sapphire eyes on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Mew?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, cut the 'mew mew' crap, I know you can talk to me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Pokemon sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Alright, alright, fine.</span>\" she said, perfectly understandable now.

I just can't wait 'till you find me!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour frustration waned as perplexity replaced it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... What does that mean? You're here in front of me, I found you! So change me back!\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew waved a stubby finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Nope. You haven't found me yet; I came to you... well, not really.

I wanna enjoy it!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I don't get how can you think this is a game.\" you dryly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Say whatever you like,</span>\" she said, her tail starting to cool around you, forcing your legs together; the same tail drew you closer to Mew and rose you to her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">But if you want to win the game, you know what to do, right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You've also made some friends, haven't you?</span>\" Mew continued, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been spying on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I've been keeping an eye on you, so to say. I've actually kept track of you, just to make sure you didn't end up in someone's stomach. But then, I sensed a friendly presence around you, so it's all good!... I mean, I assume, since you're still alive.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks to you!\" you retorted, causing the legendary to roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Whatever.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's tail began unwrapping from around your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well, see you soon... or maybe not.</span>\" she said, turning to seemingly leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!

How can you be here if you aren't!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew turned her head, wearing a pensive expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... I can't answer to either of those questions,</span>\" she replied, before smiling,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Buuut, I can give you a hint! I haven't left the region. I'm hiding in some forest...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words told you pretty much nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Unova's full of 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Exactly! That gotta make the game more interesting, don't you think? Anyway, I'll give you more hints in the future, but I miiight get bored and leave if you're too slow, y'know...</span>\" Mew said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shot open. You didn't want to chase a Mew around for who knew how long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to point that out, but the legendary anticipated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Bye!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, Mew!\" you yelled, but in vain: Mew suddenly vanished from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, your eyes shot open, and you found yourself back within the protective arms of your Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breathing in and out heavily for a minute, you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYours was only a dream... or was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit strange, don't you think?\" Rosa asked much later, when you had already told her your 'dream'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, the giantess was busily brushing her hair, while you were sitting atop Snivy's head as usual, Tepig sitting next to the grass-type while awaiting for his trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" you replied; due the closeness with the brown-haired girl, you didn't need your X-Transceiver to communicate. <br>\r\n\"But I don't think that was a dream. I think that really was Mew, giving me some advice. She even gave me a hint, though it's pretty... vague.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hear it.\" Rosa spoke, intrigued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't left Unova, but she mentioned she's in some forest.\" you said, before looking down, discovering both Snivy and Tepig staring up at you, looking skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Unova's full of 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said. Mew also said she might leave if I'm not fast enough...\" you said dejectedly, before looking back to the giantess, <br>\r\n\"What do you think, Rosa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess stopped brushing her hair for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"</span></div></div>",

Looking back forward, unaware there a tiny human in front him, Oshawott is getting confused as he scratches his head while thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembers that he, along with the two other starters, are going to be delivered the new trainers. That's what he has heard from professor Juniper. If he's out of his poke ball the that mean he has be picked and letting him out, but where is his trainer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you just sat there with eyes open wide and not making motion. In front you there a gigantic Oshawott who towering you as he's standing there and he seems to look for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still can't believed how small you are compared to the blue otter, even his own scalchop is bigger than you! As you slowly get up on your feets, you begin to wonder if you should try to get his attention, maybe he can help you, but you're not really sure about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... at least, you know that Oshawott is not a wild pokemon due he just pop out from that poke ball, but still it's a pokemon and you don't know it will help you or not. Speaking about the poke ball, you wonder where that poke ball comes from or who belong to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you decide to take the risk, taking a deep breath, you begin to call the giant pokemon in front you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Down here!\" you yell as the giant Oshawott turns his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Osha?\" Oshawott looks down and notices a tiny person on the ground in front him waving it arms at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Oshawott paused at for a moment as he staring at you at his full height. As for you, you stop waving at him, now you got his attention, there no turning back. You get really nervous after that, you always find Oshawotts cute, but now at your new size, see one as a giant, it's very intimidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter few seconds, Oshawott finally reacts as he reaches down to picks you up with his both hands (Or paws I must say.) and went back to his full height. As Oshawott holds you, he moves you to his eyes level and begin to study you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you being held by the both paws on your both sides, you begin to regret for try getting help from a pokemon. Because may never know what he's going to do with you as you just frozen in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Oshawott, he's really surprised by what he just see, a incredible small human before his eyes. He never expected that humans could be so small. Then that make him a realization, if this human was standing in front him, does it means... Of course! That make sense, you must be one who call him from his poke ball. Which that mean you are his trainer of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Oshawott notices that you shivery in fear as he realized you look scared. Not sure why, but he tries to comfort you as he pats you with one of his paws with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure if Oshawott is friendly or not. You sigh in relief when you realize he doesn't want to harm you. So you still unsure if he will listened to you, but you give a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look Oshawott... I know it weird but I meet a some psychic pokemon and it shrinks me down to this size and I need help, would you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOshawott was surprised to heard it. Guess that explained why you are so small. Then again, you're his trainer so it his duty to help you as he nods at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oshawott.\" he nods again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and say \"Thank you, Oshawott! You're so nice.\" that make him blushes, but then you realize something. Why Oshawott would help a stranger like you? You just met him. So went to ask but you get interrupted by someone calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oshawott!\" a voice calls from behind Oshawott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Osha?\" Oshawott turns behind with you in his hands as you see a person approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(That must be his trainer...)\" that what you think and the person is...</span></div></div>",

However, it wasn't what you were expecting as your surroundings are quickly changing. Once that's over, you soon found yourself in a brand-new location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a grassy field, you are standing on a rocky mountain path that is incredibly hot; you are even sweating right now. You soon realized that Mew must've teleported you here, but why? From the looks of it, this appears to be on a large mountain with a steam air around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew, why did you bring me here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"In order to experience an amazing moment of your life.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused at what she meant by that as you highly doubt you will even experience anything good in the middle of a large volcano. With nothing left to do, you decided to go down and try to find some way to get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you travelled down, you began to notice something familiar about this place. While you never visited here before, you did read a book about a large volcano a long time ago. This volcano is known as Mt Chimney and is very tall; about 5000 feet tall to be exact! Kinda think of it, you did see the vast landscape of Hoenn at last. You immediately discovered that this IS Mt Chimney and because of it's great size, you can see nearly everything around the region. Honestly if you were at your original size, you would love to sit here and just take a look at sights from the mountain; you can even see your hometown of Petalburg City from up here. Is this what Mew wanted you to experience? You guess that must be the case, but it didn't really make any sense on why she shrank you for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sightseeing for a while, you go back to your journey downwards. You couldn't stand here any longer due to the heat and going lower will make everything less hot for you to survive. You travel across the rocky terrain that makes up the mountainous route and realized that the more you travel down, the less warmer it gets. However, you suddenly felt something hot nearby and it almost feels like warm liquid coming from below. You slowly walk to the cliff and look down. You see a small lake that looks like a hot spring, but there's something there that really surprised you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting on the hot springs is a girl but it's not just any girl, it's someone you think you recognized. She has long red hair that is tied in a ponytail, making it look spiky. The only thing she's wearing is a black bikini. Yep, this is none other than Flannery, the fire gym leader of Lavaridge Town. The reason you know her is because you once saw a battle between her and a trainer on TV once and ever since you saw her, you thought she was very hot like the fire Pokemon she uses, but in a good way. You also really wanted to see and get closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally realized what Mew meant by getting an amazing moment. The reason she shrank you and got you here was so you could get close to Flannery in secret. You could just take advantage of this new size and go see her up close without her even knowing your existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her and was about to go down until you see a beach towel right next to the springs. It looks like she might be going to there to dry herself and relax under the sun. You thought of waiting for her to do so and go exploring across her body. Next to the towel, you can see a bag that may belong to her and began to think about going inside to explore around her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Mew was a legendary, not only that but one of the most powerful ones. You know you thought it was just a cute playful Pokemon, but in retrospect that was stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you paid the price, you were what... two inches tall at the moment. Maybe even less than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the ocean in front of you, you try to think about what you can do. The Mew flew that way, so no way you were gonna cross it. Although you do have a water Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a Pokemon Trainer, with Pokemon. Here in the Hoenn Region, you started your journey a while ago. Now with six badges and ready for your seventh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence is why you were at Mossdeep City. Ready to challenge the psychic twins Tate and Liza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon, were even brought around to counter them. You only had two on you, as the rest were in your PC. A female Banette as well as a Male Crawdaunt. Both use to punish their types when you challenge them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that is pretty much not the plan at the moment. Then again, that was not the worst thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose two, they were psychics right? Maybe they can use their powers to help you! Granted, that was quite a leap but it was better than the alternative. Your Crawdaunt is not a fast Pokemon, at all. So chasing Mew was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Banette was fast, and could levitate. Let\u2019s just say though... you would much rather be a bigger size than deal with that mischievous Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... the twins seem to be your best option. Looking back into the city from the shore, you swallow and you then move in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took, a real long while for you to actually get to the gym. You were so small, and everyone risked stepping on you. So it was understandable why you were having trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t matter though, as you were by yourself right now at the front of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you get in there? The doors were giant and much too big for you to actually make your way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to figure out a way, even pushing your way into the door. You were far too weak though, so that was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... better then nothing.\u201d You say as you reach for your Pokeball. \u201cCrawdaunt, come on out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, your Pokeball shrunk with you, but not the Pokemon. You crab was giant! Towering over you like a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraw?\u201d it said, looking it\u2019s way around. Needless to say, it was expecting a battle, not to be outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Crawdaunt down here!\u201d You shout up to him for a long while.  He listened, and looked down. His giant face close to you, as he was shocked about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraw!!!\u201d He said as he brought his claw down. Your eyes wide open as you jump back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah! Don\u2019t pick me up!\u201d You say to your giant Pokemon as thankfully he listened. \u201cGreat, look I need you to open this door. Please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon, like most (Not Banette) is loyal, so he listens. Waddling his way over and... breaking the door with one Crab Hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay, I guess that works. Um... come back before you get found and blamed.\u201d You say to the Pokemon as you return him. Although you were weak and powerless, at least you have your two strong Pokemon. Granted you were pretty sure you weren\u2019t going to bring out Banette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery since you got her as a Shuppet across on the mainland, she has been trouble. Pranks, Scares and Mischief was her game. When she evolved into Banette, she even found a way to get into more mischief. A variant of Curse was her favourite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much, she links your body\u2019s feeling to hers, as she then starts to either hurt herself, to hurt you, or tickle herself to tickle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, she turned the ticklish option into the worse of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, as you move over towards the door, that was now opened. You walk among the shattered glass, getting in as you look around. Now where were you going to go? You have never been to this place before, so you might as well guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a hallway not so far away, so you logically take it. Taking long steps as you move forward and in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway was big, but empty which left you confused. Guess there was not much people in this Gym. You have no idea why, but since it lowered your chance of actually getting stepped on, you were not going to question it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you just kept moving as you arrived at something that interested you. A giant door to the side, with the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Twins Room\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, this was where you were going to find them. You could hear shifting inside, so at least one of them had to be in. How are you going to get in their this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Crawdaunt can break his way in and... oh no, wait. The door was slightly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that made things much simpler, so you simply move your way. Getting right between the door and the wall as you step in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two shared the same room, and apparently it wasn\u2019t split into two. In fact it seemed to be shared, as their beds were right next to each other in the middle of the room. A large desk on one side, a closet as well as drawers on the other side. The room didn\u2019t look like it was catered to a boy or a girl, or either. It just seemed like an average room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the room wasn\u2019t the thing you were interested in. Instead it was the giant twins that you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked and saw that ______________</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked and saw it was one of the two twin gym leaders! The girl one, Liza you think her name is. You could not be happier about how this turned out, you need to go and get her attention right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was meditating on the ground right now, her legs crossed her and her feet bare. You need to get her attention simple as that. You don\u2019t know much about psychics, but you know they have powers. Powers that might be able to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all it was a psychic Pokemon that shrunk you, maybe  a psychic person can help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get real closed to the giant sitting girl, looking how intimidating she was. Not only that, but a bit pretty. For her age at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be deep in thought, so you were wondering how you were going to get her attention. You don\u2019t want to shock her, you want her to remain calm and not to jump to conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for a bit, you found how you are gonna get this giant girls attention. You move around, getting real close to her foot as you feel it for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you push, rubbing it as you try to make sure she feels it. You push as hard as you can, really putting your back into it. All in front of you was her giant clean sole, which could probably easily step on you. So it was a good thing you were getting her attention now, rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Liza, she was awaken out of her meditation, feeling something against her foot. While she was focusing er power, she still noticed it. Which was good, as she looked down at her sole, seeing you! Not seeing you as a doll, or a small Pokemon, but as a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyebrows lifted looking at you, a little bit shocked about it but not enough to actually throw her off. How did this happen? Why is a small boy rubbing her feet? You looked older than her, and if she looks hard she can see two small Pokeball\u2019s on your belt. Pausing for a couple of seconds she looks at you as she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... can I help you?\u201d You jump and jerk at her sudden talks, almost tripping back. Something she found adorable, and was the reason why Liza wore a smile on her face as you look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, you found me. Wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought.\u201d You say with a smile, as this could not be better. You move around as she still had her legs crossed, going before her as you tidy yourself up. You look up to her towering form as you begin to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, hi... Liza! Big fan first off. I\u2019m a Pokemon trainer, who is actually here to challenge you and your brother funnily enough.\u201d You say to her as she listened. Still it was intimidating in front of her. \u201cAnyway...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, go on.\u201d She said giving you motivation to keep on talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was planning on facing you and your brother, and then I went to sleep. Then a Mew showed up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Mew?\u201d She questioned, surprised at that bit. \u201cIs that why you are small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I played around with the Mew... and it shrunk me. My own fault really. So, the Mew wanted me to chase it, but considering that... I can\u2019t this size. I came to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she has pieced it together. That\u2019s why you were here, because you thought that Liza with her psychic powers could help. Sadly, she could not. Moving her hand to her back she looked sheepishly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I know why you are here then and i\u2019ve never have grown something with my powers, not even affect something\u2019s size. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d You say in a deadpanned expression. \u201cGuess I should of expected it. It was a long shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your name by the way?\u201d She questioned down to you as you realise you haven\u2019t told her yet. You reply and she smiles. Moving her giant body around. She wasn\u2019t aware of the effect this was going to have on you. Moving her giant body and laying down on her stomach, bringing her face closer to you as she rests her two knuckles under her chin. Her feet kicking around as she smiles at you. \u201cNice name, so... if I were going to guess, Mew would be the only way you could grow big. I doubt any other psychic Pokemon could overpower Mew\u2019s.\u201d She said logically. \u201cAlthough if you find a Pokemon that knows Growth, and they somehow use it on you. You could have Mew\u2019s shrink on you, but you could use the growth as well to counter it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide. \u201cL-Liza you are a genius!\u201d You say happy. That could be a good strategy you could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough that is also farfetched. Growth is an internal move, and it doesn\u2019t use the way it\u2019s described. It can\u2019t just magically Dynamax. So I guess Mew is still your bet.\u201d She said looking over. Only now realising she just kind of stepped on your dreams. \u201cOh uh... sorry. Think about it like this way, there is a lot more fun things to do with your size than normal! You could eat food so much bigger than you, a bottle of water would last you a day. Um... you can have a giant king\u2019s size bed regardless of what you are actually on. You never have to wait in lines, you could move through under the feet. Am I helping?\u201d The caring girl questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little. Well, thanks for hearing me out Liza. Guess, I got to go find Mew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy yourself?\u201d She questioned as you turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I got strong Pokemon, they were probably going to beat you and your brother if i\u2019m being honest. Anyway, goodbye Liza!\u201d You say waving. Is this the end?</span></div></div>",

Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza placed her hands behind her back and adopted a solemn expression that you best described as adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, trainer, it would be very dangerous for someone your size to challenge the world by yourself.\" Liza explained, <br>\r\n\"I think it would be very unwise of you to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did have a point, you guessed, but that didn't change the fact that you needed to find Mew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" you said, before offering a smile,<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that but, y'know, I'm not on my own. I have my Pokemon with me. They're to thank if I even got in here... though now I guess it was a bit pointless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that!\" she chided, before realizing she had shouted and placing a hand over her mouth, blushing; then, timidly, she resumed,<br>\r\n\"Excuse me... but I still think you won't be completely safe. Even if you did find Mew, I doubt you could defeat it in battle since it's one of the mightiest legendaries... and it's also sooo cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liza adopted dreamy eyes while thinking of Mew, you pondered her words and discovered that they made perfect sense: your Pokemon may have been strong enough to take on Liza and Tate and maybe win, but were they strong enough to take on a legendary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't mention that.\" you pointed out,<br>\r\n\"She told me to go find her, not fight her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza finally stopped daydreaming about finding a Mew herself and finally turned back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a gir... wait. Hehehe, sorry,\" the young giantess giggled, realizing she had lost the main track of her thoughts; she focused back on you and once more adopted a serious expression,<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's like you say, trainer, but there's still no telling if Mew is going to give you back your size even if you manage to find her.\" Liza pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her for a few seconds, wondering just what she was trying to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a shrug, you said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. But what other choice do I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, you could always...\" she mumbled the last part so lowly that not even you could hear her, not that there was anybody else to listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza's face flushed bright red once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...\" she said, closing her eyes,<br>\r\n\"That maybe you could stay... with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell between you and the giantess; you kept your gaze glued to her while she once again looked away, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why?\" you asked,<br>\r\n\"Why would you want me to stay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Liza finally turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, I wish to, um, assist you,\" she kindly replied, bending to place her hand palm-up in front of you; getting the hint, you climbed on as she rose up, lifting her palm as well.<br>\r\n\"You know, I can't help you with your size, at least for now, but I can take care of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza was sure she had concealed it well, but she was actually thrilled by the idea of taking care of a small person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... that's very kind of you, but... you're a gym leader, no?\" you pointed out. She nodded,<br>\r\n\"If I stayed, I'd be stuck in this city, and I need to find Mew. I don't think you would be able to leave this gym, and therefore I wouldn't be able to go and seek for Mew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza bit her lip - you had a solid point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... We'll think of something,\" she replied after a long hesitation. Then, she shot a smile that was intended to be reassuring,<br>\r\n\"I could always try to make my Pokemon to learn some Psychic move that might help you grow... or I could even learn it myself... or maybe Tate's psychic powers and mine could be strong enough to actually grow you. I'm sure we'll come up with something, eventually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Liza fell silent and you fell into thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer you were given was admittedly pretty good and surely the best you had since it was also the sole one; on one hand, the gym leader was right, staying would be much safer than just traveling aimlessly until you found Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you had Pokemon, and were fairly sure that, with them, your chances of survival were as good as anyone's... as long as your Banette didn't come up with something mischievous that implied with your new size... yeah, you guessed Banette was was going to sit in her Pokeball for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you focused back on Liza's offer and pondered it for a few more minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you made your choice, then?\" the giantess spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at her.</span></div></div>",

Something that you were not really expecting, a giant foot came in your way. You jumped around and jumped back, a bit freaked out as you looked up to Liza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... what\u2019s happening?\u201d You question her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d She said with a certain level of giddiness in her voice. \u201cYou came here for a Gym Battle, so I think it\u2019s only fair you get one!\u201d She said this, and you were confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... it\u2019s great and all, but I did not really want to.... I have more pressing things to worry about at the moment.\u201d You say to her, finding your rules. \u201cSo... let me just figure this out, get my height back and we can do it later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d She said stomping her foot down once again, getting you to panic. \u201cWe are having one right now, it\u2019s the Gym Leader rule. once you enter a Gym, you can\u2019t lose until the battle is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a real rule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is, trust me i\u2019m a Gym Leader.\u201d She said with a smile down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to do this, but it was not like you were gonna convince this giant girl otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, fine whatever. My Pokemon won\u2019t hear my commands and I won\u2019t be able to see the battle at all, but no it\u2019s fine. Just carry me over to the battlefield.\u201d You said not that enthusiastic about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, actually this will be just as good.\u201d She says to you, taking you over and placing you down in the middle. She placed you down into the middle of the room as you see her trying to move stuff under the bed creating more floor space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, isn\u2019t it a little...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were gonna say small weren\u2019t you?\u201d She questioned with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you want to ruin your room. Fine, i\u2019ve go-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t gonna need them!\u201d Liza said, quickly moving over and getting onto her knee. She got onto her knee and she grabbed your belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! Please don\u2019t do that!\u201d You say trying to swat her giant controlling finger away from you. No matter how much you tried though, you lost your belt and your Pokemon. \u201cThose are mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can get them back if you win.\u201d She said playfully, putting it on the top shelf. You were so confused about it, and you were not really sure how you were going to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no Pokemon!\u201d You say back to her as she just rolls her eyes around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t use mine either. It will be Gym Leader, versus Challenger!\u201d She said happily and with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, this is a once in a lifetime event, I never get to be bigger than my challenger! You are gonna be the most fun challenge!\u201d She said with a laugh and a giggle. You just look to the towering little girl, unsure of what she was truly doing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause I want to, and you can\u2019t escape until you go.\u201d She said as you realise the true danger you were in. If she was not going to let you go unless you do this, you can do nothing about it. You pause and look at her for a couple of seconds before accepting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fine. I\u2019ll do this but you got to let me leave afterwards! You have got to!\u201d You say to her as she smiled down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are just so cute,\u201d She said bringing her finger down to you and patting you on the nose. Her finger being big enough to push on your face. \u201cYep, don\u2019t worry you can leave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood be-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you beat me that is.\u201d She said as you look at the giant psychic twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t, i\u2019m gonna go around and keep you! I want to keep you, and make you mine. So that\u2019s on line. You win, you get the badge and you can leave, if you don\u2019t I get you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so left confused about this, cause it did not make any sense to you. You have no idea why she would do this, but the stakes have never been higher. Should you just say no, should you just reject her idea? Walk away. What\u2019s the worst she can do if you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the theory to the test, you get moving and prepare to leave. However her giant bare foot comes down onto you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, trying to escape are we. You got to play, or I might just step in the wrong place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Did you just threaten to kill me!\u201d You panic at her, as she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA threat is nothing wrong, plus I doubt I would actually kill you. Anyway, so you are playing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess since I don\u2019t have a choice!\u201d You shout to her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily Liza stepped over you as she closed the door. Despite her interest changing 18 degrees, she was still talking the same way before. Does she not see what she is doing to you, She is forcing you into a game you don\u2019t want to play with vicious threats and if you lose, you are hers forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so the game is simple.\u201d Liza said standing opposite of you. Just seeing her so big, it was pretty clear the advantage she had over this. Hopefully she picks something you can actually win. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a battle, you against me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, clearly this girl is too smart for that. Did she just say you against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiza, there is no way I can actually win that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, I know that\u2019s the beauty of it and... the match will officially commence!\u201d She shouted and just like that, it was on. The match was afoot and it was time to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes wide open, as you brain tries to attack you with things you can do, but what can you do!?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were left undisturbed, staring at the sky in the direction Mew took off for a long time, your mind processing what just happened: Mew, a supposedly sweet and playful Pokemon, had shrunk you down to size and left you in the middle of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't exactly correct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were currently by the lake shore of Lake Verity, where you had been napping until Mew showed up and did... this. So now, you were basically stuck in the wild, shrunk and alone; even if Twinleaf Town was near, you weren't even sure you could reach by night at this size, and that was assuming you didn't get lost in the forest of grass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization dawned on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were no longer a human being, but an insect barely bigger than a speck of dust on the Sinnoh region. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic began settling in as you felt your legs shaking, forcing you to sit down to think of a way out of this; okay, being this tiny would seem admittedly somewhat cool, but the perspective of what could happen to you while you were like this... scared you. A lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there for a long while, trying to calm the beating of your heart while also trying to calm yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be something you could do, you just had to keep calm; slowly, very slowly, your heart stopped rattling your chest and your breathing became steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you had to do was pretty clear: you had to find Mew. There was one major problem though: you had no idea where Mew went or if you could even get out by this patch of grass by the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaunted, you turned to face the same lake, trying to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as much as you tried to focus, you couldn't find a solution that didn't involve finding Mew, a task that was currently impossible since you had no Pokemon or help whatsoever right now; the only thing you had was your PokeKron, which you used to take a picture of the mischievous legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wondered if the pink Pokemon was happily waiting for you, to make your move maybe watching you from somewhere nearby, in a twisted game of hide and seek. Or perhaps she had already forgotten you moments after she took off, really leaving you to fend for yourself in a world of giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, fear rose in you, nearly causing you to hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get out of here. You had to find help. You had to avoid ending in the stomach of a Pokemon or on the bottom of someone's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began realizing the true danger of the situation you were in, you felt tempted to cower back down and cry; the world around you began looking much scarier all of a sudden, starting with the 'trees' around you that were starting to tower over you menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you sat down, hidden as well as you could in the grass, and didn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you tried to convince yourself that this was all a dream, just a dream, a dream you could get out of by simply waking up, a feeble illusion caused by your subconscious, a mirage... but, with how much you tried, you couldn't wake up, and you eventually had to accept that you were living in hard reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing that, you sank back into thought, but your brain was a maze, and you were stuck in the middle of it with the solution to this situation at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you managed to get a headache without having found a way to improve your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough, enough! You had to stop thinking and start moving, or else you were going to stay here forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got on your feet and, without thinking anymore, you began running. You at least had to get out of this patch of grass, then... you decided cross that bridge when you came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a while, but eventually managed to emerge from the forest of leafless trees; luckily, there were no Pokemon around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall victories, you guessed as you began pondering your next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, getting back to Twinleaf Town seemed the best thing to do right now, also because you really saw no other option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bitterly realized that, had you had a Pokemon, they'd help you out... and maybe you wouldn't even be in this mess to begin with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, knowing you didn't have the time for regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided: you had to get back to the town!</span></div></div>",

Get help from one of your neighbors, perhaps? And then maybe ask them to bring you to Prof. Rowan's lab, since you doubted any of them would be willing to chase Mew down... and that was supposing the believed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, little did you know that you weren't going to return anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran through the lake shore to leave, you heard the unmistakable sound of splashing water behind you, like something  had fallen into the lake; instinctively, you froze in your tracks, knowing better: some Pokemon was probably coming out, and if they saw you, you were going to be in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking in fear, you turned to face a potentially hungry titan... but there was none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough though, there was what appeared to be a sphere of water hovering above the lake, right in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, your mind was telling you to turn around again and get lost; but curiosity got the best of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of Lake Verity, a Pokemon slept peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, its sleep was disturbed as it sensed something, extremely near to its location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmotions... especially strong emotions, intense fear being the strongest it could feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a new emotion emerged - resignation, followed by a sudden surge of determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch an odd mix of strong emotions made it so that they couldn't be ignored any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to see who was the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, completely, awakened from its slumber, the Pokemon began to rise from the depths of the lake it resided it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in disbelief as the sphere of water lingered above the lake for a few moments more, like a soap bubble, and just like one it popped, splashing droplets of water everywhere; a Pokemon took the place of the sphere of water, you noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw nearly dropped as you stared at the titanic being that was now fluttering above the lake, stirring and yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a relatively small body and small feet, long slender arms and a pink head. Also, it had two identical tails, each with a gem, and there was a third, red gem in the middle of its forehead; eventually, the creature opened its eyes, allowing you to see their shade of gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistaking it, this was another legendary! This Pokemon was the Being of Emotion, Mesprit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your luck (or misfortune), meeting two legendaries, the rarest creatures of the world, in one day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in silence as the titan looked around, seemingly searching for something... or someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that someone, you realized when the gaze of the Pokemon landed on you, was you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you felt the need to run, and the urge only grew stronger as you saw the legendary fluttering in your direction, reaching you in a matter of seconds; you found yourself face to face with Mesprit, right before it extended its paws to grab you. You turned around and ran in the opposite direction, only for a tail twice as big as you to land in front of you, blocking your escape and causing you to turn once more and run... right into Mesprit's awaiting hands, which closed around you as the legendary flew up at a decent height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were utterly terrified, but the titan seemingly had no bad intentions. In fact, it was merely examining you; eventually, it let a smile spread on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, it spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Curious.</span>\" it said in perfect human language, sounding distinctly feminine,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Human travelers aren't rare, but they usually don't usually possess such a... peculiar size.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were fairly sure you heard the giant - giantess, you decided - giggling after her little speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so bewildered to forget your fear. However, Mesprit didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">If I may ask, human, why are you so afraid? I do not wish to harm you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question caught you off guard. Mostly because you didn't expect a Pokemon to ask you why you were afraid instead of simply tossing you in their mouth and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I asked-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, I heard you,\" you interrupted, still hardly believing you were talking to a Pokemon,<br>\r\n\"It's... well, everything. I'm so small I could be killed by everything... though I'm very, very grateful that you don't want to hurt me!\" you hastily added the last line, making Mesprit giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That makes sense.</span>\" she replied,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">But how did a human become so small?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the question, your mind went back to Mew, and you were reminded of what you were supposed to be doing right now instead of chatting with another legendary about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">The subject seems to be causing you a great amount of distress.</span>\" Mesprit noted, amused.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Perhaps I can fix that.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, you became perfectly calm. It was as if fear, worry, distress and every other negative emotion you were feeling simply disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I believe you can now speak, yes?</span>\" Mesprit calmly wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you replied without hesitation, a bit stoically even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began telling your tale, at the end of which Mesprit looked intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Mew, you say?</span>\" she spoke, intrigued. What was Mew even doing in the Sinnoh region?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. She told me to find her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That... does sound like something Mew would do.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only hope she'll give me back my size then,\" you continued, before adding,<br>\r\n\"Can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you'd be a little more intimidated while asking such thing to a Pokemon who was said to possess an immense strength and who was literally holding your life in her very hands, but being temporarily deprived of fear made you a lot bolder as a consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's eyes shone at the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Help... you...?</span>\" she parroted back, pondering the request you made for a little while; then, she replied,</span></div></div>",

Mesprit can you... stop using your powers or whatever? I don't like not being able to express emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Hm? Oh right, I forgot I was calming you. You should be fine now.\" </span>The legendary answered, not doing anything that visibly caused change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good!\" You shout, checking to make sure you could properly emote again. \"I-uh, thank you for helping me!\" You stutter out an embarrassed thanks. \"I would've been in so much trouble if you weren't helping me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Yes, I imagine that you quite would be.\" </span>The legendary responded bluntly, a mischievous gleam washing over her eyes. <span class=\"cppink\">\"You wouldn't wind up eaten, around here at least, most Pok\u00e9mon here are herbivorous. But outside of my domain you would be in quiet a precarious situation. I imagine a lot of Pok\u00e9mon would love having a little human. Especially one as cute as you...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... you think so?\" You laugh nervously. Mesprit was looking at you with a rather protective gaze, the golden eyes really enhancing the affect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Oh yes, there's something quite cute about you. I mean... look at you! You're so small you fit snuggly in my hands! It's so easy to...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit slowly brought you closer to her face. You were unable to protest, enraptured by the giantess' golden eyes. The legendary wasn't suppressing your emotions, just not letting you express them. This drastic shift in personality was frightening you, but you had no way to express that... or resist what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit hands slowly crept you closer and closer to her face. Unable to move you gaze, instead you could only listen to the sounds around you. Your mind racing with a sense of fear, you believe your hear the sound of the legendary's mouth opening. Had she-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Cuddle you.\"</span> Mesprit finished her sentence, pressing you gently against her cheek.  The giantess giggled as you were released from her gaze and you looked away, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scared me... ahaha.: You attempt to nervously laugh the situation off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Oh I'm sorry. I truly meant that I didn't mean you any harm, but I couldn't stop myself from having a bit of fun at your expense. It's always to tempting to pass on the opportunity to mess with humans.\"</span>Mesprit laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"But I'm still sorry. Perhaps making you think I was going to eat you was a bit too much. No more pranks, I promise.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, keep that promise.\" You respond, still a little shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone with her fun, Mesprit moved you away from her cheek and gently patted your head with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... why are you going to help me, Mesprit? You're not going to ask for a favor after all this, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Ha! No, nothing silly like that. I just want to help you is all. It's important for Pok\u00e9mon as powerful as me to set an example that all living things should cooperate.\"</span> Mesprit reasoned with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. You never thought you'd hear a legendary say something so cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Plus it gives a reason to mess with Mew.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh... what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\" You parrot your immediate thought back to the legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding you in her hands, Mesprit turned around and began floating back to her lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"I'm going to be honest with you for a minute, human. I'm not the biggest fan of Mew.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this could be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"She gets to float around, all over the world and do whatever she wants. She can even pull stunts like this on innocent mortals like you. She thinks she can be carefree just because she's a legendary.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no reason to disagree with that statement now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Now that's not a bad thing, and she does some genuinely helpful things but... ugh!\"</span> At the sound of her annoyed groan, the waters of Mesprit's lake roared to life and catapulted into the air. You didn't react at all, but only because Mesprit momentarily kept you calm. Soon you free to sweat nervously at the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"While she's free to do whatever she wants, I have to stay at this lake and help preserve the cosmic balance of space and time! I'm part of a system that helps keep the entire world in balance, and I even guard a peaceful lake domain in my spare time. But who gets all the attention? Mew!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water around you began to stir again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason, people absolutely love her. I get, she's kind of cute, but I'm cute too! But I barely get my name whispered and Mew is part of a conversation every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the waters were practically raging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Mesprit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"But now's my chance to show her up. She though she could just prank you in my domain and leave? Ha! I'm going to help you find her, make her turn you back to normal and show her that she isn't as cool as she thinks.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit!\" You shouted as some water splashed against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"She probably doesn't even realize it, but her little prank on you is a challenge to me! And! It! Is! On!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water around Mesprit erupted into a geyser and sprayed the area around the lake with water. You seemed to be shielded from getting wet and you also managed to avoid getting scarred! You were actually just astounded that Mesprit had indulged such... interesting information to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as it erupted out, all of the water in the lake quickly gathered back in and the surface became completely still once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um........ cool?\" You honestly weren't sure how you should have responded to all of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Well, sorry you had to see that.\"</span> Mesprit laughed, completely back to her previous calm persona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we going after Mew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Heck yeah.\"</span> Mesprit answered adorably. <span class=\"cppink\">\"But, just a head's up...\"</span></span></div></div>",

It's back on the ground.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention, the legendary's eyes immediately darted to where she found you; there, abandoned, lied the bag you were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Mesprit about a moment to fly - at breakneck speed, much to your horror - to it, drop you on the ground and dig inside, emerging shortly later with snacks in her short paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you with a beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Let's eat!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Aw man, these were so good!</span>\" Mesprit cheered happily, turning her gaze and smile to you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I reeeally owe you one for that, human!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled briefly, momentarily putting your condition aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit was adorable. More than that, she was friendly, and willing to help you out without asking nothing in exchange... not to mention her power could probably rival Mew's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized just how lucky you had been to stumble into her... even if she had delayed the 'hunt' for Mew for some... debatable reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hey, what's with the happiness all of a sudden?</span>\" the pink-headed giantess asked playfully, her tails sliding beneath your feet, forming a platform for you to stand on as she drew them closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, hahaha.\" you attempted to laugh it off, feeling vaguely embarrassed as you realized what you were thinking; that didn't escape Mesprit's infallible senses, and she quickly gained a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh - you sure?</span>\" she asked playfully, poking you in the chest with a finger. Several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored the question, pushed her finger away and answered with a question of your own,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit,\" you began, retrieving your seriousness as your mind wandered back to your size-related issue,<br>\r\n\"Do you think it'll be hard finding Mew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Who knows.</span>\" she simply replied; then, sensing that you were unsatisfied with that answer, she added,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We <i>will</i> find her, human, and I <i>will</i> make her turn you back to normal.</span>\" she reassured with determination... which oddly made her look even more adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you replied, causing the giantess to smile as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rare for her to get gratitude; the Pokemon around the lake didn't even seem to notice that she was why they could all lead peaceful lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you spoke again after a moment of silence,<br>\r\n\"What do we do for the next twenty-four hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawn back to reality from her upsetting line of thinking, Mesprit laughed quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she answered,</span></div></div>",

What kind of games do legendary Pok\u00e9mon even play?\u201d You asked, curious if the legendary Pok\u00e9mon had something unique in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit crossed her arms and gave you a funny look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cThe same games as everyone else, duh.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. Ahaha\u2026\u201d You laughed nervously. That made sense, you supposed, you\u2019re not sure what kind of special games you thought might exist just for legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cCool, now let\u2019s talk about what we\u2019re gonna play!\u201d</span> Mesprit immediately got excited again. It was pretty adorable, but now you were curious about something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound really excited about this. You know we won\u2019t be able to do anything that exciting, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot losing her happy smile, Mesprit poked you gently in the chest again. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cSays you. I haven\u2019t gotten to play any sort of game with someone in ages.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile faltered a bit hearing that. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your changed expression, Mesprit raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cWhat? Are you feeling bad for me? Don\u2019t do that, let\u2019s not make this complicated.\u201d</span> Mesprit smiled reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that she was right, you shrugged your shoulders and smiled again. \u201cOkay, what did you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting around, Mesprit allowed herself to float to the ground, her stomach resting atop the grass and gently smushing it underneath her. The legendary crossed her arms and used them to rest her chin on the ground, her legs kicking excitedly behind her. Even at her massive size, she still looked adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI want to play hide and seek!\u201d</span> Mesprit announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even giving me a choice, eh?\u201d You smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smirked in return. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cWell I am the big one. Plus, this is the most entertaining game we can both play. I could turn your body into putty and stretch you around instead if you want.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smirk faltered a bit at the suggestion, but you laughed it off. \u201cYou can\u2019t really do that\u2026 can you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggled. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cIf I really tried I probably could, but that would be a lot of effort for not much fun.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hide and seek sounds good to me, I guess. It will probably be boring for you since you\u2019ll win so easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit let her head fall to one side, her feet still happily kicking behind her. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cAre you accusing me of cheating?\u201d</span> She asked in mock offense. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI\u2019ll disable my psychic powers, no emotion or life force tracking.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t actually thought about the possibility of Mesprit cheating, but you were glad to know that she was planning to play fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, though I appreciate the fair play.\u201d You noted, earning a giggle from your caretaker. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this open space doesn\u2019t give me a good selection of hiding spots. Plus I\u2019m kind of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit waited a bit for you to finish but then suddenly got a teasing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cOh my, is that fear I feel?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I hate when you do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cSorry, it\u2019s part of who I am. Now, will you tell me what you\u2019re scared of? Well, nervous is probably a more accurate description. Are you nervous about being separated from me?\u201d</span> The legendary teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! ...Okay yes, but that\u2019s only a part of it.\u201d You insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the Pok\u00e9mon around here can talk like you can. And I\u2019d rather not have my hiding spot be in a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s belly. I\u2019m just a little nervous about possibly running into another Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cDo you think I\u2019d let that happen?\u201d</span> Mesprit laughed, her eyes adapting a gentle look. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI promised you that I\u2019d protect you and get you to Mew, correct? No harm will befall you, even if you should run into another Pok\u00e9mon while I am not present.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit moved to cuddle you once more, but you motioned for her to stop, electing a pout from the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cHm. You will have to learn to accept my cuddling. I will spare you this time, but I will not always be so considerate.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuly noted.\u201d You answered, surprised that Mesprit listened to you this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cIf I win this round I will be allowed one session of cuddling, for as long as I wish whenever I desire it.\u201d</span> Mesprit stated, making it clear this wasn\u2019t a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laughed it off and got back to your original concern. \u201cAlright but, like I said, this will be a pretty boring win for you. Your lake doesn\u2019t exactly have many good spots to hide. You could probably see me from a good distance away. And I\u2019m kind of restricted to this side of the shore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding what you were saying, Mesprit sank into thought, her eyes drifting to the side and looking out into space. She hummed softly to herself before gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI have a good way to fix that! It should increase your chance of winning dramatically and it will ease your mind of worry about other Pokemon. Come here.\u201d</span> She ordered gently, waving you close with one of the paws under her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what are you going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cJust come over! This could be quicker, but I am refraining from grabbing you without your permission. For now at least.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppreciating her attempt to be polite, you oblige her request and walk forward, stepping off her tails as you go. You stopped when you were told to, arriving directly in front of the legendary's face. Her head, bolstered by her arms, towered over you like a massiv billboard. Even though her size was intimidating, she still radiated a feeling of gentleness and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPay attention! I need you to look at the gem on my forehead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn your forehead\u2026\u201d You mumble, slowly focusing on the large gem she spoke of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what no-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust focus on the gem.\u201d Mesprit said sweetly and condescendingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding against commenting further, you did as you were told and focused on Mesprit\u2019s gem. It was an interesting part of Mesprit. What was it there for? Was it how she used her psychic powers? Some other psychic types had a gem on their head too, but not all of them did. You wondered if there was a connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas something supposed to be happening? You didn\u2019t want to be impatient, but the gem hasn\u2019t shown any sign of change and you assumed that\u2019s why you were supposed to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay done.\u201d Mesprit\u2019s cheery voice rang in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait really? But nothing changed!\u201d You said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhoho really? Why don\u2019t you look at your hands then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give the legendary a strange look before you do as instructed. Only to realize that you couldn\u2019t because your hands weren\u2019t there any more! In fact, you couldn\u2019t see any of yourself anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMesprit, did you-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cTurn you invisible? Heck yeah I did! This should make hiding a lot easier for you.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed, amazed that you had been turned completely invisible so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this is pretty cool! But, how are you going to find me? You said that you wouldn\u2019t use your powers to track me and I don\u2019t see how you can find someone invisible without those.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smug grin spread across Mesprit\u2019s lips. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cOh you poor thing, you would be smart not to underestimate me. Run along now, I will count to one thousand and then I will come find you. And then I will savor your fear as you dread my next cuddle attack, mwahahaha.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her \u201cevil\u201d laugh the psychic covered her eyes with her paws and started counting quietly. You guessed that it was time for you to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mesprit\u2019s legs continued to happily kick behind her as she covered her eyes. Though she really should have been. she hadn\u2019t actually started counting yet. She was making sure that the little human had a head start for hiding. She was confident in her ability to find him, even while he was invisible and she was without her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cYou better not just try to stand still right in front of me. That definitely will not work.\u201d</span> Mesprit said aloud, just in case the human was planning to do just that. Fortunately she didn\u2019t hear any kind of response or reaction, so she figured that the human had wandered far enough away now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to contain an excited giggle, Mesprit started counting towards one thousands. She was finally going to play a game with someone again! Of course, she had to make sure to count at a fair pace\u2026 but then the chase was on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t*\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to disappoint the apparently very excited Mesprit, you dashed through the tall grass as fast as you could. Admittedly, Mesprit turning you invisible did make you a bit more excited to play. You thought it gave you a really good shot at winning. You doubted that you could actually pull off a win, but it would at least be a little harder for Mesprit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, being invisible made you feel a lot more comfortable about being alone. It would be impossible for a Pok\u00e9mon to notice you like this! And, from what you remembered, the Pok\u00e9mon around here already weren\u2019t that dangerous, so it would be easy to avoid getting accidentally injured by them. A giant human would be more difficult\u2026 but you doubted anyone would randomly be wandering around now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident and eager, you kept moving forward in search of a good hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t*\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One thousand!</i> The instant Mesprit recited the number in her head, the legendary Pok\u00e9mon removed her paws from her eyes and rose off the ground. She rubbed her paws together eagerly, her eyes scanned the ground before her thoughts even told her to. An innocently excited smile was the only expression on Mesprit\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cReady or not human, here I\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit\u2019s paws stopped rubbing together and her eyes stopped their search. Slowly the legendary lake guardian floated back to the ground until the grass was once more smothered beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI can\u2019t start looking yet.\u201d</span> She thought glumly. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI have not finished counting properly. One thousand does not come after ninety nine. I missed one hundred through nine hundred and ninety nine.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whimper, Mesprit fell onto her back, closed her eyes and covered them with her paws again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cDon\u2019t let your excitement get the better of you again.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t*\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter moving along for some time, you reached the area of the lake where the tree line started. Mesprit\u2019s lake was surrounded by a large forest, with the exception of the small path that led from the lake to your hometown. And even that path had plenty of trees and vegetation around it. You figured that this was good for your game though. Even for a legendary Pok\u00e9mon, it should be super hard to find a shrunken, invisible human somewhere in a large forest right? This would be a great hiding spot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you really need to find a hiding spot? You pondered as you moved into the forest a little bit. You were completely invisible, you mused. It should be hard enough to find you based on that fact alone. Of course you weren\u2019t going to just hide right beside Mesprit, you wouldn\u2019t overestimate your invisibility that much. And, judging from how confident she sounded earlier, you definitely shouldn\u2019t underestimate Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving the idea some more thought, you just laughed it off. You were headed into a forest, you noted, there probably wasn\u2019t anything in there that could be used as a hiding spot anyways; not ones that weren\u2019t super obvious at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour invisibility was the only thing that even gave you a chance, so you decided that you\u2019d go into the forest looking for a safe place to lay low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t*\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cFive hundred thirty three\u2026 Five hundred thirty four\u2026 five hundred thirty- gah!\u201d</span> Mesprit groaned and contorted, trying to give herself a facepalm without uncovering her closed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cWhy did I make it such a high number?\u201d</span> She wondered, irritated. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI wanted to give him ample time to hide but\u2026 this is hard!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, the situation was strange. Mesprit was a lake guardian, a part of the trio that helped keep the balance of space and time in check. Throughout her long, long life she had spent uncountable amounts of time waiting and doing nothing. Of course much of that time was spent sleeping, but she spent just as much time awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why was this small amount of waiting so aggravating!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit groaned and whimpered. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI will not be defeated by my own impatience! ...Five hundred thirty five\u2026 five hundred thirty six\u2026 five hundred thirty seven\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t*\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA calming silence permeated the forest as you wandered through it. Or was it an unsettling silence? You decided that it was the former since plenty of sunshine was getting through the tree tops and lighting the interior. It wasn\u2019t some scary dark forest, it was just a dim happy forest that was being watched over by the kindest legendary Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve ever met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly you had only met two and the other you met shrunk you, but Mesprit was still super nice. She was even helping you find Mew, who was the one to shrink you! Of course, she was only going to do it after waiting a day but you figured she could have made you wait a lot longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t think you could\u2019ve ended up with someone better than Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\u201cWell well, what do we have here?\u201d</u> You instantly froze at the sound of a voice. A voice that sounded absolutely nothing like Mesprit\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What do we have here?\u2019 Did you get discovered? But\u2026 but you were invisible! That shouldn\u2019t be possible. The voice must be talking to themselves, you obviously haven't been seen. Noticing that there was nothing in front of you, you turn around to face behind you, just to prove yourself right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</u> The thing immediately behind and looking at you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t respond, since you fainted the moment you realized you had been found by\u2026 something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t*\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cNine hundred eighty two\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cNine hundred eighty three\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was nearly done counting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cNine hundred eighty four\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cNine hundred eighty five...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she could play!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cNine hundred eighty six\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust you wait, human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cNine hundred eighty seven\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit was about to be let loose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cNine hundred eighty eight\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all this waiting you better\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201c...?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit shot up from the ground back up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</span> She said to herself. Even though she had turned off her powers to make her game with the human more fun, she had just picked up a feeling of powerful energy. If it was powerful enough for her to feel when she was suppressing her own abilities,  whatever she was feeling could be a huge problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was very unhappy about it, Mesprit allowed her powers to become unrestrained, ruining all of the hard work she put into counting to one thousand. She recognized instantly that she had made the right choice though. With her powers free, she was quickly able to pinpoint where the disturbance was\u2026 and the fact that you were right by it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cOh, little human.\u201d</span> Mesprit mumbled, slightly worried. Wasting no time she started flying to where you two were. But who, or what, did she find you with when she arrived?</span></div></div>",

Azelf.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue Pokemon that was fluttering in front of Mesprit looked up from the ground, which she had been apparently staring at; Mesprit knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hi sis.</span>\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit floated in silence for a moment; she felt the human's presence extremely near, but for some odd reason he wasn't moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, shoving her sibling aside, Mesprit located you and, focusing on you, she used her powers to render you visible once more, only to see that you were unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned, Mesprit looked at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Az,</span>\" she began,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What did you do to this human?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hm?... Absolutely nothing.</span>\" Azelf replied with a shrug,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Guy just passed out when he saw me. I think he got scared.</span>\" she added, before noticing Mesprit's look,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh - you know him?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-headed legendary gave a small nod, hovering to the ground, gently picking your body in her hands. Then, she glanced at Azelf again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sis, what are you even doing here?</span>\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Azelf here was... unexpected to say the least, since the Being of Willpower had a lake of her own to guard; said guardian shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I felt that you were awake. In fact, you woke me up.</span>\" she explained,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I came because I thought something was wrong. You're welcome, by the way.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... 'You're welcome'? Sis, you just ruined my game.</span>\" she chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Game? With this human? Weren't we supposed to, y'know... avoid humans?</span>\" she reminded Mesprit, who huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, please. Like he could do anything to us. And go tell that to Mew, she's the one who shrunk him to this size.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... What?</span>\" Azelf just seemed to realize how small you were compared to other humans,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, yeah, I forgot! What's the deal with his size?... Did you just mention it was Mew?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yes...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, you began regaining your consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hey, are you feeling alright?</span>\" a concerned voice, which you identified as your newly acquired legendary friend, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, I'm alright.\" you replied as your eyes opened, meeting with Mesprit's golden ones,<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you wondered, before memories got back to you,<br>\r\n\"... Oh yeah, I remember! Someone saw me! How's that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, you know... I sensed you were there.</span>\" another voice chimed in as a creature similar to Mesprit rose out from behind her back; the only difference was that this one had a blue head, which was differently shaped. And there was a friendly smile on its face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hi.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched - Azelf!? It was another legendary! And... a she, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Azelf...?\" you suffered in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree legendaries in one day! Yours would be any trainer's dream, and you weren't even a trainer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, he knows my name.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed, then looked at you with a gentle smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That is correct. Meet my sister, human,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, then at Azelf. 'Sister'? Legendaries had families? Sure, there was a certain similarity between the two, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... you guys are related?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth legendaries blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Uh - yeah? I just told you that.</span>\" Mesprit spoke, sensing a certain degree of confusion in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We came out of the same egg. What else would that make us?</span>\" Azelf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... makes complete sense.\" you admitted, looking to the side, feeling awkward,<br>\r\n\"I, uh... nice to meet you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Why are you so nervous again?</span>\" Mesprit teased, causing you to shoot a frustrated look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Please, stop doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I already told you, I can't!</span>\" the legendary happily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to reply, but were interrupted as you were grabbed from your perch and were brought to a new one on Azelf's hands; Mesprit's sister wore a cheerful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Nice to meet you, too.</span>\" she said; even her golden eyes were the same as Mesprit's, to the point that they also carried that same gentle sparkle that was in your friend's own golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oooh, he likes you sis!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of your trance and blushed furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf giggled. Only for a second though, because she then adopted a more serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So, little human... Mesprit has informed me about the 'prank' Mew played on you.</span>\" she told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reminded of why you were here with the two legendaries right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Th-That's right! She just showed up a-and shrunk me to this size, telling me to find her!\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Ah, don't get so worked up.</span>\" Mesprit chimed as one of her tails wrapped around you, pulling you from Azelf's hands to her own; again, the Being of Emotion had that determined look from before, a smile on her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I already promised I'd help you find Mew twice, didn't I? I'll promise again if you wish, but you really need to stop forgetting that, hehe.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary felt tempted to cuddle you again, but repressed the urge. She hadn't earned that... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a smile of your own as you nodded. You knew she was just teasing you; you had a feeling that you weren't going to forget this experience that easily when you got back to your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If</i> you got back to your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Wait...</span>\" Azelf chimed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You're helping him with this?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit shot her a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yeah! Why else did you think I had a small human with me all this time?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I thought you were just taking care of him! You know, as in... keeping him?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit got an amused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You know, sis... I'll admit that I maaaay have thought about it,</span>\" she said, causing you to look at her, eyes shot open; sensing your emotions, the legendary looked down at you and winked before she continued,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">But, let Mew do whatever she wants around MY lake and get away with it? Ha! Not a chance!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sure you heard the roaring of the water as Mesprit exclaimed that last line and were reminded of how she felt about Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Azelf, she glanced in between you and her sister for a few moments, before she spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ah, well, if that's the case...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

So far she had been just as nice as Mesprit, and she seemed just as informal as her too, so you didn\u2019t have to change the way you were acting. It could be trouble if they started pushing each other\u2019s buttons, but if they did, they\u2019d leave you out of the crossfire.. right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cUh, you sure Azelf?\u201d</span> Mesprit asked cautiously. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cIsn\u2019t your lake still\u2026 majorly messed up?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHm?\u201d</span> Azelf spaced out for a moment before smiling and nodding. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh, yeah, it\u2019s still pretty bad. But I\u2019ve got most of it put back together so it\u2019s fine without my attention.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait. What happened to your lake?\u201d You interrupted the two, very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf\u2019s eyes shifted from her sister to you, glowing a bit brighter when you were in their sight. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh, a while ago some human organization blew up my lake. It was a pretty big explosion too, almost all of the water in the lake was gone.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were astounded by how casually she told you that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cIt still kind of weirds me out how casual you are about that.\u201d</span> Mesprit spoke what you were thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cEh.\u201d</span> Azelf shrugged. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNone of the Pok\u00e9mon got hurt, though I had to protect the Pok\u00e9mon in the water, but everyone got out unscathed.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-why did humans blow up your lake?\u201d You asked, trying not to sound too concerned about the apparently unimportant event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cUmmm\u2026 I think the humans were called Team Galaxy or something?\u201d</span> The blue headed legendary scratched her chin.<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThey tried to catch me for some reason\u2026 they probably would have gone after you and Uxie next, Prit Prit.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough learning more about that Team Galaxy was much more important, you laughed at Azelf\u2019s ridiculous nickname for Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI told you not to call me that Azelf!\u201d</span> Mesprit snapped at her sister. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cEspecially not around others!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAh, I forgot. Sorry Mesprit.\u201d</span> She responded unfazed by her sibling\u2019s yelling. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAnyways, I obviously avoided getting caught and I dealt with the humans.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mesprit waited for Azelf to explain what she meant by \u201cdealt with\u201d, but she just stopped telling her story after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too curious to leave the topic hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d You began, \u201cwhat did you do to them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiled gently and used her psychic powers to take you from Mesprit\u2019s hands back to her own. As you floated over, Mesprit briefly reached out to grab you but allowed her sister to hold you\u2026 for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell little human, you know how Mew shrunk you as a prank?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell, I shrunk the humans\u2019 whole group\u2026 as divine retribution.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subtle shift in the tone of Azelf\u2019s voice made you very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit, meanwhile, was unfazed. She was well aware that her sister was joking. It took a lot to stop herself from laughing when Azelf said \u201cdivine retribution\u201d. Figuring it would be harmless, Mesprit let Azelf continue uninterrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you did?\u201d You tried not to sound intimidated by the friendly legendary\u2019s statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh yes, I did.\u201d</span> Azelf confirmed. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIn fact, I might have made them smaller than you.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess giggled mischievously. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDo you want to know what I did to them?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 uhm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit\u2019s relaxed floating stiffened and she looked at her sister skeptically. Azelf either didn\u2019t notice or ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell, I did a lot of things to them. A few of them, I simply disintegrated with my psychic powers, just to make an example. Once I got them under control, I divided them into groups. The first group, I simply scattered in the wild of my domain. It didn\u2019t take long for angry Pok\u00e9mon to get revenge for me on the ones who blew up my lake. The second group, I put to sleep\u2026 and then I ate them.\u201d</span> She added bluntly. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNot even one at a time, that would\u2019ve taken too long. And then, ehehe, then the last group. It had what looked liked everyone who was a top dog of the group. So I reached into them with my psychic power, grabbed their very souls and-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cAzelf!\u201d</span> Mesprit shouted, finally having enough. The pink headed legendary grabbed you from her sister\u2019s hand and held you next to her with psychic energy. Very upset with her, Mesprit flailed her arms to smack Azelf on the head, who only put up a token defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAh! Hey sis, calm down! What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</span> Azelf asked as she defended herself from the onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cYour stupid made up story is what\u2019s the matter!\u201d</span> Mesprit yelled, not letting up. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI just spent the last few hours trying to make the little human feel safe and not afraid of me, and you\u2019re going to lie about killing a bunch of other humans and ripping out their souls!?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI was just trying to scare him! I obviously didn\u2019t mean any of it! Who would believe any of that? I almost burst out laughing when I said \u2018divine retribution\u2019.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cYou\u2019re a legendary, you moron! Any one who isn\u2019t one too will believe a story like that if you tell it well enough!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggle between the sisters continued for a while, with you floating behind them. Seeing Mesprit trying to smack Azelf was an entertaining sight, and you were utterly relieved to hear both Pok\u00e9mon confirm Azelf\u2019s story was fake, but it still made you feel anxious and uncomfortable. Azelf\u2019s fake story reminded you of how powerful these legendaries could be, and the idea of either of them actually doing those things to you made you tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting in a good hit on Azelf\u2019s head, Mesprit shoved her sister away and huffed angrily, her paws balled up angrily at her side. Azelf turned away from Mesprit and sheepishly rubbed her head. She hadn\u2019t been injured by Mesprit, but she figured doing this would temporarily diffuse the situation between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer concerned with her sister, Mesprit floated back to you and released you from her psychic grip. You fell gently into Mesprit\u2019s waiting paws, which cupped you gently in their palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine.\u201d You insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201c...No you\u2019re not.\u201d</span> Mesprit said after a pause. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI can feel your anxiety.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you weren\u2019t embarrassed or annoyed that Mesprit could read your emotions. It would assure her that you were being honest with what you were going to say next. You really weren\u2019t mad at Azelf, and you definitely weren\u2019t afraid of either of the legendaries, though that admittedly didn\u2019t help with your anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Mesprit, I really am fine.\u201d You smile at the legendary. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not a little\u2026 anxious right now, but I\u2019m not scared of you or Azelf or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit, not sensing any emotions that indicated you were lying, smiled. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cGlad to hear it. Did you want me to get rid of your anxiousness? I could calm you down, if you wanted.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re doing a pretty good job of that by holding me like this.\u201d You tried to tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smirked, but blushed just a little bit. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cLeave the teasing to me, you\u2019re really bad at it.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been waiting for the perfect time to insert herself into the conversation, Azelf\u2019s head came from behind and rested awkwardly on Mesprit\u2019s comparatively small shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHeh-hey uh, guy.\u201d</span> She started with an awkward laugh. Mesprit quickly shook Azelf\u2019s head off her shoulder, but held you in front of her. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI guess I\u2019m really good at scaring you huh?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so. You\u2019re a pretty good actor too.\u201d You joked, getting a laugh out of Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cPfft. That\u2019s the best you can do for an apology?\u201d</span> Mesprit scoffed, unimpressed. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cPretty lame of you Az.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHey, I don\u2019t think what I did was that bad. It can be fun to be scared.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cYeah, maybe at night around a campfire or something.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys have campfires?\u201d You asked, thinking that if that were true, it would be the strangest thing yet you learned about the legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAh yeah!\u201d</span> Azelf confirmed excitedly. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhenever a human is dumb enough to leave up camping stuff in my domain I snag their marshmallows. Oh! And sometimes the chocolate and those sweet crackers. Then I invite everyone over and we make those smore things you humans do! Ah, they\u2019re super good!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit noticed that all traces of your anxiety had disappeared, replaced by astonishment and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLegendary Pok\u00e9mon are weirder than I have ever dreamed of.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Still, you couldn't help but smile: these legendary, they argued just like any other siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some sight to see two of the supposedly most powerful beings in the world acting like two little girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit, let's just let her play, too,\" you stepped in, causing the giantess to look at you,<br>\r\n\"The more the merrier, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well said, human!</span>\" Azelf happily chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I... I guess... fine.</span>\" she conceded; then, leaning in so that only you could hear, she whispered, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">But if I win, it'll be <i>two</i> cuddling sessions.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked, placing a hand on the cheek of your legendary friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If</i> you win.\" you said, making Mesprit smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What did I say before? Don't underestimate me... or us, I guess.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Mesprit hovered down to the ground, followed by a happy Azelf; emulating her sister, Azelf laid belly-down on the ground, and you were let go of in front of Mesprit's huge face... which did not look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sorry, human, but I'm not counting to one thousand again.</span>\" she informed, earning a teasing smile from Azelf. One thousand for a game of hide and seek would seem ridiculously high even to Uxie, she mused.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We'll count up to three hundred this time. I believe that should still be plenty of time for you to hide.</span>\" Mesprit continued, regaining a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Seems reasonably high. At least, more reasonable than <i>one thousand</i>...</span>\" Azelf teased, only to be smacked in the head by one of Mesprit's tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" you said with a shrug. Five whole minutes should be enough, you mused. Still...<br>\r\n\"Um... we'll still follow the same rules as before, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit placed a hand under her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yup. Now, focus on me...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the hint, you began staring at the gem in the middle of the giantess' head; only when you heard her say 'Done!' you looked away and at yourself, discovering that there wasn't any of you left to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">This is dumb.</span>\" Azelf pointed out, her eyes locked on the spot where you were before disappearing from sight; the powerful psychic-type could still sense you, though.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I can still totally sense him, and I bet my left tail that you do too, sis.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">In fact, just like before... no powers whatsoever, sis.</span>\" she informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">... That makes waaay more sense. </span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both legendaries had limited their powers, Mesprit looked at you... or, where she supposed you were, since she could no longer feel you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">In case you're still here, human, we'll start counting,</span>\" she announced, sliding her hands on her eyes, which she closed; Azelf emulated her,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Good luck!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence, which you assumed Mesprit was giving you as a headstart; then, the legendary opened her mouth to start counting... when a thought ran through her head, making her groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Ugh. I swear, if Uxie shows up and he ends up fainting again, I-I'll... I'll take her emotions!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Ha!</span>\" Azelf laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And yours too!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hey!</span>\" Azelf protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to choke back a laugh at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, the possibility of encountering a fourth legendary, and the entire Lake Trio, in just one day was pretty low... right? You seemed to have become some sort of magnet for legendary Pokemon today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you shook the thought out of your head and focused back on the duo of giantesses that was in front of you, noting that they had already started counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith less time than you had last time, you quickly turned around and sprinted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed a place to hide. And a pretty good one, too...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing that you had two legendary Pokemon looking for you spurred you to run faster than before. You were going deeper into the forest now, but nothing seemed to change. This part of the forest seemed as peaceful and bright as any other part. A product of Mesprit\u2019s hard work, you supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning around alone in the forest like this made you think for a moment. If Mesprit hadn\u2019t found you after Mew shrank you, was that what you would be doing? Would you be running aimlessly through the forest, trying to chase after something much larger and faster than you? Just the idea of doing that made you shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you quickly got over it. You weren\u2019t doing this for survival, this was all part of a game. You would rather be chasing Mew with Mesprit right now, but you were happy to play along. You had to make sure you hid well, to ensure that Mesprit enjoyed her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cAz, you\u2019re counting too fast.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat? No I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just counting like normal, you\u2019re just slower than me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to just count to three hundred, it\u2019s supposed to be like three hundred seconds. We\u2019re counting time, not numbers!\u201d</span> Mesprit elbowed her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s part of the rules.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cIt\u2019s not always. But this is my game, so we\u2019re playing by my rules.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cFine, fine, I\u2019ll start counting in seconds.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cUm\u2026 what number are you on? I lost track.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201c...I did too.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf snickered and laughed. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGuess we have to start over. At least we don\u2019t have to count to one thousand.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit didn\u2019t respond, instead opting to smack her sister again with a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running as far as into the forest as you deemed necessary, you stopped to catch your breath. Looking around, you noticed that this part of the forest looked the same as everything else. So all you did was put distance between your two pursers and you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not like there\u2019s going to be good hiding spots in a forest anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring you should at least try to hide, you look around again. The only things you saw were grass, trees, and rocks. There were some flowers scattered about, but those were probably the worst place you could choose to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither of your pursuers could idly pluck a flower off the ground while they meticulously searched for you. Mesprit would be meticulous at least. You imagined that Azelf wouldn\u2019t be as invested in the game as Mesprit was, so she wouldn\u2019t try as hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more of a reason to avoid the flowers, you mused. Mesprit would be super disappointed if she lost her game just because her sister happened to pluck a flower you hid under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust gotta pick the tall grass or the rocks. ...Unless\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the starting point, the two sister\u2019s finished counting at the same time. Mesprit uncovered and opened her eyes, immediately floating into the air and began searching the area. Azelf uncovered her eyes as well, but stayed on the ground and watched her sister search with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDo you really think he tried to hide nearby?\u201d</span>  She asked as she kicked her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely he is, but I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.\u201d</span> Mesprit said, pushing a small stone aside to look behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo what\u2019s your plan for finding him? Once we get close enough, we should be able to sense him so-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cYou better not be cheating Azelf.\u201d</span> Mesprit interrupted. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cIf you\u2019re properly subduing your powers, you shouldn\u2019t be able to sense him unless you\u2019re almost directly on top of him.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Think I\u2019m gonna cheat?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cCan you blame me? I didn\u2019t really make it clear how much you had to subdue your power.\u201d</span> Mesprit parted a tall growth of grass, making certain you weren\u2019t in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not cheating, huh? You\u2019ve always been a bit competitive so  you could definitely try to cheat if you really wanted to.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cAs if.\u201d</span> Mesprit quickly breezed through a pile of leaves, scattering them around the area. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cI want to enjoy this game. Cheating just to make sure I win would take all of the fun out of it.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf lazily floated into the air and stretched. Mesprit was about done checking the area, she mused, so it was time for her to start looking too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo, do you want to go seeking together or\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit didn\u2019t answer, too occupied feeling the bark of one of the forest\u2019s trees. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cDo you think the little guy can climb these trees?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</span> Azelf answered unhelpfully. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBut if he could, I doubt he\u2019d try it. He\u2019d collapse from exhaustion before he got up to any branches and he\u2019d take so long we\u2019d find him while he\u2019s climbing.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201c...Eh, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d</span> Mesprit pushed herself away from the tree. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t want to go looking with you.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAw, come on. It\u2019ll be more fun if we\u2019re together.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cPerhaps. Or it\u2019ll ruin the game because you\u2019ll distract me from searching. I want to focus on the excitement of trying to find someone who\u2019s trying to not be found. I want to sneak around this forest quietly, get down and dirty if I have to. If I\u2019m with you, we\u2019ll just carelessly float around and maybe casually stumble on him. I want to snatch victory! Not\u2026 stumble upon it.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOkay!\u201d</span> Azelf shrugged happily. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBut you better work hard, or I\u2019m gonna be the one to snatch victory.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smirked eagerly. <span class=\"cppink\">\u201cOh yeah? You wanna bet on it?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNope.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit collapsed comically onto the ground, her competitive spirit completely deflated by her sister\u2019s casual denial. Pulling herself back up, she noticed that Azelf had already left. The giantess silently pumped her fist. She was still going to win this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as your body collapsed onto the ground again. Finally getting the message that this wouldn\u2019t work, you rested on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid tree.\u201d You mumbled embarrassed. \u201cI thought I could climb you a bit and get a better view but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. That was a pretty dumb idea. It was unlikely that there was some hidden burrow or hole you could\u2019ve seen and chosen to hide in. And even if there had been, going into it would be a very bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing better to choose from, you crawled over to a tall patch of grass and flattened yourself on the ground. Now you could only wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit floated excitedly through the forest. She had been searching for the little human for a while now and hadn\u2019t found a clue of where he could be. She was confident that she could still win Azelf didn\u2019t really care about finding the human like she did, so she wouldn\u2019t be trying as hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit had to admit, having Azelf as competition did make the game more exciting. It was already fun blindly searching for the human, but knowing someone else was looking for him to made Mesprit-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit perked at the sound of some rustling leaves. She quickly turned to face the source and saw a figure quickly duck behind a tree! She immediately recognized two problems with the situation. She was able to see the figure who made the noise\u2026 and they were the same size as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">Az, I told you that I wanted to seek separately, what are you doing here?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing the jig was up, Azelf came out from behind the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Man, and I was doing so well trailing you too.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">What are you doing here Az? I thought we agreed to search separately?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf floated down and plucked a flower off the ground, twirling it idly in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Nah. We agreed that you wanted to search alone. I didn\u2019t say I'd respect that.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">You\u2019re going to keep tailing me, even if I ask you not to, aren\u2019t you?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf silently nodded her head and continued to happily twirl her flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the response she expected, Mesprit huffed and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">If you\u2019re going to be like that, I\u2019ll just chill here. I know you\u2019ll get bored and-</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a noise, and Mesprit instantly stopped talking. She knew that she had just heard something. And it wasn\u2019t Azelf this time. This one was close, really close. She waited for a moment, waiting to see if she\u2019d hear the sound again, but she didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning over on her stomach, Mesprit looked around. There was something around here, it had just made a noise. And the fact that it hadn\u2019t made a noise again, gave away the fact that it was hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious smirk spread over Mesprit\u2019s face as she spotted a tall patch of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith as much stealth as she could muster, Mesprit crawled along the ground on her stomach. This was what she was waiting for. The exhilarating chance to pounce on her quarry! She knew that the little human was in there. She just had -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an eager shout, Mesprit lunged through the bush, grabbing hold of something she couldn't see. Filled with a sense of joy and accomplishment, she lifted into the air with her quarry hugged tightly against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Oh! Looks like you caught him!</span></span></div></div>",

Me-Mesprit!\" you protested, feeling the air being slowly squeezed out of your lungs,<br>\r\n\"Let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit adopted a mischievous smile and snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">As you wish.</span>\" she said, opening her arms and letting you fall towards the lake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf seemed flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Wait, did you just-?</span>\" she looked at an indefinite spot, trying to locate you; a hard task, given that she was still holding her powers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you screamed as you felt the air bellowing from below hitting your almost weightless body while gravity dragged you towards the surface of the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you never hit the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could hit the lake, Mesprit fluttered beneath you, who ended up landing on top of her head; the mischievous legendary giggled as she felt an enormous amount of fear coming from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she felt a little guilty, but as Azelf had mentioned earlier, it can be fun to be scared sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mesprit!\" you yelled once you had recovered enough to allow yourself to be angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sheesh, don't get so worked up! It was just a prank!</span>\" the giantess chided playfully, picking you from her head, beginning to focus on making you visible again,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">How many times do I have to say it? I will never do anything to hurt you, human.</span>\" she reassured, adopting that familiar gentle look in her golden eyes; either because she was messing with your emotions or because that look was genuinely soothing, you began feeling calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the look on Mesprit's face was soon replaced by a grin the moment you became visible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That being said, I won!</span>\" she happily said, lifting her free hand and rising two fingers; what you assumed was just a cute victory pose was, as you soon discovered, just Mesprit reminding you of what she had won,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That's two cuddle sessions!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Aw, what is there to be sour about? Are you a sore loser?</span>\" the legendary teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could reply, Azelf floated closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hey, what's that supposed to mean?... I did not know the winner would get a reward.</span>\" she stated, puffing her cheeks out in annoyance, a pout on her face, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I want a rematch!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing her sister's frustration, Mesprit giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sorry, Az, I don't think that's possible.</span>\" she said; then, noticing Azelf's curious expression, Mesprit motioned to the sun, which was very close to setting; looking at it as well, you were reminded how high in the sky it had been back when Mew showed up. Time literally flew by without you noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We should quit for today,</span>\" Mesprit continued, putting on a more serious expression,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">While I'd like to continue too, it's getting dark, and I'm not risking the human getting lost.</span>\" she said firmly. Then, as Azelf groaned her disappointment, Mesprit's face re-adopted a smile as she eyed you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">As for you, human...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that you were getting closer to Mesprit's face, you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Mesprit? Right now?\" you asked, resigned to the fact that you were going to have to let her cuddle you. It wasn't actually bad, you guessed, but it was embarrassing, and slightly humiliating as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary stopped, adopting a cute smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No.</span>\" she replied, her head moving much closer to you as she began whispering,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I won't do anything... for now.

And... oddly specific?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mes-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hey, what are you two whispering about?</span>\" Azelf suddenly chimed, fluttering beside her sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid sibling looked at you with a playful smirk, feeling your embarrassment as you yelled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oooh, he's shy!</span>\" the blue giantess teased, grabbing a hold of you; before you had time to react, you found yourself being embraced to the chest of the legendary, who was eyeing you cheerfully,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">That's adorable!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Mesprit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Being of Emotion shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">See? I'm not the only one who thinks you're cute.</span>\" she said, though you noted her eyes glowing as she sweetly added,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hang on, will ya?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, the pink-headed legendary darted forward, pushing Azelf with such strength that she was forced to let go of you, who hovered in mid-air, held by a psychic grip that slowly returned you to Mesprit's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Ow... sis, that hurt!</span>\" Azelf whined, rubbing her chest; then, in a teasing tone, she added,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I mean, I get that you're jealous, but c'mon!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's cheeks flared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I am not-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Starving? 'Cause I sure am!</span>\" Azelf quickly interrupted, giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew better than to prolonging a conversation like that; she pushed Mesprit's wrong buttons, she was going to be unable to feel mad at her for what she would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit stared at her sister for a couple seconds, before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Let's eat.</span>\" she agreed, before looking at you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You have more snacks, right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's eyes lit at the mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Aw man! That's exactly why I love human food, it's just so... tasty!</span>\" Azelf exclaimed contentedly, swallowing the last bite of a chocolate bar that was taken from your bag.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I'm starting to wish Mew shrunk you around my lake!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit, who was sitting in front of Azelf, glared,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Azelf!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What? I would've protected him, too!</span>\" Azelf retorted, before looking at you, who were sitting in between the two gigantic legendaries, with a smile,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">As long as you kept giving me snacks, anyway.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, then laughed quietly to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't about that. You guys ate everything I had.\" you informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf let out a horrified gasp; Mesprit sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And that's exactly why you need to stick with me.</span>\" she said, placing her two tails in front of you and motioning you to get on, which you did; Mesprit's tails left the ground and brought you in front of the legendary's smiling face as she sat with her arms and legs crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I'm not gonna complain.\" you joked, making Mesprit giggle,<br>\r\n\"So... what now? Do we go to sleep?\" you asked, becoming suddenly serious as your mind settled on the task that awaited you tomorrow,<br>\r\n\"I mean... we're going to start searching for Mew tomorrow, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yup. Who knows, maybe we'll be lucky enough to find her right away,</span>\" she commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'd be so lucky I'd have a hard time believing it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Aw, but that'd mean we'd have to split up! And I'm having so much fun, too!</span>\" Mesprit fake whined; then, with a smile, she continued,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">But, as for now...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

I'm not even remotely sleepy - I've been asleep for so long!</span>\" she exclaimed, before declaring in an almost motherly tone,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">But, we need to get you big again, and you need your sleep, so I'm gonna have to pass.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised by how quick the change from excited kid to caring mother had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sensed it and giggled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could be hidden from her: emotions always let her know the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, the legendary placed a hand in front of the tail you were on; you wordlessly stepped on and were successively brought up in front of the giantess' chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And with you asleep, I'm going to have nothing better to do than sleeping as well.</span>\" she added with a slight pout, reverting to the 'kid phase'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that a certain other legendary butted in,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Riiight. Because protecting your lake is a real bore, eh sis?</span>\" Azelf teased, receiving a slap in the back of her head from the tail you had just left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Ah, I'm a splendid guardian!</span>\" Mesprit replied with a pout, which you thought was adorable,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And you're not one to talk, Azelf. You, your lake and the Pokemon there nearly got obliterated!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf lost her smile, gaining a deep blush to replace it; on her blue face, it didn't go very unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">... Good night.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf hovered a few inches from the ground and gradually rose higher in the air... before pointing to the lake, diving underneath the surface at full speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathlessly watched the blue legendary disappear underwater, then turned to Mesprit, who smiled upon seeing your stunned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">C'mon, little guy, you didn't really think we'd sleep out here, did ya? We know better than to get caught by one of your kind who decided to take a walk around here and happened to stumble into me... us.</span>\" she playfully chided, hovering in the air herself. Then, she started giggling,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">If you'd like some advice, human, hold your breath.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, then glanced at the lake. Then back at her, back at the lake: it was getting <i>closer.</i> Back at Mesprit, back at the lake; it was Mesprit who was getting closer to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart filled itself with terror - no no no, this wasn't going to happen, she wouldn't-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even registered it, Mesprit rose far higher than Azelf had done before. Had it been solely her, it wouldn't be necessary, but her little passenger couldn't breathe very well underwater. Or, more specifically, he couldn't breathe at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of terror coming from the human hit her, causing her to smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Don't worry, this'll be over before you can even say... well, not like you'll be able to say anything, really.</span>\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour skin adopted a very unhealthy shade of white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo terrified to even speak, firmly held in Mesprit's hand, you could only watch as the legendary darted downwards, towards the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even feel the impact with the water; you just felt the cool breeze getting replaced by cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you hadn't had any time to hold your breath like Mesprit suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, as soon as it began, it ended; the legendary swam at crazy speed beneath her lake, deeper and deeper, until she reached the bottom, and by extension, her destination: a large underwater cavern, which she entered without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMysteriously, the inside had no water, and was filled with breathable air instead. That, and a certain blue legendary who was laying on the floor, still awake and apparently waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Weren't you going to sleep?</span>\" Mesprit questioned as she hovered closer to her sibling, who looked at her, deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I was just worried you might drown the human, Mes.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yeah, right.</span>\" the Being of Emotion huffed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">He's fine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were definitely not fine; pale, soaked to the bone and still utterly terrified, you were greedily refilling your lungs with air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a while before you were finally able to express your disappointment by yelling at Mesprit to never do such thing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-headed legendary just giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sorry. I just thought you may have appreciated a bath.</span>\" she replied innocently, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'll just carry you in my mouth when we get back up in the morning.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat little color your face had regained drained again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Sis stop. You're traumatizing him.</span>\" she spoke; Mesprit, who had begun petting you in a comforting manner, removed her gaze from you to shoot her sister a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Said the Pokemon who made him faint when she first met him,</span>\" she recalled,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And the Pokemon who told that stupid story to scare him.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">That was an accident,</span>\" Azelf promptly replied,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And stories don't drown people, y'know.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit was about to retort, but was interrupted when she heard you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we just go to sleep, please?\" you begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mix of still fresh fear and annoyance Mesprit felt from you made her smile sweetly, reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You're right. Sorry, little guy,</span>\" she apologized in a cute manner, bringing you to her cheek for an unofficial round of cuddling; after a minute or two, she felt that you had calmed down, though the annoyance remained, mixed this time with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'd say we put you through enough stuff for today.</span>\" she said sweetly,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Let's get you to bed.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour 'bed', as you found out a couple minutes later, was located in between the two titanesses, and it was made using two tails, one from each of the legendary, intertwined with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the two sisters thought it would be cute; you were honestly so tired that you couldn't bring yourself to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you laid down, you closed your eyes and fell asleep almost immediately. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time later, you begin to slowly wake up from your comfortable slumber. Being wrapped in the two legendaries\u2019 tails was surprisingly comfortable. Even though you were in an underwater cavern with hardly anything separating you from the cold floor, you still managed to stay warm. Perhaps your \"bed\" was being heated by the two who wrapped you up in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comforting warmth somehow encouraged you to wake up rather than fall back asleep. For some reason the cavern wasn\u2019t illuminated like it was when you first arrived. You could hardly see anything. From some undistinguishable direction, you could hear the sound of gently cascading water. All there was to see was a gentle darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd two strikingly golden eyes staring right at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprise, with a large hint of terror, coursed through your body! But you were unable to gasp, shout, or even jolt in surprise. Your emotions were perfectly normal, but your body didn\u2019t seem to have the energy or will to move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second\u2026 the will to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAze\u2026\u201d As soon as you begin to whisper the legendary\u2019s name, your vocal cords simply give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA different, more invasive warmth washes over your body. As the new sensation enveloped your body, you noticed your eyes were adjusting to the dark. Except they were adjusting a little too well. Everything was pitch black before, but now everything was illuminated like there was a star-filled night sky overhead. It was still dark, but there was no way this was natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring you knew who did this, you look back at Azelf to see her holding a finger in front of her lips. The message was obvious; shush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHuman, don\u2019t wake up Mesprit okay? I want you to think what you want to say, not actually say it.\u201d</span> She instructed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerbally you sighed, a bit irritated with how having to use just your thoughts to communicate. You imagine it will be difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt won\u2019t be hard, just try.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at Azelf, making her smile and giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSorry! This will be kind of hard for both of us.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me that you\u2019re helping me see in the dark and I\u2019m not mutating or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHuh. Not what I expected. I thought you\u2019d be like \u2018Okay. What do you want?\u2019.\u201d</span> Azelf did a poor imitation of you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBut yes, I am helping you see. You are not mutating.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, good. Now what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf brought her finger down from her face and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou and I have a mission.\u201d</span> She said vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need more details than that. Actually, can I just say no right away?\u201d You snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAw, come on! This is important and I\u2019m trying to be inclusive. I could do this without you, but I want you to come along. You\u2019re a vital source of information.\u201d</span> Azelf suddenly adopted a serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Azelf\u2019s serious expression made you concerned for a moment. The entire time you\u2019ve known her she\u2019d never made such a serious expression. Except for when she was trying to scare you, but the way she was talking didn\u2019t sound the same. You decided\u2026 what was the harm of helping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what\u2019s our mission?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf held her serious expression for a bit longer before it melted into an adorable giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we get outside. But I\u2019ll have to put you in mouth because I have to move quietly. So you might be stuck in there for a while, sorry!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a psychic grip take hold of you and Azelf\u2019s tail removed itself you. Before you could protest, Azelf lifted you towards her and opened her mouth. Her humid breath washed over you as you passed into her maw. She set you down on her tongue gently and closed her mouth, trapping you in its strangely comfortable warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAzelf, do you really have to do this? Can\u2019t you just hold me?\u201d You grumbled, figuring that Mesprit couldn\u2019t hear you from within her sister\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYeah, I sort of do. I don\u2019t want my little buddy to drown.\u201d</span> Azelf noted cutely. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t swallow you. Human food tastes good, but humans\u2026 not so much.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence settled between you two as Azelf made her way to the entrance of the underwater cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDo you want to know how I know humans don\u2019t taste good?\u201d</span> She asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAzelf, I\u2019m not getting fooled again. You got me the first time, but you aren\u2019t going to fool me easily again. Plus, asking that makes you sound super suspicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf huffed, blasting you with a bit of her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOkay, fine. You won\u2019t hear any more scary stories from me. It\u2019s probably best for us to focus on our mission anyways.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, you remained quiet as Azelf dove into the waters of Lake Verity once again. You wondered what sort of mission Azelf had for the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the shores of Lake Verity, Azelf stretched her arms and looked around for a certain object. Realizing she should let you out, the thought of pretending to swallow you briefly entered her head before disappearing. You wouldn\u2019t fall for it, and she couldn\u2019t get a laugh out of your fear like Mesprit could. So she simply spat you out into her waiting paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting released from Azelf\u2019s mouth was, thankfully, very simple. You landed safely and without too much movement in Azelf\u2019s paws. You immediately noticed that your ability to see in the dark had been restored, and that you were completely dry. Which made you pretty happy, being coated in a Pokemon\u2019s saliva hardly seemed any fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there was a problem that immediately grabbed your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly-! It\u2019s cold out here!\u201d You groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYep.\u201d</span> Azelf agreed cheerfully. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s like the middle of the night so it gets pretty cold. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s extra bad for someone your size.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you\u2026 help me with that? I mean you can make me see in the dark, so surely you can warm me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf, who was searching for something else rather than looking at you, spoke, <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell\u2026 I could, but I need that as leverage to make a deal with you.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just help me? It\u2019s too late for me to say no to your mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiled, still keeping her eyes off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh, you catch on quick. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let you freeze. I\u2019m just giving you a choice to be manageably warm, or nice and cozy.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAzelf, just tell me what you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOkay. So right now\u2026 all around me is a nice cozy aura of warmth. It\u2019s not on my hands because\u2026 reasons.\u201d</span> Azelf giggled awkwardly, <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI could give some of it to you and hold you away from me, but it won\u2019t be as warm that way and-\u201d<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying you want to cuddle?\u201d You interrupt the legendary, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s totally what I want. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re embarrassed, it\u2019ll just be a warm hug for now. I don\u2019t want to make you nerv-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is up with you, Mesprit, and cuddling?\u201d You interrupt again. \u201cAm I like, cursed by Mew to have Pok\u00e9mon want to cuddle me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf snickered quietly, though you were still able to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh nothing. It\u2019s just hearing you say that made me think of another legendary I know. A certain wish granter who pretends to be granting people\u2019s wishes but really-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this another one of your stories?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cJeeze.\u201d</span> Azelf rolled her eyes and finally looked at you. \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Would you quit interrupting me?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Um\u2026 sorry. I guess I just, I mean you\u2019re-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a taste of your own medicine, Azelf interrupts you with a sharp, <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHey!\u201d</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could jump out of your skin, Azelf paws rushed to her chest, bringing you with them. The moment you were softly embraced into the legendary\u2019s chest, you felt the biting cold get replaced by a comforting warmth. The pleasant warmth was only challenged by the red of your embarrassed cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I was just messin\u2019 with you.\u201d</span> Azelf finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAzelf! You startled me! That\u2019s not cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHm, neither is cuddling you.\u201d</span> Azelf deflected your protests, <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t really see why Mesprit seems to like it so much. You\u2019re enjoying it though, so I\u2019ll keep doing it I guess.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your blush get worse. Did it look like you were enjoying this? It certainly felt nice to be cuddled by these legendaries, especially when it helped you escape the cold, but you didn't want to look like some pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that you feel really warm is all.\" You insisted defensively, \"Now what's this mission you want my help with? What information could I possibly give a legendary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"You are going to be my shopping list.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... shopping list?\" You ask, very confused. \"Wait, what are you doing with my bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just noticed your bag getting levitated behind the legendary, who simply giggled excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"There's a town nearby with a lot of stores. I bet one of them has lots of tasty human food in it, and you can give me suggestions for new stuff to try!\" Azelf sounded pumped.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're going to steal some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"It's for a good cause.

Really?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head. Azelf's eyes began sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And... do you know how to make food with them?</span>\" she asked with a little bit of anxiety in her voice, nearly beginning to drool at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like a kid with no money staring at candy from outside the shop, which was why you felt slightly bad when you had to tell her that you weren't that good of a chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And plus, even if I knew how to 'make  food with them', I still wouldn't be able to cook at this size.\" you explained to a horrified Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Aw, man...</span>\" she whined dejectedly. She retrieved her cheerfulness almost immediately though,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh well! We can still steal the food though!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her with the same amazement she had been staring at you with earlier - was she just faking being sad? You didn't think so, what a fast change of mood! And you couldn't believe how casual she could be about stealing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, figuring that Azelf couldn't care much about <i>buying</i> things. She was a Legendary, a Lake Guardian, could speak human language perfectly, but she was ultimately a Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Pokemon weren't really used to pay for their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" you gave in, the giantess cuddling you to her chest starting to move again,<br>\r\n\"Wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh, you've gotta be-</span>\" Azelf paused, stopped and looked at you; the annoyance on her face was real this time,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Dude, we're never going to get this done!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The night is still young, Azelf,\" you replied, surprising yourself discovering that you didn't mind the idea of stealing as much as you would have, were you normal-sized. You had one doubt though,<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to know why you wanted to bring me along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess let her head hang to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Weren't you listening before? I want you to be my shopping list.</span>\" she repeated. You saw quieting down, before opening her mouth again and hesitate: even in the dark you could see her cheeks growing red with embarrassment,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And... my sister's been with you for longer than me, so I... just wanted to spend a little time with ya, too.</span>\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her for a few moments, then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you enjoyed being cuddled a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said,<br>\r\n\"Let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf too smiled again as she began moving... only to stop once more, this time on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just felt an enormous amount of power coming from the lake; what she said next wasn't something you expected to come out of a Lake Guardian's mouth,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Ah, crap...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty roar, the water of the lake behind the legendary exploded into an enormous splash as a second legendary revealed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit was furious and, the moment she laid eyes on her sister, a second roar erupted, this time from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">AZE-</span>\" the scream was interrupted as Mesprit suddenly hung her arms; below her, Azelf huffed, holding you a little bit more tightly against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Before physically assaulting me, care to let me explain?</span>\" she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked at her sister, irritated, feeling like doing just as Azelf suggested, but also feeling like doing absolutely nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Didn't we promise we'd never use our powers on each other?</span>\" she replied with another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Pft. Because we've <i>totally</i> kept that promise, didn't we sis?</span>\" Azelf replied sarcastically,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And I've had enough of being smacked for today, thank you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in silence as the two legendaries argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit suddenly found herself able to move again and, albeit still quite angry, she forcibly calmed down. Too bad she couldn't use her powers on herself, though she mentally noted to use them on Azelf in the near future, next time she annoyed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's sister floated down, arms crossed, until she was hovering right in front of her; Mesprit briefly looked at you, her gaze becoming much softer for a moment, before she looked back at her sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay, explain.</span>\" she said, holding out an arm,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Explain to me what you're doing out here in the middle of the night with the human!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf explained herself in just a minute, but it was enough to make Mesprit's mouth hang open; you were still very surprised by how casual she could be about stealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Let me get this right - you were bringing the human to steal food from that town nearby!?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Yup.</span>\" she confirmed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Now, if you'll excuse us, we'll be on our way. You <i>don't</i> want to eat berries for our whole journey, right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well, no b- wait, what journey?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">The one to find Mew to help the human, duh.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's mouth hung open once more. Then, feeling gratitude emanating from you, she looked at you, noticing you staring at her sister with a huge smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had more than one reason to feel happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf had just proclaimed she'd come along, too! That meant Mew would practically forced to give you back your size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Azelf!\" you exclaimed happily, causing the giant legendary to look at you, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Aw, don't mention it. Did you really think I'd abandon you? Ha!</span>\" she replied, moving her hands to bring you to her cheek, beginning to nuzzle you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Though, if you really want to thank me, you're seriously gonna have to help me get food.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her cheek a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit watched the scene without talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister... her sister would come along... the fun she would've had with the human, cut in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd plus, <i>they had the nerve to cuddle right in front of her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to voice her disappointment, Azelf looked at her and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well, since we're all here... why don't you come too, sis?</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Helping the human isn\u2019t a game, Az, I\u2019m taking this seriously.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looked at her sister skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Weren\u2019t you the one playing a game with him when I got here?</span>\u201d She asked. \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">And don\u2019t try to act like you\u2019re so above this. You\u2019re the worst of the three of us with just having to eat berries all the time!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">Nu-uh! You\u2019re the one that steals humans\u2019 food when they leave it out at night near your lake!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hey, they\u2019re on my property so that\u2019s fair game. Besides, leaving food out just attracts other wild, potentially dangerous, Pok\u00e9mon.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">Hmm! Whatever, just get the food quickly. I don\u2019t want the human up too late and being tired for the trip.</span>\u201d Mesprit noted, suddenly not caring about her sister\u2019s future theft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Of course I won\u2019t take long. Humans who own stores always come in early before sunrise so I gotta work quick anyways, right?</span>\u201d Azelf finished her sentence by looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief silence before you realized Azelf\u2019s question was directed towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Um, yeah, I guess. Everything around here is kind of slow though, so store owners probably won\u2019t open for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit focused on you intently as you spoke, but didn\u2019t hear a word you said. Instead, she was bitterly contemplating the fact that Azelf was joining you two on her hunt for Mew. Why did she have to come along? Now Mew would think that she needed Azelf\u2019s help to find her. Which wasn\u2019t going to be the case! She\u2019d find Mew so fast the pink puffball\u2019s head would spin. Plus, now that Mesprit couldn\u2019t have you all to herself, she had no reason to slack off and play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">I\u2019m going back to sleep.</span>\u201d Mesprit huffed, lowering herself into the water. \u201c<span class=\"cppink\">You better be back quick! And no playing without me!</span>\u201d Realizing what she had just said, Mesprit quickly ducked most of her head under the lake, trying to hide her embarrassed blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for her, you didn\u2019t seem to notice and Azelf had her thoughts on other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Alright, we\u2019ll be back soon. Did you want me to pick up anything for you?</span>\u201d She asked casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">No, I don\u2019t want you stealing for me.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Are you sure? I don\u2019t want to hear you complaining about what I got later</span>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">Yes, I\u2019m sure. Get going already!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Are you certain that you\u2019re sure?</span>\u201d Azelf asked, surprisingly not joking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">Yes, I am certain that I am sure! ...Just don\u2019t get anything spicy.</span>\u201d Mesprit muttered quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Knew it.</span>\u201d Azelf smiled. \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Okay, I won\u2019t get anything spicy. See you later!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, Azelf turned her back to Mesprit and flew off with you hugged against her chest. Your bag floated behind you two, getting dragged along with the legendary\u2019s psychic powers. Mesprit watched you two from the water for a while before submerging and heading back to the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</span> Mesprit thought as she swam, \u201c<span class=\"cppink\">Now she\u2019s definitely going to bring back something spicy.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">So, why shouldn\u2019t I get anything from behind doors inside the store? I don\u2019t really get it.</span>\u201d Azelf said, genuinely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Azelf\u2019s confusion made you smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take any of those because that stuff is frozen. They\u2019re kept behind doors so they can stay cool. If you took them out, they\u2019d melt before the sun rises.\u201d You explained to her like you were talking to a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Oooooh, I get it! If the food melts, it won\u2019t be any good.</span>\u201d The legendary concluded proudly. \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">...But I could eat some tonight while we\u2019re shopping\u2026</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made you chuckle. Would having something sweet keep Azelf up all night? Probably not, but the way she was acting made you think that it was possible. You still couldn\u2019t believe that you were going to steal food with a legendary Pok\u00e9mon! Part of you felt bad for stealing food, but most of you didn\u2019t really care. After all, Azelf was the one actually stealing the food. You were just going to give some suggestions and enjoy whatever she took with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Okay, we\u2019re almost there. Are you ready?</span>\u201d Azelf asked, lifting you up in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I don\u2019t really know what sort of food you like, so I\u2019ll help you avoid bringing back anything spicy for Mesprit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Okay.</span>\u201d Azelf nodded. \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">But, just so you know, I love sweet stuff. So tell me about anything super sweet so I can grab it!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Cool. Now, be quiet for a sec, I gotta be careful getting inside.</span>\u201d Azelf said as she hugged you against herself once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to Azelf\u2019s request, you decide to play along and keep quiet for now. You were still hugged comfortably against the friendly Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s chest, so you had no reason to complain. Looking out into the night, you realize that Azelf had taken you to Sandgem town. That made sense, you supposed. Your home town of Twinleaf was pretty small and didn\u2019t have a convenience store. Sandgem was also where you occasionally go shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a startlingly display of speed, Azelf floated down into the small town. As you two rapidly descended, you felt a vaguely familiar tingly sensation washing over your body. Your magical night vision didn\u2019t seem to change, so you assumed that Azelf had just made the two of you invisible. After you two landed into the town, Azelf remained silent but playfully ruffled your hair with a paw. You indignantly tried to shake the offending appendage off, but you were only freed when Azelf was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf floated through the streets of Sandgem for some time, moving slowly and looking around carefully. You were surprised to see the usually excitable legendary acting so cautious. It made sense that she was being careful, you supposed. A legendary Pok\u00e9mon being seen casually floating through a town would cause quite a bit of gossip. You figured that none of the lake trio would want to draw attention to themselves. Especially in a town that hosted a lab owned by a man as serious as Professor Rowan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Azelf gasped happily and turned a corner, bringing you along with her. She had finally found a store that held all of the coveted human food. From what you could tell, it was just a medium sized convenience store. It was plenty big enough to give Azelf a plethora of choices to satisfy her hunger and curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Ooooh. That\u2019s a big one.</span>\u201d You heard Azelf\u2019s voice in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought Azelf was talking about the store. But, after looking more closely, you realized that there was a figure by the store. Laying on the ground outside was a large Luxray, apparently the store\u2019s vigilant guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d You sent your thoughts to the legendary. \u201cScared?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Scared? Ha. That\u2019s cute coming from you.</span>\u201d Azelf ruffled your head again. \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">I just didn\u2019t expect such a big guard Pok\u00e9mon in such a small town. Not that it really matters. Now let\u2019s go inside!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting for your response, Azelf casually floated forward. Even though you had just teased Azelf about being scared of the Luxray, you got really nervous as you floated towards the giant electric type. Imagining being caught by a Pok\u00e9mon like that at your current size, made your heart skip a beat. Mesprit and Azelf were both really sweet and, more importantly, could communicate with you. Luxray on the other hand\u2026 well, there was a reason their natural ability was Intimidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Azelf\u2019s lack of concern was justified as you two floated effortlessly over the sleeping electric Pok\u00e9mon. You flinched briefly as Azelf continued to float towards the window, but relaxed the moment you two harmlessly phased through it. Straining your neck slightly to look to the left, you noticed that your bag had also been brought inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re in.\u201d You said out loud. \u201cSo what kind of stuff did you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only answer you got was silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAzelf?\u201d You tilted your head up to look at your current guardian. The legendary had an absolutely mesmerized look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Oh my- wow! There\u2019s so much food in here!\u201d Azelf laughed joyfully, hugging you a bit more tightly. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be so much good stuff in here! Let\u2019s get shopping! I bet you\u2019ll have a ton of good suggestions!</span>\u201d</span></div></div>",

If the Pokemon out there does wake up, I'll just knock 'em out. It's that simple,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bully.\" you muttered, causing the legendary giantess to look at you with an amused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hey, I could do worse, y'know. Like when-</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'You won\u2019t hear any more scary stories from me', eh Azelf?\" you reminded her in a poor imitation of the legendary, who pouted, but quickly lost her upset expression as she giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You're right, I forgot.</span>\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, extremely grateful that she was so friendly; you doubted many legendaries would accept being teased by humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Anyway, we're wasting time. Come on, we just gotta grab some food and then get out.</span>\" she said with a serious expression that didn't really fit her character. Still, it was adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you replied, still hardly believing you were really going through with this,<br>\r\n\"Lots of sweet stuff, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the perspective, Azelf's expression faded instantly as she nodded her head ecstatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Come on, tell me where to go.</span>\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, look around. You should be able to find snacks somewhere,\" you instructed. Azelf gave a small nod and, with your bag following her around like a loyal Lillipup, she began hovering around; she silently fluttered among various kinds of Pokemon items, Pokeballs and generic stuff until she finally stopped when she found the food section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" you murmured, able to see in the dark thanks to Azelf's aid. With gleaming eyes, the blue giantess looked around, carefully studying the various foods, looking around for anything sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Yummy...</span>\" you heard her whispering dreamily. You wouldn't be surprised if she started drooling all of a sudden; expectantly, the golden-eyed legendary shifted her gaze onto you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Okay, this is where you come in, buddy. What do I grab?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around as well and sighed. Were you really going to have eat sweets for as long as you were tiny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'm gonna be small and fat...\" you mumbled to yourself, finally meeting Azelf's gaze,<br>\r\n\"Let's start with something not sweet, okay? I don't wanna eat sweets all the time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looked horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">But why wouldn't you want that!?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez, she was just like a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not healthy.\" you simply replied. The giantess contemplated you for a couple moments, then shrugged,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Whatever. You can just eat berries with Mesprit.</span>\" she said; the look you sent her made the legendary sigh,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Fine. Jeez, I was just joking, don't look at me like that!</span>\" she complained, looking away from you, moving her gaze to her surroundings,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">So, what do I have to grab for you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrateful, you sent her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, the bag was nearly filled with food and, mercifully, not all of it were sweets... which still took a good percentage, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf was on an entirely different line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Um, there's still some space left. <br>\r\nThat means we can grab more things!</span>\" she happily chimed, her gaze going from the bag's contents to you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">So, what do you suggest, shopping list?</span>\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that!\" you protested indignantly with the sole effect of making Azelf laugh harder, consequently making you even more indignant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you looked around, scanning the shelves, trying to find something that Azelf hadn't already taken and stuffed within the bag... and, by the way, she wasn't kidding about the marshmallows earlier: she had really grabbed two bags of them, along of course with sweet crackers and chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You're taking to long.</span>\" Azel scolded,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">We need to get out of here before the sunrise, remember? Or rather, before even that.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pft, we weren't in here that long, Azelf,\" you retorted, still scanning your surroundings, until your eyes finally fell on some plastic bags containing brown objects. You stared at them in silence, surprised; Azelf noticed and, following your gaze, she spotted the bags as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What are these?</span>\" she asked, fluttering closer to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lava Cookies...\" you murmured, impressed,<br>\r\n\"They're a Hoenn treat. I didn't think I'd ever  find any in Sinnoh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Are they good?</span>\" the legendary holding you in her embrace asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you see for yourself?... Just, don't leave traces, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nodded quietly and suddenly let go of you; you hovered in the air, held by a Psychic grasp as she casually grabbed a cookie and carefully ripped the plastic from around it before giving a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Azelf's eyes began sparkling and, just as quickly, the cookie was gone, embarked on a one-way journey to the gluttonous legendary's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">That was great!</span>\" she squealed, satisfied, tossing the empty wrapper in your bag, before proceeding to do the same with a bunch of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think that's enough,\" you commented, seeing how the bag was now filled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">For now,</span>\" Azelf added happily, grabbing a hold of you once,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You're a wonderful shopping list.</span>\" she praised, ruffling your hair once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me that.\" you repeated as you were once again trapped in her warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary sent you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Let's get out of here.</span>\"</span></div></div>",

But what caused the legendary's heart to start racing was seeing Uxie with her eyes open as she examined the small human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noticing her sibling, Uxie rose her head, her eyelids closing to hide her eyes, carefully avoiding making eye contact. She didn't want to erase anyone's memories by mistake, but hers was such an interesting find that she felt the need to examine it better; the little human had fainted, anyway, so there was no real danger... unless, of course, he didn't wake up all of a sudden and happened to look at Uxie right in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she got interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hello, Mesprit.</span>\" she greeted with a wave of her free paw. Then, she noticed the expression on Mesprit's face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Um... is something bothering you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit was, in fact, staring daggers at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Uxie, what have you done to this human!?</span>\" she yelled angrily, causing a startled Uxie to float back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-I did absolutely nothing!</span>\" she defended, rising her free paw,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">He was already this small, I simply sensed him and picked him up,</span>\" she explained, calming down a little,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">This small one lost consciousness the moment he saw me, I assume out of surprise or fear... and he was concealing his appearance, for some reason. I turned him back.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit listened, then huffed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I already knew two of those things.</span>\" she revealed, annoyed<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">But why erase his memories?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie tilted her head, confused. Then, she remembered she had been staring at the unconscious human with her eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I did no such thing.</span>\" she calmly explained,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">He had already fainted when I picked him up. I was merely taking a better look at him.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit knew that her sister wasn't one to use her power on random humans for no apparent reason, yet she still felt the need to check; a quick scan of Uxie's emotions revealed no guilt, shame or nervousness whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing that she had been jumping to conclusions, Mesprit blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Sorry sis.</span>\" she meekly apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">It's alright.</span>\" Uxie replied, hovering closer to her pink-headed sibling, holding you up,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, you mentioned that you were aware of this unnaturally tiny human, correct?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit rose her head and nodded, gently picking your unconscious self from Uxie's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yeah,</span>\" she replied, wondering how much fear you must have felt to lose consciousness; she would have certainly felt it too, if she wasn't limiting her powers back then,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm actually taking care of him.</span>\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... What?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit pouted, remembering what she was doing before Uxie showed up. And she had almost finished counting, too! All that effort had been a complete waste of her time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Aw, we were in the middle of game, and you ruined it!</span>\" she complained. Then, Mesprit remembered herself wondering why Uxie was here, so far from her own lake,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Why are you even here, Ux?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Uxie's turn to blush as she floated back, her fingers clasping together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Mesprit wasn't the only one to jump to conclusions, sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well... I sensed that you were awake and thought I'd come to check...</span>\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit felt an indescribable amount of embarrassment coming from her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... You totally thought I was under attack or something, didn't you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What!? No!</span>\" Uxie exclaimed, looking to the side, her blush extending,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">But I did think that your awakening was kind of sudden...</font></span>\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie decided that this was a good moment to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, it's my turn to ask questions,</span>\" she spoke, floating closer to her sibling, pointing a finger to you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What does it mean that you are taking care of this human? Why is he so small?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed, holding out a paw, gesturing for Uxie to follow as she began floating back to Lake Verity with you on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I don't know all the details myself, since I was asleep, </span>\" she began explaining,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">But, it was Mew who did this. She shrunk this human to this size.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Mew?</span>\" Uxie parroted back, perplexed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Why would Mew be here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sis, I just told you I have no idea!</span>\" Mesprit retorted,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">According to what the human said, Mew just appeared and shrunk him. It was some sort of prank or challenge... at least, it's what we believe.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie halted in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But, that's... unacceptable!</span>\" she yelled all of a sudden; Mesprit sensed a certain level of irritation growing within her and couldn't stop herself from giggling. Uxie had always been terrible at hiding her emotions.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">We're supposed to lay low, and she just... goes ahead and plays pranks on humans! It's like she doesn't even care about the consequences!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit became serious all of a sudden, remembering feeling a similar level of frustration when she heard your tale straight for you. Her reasons, however, were entirely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Not only that,</span>\" she chimed, frowning,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Who does she think she is, pranking people 'round my lake?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie didn't reply, and for several seconds she remained in silence; then, she spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... I'm going to locate her, then we can solve this-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No, wait!</span>\" Mesprit interrupted, placing her free hand on Uxie's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mystery how you were able to sleep throughout the entire conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I promised this human I'd help him find Mew, and that's exactly what I'm going to do,</span>\" Mesprit said, adopting a determined smile, just like before, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">However, just like I told this human... I'll let Mew roam free for the next day. Then, I'll start chasing her.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie was perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Why?</span>\" was the only thing she could utter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's grin became almost creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Because, it'll be more challenging this way.</span>\" she bluntly admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie became silent once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even know where to start. So, she chose a physical way to show how she was feeling: her open palm met her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... That sounds exactly like the kind of selfish thing you'd do.</span>\" she said in the end, causing her pink-headed sibling to pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Think what you like.</span>\" Mesprit simply replied, turning her back to Uxie, grumbling to herself, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You try to have a little fun and suddenly you're selfish.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighed and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh, sis...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still reeling from what had just transpired, you couldn\u2019t believe how rotten your luck had become! Not too long ago, you earned your first gym badge with the help of your only partner. After that, you got to spend a few relaxing days in Rustboro city to celebrate your first win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne, Rustboro\u2019s gym leader, was even kind enough to let you attend a few of her advanced courses at the Pokemon school. The courses you attended were all about the Hoen region\u2019s gym leaders. Who they were, what types they used, and what cities they all lived in. She even briefly discussed the time of years all the gym leaders were always taking time off. With all of that extra information, you thought you could have planned out a pretty good journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of those good results and generosity were wasted because of your unfortunate encounter with a legendary Pokemon. And that wasn\u2019t something you ever thought would be considered unfortunate. Most people would kill for a chance to meet a legendary Pokemon, let alone get some pictures with one. Then again, they didn\u2019t know that meeting a legendary apparently ended with them being shrunk and challenged to find the same ultra rare Pokemon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out an angry huff of breath, trying to calm yourself down a bit. There was no use in being angry right now. Well, there was a good reason for your anger, but it was pointless to dwell on it. It wouldn\u2019t help you find Mew, and it could distract you so much that you wouldn\u2019t even notice any danger before it struck. You had to focus on what you should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit calmer now, you take some time to go over what you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now you were on the outskirts of Rustboro city, near the large lake that acted as a sort of gate to the city. You remember how cool the extensive walkway over the lake seemed when you first came to Rustboro; and that double battle that you managed to win with only your one partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of your partner, you recalled they told you they were going to stay by the shore of the lake while you slept. You briefly wondered if having your partner with you might have stopped this from happening. Maybe Mew wouldn\u2019t have been as eager to play with you if you had them with you. It\u2019s not like your partner could necessarily fight off Mew, but you assumed Mew wouldn\u2019t like being seen by any sort of group. She probably preferred individuals so she could do stuff like she did to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t remember anything else especially important about where you were. You had no reason to count how many people were around before you fell asleep. But, you guessed it was safe to say that there was no one too close by. Otherwise, they would have spotted Mew and scared her away. Of course, someone could have shown up by now without you knowing. The grass around you was so tall that it prevented you from seeing very far away. So being concerned about other people right now was pretty much irrelevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thing went for wild Pokemon. If one found you without your partner, you probably had no choice but to deal with it yourself. But there was even less of a chance for you to see a wild Pokemon before it found you. So neither of those things were something you had to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was decide between going to find your partner or going back to Rustboror. Both options had their pros, cons, and dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to Rustboro was probably immediately safer, but the long term danger was greater. You believed the city was slightly closer to you than the lake. That was good because you\u2019d be out in the wild less and less likely to run into a wild Pokemon. You were also more generally visible in a city than tucked away in grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was that you had no idea who you should go to for help there. The only person that came to mind was Roxanne, who had been exceptionally nice to you. She probably would be a big help, but the problem was getting to her. The only places you knew she could be were her gym and the school, which were both far inside the city. Getting to either of them would mean having to get past a lot of people and who knows what else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich led you to your other option of going to the lake and finding your partner. You knew that you could one hundred percent trust your partner to help you, and they were a lot closer than the gym and school! Yet\u2026 that meant you had to be out in the wild for longer. The chances of running into a wild Pokemon was a lot higher and the limited vision was very worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try to find a trainer wandering around nearby. Their presence would probably scare away or at least distract any wild Pokemon. But they could also miss you completely and crush you by accident. Then again, avoiding being crushed by one person would be a lot easier than avoiding an entire city full of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tough decision, but you had to choose quickly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though you had spent a long time sorting out your options and going over how difficult of a decision this would be, you made your choice pretty quickly. The moment you thought about making a decision, only one of your options seemed to be the right one. Finding your Pokemon partner just felt like the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I didn\u2019t have to waste time thinking things over.\u201d You manage to laugh, in spite of your grim situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking in a direction before stopping dead in your tracks. You had to make sure that you were actually heading towards the lake. The \u201ctall\u201d grass was still cutting off most of your view, so you couldn\u2019t really see for yourself. There wasn\u2019t an easy way to figure that out, so you just had to try something to improve your chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought you come up with an idea. You quickly wet your finger and try holding it up high in the air, hoping you could feel the direction of the wind. Just as quickly as you brought it up, you brought your finger down and shook it dry. Figuring out what direction the wind was blowing was pointless. The two things didn\u2019t have any correlation and wouldn\u2019t help you find the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could try to smell for it? Like the ocean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the lake didn\u2019t really have a distinct smell. You were just desperate for a way to guarantee that you would go to the lake. But, you didn\u2019t have a way to make sure so you just had to take a chance. So with a sigh you start heading, you assumed, south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, once I get to her, everything will be fine.\u201d You tried to assure yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging on to whatever confidence you could muster, you kept moving forward. Even though you were doing your best to stay calm, you were constantly on edge. The grass around you encumbered your vision a lot more than you were comfortable with. Every time you moved to push aside more grass, it felt like your heart stopped. At any moment you could part the grass and come face to face with a wild Pokemon, which could easily be the end of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that a Pokemon could always wander up and find you, but you weren\u2019t as worried about that. If that could happen, you\u2019d probably hear it rustling the grass before you found it\u2026 or it found you. At least then you\u2019d have some way to avoid it or at least be prepared to face a giant Pokemon. Even if ending up in the gullet of a Tailow or some other Pokemon was inevitable, you would prefer for it to not be a sudden surprise.Of course you could also get poisoned to death or paralyzed by a giant Shroomish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t a fan of the grim thoughts you were having, but they were the only things that popped into your head right now. At any moment something you didn\u2019t notice could pop out and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParting another tuft of grass, you instinctively scream when you see something unfamiliar. Your scream quickly dies out though, since what you saw was actually good. You had found the lake! And what\u2019s more, you could see your partner too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, I knew I\u2019d be fine the whole time.\u201d You lie to yourself. \u201cNothing can catch me by surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are immediately proven wrong as a Zigzagoon comes zooming out of some of the tall grass nearby, causing you to scream and fall. Thankfully the creature hadn\u2019t noticed you and simply ran off somewhere, but you still felt the sting of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh. ...I just gotta get Mawile\u2019s attention and then I won\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u201d You mumble, scratching at your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never been so happy to see Mawile before. Even though she was still far away from you, just seeing her made everything feel alright. She was your faithful partner, and you had known her for awhile before you two even started the gym challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two didn\u2019t have some sappy story about how she hatched from an egg that you raised since you were a kid. In fact, you two started out on less than stellar standings. She was a Pokemon with a bit of a reputation around your hometown. A feisty Mawile with a little scar on her left ear who was way too eager to fight. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for the people working outside to find KOed Pokemon because of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just as willing to mess with humans as she was wild Pokemon. She stole stuff from the local market a lot and would sometimes go around town checking to see if people\u2019s homes were locked. They always were, but everyone guessed that Mawile probably would have stolen from any place that wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople from outside of town were some of the most frequent victims. It became a monthly bet for the whole town: how many travelers would show up without their backpack or luggage because of her? She was a regular old trouble maker, but she was also good enough to become your partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happened to be a frequent victim of hers. She never really harmed a human, at least not too much, but she was still able to take stuff from you a lot. Mostly food, which you never felt too bad about losing. But sometimes she\u2019d take something a bit more important like a coat or an umbrella, that kind of bothered you. But she was so intimidating you just couldn\u2019t stop yourself from giving her what she wanted. You heard that some Pokemon had that sort of ability \u201cIntimidate\u201d or something like that. Mawile\u2019s ability must\u2019ve been \u201cIntimidate EX\u201d you used to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day though, all of that caught up to her. She must have stolen one to many backpacks or something, because a bunch of Pokemon hunters showed up at your home town. Well\u2026 hunters sounds worse than what they were. They were just a special division of Pokemon rangers who dealt with troublesome Pokemon. You always thought they were meant for natural disasters, not a local bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, the rangers ended up making short work of her. A few days after they showed up, Mawile was in town under ranger supervision. The first time they got her, they put her in a big cage so they could report back to their headquarters. But she ended up escaping by pulling some of the bars apart; the cage was meant for much bigger Pokemon after all. But they snatched her again real quick, put her in handcuffs; which looked strangely hilarious; and kept her under supervision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of days later, everyone in town was told that Mawile was going to be shipped away. She had caused enough trouble in the area and was going to be relocated somewhere more open with a lower population count. She would only be kept in town one more day for a checkup at the Pokemon Center, which was open for people to watch for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, you felt compelled to go and see Mawile off for the last time. She had never been that bad, so you sort of liked her... in a vitriolic way. You watched her whole check up, done by the rangers\u2019 own doctor instead of the local nurse. You were surprised when she actually behaved the whole time. But you realized quickly that it was because she seemed depressed. Her usual fire was replaced by bored submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason that hit you hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really sure what you were thinking, you ended up talking to the Pokemon rangers that night. You discussed the possibility of you\u2026 becoming Mawile\u2019s trainer. They were blunt and asked why you would want that. You simply said that you felt attached to her. The rangers laughed, but agreed to let you ask if she\u2019d be your partner. They also made you sign a waiver, saying that you would be responsible for Mawile\u2019s misbehavior from now on. It might\u2019ve been meant to scare you away, but it didn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all ended up working out. Mawile became a real, genuinely great partner. She caused minor amounts of trouble at first, and you two always butted heads, but you and her ended up enjoying each other\u2019s company. She\u2019s dropped her overall aggression and no longer openly steals things. You could still remember how she reacted when you asked her to be your partner. She was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cM-Mawile?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, you were woken from your dream-like reminiscing state. Towering in front of you was the partner who\u2019s past you had been happily thinking about. She looked down at you with an almost unreadable expression, though you could see a bit of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you were a bit confused as well. Had you really already made your way over to Mawile.Last time you looked the walk out in the open should have taken you a while. But, apparently, you did the whole thing while fondly thinking about the past!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey Mawile.\u201d You call up to her awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s me\u2026 your partner. Ahaha, I sort of just wandered up to you like this without realizing.\u201d You spoke, unsure what to say right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile\u2019s mouth closed and opened again, still processing what she was looking at. Without saying anything, she gently grabbed you in one of her hands and raised you off the ground. She continued to stare at you silently, struggling to make any progress in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two stare at each other for a while, you slowly begin to recognize a change in her expression. Soon, you were able to figure out what exactly Mawile was feeling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Very quickly, Mawile\u2019s unreadable expression of confusion turned into a look of smug amusement. Coyly, she put a hand under her chin and muttered her name under her breath. Apparently, Mawile was entertained by your little predicament rather than concerned. Part of you totally expected this, Mawile and you did have a sort of vitriolic relationship, even as partner and trainer. But, even though it was hard to spot, you could still see a gleam of concern in Mawile\u2019s eyes that made it clear you were safe with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cHey Boss, you look different. Did you change something while you were gone?\u201d</span></u> Mawile asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are totally enjoying this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d You ask Mawile with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile shook her free hand slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little huh?\u201d You say skeptically. \u201cThen why are you trying not to laugh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMawile?\u201d</span> The giantess asked, a corner of her mouth clearly twitching upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t always understand what you\u2019re saying, but I can read your expressions. Just admit that you like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s not exactly something I\u2019ll complain about.\u201d</span></u> Mawile let her poorly hidden smile make itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it. I just hope you don\u2019t enjoy this too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI\u2019ll try not to look as pleased as I really am all the time.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing it would probably be better for you, Mawile let go of her grip around you and left you standing on her open palm. She chuckled at the sight, but it quickly became a resigned sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMaw\u2026 Mawile, wile?\u201d</span> Your partner seemed curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to know what happened to me? Well, I\u2019m glad to see some outward concern for once.\u201d You smile slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile gave you a serious look and used her free hand to flick you in the arm. You knew that she was trying to be gentle, but the hit still stung. But, all she was trying to do was tell you to be serious, so you couldn\u2019t be mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be serious. This might sound a little weird, but it's the truth and you\u2019ll have to believe me. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile nodded her head and uttered her name quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now, it didn\u2019t happen that long ago. I was minding my own business when\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t-\t\t-\t\t-\t\t-\t\t-\t\t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the last thing I did was come back here to get your attention.\u201d You concluded your explanation. You went over everything that happened before you met with Mawile. There wasn\u2019t that much to tell, but you did your best to remember everything because any of it could be important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile, for her part, remained quiet and serious the whole time. Though she sort of smiled when you told her you had taken selfies with the legendary Pok\u00e9mon. Other than that, she was completely attentive and you noticed her fingers occasionally curling closer to you. You wanted to assume that it was her naturally reacting protectively, but considering her you also could chalk it up to just a bit of nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you were finished, Mawile sighed wearily. <u><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cSo that pink puff ball did this to you? Why couldn\u2019t she have gotten someone other than Boss?\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Mawile thinking to herself and speak up. \u201cHey, Mawile!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Pokemon quickly turned to look at you again. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMawile?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to interrupt your thoughts, but I just wanted your attention on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile just gave you a confused look, her scarred ear drooping slightly. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWile?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t really have a reason I guess. I just feel like anything could happen to me. I\u2019m just paranoid that a Taillow or something will gobble me out of your hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile\u2019s fingers curled closer again but went back to normal almost instantly. Your partner looked at you warmly, a confident smile on her face. Muttering her name, she raised her other hand and clenched it into a fist. You recognized the message instantly. Mawile would beat the crap out of anyone who even tried to touch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, you scratch your cheek with a finger and laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 really good to hear Mawile, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile let her fist loosen and confidently leaned back. <u><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cDid you expect anything else from me?\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one thing\u2026\u201d You begin seriously, making Mawile look concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s make sure you don\u2019t beat up the people trying to help me.\u201d You smiled slyly at your giant partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMaw!\u201d</span> Mawile groaned and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were almost like normal between you two.</span></div></div>",

The pair looked at Mawile with mystified and amused expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cHey, you\u2019re seeing what I\u2019m seeing, right?\u201d</span> One figure asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOf course I am but\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it! That is the Mawile we know, right?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cYep, with that scar on her ear and the way she holds herself , it\u2019s obvious. Now, do you see what she's holding?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</span>The shadowy figured leaned forward. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI can\u2019t make it out very well but it looks like a doll. It\u2019s super small though.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cHa! A doll!\u201d</span> The other figure spoke, astounded. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cI would never believe it if I wasn't seeing it as we spoke.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYeah, me neither.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cYou know what I\u2019m thinking, right?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYeah I am. But\u2026 are you sure? That could end pretty badly.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cAh we\u2019ll be fine! Are you ready? We cannot miss this chance!\u201d</span> The shadowy figure bounced with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d</span> The other agreed casually. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWe\u2019ll probably regret this later but what the heck.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mawile, now we need to figure out what to do next.\u201d You told her once you stopped laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMawile.\u201d</span> Your partner said simply, pointing to Rustboro with the thumb of her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. Now the first thing I thought of was going to the Pok\u00e9mon Center. But then I thought what about Rox-aaaaaaahhhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even register what happened, you felt something grab hold of your leg and start carrying you through the air. Whatever it was that grabbed you was incredibly fast, so much so that the world around you whipped by in a blur. Your only dangers were getting sick and whiplash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile was focusing intently on you as you stood on her paw, too preoccupied with figuring out what to do next to make fun of you right now. One moment you were talking to her and the next, something snatched you out of her paw! And another thing tried to push her over! All it managed to do was nudge her a little but whatever it was quickly followed the thing that had taken you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cHey!\u201d</span> Mawile shouted, sounding more irritated than angry. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea!? Give him back to me before I kick your-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that the two figures hadn\u2019t stopped running, Mawile stopped talking and instead ran after the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhen I get you two, you\u2019re gonna wish you pissed off a herd of Tauros instead of me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter who knows how long of being violently shaken by whatever had grabbed you, everything finally stopped moving. Stopped moving physically at least. Your head, which was miraculously still attached to the rest of your body, was still spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, whatever had grabbed you wasn\u2019t running anymore and they seemed to have settled into a spot. Things kept getting better as you stopped being held by just your leg and were gripped firmly but relatively gently between what felt like two paws. As long as you weren\u2019t about to be thrown down a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s gullet, things were marginally improving for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you weren\u2019t getting tossed down a gullet, your head was slowly able to recover until the headache and blurry vision went away. You desperately wanted to rub your eyes, but the paws held your arms tightly at your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstandably nervous, but well aware that you would have to eventually, you looked at whatever had just kidnapped you. To your surprise, you hadn\u2019t been taken by one Pok\u00e9mon, but a team of two! Even more surprising, you actually recognized these two troublemakers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieve it or not, your hometown had more troublemaking Pok\u00e9mon than just Mawile. You had problems remembering all of them, but Plusle and Minun were two that you remembered very distinctly. After all, they were by far the most \u2018popular\u2019 of your town\u2019s resident Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two were a very different type of troublemaker than Mawile was. They didn\u2019t threaten to beat people up and try to establish themselves as the tough ones. They simply couldn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t sneak around town, testing doors to see if they were unlocked, or trying to take stuff from street stalls. They didn\u2019t have to. Plusle and Minun didn\u2019t try to make trouble. They just were trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were, for lack of a better term, brats. The two of them were adorable, and the town loved them for that. And Plusle and Minun were well aware of that. So they used their cuteness to get things, whatever they wanted. They always got free food, even though they were wild Pok\u00e9mon who would never pay back the person in any way. People would knit or craft them cute stuff that they\u2019d wear for a while before it disappeared forever. The two of them were given more stuff than most wild Pok\u00e9mon would even dream of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile took stuff, Plusle and Minun were given stuff and expected to keep receiving more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, this was all mostly harmless. It wasn\u2019t that different from how many people treated their Snubbull, Furfrou, or other stereotypically spoiled Pok\u00e9mon. But those cases were usually one person spoiling one Pok\u00e9mon. Plusle and Minun were being spoiled by a whole town. So the two of them were\u2026 less cute when someone was alone with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were well aware of that. You always seemed to end up alone with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the two of them would still act cute like they always did. But since they were used to being adored by so many people, your attention alone usually wasn\u2019t enough. You always had something ready for them, especially after meeting them alone became a normal thing, but they were never satisfied. Give them a bit of petting and nice words, and they\u2019ll quickly get bored and skamper off\u2026 or start going through your bag while it\u2019s still on your back. You try to give them a gift, like a blanket or something, and they\u2019ll look it over. If they like it, they\u2019ll treat it like any other gift, use it for a bit and then throw it out. If they don\u2019t like it, one would distract you by acting appreciative while the other threw it away somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that consistently made them happy was sweets. They enjoyed getting any kind of treat, even simple things like sweet berries. They couldn\u2019t always be bothered to be super appreciative, but it kept them under control. Even that didn\u2019t please them forever, they expected you to mix up the variety of gifts after all. And if you had a few visits without anything\u2026 they\u2019d give you a shock and be on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t have as much of an impact as Mawile did, but they were just as troublesome as she was. To you they were, at least. Especially now that they were giant enough to whip you around like a rag doll while running from Mawile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to call to them and ask why they had taken you, or why they had left your hometown in the first place, but you were when the two of them and you were rocked by a massive tremor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cYou two rats get down here, or I\u2019ll punch this tree down!\u201d</span> Mawile shouted up to the two Pok\u00e9mon after leaving a noticeable crack in the tree\u2019s stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cAs if!\u201d</span> Plusle said tauntingly from above. <span class=\"clred\">\u201cAnd if you try punching this tree down, we\u2019ll just hop to the next one. There\u2019s plenty to chose from.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinun, the one who was holding you snickered mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile clenched a fist angrily and glared at the duo.<span class=\"clgrey\"> \u201cGive him back to me. If you play nice, I\u2019ll let you walk away without consequence. The rest of that town ain\u2019t here to keep you safe.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cOh, I\u2019m so scared. That\u2019d be a lot more threatening coming from a Pok\u00e9mon who didn\u2019t play with dolls.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlusle and Minun both pulled an eye down and stuck out their tongues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI don\u2019t have a stinkin\u2019 doll! You just stole my trainer, and you do not mess with the boss while I\u2019m around!\u201d</span> Mawile wasn\u2019t shouting anymore, but anyone who understood her could hear the threatening undertone of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cHa! Don\u2019t lie to us. A human that small? Don\u2019t be ridiculous! You\u2019re just mad we\u2019re playing with your toy.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing how to play along, Minun held you out in front of her face, using one paw to hold an arm each. Tauntingly, she started swaying you back and forth and rocking you up and down. Which made you very uncomfortable and embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cQ-quit that! You\u2019re gonna hurt \u2018im.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Aww, don't be sad. We'll give you your doll back once we're-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Gah!\"</span> Minun's screaming interrupted Plusle's taunting, just in time for her to see you dropping from the tree branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Minun, what are you doing? We could've taunted her more and-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"T-that wasn't a doll!\"</span> Minun muttered, shocked and sounding a little guilty. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I-it was her trainer. The guy who always tried to give us stuff and... and I just dropped him!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnxiously, the pair got on their knees and looked over the edge of the large branch. Both their hearts raced with anticipation and dread, Minun's going much faster than Plusle's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their relief, you had been safely caught by Mawile below... who looked <i>really</i> angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... idiots! I'm going to destroy you! I'm gonna make <i>all</i> of you red, Plusle! And when I'm done with you Minun, you'll be black and blue instead of white and blue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Um... I'm more of a cream.\"</span> Minun pointed out meekly.</span></div></div>",

You were completely powerless to stop anything that fate decided to throw your way! Heck, you couldn't even see past these blades of grass you were surrounded by!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd worst of all, you were alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up at the last thought, which you discarded as incorrect: you weren't exactly alone, you reminded yourself as a small wave of relief washed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered your two Pokemon come with you, and they just happened to hate being confined in their Pokeballs, which was why you kept them out all the time; they weren't around back when Mew showed up and shrunk you, but they must have been nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, without hesitation, you decided to go find them to get their attention and, possibly, help. You were sure they'd help you; after all, both were especially fond of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>They've got to be...</i>' you thought to yourself as you traveled through the forest of grass, trying to find a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on...\" you mumbled, pushing blade after blade out of the way so that you could pass, wondering where your partners were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, you would find them before the sun set; you had recently met and challenged Morty, the gym leader of Ecruteak Town; in a conversation with him after you won, he told you that ghost-type Pokemon had a tendency to show themselves around town at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that conversation, you tried to avoid move during nighttime. Unlike one of your Pokemon, but she could handle ghosts by herself without issue, you thought with sudden pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped back to reality - you had to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, as you pushed away a few more blades of grass, you noted that you had finally managed to get out of the patch of grass you were in. And not too far, much to your relief, were your loyal Pokemon, seemingly sleeping next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust seeing their figures took you back in time: finding an Eevee was somewhat rare, but finding two at the same time proved that you were particularly... well, maybe more than you had been now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had captured them both, making them your partners in battle, and you always did your best to treat them as well as you could; in return, they did their best in battle and never complained about how they were treated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the time, they both became very attached to you; so much in fact that one of them eventually evolved into an Espeon one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only Eevee you had left was pretty envious, but you comforted her, telling that she would evolve at some point as well, though, when you said that, you never expected it to happen that same night, when your other Eevee evolved into Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evolution of your two Eevee made you feel joyous. Not because they grew stronger, faster and tougher, but because Eevee only evolved into Espeon or Umbreon when they were extremely happy, and that proved that your two former Eevee truly loved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a somewhat nostalgic sigh, before shaking your head to rid it of such thoughts: this was no time to lose yourself in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began moving again and hastily made your way to Umbreon, who was napping with her head in her paws and her tail hanging. She liked sleeping during the day, but became very active during the dark hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder, given her type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also became very serious ever since she evolved, though she still cared deeply about you, and that was why you chose to head to her; Espeon, despite caring for you as well, was much more playful than her dark-type counterpart was when it came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving swiftly, you positioned yourself right in front of Umbreon's muzzle, feeling her warm breath blowing from her nostrils and into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umbreon! Wake up!\" you called, getting no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried several more times, until you eventually saw her ears twitching and Umbreon herself rising her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-furred giantess turned to the side to let out a deep yawn, before pointing her red eyes in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Umbreon became alert as she saw you standing before her at two inches or less tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">U-Umb?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Umbreon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Um, umbreon!?</span>\" she exclaimed in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, easily figuring out what she was asking, and began explaining; when you finished telling her about your encounter with Mew, Umbreon turned to the still sleeping Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">Espy, wake up!</span></u>\" she called, getting no reply, which triggered Umbreon to drive her hind left leg into the psychic-type's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't surprised, the two of them always had some kind of rivalry, especially since they evolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">Ow!</span></u>\" Espeon yelled as she rose, fully awake, shooting Umbreon a glare,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">What's the big idea!?</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Umbreon pointed her paw to you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Um.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Umbreon's paw, Espeon gazed down and spotted you, adopting the same look of confusion and shock the dark-type had when she first discovered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Esp, espeon!?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you sighed and once more you began telling about your encounter with Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of your tale, Espeon looked at you skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">Seriously? Are you sure you didn't just hit your head when you laid down?</span></u>\" she said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">How do you explain his size then?</span></u>\" Umbreon chimed in, leading Espeon to sigh,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">I can't.</span></u>\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon smirked briefly, before returning serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">Well, we certainly can't leave him like that.</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">And here I though <i>I</i> was the psychic.</span></u>\" Espeon sneered, causing Umbreon to sigh,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">Espy, this is serious! We've got to do something!</span></u>\" she chided.<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">What are we supposed to do?</span></u>\" the psychic-type retorted, before looking down in disappointment,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">I'm... I'm not even sure I could grow him again: my Psychic is no match against Mew's...</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led Umbreon to look down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, while the two behemoths chatted among themselves, you watched them saying their own names over and over while trying to think of something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could you even do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't figure anything out, but you certainly couldn't stay here forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling observed, you suddenly looked up: Espeon and Umbreon were staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if, perhaps, the two had thought of something. </span></div></div>",

U-Um?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon nodded, before she looked back down at you; after a moment, you began hearing a familiar voice speaking within your mind,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"clilac\">We need to find Mew.</span></i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched upon hearing Espeon's voice in your head as she spoke to you through telepathy; she had done it many times ever since she evolved. You recalled having jumped the first time she developed the skill, deciding to use you as a test dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said than done, Espeon...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">That's not the only issue,</span></u>\" Umbreon chimed, earning a look from Espeon,<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">Mew's infinitely stronger than we are. Even if we did find her, what could we do? Kneel and beg?</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon sighed. Both you and Umbreon had solid points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">Then, what do you suggest, Umbreon?</span></u>\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type glanced down, remaining silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must have been something to do, something that could help you that didn't imply hunting Mew down. Sadly, if that something existed, Umbreon had no idea what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">I don't know...</span></u>\" she eventually admitted, sighing deeply, before looking at you in a concerned manner; a small smile, a rare expression for Umbreon, appeared on her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Um, umbre,</span>\" she spoke in a comforting manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"clilac\">We're gonna help you, someway,</span></i>' Espeon helpfully translated, before growing a smile herself. Okay, perhaps she was guilty of having been somewhat mischievous to you in the past, even as an Eevee, but she still cared a great deal about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only had the time to smile back, before Espeon's tail reached you, coiling around your waist and lifting you off the ground and up to the psychic-type's head, where you were dropped ankle-deep in a sea of silky purple fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were glad you had your Pokemon on your side; they were going to help, no matter what. You quickly became serious again though, there would be plenty of time to be thankful later, when you were hopefully back to your original stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, girls,\" you said, looking in between the dark-type and the psychic-type, before your gaze ultimately settled on the latter,<br>\r\n\"So, have you got a plan? 'Cause I certainly don't.\" you said in a dejected tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"clilac\">Well, yeah... well, it's more of an idea,</span></i>' she replied telepathically,<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"clilac\">We're going to try Mew around here.</span></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't sound like a plan at all, though you refrained yourself from pointing that out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And if she's not?\" you said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon quieted down, suggesting that she had no idea; Umbreon hastily placed a paw onto her shoulder,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">We'll think of something.</span></u>\" she barked, causing Espeon to look at her and nod.<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">Right. Now, let's go.</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that being said, both Pokemon began moving, trotting alongside each other... in a completely random direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait!\" you shouted from Espeon's head, causing both to halt and look at you,<br>\r\n\"Do you even know what direction Mew took?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same moment, both giantesses blushed brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That way.\" you told, pointing a finger in the direction Mew previously took. Obediently, Espeon and Umbreon began moving in that direction; they silently agreed that none of them was ever going to speak about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile moving moderately fast, Espeon tried to sense any trace of psychic powers with her own psychic; sadly, she couldn't feel anything, which either meant Mew wasn't around or she was pretty good at concealing her presence, both of which sounded pretty plausible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you were wondering how much ahead Mew was; she could fly, so that meant she had a huge headstart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you began doubting you were really going to find her, even with the aid of your two Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd I even get myself into this...?\" you murmured to yourself. However, the sentence didn't go unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"clilac\">Don't worry. We're going to find Mew. You're going back to normal, one way or another...</span></i>' Espeon spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the situation, you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the situation, Espeon smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"clilac\">Oh, don't worry. There'll be plenty of time for you to thank me later.</span></i>' she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot a look at Umbreon; judging from her expression, she wasn't far from Espeon's thought process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Espeon. Most definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed, yet the search was unfruitful: Mew was nowhere to be found, and not even Espeon's sharp psychic was of any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was still high, but it wouldn't be long before it disappeared over the horizon. You gave it another hour or two without consulting your PokeGear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Um, breon,</span>\" Umbreon spoke at some point, suggesting a small break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon registered the suggestion, but didn't listen, her eyes fixed on something ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her gaze, Umbreon noted what her fellow teammate was staring at: a cave  just beside the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">Umbreon, do you think...?</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">It's possible.</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's the matter?\" you butted in, noting your Pokemon acting strange; in response, Umbreon pointed her paw to the cave the two were staring at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've read of that place on the map. Mt. Mortar or something...\" you declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a couple moments to understand what Espeon and Umbreon were thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You two think Mew's in there?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nod from both of them was your answer, before they moved their gaze from the cave to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"cplum\">What do we do, Boss?</span></u>\" Umbreon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon instinctively shook her head, before looking at Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clilac\">... 'Boss'? Since when you call him 'Boss'?</span></u>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon was promptly ignored and looked at her own head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that both were awaiting orders.</span></div></div>",

Mew's here!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon ran a few, before slumping back down.

You wanted to respect it, since it was being friendly and playful. You\u2019ve heard tales of Mew, and to be honest... you could of taken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your first move was to whip out your Pokeball and challenge her, you could of beaten and then captured Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were after all, one of the best trainers in the world. You\u2019ve travelled the land with your Pokemon. All of them being top level defeating Gym Leaders and Elite Fours everywhere you went. You have travelled to every region, and your Pokemon reflected on that strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now you were in Kalos, trying to catch a Flabebe. You\u2019ve heard of their sizes, and you were interested in. Guess you were about that size right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went into a sitting position, looking at the new world. You really should of tried catching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... maybe you still can. Your Flygon, it\u2019s a fast Pokemon! Of course it should be able to catch up to Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile you found that your Pokeball shrunk with you, so you unlatch it from your belt and you begin to toss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlygon, come on out!\u201d You shout to your Pokemon. However, another problem rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon shrunk too!\u201d Flygon was a big Pokemon, but now it was nothing but an insect compared to everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlygon looked around for a couple of seconds, as it was confused and you felt bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlygon, I... return!\u201d You say panicking. How strong would your Pokemon be now. It\u2019s like they all have been reversed Dynamaxed. This is not good, and you imagine it will be the same with all your Pokemon!<br>\r\n\u2028Your Dusknoir, your Tyranitar, Your Nidoqueen. Every Pokemon of yours would be so weak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo chasing Mew it out of the option, as she has crippled your team. Might as well go over and try to get back to town. Will not be that hard, considering you didn\u2019t go out too far. Not wanting to paralyse your Pokemon, you want to keep them i your Pokeball until you have to bring them out. Looking ahead though, you could see a Flabebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was taller then you, and it didn\u2019t even notice you. That is a major problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the tall grass, walking over to the dirt path as it seemed to stretch on for years. How small can you really be! You were not happy about this, but there was nothing you could really do anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust walk down the path, until you see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\u201cSwirl!\u201d</span> A Pokemon said getting you to freeze. You turn your head, seeing a Swirlix near you, and even worse it was making it\u2019s way to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was such a little Pokemon, but the giant Kalos region Pokemon intimidated you more then it should. Not like you were gonna just let it come near. A bit concerned you brought out a Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-Electivire, go!\u201d You shout, sending your strongest electric type. As he landed onto the ground, he was shrunk and was looking at a giant ball of a Pokemon. Towering over him as he was intimidated. Electivire was never intimidated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn\u2019t help that the giant Swirlix had it\u2019s tongue out and was wagging it around a bit playfully. It is gonna try to eat your Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElectivire!\u201d You shout to him. \u201cIgnore the size difference, just use Thunder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened, sending a powerful lightning blast. One so powerful that normal size it could take down a Wailord in one hit, at this size though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck Swirlix, and it didn\u2019t care at all! This first evolution, which hasn\u2019t been trained is tanking Electivire\u2019s most powerful attack. This is not good. Your eyes wide open as you start to get concerned. The Swirlix moved forward, and you acted quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Return Electivire!\u201d You shout and return him to the Pokeball, just in time for the Pokemon to stomp it\u2019s foot down where your Pokemon would of been. Retreating your Pokemon as you look to the Pokemon with new fear. It was literally invincible, at least to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were big, you had company with Red and Cynthia, at this size though. You couldn\u2019t even beat a bug catcher! You had to run, running away from the Pokemon as you try to get away. You turned your head, seeing if you were gonna get any reaction from the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swirlix looked at you, and went along it\u2019s day. It wasn\u2019t even bothering with you, that\u2019s how insignificant you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you were taking it. Making your way across as you breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell are you gonna do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just kept walking down the street, just kept walking without much interest. You were small, and your Pokemon was useless. You just keep trying to talk to yourself, trying to convince that you were not truly useless. Maybe that Swirlix had an ability that helped it resist Electivire, or maybe it was a much higher level than you thought. Anything that can convince you that maybe it wasn\u2019t so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you walk around and try to get around, down the road. It was an empty road, with the lake on one side, and tall grass on the other. You would eventually see a Pokemon, but you made sure not to dwell on that and even increase your speed to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t want to get another encounter like that Swirlix. That Swirlix... it was so weak. Any other way, you would of beaten it but not hear. Worst thing is, you don\u2019t even know what a Human would look like, and how they would treat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so small, if they wanted they could kidnap you. Not like your Pokemon will be able to save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sad notion to think about. Eventually you walked down the road some more until _______________</span></div></div>",

You were so close to the city, you ignored what was happening behind you and just kept on walking. This turned out to be a major problem, cause something was behind you. At least it wasn\u2019t a Pokemon you suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk forward, the booms keep getting louder and louder until finally you saw a giant shoe slam to your side. You freaked out and jumped, falling to the side as you could not believe it. That shoe was matched with another one on the other side, stepping down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh...\u201d A voice said, as you turn your body. It was... a young schoolgirl! Brown skin, brown hair and a a giant body that scared you. You looked up to her, barely being able to look up at her. You even look under her skirt, even if you did not mean to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so big, and she was looking down. \u201cA little guy?\u201d She questioned as you nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes I am... little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhEaring your voice, she giggled finding it a bit funny. \u201cI\u2019m not little, you\u2019re little! Wait... have I seen you before.\u201d She said as turned her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever met her, so you were not going to answer. It would seem that she actually knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second, I do! I\u2019ve seen you on TV!\u201d She said happily. She moved her hand around and reached down for you. You back up but all she did was put her finger on your head. \u201cAlthough you were not so big, were you?\u201d She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was bigger! A Pokemon shrunk me.\u201d You say putting her finger off your head. She laughed and giggled about it, her eyes on you as you go walking away. She had her eye down onto you, when suddenly she smiled. Standing tall, she moved her foot around and blocked your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer giant shoe almost stomping you as you look up. She seemed so much more intimidating standing up like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wanna have a Pokemon battle!\u201d She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a trainer? Normally, you would wipe the floor with this kid, but you were not really sure you should do that. Not with your Pokemon in their weakened forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d You say to her about to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait a second.\u201d She said taking steps around and getting in front of you. She got in front making sure you were not going to be able to do anything as she was in front of you. You couldn\u2019t pass him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I wanna see how good I am against the best in the world!\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my Pokemon are pretty weak at the moment. Shrunken with me. We can do it later, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, scared?\u201d She said, a playful smile on her face as she looked down to you. She wore a smile as she brought her shoe forward and knocked you back. The School girl giving you quite the hit as you fell onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, face me.\u201d She said happily, kicking you around with her shoe. She did this a couple more times, toying with you and laughing above as you try to get away. She didn\u2019t let you though, as she toyed with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d You shout to her as she wore a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! This is gonna be fun!\u201d She taking a couple of steps back and getting away. You look to her for a couple of seconds, not really sure if you were gonna be okay with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, Fletchling!\u201d She said sending her Pokeball out. You saw a giant fire bird come down, towering over you like a Molstres as you look up to it. If this Pokemon wanted to, it could even swallow you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFletch?\u201d It said ready. It was a simple Pokemon, one that beginners would have. This is not good. If you lose to this thing, it\u2019s gonna be embarssing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElectivire! Come on out!\u201d You shout giving it out. Tossing it forward as it fell right down. Youe Electric type there, as it stared at the giant Bird, as well as the giant Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s Electivire! It looks so cute down there! I just wanna put it in a cage and make it run around there. Hehehe.\u201d She laughed as you swallowed your fear. Electivire thrown off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Whatever, let\u2019s go!\u201d you shout to her. You had the type advantage, a higher level. Maybe you can do this, against this intimidating, but weak bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school girl you were facing, wore a smile as she wanted some fun. \u201cHey, that idea before gives me an... idea. How about we make a bet!\u201d She said as you look at her, fear in your eyes. \u201cIf you win, I\u2019ll... I don\u2019t know carry you to that town you were walking to. If I win though, you gotta be my pet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What! No!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you are one of the best in the world, no way you can lose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d You shout, not getting goated into this one. She looked at you for a couple of seconds, until finally she just rolled her eyes about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, you are taking it anyway. Whether you like it or not!\u201d She said as she wore a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, ready for battle!\u201d She said getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to stick close to the battle, so you were in danger. Otherwise you won\u2019t be able to tell your Pokemon. You swallow your fear, as you look at her for a couple of seconds until you swallow your fear. \u201cElectivire! We got to win this! It\u2019s just a bird, a big one yes... but we can beat this Flying Type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElectivire!\u201d it said, hearing your words and getting excited about it. He was getting his courage back, and you suppose that was really good.</span></div></div>",

She wants you to go find her? Does she realise the problems that arrises with you. And today of all days. This was suppose to be your day of triumph. The day where you took your first step into greatness. Now, well now you were the size of a Joltik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grew up in Viridian City, and despite all your aspirations, you were constantly pushed away from the Trainer life and into the store owning life by your family. You didn\u2019t really want to, you wanted to explore! You wanted go around catching Pokemon, doing battles. You wanted to be a Pokemon Trainer. You were a teenager, so you were past the general age for starting trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil of course, then even it came along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first saw it on a flyer. The Pokemon Challenge of the ages. Pokemon Extravaganza! It was a nice idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Pokemon left over by breeding, all of them were being handed out to Rookies. Not only does this mean the Pokemon get homes, but they can easily provide Pokemon for all of them. T<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the regions in the world, coming together for an ultimate competition. Much like each region, it has Gym Leaders as you have to beat. Each of one type, as instead of badges you will get coloured ribbons. Once you have all the colours, prevent it to a Champion of any region, and you can challenge them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just the thing you needed. So you got excited as you ran over almost as soon as it happened. Waiting all month for the even to actually start. Today was the day, and looking at your clock... it was going to start in five minutes. Now you have shrunk, and you can\u2019t even do it. It would be far too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<i>1 Month Ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m not late am I!\u201d You shout, running up to the desk where it was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, of course not sir. In fact you are our first one of the day. Would you like to register for Extravengza?\u201d The woman behind the desk said. She questioned as you nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my name is (Your Name)\u201d You say to her as she smiled. Pulling out the paperwork as you eagerly signed, getting your breath back as you literally ran over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, do you have prior experience?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No. I thought this was for rookies?\u201d You question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it is however we do expect some expert trainers to try. Don\u2019t worry though, they will all follow the same rules as you. Although, i\u2019m a bit shocked. Aren\u2019t you a bit old to start now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, better then never.\u201d You say back to her as she couldn\u2019t agree more. Now that you have signed everything, she gave you what you needed. A Pokedex, five spare Pokeballs, canned food that will last, A ribbon box and a drink bottle. She then gave you a passport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you know, each region only has eight Gym leaders, so you will have to travel to get all. This passport will get you a free ride to any other region.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah. Awesome.\u201d You say with the biggest smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now you can pick your first Pokemon!\u201d She said happily. You followed her as she went into the room. Since you were the first one, it was giant. Over a thousand balls all laid out as you followed her. \u201cQuite the pick you get. Now you won\u2019t be able to bring your Pokemon out until the event starts, a lock is on it. To make sure no cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it.\u201d You say back to her as you walk around. So many Pokeballs. However in a few seconds you already picked. Grabbing the ball and pulling it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got your choice? That was quick. I suppose they all are the same to us. Each one has a different Pokemon in it. From any region as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething about this ball, I don\u2019t know I guess you could it called to me.\u201d You say to the Pokemon that was in your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good sign!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... I suppose it is.\u201d You say flashing her a smile.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow holding the shrunken Pokeball in you, you start thinking about what to do. You could go back home, get yelled at by your parents and chances are never be able to leave again. Or... you can have your dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure you were small, but it was not like you were in a vegetable state. You can still do this, you can still win! Shrunken to a small state or not, you will not be stopped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, you got to find Mew. You two are still in a game after all, and you play to win. Moving around and looking inside of your bag. Everything was still there. You don\u2019t really have a problem. Well except for your ribbon case, gonna have to get a normal size replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the timer counted down on your Pokenav, you got excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only are you going to find out who your Pokemon was and who you will journey with, you will also hopefully see them normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about your plan. Now, you should train your Pokemon first, make them strong for the first gym badge. You might have to journey depending on the Type Advantage, but you can do that. Of course, since they all came from abandoned eggs at Daycare, they were gonna be a baby Pokemon. Not to mention very weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA normal trainer would be able to carry their Pokemon back to the centre in case, but you can\u2019t. Not to mention you can\u2019t use your points. Normally recover 20hp. however it shrunk down with you, so it would be 2hp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Beep Beep*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the beeping started, so did the event. Now was the moment. Tossing your Pokeball, your first Pokemon came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it was normal size as it was a giant _____________</span></div></div>",

Morphing around the light as the Pokeball came back to you. You catch it and look up, eager to see who you your partner was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brown body came out. Standing on two feet, with two arms. Claws on the tip of every limb. The body was large, a couple of feet so you were around doll size to it. Only a couple of inches to regular humans. Finally you looked up to the top. Seeing large round ears, and probably the most adorable face you have ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared at it for a long time, admiring your Pokemon. While on the other end, your Pokemon moved it's hands around. Stretching it's arms out giving out an adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddiursa!\"</span> It said with a smile. Seems like really liked being out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your Pokemon was a Teddiursa<br>\r\nA normal type, found in Johto and evolves into Ursaring. Also seems to be a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your shrunken Pokedex you look her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddiursa, the Little Bear Pokemon.\" And at this you had to chuckle. \"This Pokemon likes to lick it's palms that are sweetened by being soaked in honey. Teddiursa concocts it's own honey by blending fruits and pollen.\" You got to admit, that sounded even more adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddiursa?\"</span> It questioned. Tilting it's large head from side to side as you at the Pokemon. Was it looking for the trainer that brought her out. Well now was the moment of truth. You've already accepted the Normal type as your Pokemon, but was she going to accept you as her trainer. You were small, tiny and let's face it the weakest trainer in the world. They want a strong trainer and you are not one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... Better go for it. \"D-Down here!\" You shout to the giant searching bear. She heard, her ears twitching as the giant Pokemon heard. She tilted her large head down. Looking down at you as those big eyes look over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight between her legs a small human stood. The young Pokemon surely did not expect this. \"H-Hello!\" You shout to it. \"I guess I uh... I'm your Pokemon Trainer Teddiursa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout this as you have to wait for the reaction. The Pokemon looked down, almost like she was thinking about it. Until finally something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear smiled, a huge and giant smile! Her eyes shining as she seemed to like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddi!\"</span> She cheered. Reaching her arms down to you. You of course was startled but let do it. She reached down and picked you up. Her claws not actually sharp when handling you. She brought you up and right to her stomach. Before you could even question what was happening, you got hugged into her plus stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging you as tight as she can as she loved it. She was loving this. You turn your gaze up to her, to see her happily look down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the biggest bear hug you have ever gotten. So safe to say she was really glad with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Are you okay with having me as your Trainer? You question the normal type. It rose you up to it's face. Holding you with two arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><span class=\"corange\">\"Ursa!\"</span></span> She chimed happily, as she then brought you back to her chest. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddi! Teddiursa!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. I'll take that as a Yes.\" You say. You are so glad that Teddiursa likes you. Now you can start your journey. As a Normal type, there was not many weaknesses she had besides fighting. She had a stalemate with ghost types, and rock types resisted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is a real problem considering the Kanto first gym leader was rock. Maybe skip Brock and go for Misty? Or maybe go to another region, you always wanted to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, now that you had Teddiursa the sky was the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddiursa?</span> She spoke. Funnily enough you forgot the bear was holding you. Just kind of accepted it. She looked down to you with a curious yet adorable look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you wondering how I got like this?\" You say as she nods. \"Well I met Mew and she did this.\" To this she just looked more confused. \"Right... Newborn Pokemon. Well there was this powerful and playful Pokemon who shrunk me down to this size. I can get big, if I find it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this, she gave out a little adorable giggle. \"Anyway enough about that. Let's start this adventure! Let's see what moves you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the Pokedex it informed you. \"You know Scratch and Fake Tears. Not bad not bad. As well level up you should be able to know more. So uh... You wanna put me somewhere else Teddiursa. I can walk on own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you said that and you could, the answer was an extreme no. In fact it was the opposite as Teddiursa hugged you even more into her chest. Her warm fur behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddiursa.\" </span>She pouted down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess you can hug me here. But if we run into a battle you gotta put me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddi!\u201d She cheered agreeing to the deal. At least your Pokemon really like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow thinking about your future, you should probably train Teddiursa up. She\u2019s not that high level, and facing wild Pokemon was a good start. Then again, you could catch another Pokemon. A Nidoran in the nearby route could be good. Getting a Nidoking or a Nidoqueen is something you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, you could spend your time with teddiursa, bonding with her. Plus, well you have recently shrunken down, maybe it would be best to not just jump in there at full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile on your face as you decide what you are going to do. Teddiursa was awaiting patiently. She didn\u2019t care which option you went with, she just wanted to spend her time with you. She found you so adorable, and she can\u2019t think of another trainer she would want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Teddiursa... let\u2019s ___________\u201d</span></div></div>",

Both of you very happy as she walked around. You knew where you were, since you lived here so you just told the bear where to go. She seemed very happy about holding you, and that was something you were a real fan of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not going to be easy, but catching a second Pokemon is key. That way, at least they can train together when not facing other trainers or wild Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not going to lie though, you were a bit concerned. As soon as you saw a trainer in the distance, you asked Teddiursa to avoid them. You were just concerned, even though you know for a fact that you would have to deal with giants eventually. Just gonna try to delay it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you two got to the route. The route to the Victory Road of Kanto. Excited, you tell her to go into the grass. Both of you moving in, as you wore a smile as you look over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s catch you a friend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><span class=\"corange\">\u201cTeddi!\u201d</span></span> She chimed back excitedly, pretty much running. Still holding you of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s see, Rattata, Pidgey, Nidoran and Mankey. I think those are all the Pokemon here. I just hope we catch one without much trouble.\u201d You say to her as she just walks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen suddenly, you heard something moving around the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Pokemon Teddiursa, quick we don\u2019t want to to startle it a-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just came out. You thought it would be more concerned considering a trainer was near but... it hasn\u2019t seen you. Useful, but a bit heartbreaking. It must assume that Teddiursa was just a wild Pokemon like itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Pokemon? It was a Nidoran Female! This was one of the Pokemon you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Teddiursa, put me down and...\u201d You pause, when you realise that she will not really be able to hear you from a distance, and in the midst of battle. \u201cOkay how about... in your ear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou questioned about it, as she wore a smile. She knew what she wanted to do, as she swung you around. It was so fast, and you felt yourself tucked in. You could see barely anything, but still at least you could see the battle and Teddiursa could hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady... get as close as you can, and then send out a Scratch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept walking, getting closer until finally she acted. Nidoran didn\u2019t expect anything, as she swung her hand around and slashed the Pokemon. Nidoran fell over from the hit. It was a critical! However it was still going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoran stood up, and rammed into Teddiursa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDodge it!\u201d You say to your Pokemon, however she took the hit. Being sent back by a Tackle and being hit hard. She fell onto her back, feeling hurt.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><span class=\"corange\"><br>\r\n\u201cTeddi!\u201d </span></span>She whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, i\u2019ll try to be better next time. Get up, cause she is coming!\u201d Nidoran was, running her way. As fast as she can, but thankfully Teddiursa dodged out of the way as she leaped. You still in the ear and trying to look at what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Fake Tears isn\u2019t going to work, so what I want you to do is sidestep the next Tackle. Can you do it Teddiursa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I can!\u201d She shouted back, as Teddiursa moved forward. Getting ready and waiting for Nidoran, it happened at the perfect time. Dodging to the side and giving it a Scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it Teddiursa You are a natural!\u201d you shouted with a big smile on your face. Very happy about what you were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Nidoran got up once again, and lowered it\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone who have seen this before. \u201cTeddiursa! She\u2019s sending out a Poison Sting! Make sure to move to the side!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you said this, she moved to the side. Walking to the side as she breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fast, but easy to dodge. Watch out more are coming!\u201d You shout to Teddiursa as she listened. She really seemed to perfected the sidestep, as that was all she was doing. Dodging to the side again and again but she wasn\u2019t getting closer and Nidoran wasn\u2019t stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got to move forward, instead of stepping to the side, step forward as well!\u201d She said with a smile, as that started to happen. Slowly but surely, the distance between was becoming smaller and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally she acted. A smile on her face as you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScratch!\u201d At the top of your lungs. It was a powerful hit as Teddiursa attacked. Nidoran was left with a powerful hit, falling the side and unable to move even if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wore a smile yourself, very happy about how it ended. The Nidoran\u2019s eyes were X\u2019d out, so it was over at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing, now it\u2019s my turn. Bring me out please!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened as Teddiursa pulled you out. She was a bit hurt, but she also level up due to the intense battle. This was making you happy about it. Teddiursa levelled up, and you were going to get a second Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the Pokeball, you tossed it as far as you can. Going far until it hit the Nidoran. The giant Pokemon retracted into the small ball as it came back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wore a smile on your face, happy about it as you look at the ball in your hand. This has got to work, you have got to get another Pokemon. The strength of the trainer doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s the strength of the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down as the Pokeball shook a bit. It usually takes three shakes for it to catch a Pokemon. That was the first one, and the second one just came out as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, one more and you\u2019ve officially caught your first Pokemon! You could start preparing, you just need it to be confirmed!</span></div></div>",

It was more than good if anything, as you just caught your second Pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we got a companion Teddiursa! We just got one!\u201d She smiled and cheered about this as well, swinging you around and bringing you over to her chest. She pinned you against it, making sure you were getting a huge barehug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich if you were going to be honest, you think it\u2019s the only way she can do it. She was so happy about it, and wore a smile. Eventually you got pulled out of the hug and placed onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t help but be eager about this, as you moved your hands around. Looking at the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to meet her? She is going to be nicer this time.\u201d You say as she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddiursa!\u201d</span> She cheered, as it finally started. You moved your hand around and tossed out the Pokeball. It went flying out and you see the giant Poison type in front of you. She was massive and towering if you were going to be honest. You try to stand tall as you look up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cI\u2019ve... been caught.\u201d</span> She said with a sigh, looking to the bear. \u201cAnd by you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYep! Welcome to the team! I\u2019m Teddiursa, and this is my trainer!\u201d</span> Your bear cheered as you were letting them talk. Nidoran was confused though, looking around she saw no trainer? <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cNo, down there silly!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoran looked down, and to say she was disappointed was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, i\u2019m your trainer!\u201d you say up to her with a smile. \u201cI know i\u2019m not very... big, but don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m gonna try as hard as I can!\u201d You say as you can tell she was not that happy about it. She just looked down, her expression not changing much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t changing, until finally she rose her paw. You saw it hover over you as it was the thing you could expect the least. It came right down onto you, pushing you onto your back as she pinned you under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Woah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cNot cool, let our cute little trainer go!\u201d </span>Teddiursa whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cHe\u2019s not much of a trainer, he\u2019s nothing but a little toy!\u201d</span> She said as she could not care less about it. If anything, she was a bit disappointed about the fact that she would have to listen and obey you from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cNot true he\u2019s a great trainer, let him go!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cFine...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoran took her paw off of you, as you breathed a sigh of relief. Whatever Teddiursa said was appreciated. You look around for a couple of seconds, until your eyes went over to Nidoran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I know, you are disappointed like I said, but don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m gonna make you one of the strongest Pokemon! Make you happy, don\u2019t worry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say this up to her happily, as she didn\u2019t really pay much attention. Now you personally were at a problem. Do you recall these Pokemon back into their balls? Or what else can you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... I think i\u2019m gonna keep you out, if you don\u2019t want to travel you can go in your ball if you want Nidoran?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><span class=\"corange\"><br>\r\n\u201cTeddi!\u201d </span></span>Your first Pokemon cheered, as she swung you around. She swung you around into a massive hug, holding you as tight as she can. She can\u2019t help but enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nidoran, if she was going to be honest knew that it was really nice. Not forcing her into a ball, sure... that brief moment she was in there didn\u2019t seem so bad, but she would rather be out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay... so now that I got a team, we can train! Since you probably know these Pokemon Nidoran, we can go to a different route. Move around town and all.\u201d You say with a smile as she listened. The group of you start moving, moving forward as all three of you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip over to Viridian Forest was a bit boring, but you were getting hugged to Teddiursa. Thankfully less trainers around, as you entered the forest. It was a lot more dense than the routes surrounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew this place pretty good. You remember running over here when you were a kid, playing and messing around playfully. It had Beedrills, but that was not really a problem if you didn\u2019t start a fight with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you knew this place at the moment. Looking around for a couple of seconds at the entranced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow from trainers i\u2019ve heard passing. Preying on Metapods and Kakunas is a good way to get easy couple levels with starting Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you three move over, and you got to admit, not as much bug Pokemon as you remember. Suppose since there was so much trainers these days with the whole Extravaganza, there was little of Pokemon in the wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait and relax, rolling into the fur of your Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cHow are you happy about this?\u201d</span> Nidoran questioned. <span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cI mean, he\u2019s not fit for a trainer.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cNo, but he\u2019s cute.\u201d </span>Teddiursa with a big smile. Both of them relaxing about it. Nidoran of course was a bit angry about being caught, but it could of been much worse. At least you seemed like a sort of nice trainer. If not a bit small. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cHe wants to beat Pokemon with us. Get us stronger and face other trainers. Don\u2019t you know anything about humans.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cN-Not really?\u201d</span> Teddiursa said back. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI was born from an egg not to long ago. Then I was in the ball for a while, and finally out with him. He said he was going to be my trainer, and I was glad.\u201d<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cOh, so you\u2019ve never been a wild Pokemon?\u201d</span> Nidoran questioned, the two Pokemon having a good conversation. Until you chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! I see something, let\u2019s start!\u201d you say to them as Nidoran and Teddiursa looked as well, seeing ________</span></div></div>",

He also had lavender hair, as you knew who this boy was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have looked it up for a while, all the Gym Leaders. You could spot most of them instantly, and this giant boy was no different. A giant human, that\u2019s something you haven\u2019t dealt with yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus he\u2019s a gym leader, it\u2019s not like you could beat him at the moment. You were not going to lie though, you were really excited to do this. Wearing a smile on your face as tell Teddiursa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, take me over to him! Can you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddi!\u201d</span> Your Pokemon nodded as they went open. You were not really sure what he was doing, but he was feeling up a tree in the forest looking over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did this for a long while, until he looked around, noticing two Pokemon walking his way.  The bug catcher talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Teddiursa? Nidoran makes sense but Teddiursa is only in Johto?\u201d He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there!\u201d You shout as he listened. He looked down at the chest, seeing a little boy waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Woah! look at you, you are as big as a Joltik!\u201d He laughed with a smile. Bugsy got onto a knee, bringing his face close to you as you froze. He was so big, and if anything a bit intimidating. Still he was a Gym Leader, he was a good guy. \u201cMy name is Bugsy. I\u2019m guessing these are your Pokemon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, my name is (Your Name). I became a trainer due to the Extravengenza! Came here to train on some Metapod and Kakuna.\u201d You say back to him, as he wore a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, trainers tend to do that. But... really? A trainer at that size, isn\u2019t there more proper things to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I wanna do this.\u201d You say back to him, as the boy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well I can\u2019t stop that. Here, can I hold you?\u201d He questioned. You were a bit thrown off, and Teddiursa hugged you even closer. Getting the giant boy to laugh. \u201cHehe, guess not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Teddiursa is a bit protective. Anyway, let\u2019s have a Pokemon battle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was his turn to be thrown off about it. He can\u2019t believe you wanted a battle. \u201cUh... that might not be good, a Pokemon battle this early. Maybe you should train your Pokemon first, okay little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe talked down to you, even though you think you are older than this boy. Still you didn\u2019t speak up about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I guess, it\u2019s just, seeing a bug gym leader here. This is my chance isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there are only a couple of bug trainers, compared to let\u2019s say Water or rock type gym leaders. Still be careful okay.\u201d Bugsy said with a smile. \u201cPlus, since we have no need to stay in our Gym, it\u2019s gonna cause more trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh yeah, I didn\u2019t think about it really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came here cause i\u2019ve always wanted to visit it. Like Ilex Forest back home, it\u2019s famous for all the bugs. Look here, at this tree.\u201d He said pushing it over. You listen to his words, moving over and getting closer at the moment. \u201cA Kakuna has been there. Isn\u2019t it pretty awesome, you can see it right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I can Bugsy? Can you Teddiursa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUr-Sa?\u201d</span> It shook it\u2019s head as that became clear. She wore a smile on her face, seeing the both of you agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose not everyone can, i\u2019ve been studying bug Pokemon all my life. I just love them, they are all so fun, and crawly, and small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused as he shifted his gaze over to you, and had to chuckle. \u201cWell, small to me. Not so much to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right. This is my first of day of being shrunk. Guess I should get use to this more.\u201d you say to him with a chuckle. \u201cAnyway, let\u2019s have a battle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill? Little guy you are not going to win, and you will be stranded in this forest by yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we can make it a One on One Pokemon battle than! I will still have one over if I lose. I want to win though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBugsy looked down to you, and... well it was pretty clear you were a determined trainer. \u201cFine, one battle. But none after that.\u201d He said. He got off his knee and started moving, walking away and creating some space for the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well if you want it you got it. Heracross, come out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed it onto the battlefield, and as the ball retracted, a giant bug came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, Heracross i\u2019ve never seen one before!\u201d you shout to him as Heracross smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHera, Heracross!\u201d</span> He said ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down Heracross, this is going to be an easy win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you think, Teddiursa do you w-\u201d you didn\u2019t finish, as Teddiursa moved you around and placed you onto the back of Nidoran. Nidoran didn\u2019t mind as she let you sit there. \u201cI suppose it would be too dangerous to be in your ear, well... I\u2019ll try.\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><br>\r\n\u201cTeddi!\u201d</span> She said squaring off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good you got a Pokemon like that. Teddiursa seems to like you, as well as be ready to follow you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cNido!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Best Normal type... of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay ready Teddiursa! Scratch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMegahorn!\u201d Bugsy yelled, as the two Pokemon clashed. And since one was a gym leader\u2019s Pokemon, and one was barely level 3, it became clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddi!\u201d She yelled, being sent back by one hit and having dazed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the battle is decided. Sorry little guy, I win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right.\u201d You say back to him. \u201cReturn Teddiursa.\u201d You called your Pokemon back and looked at it. \u201cSorry, I promise we will get stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry little guy,\u201d Bugsy said coming over to you. He walked over and towered over you, reaching for you. This time though, Teddiursa wasn\u2019t stopping him. \u201cBut ____________\u201d</span></div></div>",

This was the first time you\u2019ve been grabbed by something other than Teddiursa. Kicking your feet, you feel that you give the proper response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!

Bugsy I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry but not discussing this with you little guy. He said as he pulled out a bug jar out of his bag. He moved it around and pulled the lid. He brought you over and dangled you. Noticing something as he had to comment. \u201cNo matter how much you kick little guy, it isn\u2019t going to help. Down you go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his fingers, and you felt yourself go free. You hit the bottom, as you see him screw up on top. He has officially trapped you. You feel the jar get lifted up as you see his giant body go past you. Until finally you were brought to his smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I got to admit, this is a pretty funny sight. I normally have small bugs in here, but now a small boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe toyed with you, as he moved his finger and brought it ahead of his smile. He brought it and tapped on the glass, as it caused you take a step back. Suddenly, it started to move around. He turned it around causing him to look over your entire body. Eyeing you up, as you struggled to stay on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Bugsy!\u201d You shout to him, as he chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but it\u2019s just a funny sight. Now, time to put you on my belt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy moved you around, and brought you to his waist. He brought you to his high shorts and pushed you against it, making sure the jar was stuck and not going to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, this is humiliating.\u201d You said to yourself. Looking up, at least there was halls. Still it was not like you could really do anything to get out of there. You were forced to accept what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, are you gonna carry me back to Viridian City?\u201d you question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be kind, I\u2019ll take you to Pewter City, there you could try Brock. However, not now. At the moment, i\u2019m gonna look at these markings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, you were going to get bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still in the jar that was at his side, as he walked out of the forest. \u201cMan, finally out! I see Pewter City ahead of me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, can you take me to the Pokecenter than Bugsy, to heal my Pokemon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it, and... actually.\u201d Bugsy said thinking about it for a couple of seconds. He walked close as he pulled the jar to his face. Smiling at you, as the boy really did like this sight. \u201cActually, I might not be able to. If I go out there, i\u2019m just gonna get swarmed by a bunch of new trainers. Gonna be a real hassle. Do you think I could just drop you here and you can make the distance?\u201d he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it as you nodded. Bugsy got onto his knees and opened it up. He reached for you, as you got plucked from the jar. His fingers on you as you get set free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your prison, you were glad he pulled it away and into his bag. It was getting dark, so you were gonna have to go in. As you stretched though, you found a finger tap you on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen here, you gotta be careful. You are in danger at that size. Just get to the Pokecenter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it!\u201d You say back to him with a smile. The boy stood up to his frightening height as he got moving. Walking back into the forest. \u201cGood luck!\u201d He said, his giant shoe stepping pass you. \u201cHope to see you again, and who knows you might win then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah see ya!\u201d You shout to him, waving as much as you can as he leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to walk by yourself. Mostly out of need, but a bit out of fear. You do feel like a worthless trainer. Not only did you fail teddiursa and let her get defeated in out hit, Nidoran watched you fail and get humiliated as Bugsy manhandled you. It was not something you were happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you made the journey yourself, which was long. So you got there around midnight. This wasn\u2019t the first time you were in the city, as you have been here when you were younger. So thankfully you knew where everything was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got to the Pokecenter though, it was empty inside every trainer was probably sleeping. However that rose another problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving around, you found that you... well you didn\u2019t weight enough to get the censor to open the door. You were stuck outside.</span></div></div>",

You wear a smile as you move over and start banging on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m on the outside! Anyone in there, and do you think you can help me in! Anyone! Anyone!\u201d You shout at the top of your lungs, wanting a reaction, any reaction if you were going to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you got one. As your yelling and small punching of the door got a woman to get interested. Her ears picking up as you see her walk her way over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know her! Well you didn\u2019t know her specifically, but... well she was Nurse Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went onto the other side as you see the doors open to feeling her pressure. Sliding open as she peeked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Is someone there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Down here!\u201d You shout to the giant woman, as she did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d She said jumping backwards a bit. \u201cA-A tiny boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA tiny trainer actually Nurse! I was wondering if you could help me out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy now has you on her counter. Talking to you as you explained your whole situation. Being tiny clearly was not something she was use to seeing in her guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, and even though Mew shrunk you, you still are trying to be the greatest Trainer. That\u2019s admirable if anything.\u201d She said with a smile. \u201cNow you want me to try to heal your Pokemon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... if you can that is Nurse. I mean... they are small.\u201d You say showing her your Pokeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear... this might be trouble. Too small to fit in the machine. Are your two Pokemon small like you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, actually they are normal size.\u201d You say back to her as she wore a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, i\u2019ll try my best. Do you want to stay in one of ours rooms?\u201d She questioned to you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Actually, Nurse Joy I don\u2019t think I could go to sleep if I wanted. It\u2019s just... well when I faced Bugsy, I failed my Pokemon. Teddiursa got down in one hit, and I can\u2019t help but feel it was my fault for putting her in that situation. And then Bugsy grabbed me and put me in a jar for my own protection, so I feel humiliated. I can\u2019t even imagine what Nidoran was thinking when she saw that. Why would anyone want someone like me as a trainer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy looked down, as she couldn\u2019t help but giggle. Something that confused you for a couple of seconds. \u201cSorry, you might not believe it. But this is pretty common.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Common?\u201d You question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the whole size situation, but new trainers, doubting themselves. It\u2019s something I personally deal with a lot.\u201d The pink haired woman said down to you. \u201cTrainers lose, even the very best in the world lose. Don\u2019t let that worry you though, move forward. Are you disappointed cause you felt like you were a bad trainer, well make sure to act better. Be a better trainer, one that your Pokemon will happily lead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow... hehe, it\u2019s almost like you rehearsed that or something.\u201d You joke as she couldn\u2019t help but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ll heal these Pokemon, and put you to sleep. I will see you in the morning, and I can set you off.\u201d Nurse Joy said. She moved her hand around and brought it under you. You got swept up as you were left sitting, your legs dangling over her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got moving and went over to the corridor of the Pokecenter. A lot of the were occupied, but thankfully there was one for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about this, it\u2019s our last room. So many trainers during this time trying to start. I imagine it will slow down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door, and you saw a nice little room for you. Well giant to you, absolutely massive. Nurse Joy walked over to the middle, leaned her body over and let you drop down. You got dropped down onto the pillow as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, i\u2019ll tuck you in.\u201d Nurse Joy said as you were a bit caught off by that. Still... going to let it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure you were comfy, and brought the blanket over you and holding you there. She was not going to lie, she was tempted to kiss you on the forehead, which by extension is your entire head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night, hopefully you can sleep well. Don\u2019t worry about your Pokemon. If I can\u2019t find a way to use the machine, I will just use a revive and potions for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thanks, that\u2019s very generous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe plan to take care of any trainer or any Pokemon. Now before we go to sleeper, can I take a picture with you... with my Pokenav.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A picture, s-sure?\u201d You say to her confused. She smiled as she moved around. She brought it out and went into the camera. She turned it around so her face was in the way as she wore a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay cheese please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheese!\u201d you shout of course, as she took the photo. She turned it around, and loved how it turned out. \u201cOh that is great! We are going to put it on the family messages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you travel to other towns, you might meet my sisters. Want to tell them about you. Now good night!\u201d Nurse Joy stood up tall, and turned the light off. It went dark was you were left waiting, until finally you went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is just like Nurse Joy said. You might of failed today, but tomorrow you can only learn from it. Become a better trainer, for your Pokemon. As you lay in the giant bed, you eventually go to sleep. Drowning out your worries as you plan to make the best out of the situation. You got two loving Pokemon at the moment, that was what you wanted after all.</span></div></div>",

What a sleep that was. These Pokecenter beds are really good. Especially for your size. Now was day two of your Pokemon journey. Hopefully this day turns out better than day one. Train your Pokemon, that's what you need to do. As you get up you look at the platform that was the bed. Maybe next time, you can get your Pokemon to sleep with you. Plenty of space, and you imagine a bed is better than a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Chance! </span>A voice said getting you to panic. You look to the side, seeing the large Pokemon next to you. It was a Chansey. It was smiling down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery Nurse Joy had a Chansey, and this must be hers. \"Uh... Hi there.\" You say waving at the Pokemon awkwardly. \"Did Nurse Joy send you to pick me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Chansey!\" </span>It nodded as you guess that was good. <span class=\"cpred\">\"Chance?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna take me now. Sure.\" You say shrugging your shoulders. The large Egg Pokemon reached for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's small stubs of arms grab you and bring you around. Right into her pouch. She moved her egg clearly to make way for you and that was appreciated. You pop your head out of the nice pocket you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Chansey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Chansey!\"</span> It said happily back as it walked out of the room. The Chansey moved through the halls. You could see giant boys and girls. Other trainers, clearly getting ready for their day as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChansey went behind and called Nurse Joy. Who instantly skipped her way over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" She said happily down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" You say back to her. \"Thank you for the transport Nurse Joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was my pleasure!\" She said as Nurse Joy moved her hand over to you. You feel her fingers around you as you get lifted up. She sat you in her hand as Nurse Joy moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of the Pokecenter to the street. You waiting patiently for her as she went around the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but don't want you getting stepped on in there.\" She said in a caring way. She put you back down onto the ground. \"Now here are your Pokemon. Fully refreshed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put them onto your belt and smiled up to her. \"Thank you Nurse Joy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now some advice. Brock isn't here at the gym. So you can't face him. So good luck.\" Nurse Joy said as she then reached into her dress. \"Also take this. It should be your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Nurse Joy?\" You say to her as you grab the tiny device. Nano to her but to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little microphone! A trainer left it here long ago, and I knew that it would help you. Now you don't have to strain that little voice of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for everything Nurse Joy.\" You say up to her as she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was actually my pleasure little guy! Don't tell any of the other trainers, but I'm actually rooting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You are?\" You say with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just lover underdog stories! Good luck out there!\" Nurse Joy stood up to her large and towering height. Leaving you alone as you were by yourself. Not for long though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Teddiursa!\" You shout as you throw your little Pokeball, and out comes your bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instantly located you and hugged you. Her favourite pass time or so it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe okay Teddiursa. We are going back into the Viridian Forest, and we are gonna make sure you never lose again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><span class=\"corange\">\"Teddi!\"</span></span> She cheered as you smiled. Even after the loss yesterday, it was not enough to throw her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully. The large steps of Teddiursa moved faster than your little ones. So the two of you got back into the forest quick. In there Teddiursa thankfully put you back down as you talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell through the new microphone that was given to you. It was something else, it was almost perfectly your size! Sure you had to hold it with two hands like an ice cream cone but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Hello! How can you hear me?\" You say hearing your voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddi\" </span>She replied happily as she made some distance. Wanting you to try again from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear Teddiursa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddi\"</span> She said happily in a reply. Coming closer as you smile, this will make it go a lot smoother almost like you were a normal trainer. You were gonna reply back to when suddenly she moved down onto her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved down with a smile as you smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now that it works I won\u2019t be hanging on your ear or anything like that. Now what to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cKakuna!\u201d </span>A voice said as you both look over the way. Seeing the giant bug Pokemon hanging on a tree. Just like Bugsy has been studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... all they can do it Harden. Go get him Teddiursa! Scratch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, your Pokemon went over there. She was able to hear you from so far away, as you couldn\u2019t help but love it. She scratched it for a real long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the hardens made it happen for a long while, but eventually Teddiursa swiped it down. You can just tell your Pokemon was getting EXP as she was coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddiursa!\u201d</span> She said happily, even flexing her muscles in the most adorable manner. Although if you tried, you probably could beat it on the adorable factor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, we are going to be doing that all day. Hope you are ready for a long time of training and levelling up. Now the real question is... bring Nidorina out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were embarrassed at the events yesterday, and you were a bit afraid of confronting her. Your Pokemon has GOT to be thinking less of you at the moment. She can\u2019t be excited to have such a weak trainer, and well you are scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You toss the Pokeball and your Nidoran came out. Shaking around as you wear a smile. She didn't seem to care less when seeing you, but she was out of the Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Listen Nidoran, I'm sorry.\" You say to your Pokemon. \"Not only because I challenged Bugsy. But... b-because I'm so weak!\" You shout your outburst catching your Pokemon by surprise. \"I know you don't like me being small, I-I know you don't even like being with me. But I promise I will be the beat trainer I can be. I WILL make us unstoppable and... E-Even a champion! I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoran looked down at you for a long while, until she finally had to smile. Your Pokemon walked over to you and placed it's paw on your head, rubbing it around. She was... Smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"I know your weak. If you were in a battle against a human, you would no doubt lose. However... That's why you need me little Trainer. To be strong for you. I promise to be strong.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't understand what Nidoran said, but you felt the words. You just have to, as you run over to her leg and hug it. As tight as you could which in fairness isn't that tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise we will be strong.\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\"><br>\r\n\"Nidoran...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddiursa!\" </span>Your other Pokemon chimed in. Grabbing you and both Nidoran into a hug. Nidoran of course tried to get out but... You know what they say about a bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were being hugged against the large stomach of both your Pokemon and you could not be more happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Girls! Let's train you two up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe training day wasn't bad. In fact you would say it was a great bonding experience for you three. The girls took turn facing both Kakunas and Metapods. They were gaining so my EXP and you were loving it. You three walked around the forest. Sometimes being hugged by Teddiursa, sometimes on the back of Nidoran. Either way you were loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't only go against harden Pokemon. Weedle, Catapie once a Pikachu. The girls were getting stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is also evident in their moves, as Nidoran learned Double Kick while Teddiursa learned Fury Swipes. More moves is always good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Nidoran was kicking a Metapod into a tree, as the battle concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome Nidoran! You are so awesome and so much stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Nidoran!\"</span> She said confidently and walked over back to you. Your giant Poison type smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now it's Teddiursa's...\" You trailed off, realising your Pokemon wasn't there. \"Where did she go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Nidoran?\"</span> She said just as confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddi!\"</span> A voice above said as you both look up. Your Pokemon was in a tree, on a branch and grabbing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddiursa! You use the Microphone. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, as she dropped down. Onto the ground as she ran around. Once she got what looked like a wooden piece of bark. She put it down with Pollen and berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... You like to make your own honey. Can we have some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddi!\" </span>She said as you were a bit excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got it all ready, she brought the bark over to you covered in Honey. She seemed to like feeding you two. Moving around you take a handful of the gooey substance and take a bite. Beside you Nidoran was doing the exact same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this tastes good! You has to comment as Nidoran was thinking the exact same. Teddiursa of course dug in as well as the three of you ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were fully after a couple of bites, Nidoran more of course. Teddiursa ate the rest. Guess she really did love it. After the three of you ate. You had to be the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... We need water. Maybe we should head back?\" To your surprise a bit neither of your Pokemon were a fan of this. \"Come on you two, not much we can do if we are thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Nidoran.\".</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><br>\r\n\"Teddiursa!\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think your Pokemon are arguing with you. You know Viridian Forest doesn't have a river or stream, so this was the only option there was. Then again... Not much reason to go back to Pewter City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gym Leader isn't in. So where will your next stop be. You could go to the water gym leader Misty. That will require you to go through Mt. Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go to electric type gym leader Sarge. You heard bad things about Diglett Cave though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Nidoran.\"</span> Your Pokemon said getting your attention. Just in time for her to bring her leg and push into your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah okay... What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou question this, as you suddenly felt yourself tossed up. Tossed up into the air, high above into the air and onto your back. Landing on her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Nidoran.\"</span> She said smugly as you guess you should of expected this. You might be their trainer and technically their superior. You should of expected to treat you with less authority. Not that you minded at the end of the day. Still it would be nice for your plan not to get dismissed by the two bigger and more powerful Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Teddiursa!\"</span> She yelled happily as you look her way on the back. She already has filled up another bark branch with berries and pollen. Ready to go back for seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, are you that hungry.\" You chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that was a fun day! He's a good little cute Trainer!\" Teddiursa said, her mouth stuffed with honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will admit... He's not entirely useless, he knows what he's doing. Still, we got to take care of him.\" Nidoran replied back, her eye looking at the trainer who was riding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, we are a team. And teams work together!\"</span></div></div>",

Eyes open as you heard the sound of a girl. It was around a couple of trees, out of sight. Although you could defiantly here a battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogically you would assume this was a Trainer, with her own Pokemon. You were thinking, deep in thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Ursa?\"</span> Teddiursa questioned as you look over her. Looking over to her as you see they were both paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I mean we have to be better at battles. She is starting as well, so this might be a good chance to train as well.\" You say to them. \"You girls up for it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, all they did was send you a smile as you knew their answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you three moved your way over, and you saw this trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was young, a girl you would say. She was wearing sneakers, a blue skirt, a white shirt and a Pokeball necklace around her torso. 12... Maybe 14. She had long curly slightly auburn hair. Looking her way, you know that she was going to big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a Cubchoo! An Ice Pokemon with a constant blue snotty nose. That's what makes it kind of cute honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Cubchoo! She said to her Pokemon happily. Crouching down and hugging it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer, she got eager spotting the Pokemon. However stopped when she spotted you on Nidoran's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" You say to her with a smile. She took a second to really believe what she was seeing. \"Seems like we had the same idea of training out here huh?\" You start to move around. Getting off of Nidoran and standing in front of her. She was massive, of course as you didn't even come past her sneakers. She just looked down at you between her legs, as she just had to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you saying your a trainer little guy. Find that a bit hard to believe.\" She said as she then moved down. Getting onto her knees in front of you. That smile not leaving. She moved her finger around and gently pushed you back. Your Pokemon was talking to her Cubchoo so you were on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am. Despite my size...\u201d You say to her. \u201cI mean... i\u2019m small but my Pokemon are strong and normal size.\u201d You gesture to your Pokemon, who are having their own conversation from the Unova born Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you even give them commands?\u201d She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith uh... this microphone.\u201d You say raising it so she can see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, okay you are the most adorable thing in the world.\u201d She joked, bringing her finger and tapping you in the chest once again. Knocking you back onto your rear. Getting the casual girl to laugh once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you not,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Katie.\u201d She said with a smile. Her fingers coming towards you and making you stand. Of course manhandling you. \u201cWhat\u2019s yours little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did this happen?\u201d She questioned as you pouted. You should expect that question a lot, so best not to delve into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... reasons. Anyway that isn\u2019t that important Katie. Let\u2019s have a Pokemon battle!\u201d You shout to her as she had to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlow your roll there little guy, we will. Let\u2019s just talk and chill for a sec. After all, not every day I meet someone your... size.\u201d She lowered two fingers down to you. Gripping each side of you, as you get lifted right up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">`<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"></span><br>\r\n\u201cYou two really have a small trainer.\u201d </span>He said, the Cubchoo looking over to her own trainer. His voice of course coming off a bit nosey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYeah he is, but that just makes him better! Plus he\u2019s like really smart!\u201d </span>Teddiursa, finishing her honey and eating it right now. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u2018He\u2019s really good!\u201d<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\"><span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHe\u2019s dedicated, that\u2019s not up for dispute. What about yours Cubchoo, what is the girl like?\u201d</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShe\u2019s really fun too!\u201d</span> He said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were experiencing that fun, as she moved her finger around and gripped the back of your shirt. She held you there and started dipping you up and down. No doubt she was doing this playfully right in front of her face. \u201cHow does it feel, being this high up. If I let you go on accident, you would get really hurt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well I didn\u2019t think about that until now!\u201d You shout to the girl as she laughed. She moved you around to her palm though, to lessen that fear. So you are sort of getting a simple understanding of this girl. She was playful, but she wasn\u2019t evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo little guy,\u201d She said as you instantly frown. \u201cYou training too? With those two? What\u2019s your plan. I mean, just curious from one trainer to another... smaller trainer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly don\u2019t know. Right now it\u2019s get stronger. With Brock out of his gym though, that\u2019s clearly not an option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, it sucks.\u201d Katie said. \u201cSo now we gotta do other things. The Viridian Gym Leader is way too strong, so it\u2019s either go against around Kanto to other gyms, or jump on a plane. Me, myself i\u2019m going to do the former.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!\u201d You shout, a bit surprised at this. \u201cYou really going across to a different region?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Hoenn actually. Gonna train here, until the plane tomorrow. Jump over there, and beat the rock gym leader over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That might be a good plan.\u201d You say to her as you were deep in thought. With Teddiursa, the only types she would have trouble with is fighting and ghost. Nidoran was poison though, so she might have more trouble honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s battle!\u201d Katie said offering. Seems like she had the mantra the same you are. Battle everyone to get better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just read my mind.\u201d You say with a smile back to her. \u201cLet\u2019s get started!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful little guy, me and Cubchoo aren\u2019t gonna be easy.\u201d She said with a smirk.</span></div></div>",

You two stood opposite of each other, some room in the middle of the Pokemon to battle. You both retracted your Pokemon, and are ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust so you know,\u201d Katie started. \u201cBecause you are so small, I am not going to go easy on you.\u201d She said with a big smile, a wide smile even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t act like it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, it\u2019s a fight.\u201d You say as you send out your Pokemon. \u201cNidoran!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut she came of course, and it seemed like she was ready as well. Katie smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how about this. Go, Pidgey!\u201d She said sending out a bird, and since you two are playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, a Pidgey, so common.\u201d You joke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCommon doesn\u2019t mean bad, Pidgey, tackle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird Pokemon flew fast. With the Microphone you yell at your Pokemon to dodge. Nidoran rolled over as the Pokemon hit it's body against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouble Kick to counter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFly up Pidgey!\u201d And the Pidgey did just that, Nidoran almost got one kick in. You see it high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily you could handle it. \u201cYou have range Nidoran, Poison Sting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting out it\u2019s quills from it\u2019s back, they went flying to Pidgey, the bird flying around and trying to dodge. \u201cAim for it\u2019s wing Nidoran, get it grounded!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What!?\u201d She said, almost not believing that was the strategy. She watched as your Nidoran aimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFly up higher Pidgey, don\u2019t let her hit you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPush it as far as you can, don\u2019t let it get out of range!\u201d Your Nidoran listened to you, and pushed her Poison Sting as far as she can. Eventually, it stabbed through the wing. It was exactly like you wanted, as the Nidoran couldn\u2019t stay up into the air with that injury. Flying Pokemon were strong, but they were also agile. Their downside, they have a very obvious weak spot, and take that out, it\u2019s easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot going down that easy, peck Pidgey!\u201d The Pokemon moved forward on it\u2019s talons, as Nidoran got ready. You wait for it to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouble Kick!\u201d Sure it wasn\u2019t effective, but you knew it would finish it. Nidoran turned around, kicking it\u2019s two hind legs into the giant bird. It got sent flying back closer to you. You will admit, you jumped back at this, seeing the avian. However, it was out right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNidoran!\u201d She proudly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Return!\u201d She called, calling her Pidgey back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNidoran, return!\u201d You say as well, calling your Pokemon back. Holding her in your Pokeball, she wasn\u2019t as scary. \u201cThanks, you did amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you got some smarts about you little guy, well we will see if you are as lucky here. Go, Cubchoo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddiursa!\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028As the two colossal bears stood opposite of each other, you wear a smile at your Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go first. Teddiursa, scratch!\u201d Teddiursa charged as Katie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got some moves too, Icy Wind Cubchoo!\u201d The Pokemon blow a cold wind to Teddiursa and you could see she was getting damaged as she rushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget Scratch, get out of there!\u201d You shout as she rolled to the side. \u201cYou okay!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBet she\u2019s not, Icy Wind can pack a real hard hit, not to mention, can slow down the opposition. Pound Cubchoo!\u201d The giant bear came rushing over to yours, and even though you yelled at her to dodge, she got hit. Pushed onto her back, right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddiursa, you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIcy Wind!\u201d Katie yelled as you can\u2019t believe it. The Pokemon blew it\u2019s cold breath, small bits of ice sprinkled in like dust. You open your eyes, seeing that you were really close about this. Your eyes go open as you move around. Ducking behind your Pokemon\u2019s large head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Katie, i\u2019m here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uh... Cubchoo cut it out.\u201d She said to her Pokemon, as she didn\u2019t really think of that. Teddiursa got back up, standing tall as you walk backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready for the counter attack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddi!\u201d She said with a determined look. \u201cOkay, scratch!\u201d You shout as she got got her claws ready and moved in, going across the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, Icy Wind again!\u201d She yelled to Cubchoo, as the Pokemon pattern repeated, this time however you were planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, strafe!\u201d You shout to her as Teddiursa started moving left and right. Icy Wind was more of a less a straight attack, so Cubchoo has to follow with his head to truly get a hit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn it, cut it and use Pound!\u201d Katie said as her Pokemon charged in. Teddiursa was gonna take a hit, but if she can dish one out just as big you were glad about it. As the two Pokemon charged at each other, the collision was heavy. The two got hit, and Cubchoo got scratched. Now that he was in though, you decided to reveal the new move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFury Swipes!\u201d You shout to her as Teddiursa lifted both of her paws. Her eyes go wide, as the two arms got swung down, and slashes. So many swipes as Cubchoo was forced to take the onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Katie yelled while you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Don\u2019t stop!\u201d You shout as Teddiursa kept going, getting tired, but stopping as this really lasted a long time. When it ended, Cubchoo fell onto his back, his eyes crossed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCubchoo no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddiursa, we won!\u201d You shout to her, cause as as soon as you did she came over to you. Picking you up and giving you a large hug. She seemed to be as happy as you were, while Katie was not. You recalled your Pokemon, as Teddiursa placed you onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her call Cubchoo over and look at you standing there. \u201cSorry, guess I win.\u201d You say with a smile as she gave out a bigger frown. \u201cI uh... n-nice match.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that you realised, even though you won, you might be in the same humiliating situation like with Bugsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Katie react to losing?</span></div></div>",

Will she take advantage against her opponent, and get her revenge. You sure hope not. Looking at her, as she stared right down to you. Until finally... she wore a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you are pretty guy, better then I expected!\u201d She said kindly as you breathed a massive sigh of relief. So happy about how it turned out. She came right over to you, lowering her body as she reached down for you. She grabbed you and lifted you up to her smile. She let you sit in her palm as she smiled. \u201cThanks for the match!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, glad how it turned out.\u201d You say to her as that was meant in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Pokemon are out though, and I don\u2019t have any revives. Gonna have to go.\u201d She said back to you, as you thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t mind actually. Probably gonna turn in for the day, after all going to Hoenn tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you?\u201d You question to her. \u201cWell, good luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you for a couple of seconds, until finally she had to wear a smile to you. A big giant smile. \u201cHey, you wanna come with me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on little guy, i\u2019ll take you with me to Hoenn. I can sneak you in, after all... with your size it\u2019s not like they will let you fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a point, but I was thinking about going through Mt Moon to fight Misty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could, but come on don\u2019t you want to visit a new region with me! Be pretty fun, see Pokemon you never have before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... i\u2019ll think about it. As for today, can you bring me back to the Pokecenter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, and since you bet me, i\u2019ll be a good sportsmanship and give you a ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A ride?\u201d You say when suddenly you felt yourself tossed around. placed right onto the top of her head, on her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood up there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see, that\u2019s pretty clear.\u201d You say back to her with a laugh. She got moving, down to Viridian City as you wait there. \u201cHey Katie, thanks for not... hurting me after the battle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d You say back to the giant girl that was carrying you. \u201cBeing so small, literally everyone can take advantage of me. Say... I beat someone, and they aren\u2019t happy about it. What can I really do against them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe suppose you have a point. Still could be worse.\u201d She said to you. \u201cYou could be in a Pokemon\u2019s stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s right.\u201d You say with a smile as that was a unique way to look at it.

The Nurse Joy there didn\u2019t see you as she rented a room. Moving in as she healed her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got in, you saw a room identical to the one you were staying in this morning. Only now you were sharing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t tell her about it, figured wouldn\u2019t bother with the hassle.\u201d She said as she placed you down. Letting you stand on the bed as she stood over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, stuff like that I don\u2019t mind.\u201d You say to her. Katie smiled at this, as she relaxed. moving and sitting down next to you.You saw her giant rear flatten the ground next to you as you had to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... K-Katie, next time you do that, be careful okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, scared you are gonna get sat on.\u201d She laughed, finding it a bit funny. It was at this exact moment you realised you probably should not have put that idea into her mind. \u201cRelax, you will be fine with me. I respect strong trainers, and I respect you. Cause you beat me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I kind of did. My record right now is 1-1 with Pokemon Trainers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, who did you lose against?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, before you figured you should tell her. Meeting Bugsy in the forest, getting beaten in one shot by him, and even him sneaking up and putting you in a jar. You were not a big fan of it but you did tell her. She heard it and listened, and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, you got to admit though it was pretty funny!\u201d Katie laughed. \u201cStill, there was a gym leader in there, kinda sad I didn\u2019t see him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I lost to him, you would of defiantly.\u201d You smile to her as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that suppose to mean?\u201d She said as you feel like she should no. \u201cYou got a bit of a wise lip little guy.\u201d She reached for you, two of her fingers gripping the back of your shirt as you get lifted up. Right into the air and to her smile. It was so easy for her to hold you and dangle you. \u201cYou know I could do the exact same thing to you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but you won\u2019t... we\u2019re friends.\u201d You say with a smile, one that Katie had to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess we are.\u201d She said, placing you back onto her lap and onto her leg. You sit there for a couple of seconds. You were gonna be relaxing with Katie all night, so you might as well get use to her company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you didn\u2019t answer my question before.\u201d Katie said. \u201cSo are you gonna be coming to Hoenn with me or what? I would love to have you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about this, it\u2019s quite the choice. move around to Misty or Surge, or fly across to another region and defeat the Rock gym leader there. You think you can do it, and... it would not be the worst thing to be with Katie more.</span></div></div>",

You love your Pokemon, but you gotta know if they go down you are gonna be by yourself in the wild. Plus, you will be able to face the rock type Gym Leader there. All advantages, no disadvantages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, suppose I will.\u201d You say up to her as Katie smiled. She seemed real happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll sneak you on board tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sneak me on board, no I\u2019m good. I can book a seat myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept for the fact that you really can\u2019t.\u201d She added, playfully bopping you on your head. \u201cAt that size, they would not let you get on. This will be easier trust me. It\u2019s early in the morning, so gotta get there quick.\u201d She said as Katie can\u2019t get over it. She does like you, meeting someone so small, so nice... so cute. Katie has never been one of those type of girls, but something about you she just found adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess i\u2019ll just follow your lead.\u201d You smile to her as she smiled back. Katie moved her hand around, and reached down for you. Grabbing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich means we got about an hour before we should go to sleep. I\u2019ll get us food, and then we can have some fun. I\u2019ve got some things I wanna try with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d You say, not only a bit concerned but very concerned. She didn\u2019t reveal, as she lowered you down. She got up and left, leaving you to dwell on what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you were going to Hoenn huh? So many Pokemon there, you are a bit eager to catch one of them. Not to mention face the Rock Gym Leader. You don\u2019t know much about her, but you have seen her face in passing. If you remember she was a bit of a cutie too, that\u2019s a plus. Plus now that Nidoran knows Double Kick, it\u2019s gonna be super effective. This was the best course of action, you are sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Katie said coming back. \u201cThis should be enough for you right?\u201d She leaned forward and dropped down something in front of you. It was a potato chip, from the bag she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug her hand in and ate about five of them, eating them admittedly pretty messily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this dinner? Shouldn\u2019t it be more... healthy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, your lucky I even gave you one. Come on, eat up quick.\u201d She said as she ate hers. So she liked junk food, you are learning more and more about this girl that is taking care of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing what she wants, you start chipping away at your giant chip. The both of you ate in silence, until you filled yourself up, and Katie finished the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird, seeing how much I eat compared to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but makes sense considering how tiny you are, finished with that.\u201d Whether you were or not, Katie moved her fingers around and grabbed the chip from you. Eating it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s get started with the fun!\u201d She said with a smile, scrunching up the bag and tossing it into the bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, I have had this idea for a pretty long time.\u201d Katie said as you watch her move her fingers to her feet. She started to take off her shoes, throwing them onto the ground together as the next part was her socks. Taking them off as she smiled. Directly at you, which worried you to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That idea is?\u201d You question as she didn\u2019t give you an answer. Instead, she just reached for you, grabbing you and lifting you up. You did get placed back onto the bed, straight in the middle. You stumble around but manage to keep on your feet, cause looking ahead you could see what Katie was doing. With a smile, she laid across the giant bed, and stuck out her feet right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bed, her feet where looming over you. Standing on her heels, and looking a bit dirty. Although you got to admit, smooth. They were scarily close to you, and even though you stumble back, you were a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-Katie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I know this sound weird, but I want you to rub my feet!\u201d She said, the happiest smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, do it. I\u2019m gonna let you come with me to Hoenn. It\u2019s just a little footrub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie.\u201d You say to her a bit sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDOn\u2019t be like that, just do it or they are gonna get you little guy!\u201d She raised her foot, raising it into the air and very gently jabbed you with the side. Knocking you over but not actually hurting you. Katie of course laughing out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on just do it. If you give me a foot rub, i\u2019ll let you sleep on the bed with me.\u201d She said flexing her toes all around the place. Katie should be letting you stay there regardless but... you did feel like you owe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did carry you back, and she is going to take you to Hoenn. Sure playful, but Katie has been nothing but nice to you. You look at her for a couple of seconds, before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one foot rub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor each foot.\u201d She clarified, as you moved forward. \u201cNo way, you are actually doing it! Oh you are the best little guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah just don\u2019t expect this to be a regular thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I will make it a regular thing.\u201d She said with the biggest smile. As you move over, you had to back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, Katie! Your feet stink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they do.\u201d Katie said snickering. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who is about to give them a foot rub though. Good luck!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, doing this, you are gonna have to cover your nose as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you move closer to her giant foot, you try your hardest to ignore the smell that you were getting. She really didn't wash her feet did she. Regardless, you move your way closer. Putting your hand on her sole, getting some dirt on your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you even feel my touch?\" You question to her as she moved her feet around. Letting you see her giant face between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, can feel it pretty good. Keep it up, I really appreciate it.\" Katie said, as you had to smile at that. At least she was thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you start your work. Putting both your hands onto her sole, and pushing it. You push as far as your little muscles can do, and then you start moving around. Transitioning the push around her sole. At least to the parts that you can reach it. You really try, to at least make Katie happy. That's just the guy you are you suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you start rubbing where you can. Getting tired but being efficient. You worked as hard as you can, until finally you couldn't take it anymore, you collapsed back onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't stopping are you!?\" She questioned very against the idea. You see her shift her entire body bringing her feet back, while bringing her face forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you acting so disappointed?\" You snicker at her. Laying on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think, that was an amazing foot rub!\" She told you, honestly perking you up a bit more. You can't help but grow a small smile from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not gonna lie, that kind of makes me glad.\" You say to her as the next part... Didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can't beat the gym leaders... Maybe you can try to make a deal with a foot rub!\" Clearly it was suppose to be a playful jest but it felt more painful. So you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I am done. Sorry if you want more of a foot rub, but I'm feeling tired.\" Katie frowned. She actually wasn't joking or messing with you. It was one great foot rub! She's a bit sad she doesn't get more... But that doesn't mean she can't have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were walking away, you turn your head just in time for her bare sole to be over you! Not that you could do anything about it. It came right down onto you... Pinning you on your back. Unable of course to do anything about it as she held you there. You did try... Lifting it off of you with all the power you can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiler warning... It wasn't much, as you barely budged it. You laid there, bit of a sour look on your face. Half because of the situation, other half because of the stench that coming from the foot on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie!\" You yell at her, as she couldn't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided little guy, I'm going to give you a foot rub! So... I will rub my foot over you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie!\" You shout to her as you suddenly feel she shifting it around on your back. Sliding her sole as you can't believe she was doing this. How humiliating. Also... Kinda good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause she was being so gentle it felt like a massage for you. So you can't deny that it felt good. Still stunk though, without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her sole over you for a while, until she stopped and... \"Boop.\" She joked, tapping the top of your head with her toe.<br>\r\nShe started to laugh, Katie finding it funny as she brought it to the side. While you just look at her less than amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I was just playing.\" She giggled<br>\r\n\"With that cross face, you only come across as cute you know that right.\" She joked as you need to keep that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night admittedly wasn't bad. You two just talked and since the both of you were planning to become champion it had a lot of things to do with strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you... I just need a Dragon type. Those things are unstoppable!\" Katie said. \"Lance, Clair, Drake. The best trainers have Dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean they are strong but against Ice and Fairy not so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh... Dragons are still the best.\" She said with a shrug that got you to smile. \"Anyway, turn around little guy while I change for bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course.\" You say not expecting it to come so suddenly. You turn and you hear shifting around behind you. So you just wait, tapping your hands on your thighs and whistling. When you finally got the go on the turn around, you see her dressed in her sleepwear. A white loose shirt as well comfy shorts to sleep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Ready to sleep!\" She said happily to you. Katie reaching for you and picking you up. While you... You had to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I going to sleep? It is one bed...\" You look over the place, wondering while Katie... Thought it was pretty obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly though you aren't thinking about it... So she will explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You did give me a foot rub, and I kind of did bully you so... You can sleep on the bed with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-With you!\" You shout. A blush on your face as you couldn't believe it. She really just said that. She must be bolder than you thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me like that.\" She said back to you a bit of a snap. \"I'm doing this for you. You can sleep with me on the warm bed... Now the question is... Where am I going to put you?\" She said in a very mocking fashion. \"Bet you would like to pick Wouldn't you?\" She laughed. Noticing that you were still being quiet. \"Well at least you aren't gonna be loud tonight hehe. Now where to put you... Oh I know! She said very happily, smiling at you. \"You can sleep ________</span></div></div>",

You fought for laying on her shirt but Katie was not having it. So... Here you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax... You will be fine, and warm. You should be thanking me if anything.\" She said, a bit upset at the fact that you weren't happy. Offended even. Katie thought she was a pretty cute girl. In her mind most boys would jump on the chance to lay on her stomach. Here you were though, complaining and scared. Regardless she was doing it. Laying back down, she turned off the light. Every light movement that she was doing was enough to throw you around. It was like laying on a water bed that you could not actually control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the lights off, you couldn't see anything. It became worse when you felt a thick layer of fabric come down onto you. Pinning you down and really making sure you were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. Goodnight little guy, tomorrow... We will be in Hoenn!\" She said this as you guess you will. First time travelling to another region and it's by smuggling your tiny body with a giant girl. Not what you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... It was nice, and you were excited. With that excitement for the next day, you didn't struggle much when going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing. You aren't even trying to find me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mew! Listen I need you to grow me big please. I didn't agree to this game and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you gotta find me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't Mew. I was doing something before meeting you. I gotta see it through. Besides... I'm on my way to Hoenn right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoenn got it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up on the next morning, your eyes went wide as you heard a loud sound. A very loud sound that woke you up, but funnily... not it\u2019s intended target. Her alarm was set early, and you were up quick. Your hostess was not though, as she slept through it. You of course wanting to go on that plane went over and tried to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie! Katie come on get up!\u201d You yell at her, at her chin as you can't believe it. How heavy of a sleeper is this girl? Standing on her face, you stomp a couple of times wanting her to get up. She didn't but she did sleepily swing her hand to you. You dodged it at the last second, but it almost knocked you off. \"H-Hey! Fine... If you wanna be that way.\" You shout to her, as you then move over. Crouching right over her eyes... As you simply just slap her giant eyelid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis not only woke her up, but made her jerk awake. Getting up to a sitting position and freaking out! She screamed, and you fell onto the blanket over her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! What was that for!?\" She yelled, angry and rightfully so. However you had a very good reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour alarm went off! We are going to be late!\" You shout at her as she understood. Eyes open and listening in for the alarm. She acted quick. Switching clothes, grabbing her bag. Making sure her Pokeballs were on. You did the same as she scooped you up. Holding you in her hand, she quickly exited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to feed our Pokemon!\" You remind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do that when we get there. We need to go!\" The girl kept running. Sprinting as she left for the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... Got here.\" Katie said. Tired as she fell down in her seat. Literally the last one on the plane. Man was she tired. \"They took my bag... But thankfully they didn't see you.\" Katie said opening the bottom of her shirt. She saw you... Clinging onto the inside. You drop down and breath a sigh of relief. You couldn't see much but you could see Katie by the window. Of course you were on her lap, as an empty seat was next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close. We are on it though. Should be a couple hours right?\" You question to her as she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Which means we got time to just relax. Let me...\" She reached for you. Her fingers on you as you get thrown to her shoulder. Standing there. That wasn't the end though, as she moved her hair over you, hiding you. \"There we go, no one wi see you. Now... Time to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her hands around to the back of head relaxing. As you did the same... Relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was uneventful. You two talked some more, Katie got eyes cause everyone thought she was just talking to herself, and you two ate some peanuts. You got to admit... You've become pretty good friends with Katie. She was a nice girl, a bit playful and bullish at time, but still nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours. \"Here we are... Look out the window!\" She said happily as you did just that. Looking out and seeing the land of Hoenn. It was really something else, Swablu's in the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the large land, so this was Hoenn. A bit excited you are, about how this turns out. Looking back up at the flying Pokemon, you looked at them for a long while... until finally you saw something. A pink tail in the clouds, hiding behind one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that... so Mew really is in Hoenn. You thought it was just a weird dream, but if she is here... maybe you can go to her. All of Hoenn though, you weren\u2019t really in a better situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Katie questioned, noticing your small face. You look at her for a couple seconds until you shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s nothing.\u201d You say back to her. \u201cSo uh... we are gonna be landing soon, where will we be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this is a flight _____________\u201d</span></div></div>",

Anyway, if we are here, let\u2019s go to the gym first!\u201d You shout to her happily, as she didn\u2019t share the same excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, my Pokemon might not be ready. A bird against a rock, not a good result. Cubchoo, although his ice attacks are strong, might not be ready. I think i\u2019ll catch a grass type or water type here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s cool. Can you drop me by the gym and then I will do that.\u201d You say to her as she paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What, seriously? You wanna go in there by yourself.\u201d She said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh... yeah, that was my original plan. Something wrong?\u201d You question to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing it\u2019s just... you sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d She questioned, as you snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeeling a bit protective of me are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if you get stepped on it\u2019s gonna be my fault. I brought you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are both trainers, and if I remember, I bet you. I\u2019m ready, so drop me off please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine fine, i\u2019ll get a map.\u201d She said. Katie has to let you be, not like she could babysit you your whole journey. Would take the fun out of it for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is the place, it\u2019s huge!\u201d You say to her, before listening to your words. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not only because i\u2019m small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt says right here on the map that this is a gym/school. Kind of weird right. Are you sure you wanna do this? You can come with me if you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d You say to her with a smile. It is a good thing that she cares for you, but you are sure you can handle yourself. \u201cThanks for taking me Katie! Good luck with your catching, hope you find a shiny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I find one too.\u201d She commented. \u201cHope you win.\u201d She said with a smile as you nod. She walked inside, just inside and dropped you at the front. Looking ahead, it looked more like a school. With benches, and a long hallway. \u201cI really don\u2019t wanna leave you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll bring out my Pokemon as soon as I can. Nobody is gonna step on a Teddiursa.\u201d You say to her with a smile, which did calm herself a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell bye, next time we see each other, i\u2019ll be the one taking the victory.\u201d She said, standing tall and leaving. You have now been separated with Katie, and by yourself. Not for long though, as you start moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanning on finding someone. You know you told Katie you would actually bring out your Pokemon, but you want them well rested. They would be a bit hungry and thirsty though, maybe the gym leader can help you with that. Still it was a bit weird to walk through a giant school. You know that Gym Leaders have every right to customise their place of work, but still it was a bit weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard a bell and this made you panic a bit. Moving to the side and under a bench as you watch giant children coming out. It wasn\u2019t the biggest of school, and you do think this would be the only class of kids, maybe another. They all grabbed their bags and went of to play. Doing their own thing as none of them saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo even a giant kid towered over you, that scared you a bit but it was something that you were gonna have to accept. Still, they came from that classroom, so maybe you can find Roxanne there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are assuming she was the teacher or something along those lines. So you get going, moving over and getting over it. No giant kid grabbed you, so you got inside. A lot of chairs, and a blackboard. Looking over, you could see basic type advantages and disadvantages on the board. They were kids, so she was teaching them the basics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she was not here. You wonder about what you are going to do, just wait here... well you got no other option if you were going to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you move around, and wait at the entrance. Better then being out there with the kids. You aren\u2019t an idiot, you knew why Katie didn\u2019t want you to be here. A gym leader is responsible, the student kids would not be. Still, you can handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait, you might as well think over your strategy. Not like you had another thing to do. So Rock type. Of course, Nidoran and Double Kick will be helpful. However, if a duel ground/rock type comes that might mean trouble for her. Teddiursa of course, doesn\u2019t have a good advantage against rock types, but she is a fighter. You are very confident she can handle it. Maybe lead with Teddiursa, and bring out Nidoran for the finally. She\u2019s a gym leader, so she will know what she is doing. There is no doubt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were thinking about your tactics, you suddenly hear footsteps. This one was different from the other ones outside, as it was coming closer to you! You get excited, as you stand and wait right at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were filled with so much excitement, until it finally happened. You saw someone come through the door, it was a giant ______________ standing over you, big and imposing.</span></div></div>",

You fell for her almost instantly as she towered over you. You were able to see her stockings under her large dress as she walked her way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brown hair moving as she walked as she went to the desk. Was this Roxanne? You think she might be, she is a year or two older than you, and massive. Well, you got to get her attention. After all, she was your target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you start to move around, watching as she goes around and pulls out some things from her desk. She was also the teacher? What a nice person she must be. Not only does she have her responsibility for being a Gym Leader? She was also a teacher. You plan to start, going over and right to her large shoes. You just need to get her attention, thankfully with it being just you and her, she should be able to easily hear your voice and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as you heard that, a sound happened as it made you freak out. That was a really loud bell! Sitting down as you wonder what you are going to do? Became even worse as you saw giant kids coming in. All of them having their backpacks, from ages 5 to 13 as they all sat down at the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKids were not quiet, that was for sure. You couldn\u2019t even raise your voice above them, no matter how much you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay okay! Take your seat please.\u201d Roxanne said, her tone being strict but kind. \u201cNow time to go over moves, everyone pull out a piece of paper, I want you to write this down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Miss Roxanne!\u201d They said in unison as Roxanne stood up. She took a couple of steps, and under her you get threatened to get stepped on. Freaking out as you move around and avoid actually getting stepped on. Moving to the side as you wonder what you are gonna do? Well, with all the kids your voice isn\u2019t gonna be heard. Sure she was teaching, but the kids were still talking there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo right now, you guess you were gonna have to think of a new plan. Bring out Teddiursa, no that could be bad. Don\u2019t want to erupt panic. So right now, you might as well go. Accepting it as you move around, going over and right to her shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move around and climb on top, standing on her shoe as she walks around. Wiping the blackboard clean, as she started to right down with the chalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now there are many types of attacks, some physical, some special and some effect. Each of them is related to a specific type, and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped listening, as you needed to focus the problem at hand. So you get going over, right over and to her stockings. So finally, you start climbing your way up, planning on getting high up her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the best way to get her attention, but it\u2019s the one you thought of. So you climbed up her large stocking, which went all the way far up her dress. Maybe you should not go up there, climb on the outside of the dress and get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-Wait a second, you are not really sure you can do that? Maybe... you are gonna try to make the jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow who can tell me how these Pokemon learn moves?\u201d Roxanne questioned, as she started to walk around. She moved around and you could barely believe what was happening, as she strolled. Don\u2019t fall off, you are not even at her knee at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPokemon can learn moves from levelling up right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... and TM\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget HM\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait a second, don\u2019t some Pokemon know moves from birth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Cindy. You see, these are known as Egg moves. Certain moves can be carried on from their parents attacks. Quite interesting actually, to not get into the biology of it-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, this girl really knows what she is talking about. You could really learn something to her, but still you get going. Going up to her knee as the thing you were grabbing suddenly felt a bit hard. Regardless you move up closer and to her thigh, climbing up high as you can as you keep doing it more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached her thigh, you turned your head around seeing that you could reach for the dress... maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to reach out for a second, only finding that no matter how much you tried, you couldn\u2019t reach. You had to accept it, so what was your next plan? Climb on the inside of her dress, no that was not a good thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat can you do? What can you do? Keep trying to yell out? Well you haven\u2019t tried it yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey, listen!\u201d You shout up to her, when suddenly she turned to her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo interrupting Derrick!\u201d She yelled to the class trouble boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d She kept yelling as she then started her work. You guess you have to accept what was happening. You look around and try to wonder what you are going to do? Questioning it and thinking about what you were going to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... guess you just have to hang on her thigh? Just hold on until the class is finished. Just keep your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, might as well listen in on her lessons. It does seem like very basic stuff, but you figured you might listen to something that don\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne talked about moves even more, listing off the effects they can all have about it, talking more and more as you were shocked at how good she was. She even went into more complicated moves like Destiny Bond as well as Trick Room. You wonder if you are ever gonna get a Pokemon that knows those moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you crawl over the leg of the teacher, you try to figure out the best plan. Somehow you figured just staying there and holding on was the best tactic for you. When there was less kids around, you were gonna make your move. You haven\u2019t got the best grip strength, but you do have determinations in spades and you were gonna show it. So you keep hugging, hugging for a long time until finally you hear a sound that threw you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle guy!\u201d it was a child, and you froze. Turning your head and looking the classroom, one of the girls at the front has spotted you, and she has waited no time whispering . You looked over to them, as more and more kids spotted you. The whole classroom knows about you at this point, as they can\u2019t help but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne, who was writing something on the board noticed this. She turned her body around and looked at the young girl. \u201cMary, is there something you wanna share with the class?\u201d She said unaware why they were all actually laughing. The laughter didn\u2019t end, but she was going to be filled in on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A bit, miss... you got someone on your leg?\u201d She chuckled as Roxanne was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome... one?\u201d So she looked down, and the girl was stunned on what you saw. You were hugging there, right onto her stocking as you saw her face peeking over the skirt. Well you were found, but whether that was good or not remained to be determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh... hi there!\u201d You say nervously waving at her. \u201cDo you mind picking me up, it\u2019s really high up here... at least to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids laugh at you as Roxanne continues to look. She did reach her hand down, her fingers gripping you as you breathed a sigh of relief. You get pulled ahead as you could hear the kids chattering and talking about you behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello miss Roxanne!\u201d you say in her grip and right in front of her pretty face. \u201cSorry, I was planning on holding on until your lesson is over. We-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can wait until my lesson is over.\u201d She said as that was not a reaction you expected. \u201cI\u2019m not that big a fan of my class getting interrupted, so let\u2019s fix that.\u201d She moved around, moving around and going behind her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her drawer and gently placed you in. You didn\u2019t expect this, but at least you were out of sight. Roxanne looked down to you. \u201cWe can talk after class, let me finish this up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you didn\u2019t have a complaint, as you felt the whole drawer move as she closed it. With it closed, she went back to teaching. You listening in as you were now in darkness. At least you didn\u2019t have to hang on for glory this time, as you just relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the class continued, and obviously Roxanne wasn\u2019t happy. Her class was now interested more in the tiny man than the study she was teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeculations and theories arrises all of them being interesting as Roxanne ended the class. She wasn\u2019t sure a single student listened, so she was gonna correct that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, for homework I want you to study pages 6 to 11. We will be having a test tomorrow so you better study. Also, be focused. This is school, you are here to learn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes miss Roxanne!\u201d They all said as class ended. They all started to make their way out of the class, as Roxanne waited for all of them to leave before starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went and sat at her desk, as she moved her hand around. She reached it and opened it up, getting you to trip at the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh... hi there!\u201d You say with a wave. \u201cSorry about interrupting your class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey rarely pay attention, so it was not entirely your fault.\u201d She said as she reached in. Roxanne grabs you and you felt yourself moved over closer to her. You get grabbed and brought onto the table standing before you. \u201cMy name is Roxanne, Gym Leader of Rustboro City.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is (Your Name), and that\u2019s why I am here. For a Gym Battle!\u201d You say to her as she looked down, almost like she couldn\u2019t believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the Extravaganza, you have more pressing things to do, you should focus on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... the size. Well I got shrunk by Mew, and she wants me to find her... so that\u2019s not an option. That was just before it started, the Extravaganza, so i decided to just go ahead and do it. After all, it\u2019s not like i\u2019m battling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be on this journey.\u201d She said to you. \u201cYou know how much risk you are putting yourself in (Your Name)?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, but i\u2019m still doing it. Don\u2019t worry, I figured everything out. I have got a microphone that lets me yell commands, I got Pokeball that are funny enough the same size as me. I even figured out a way to move over through regions. I\u2019m actually through Kanto!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKanto!\u201d She said back to you, still in disbelief. \u201cYou came this far, do you realise the trouble you are putting yourself in. What if one of my students found you before I did, you would of been taken right there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but... I got strong Pokemon. Look all I want is a battle, you will see that I can take care of myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to you and really thought about what she was going to do at the moment. She didn\u2019t think it would be smart for you to go on this journey. If your Pokemon fail you out in the wild, there is nothing you can do at the moment. At the same time, who was she to deny a trainers dream, no matter how large (Literally in this case) that dream may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne looked down to you, thinking about it until she decided _____________</span></div></div>",

She thinks you going on this journey was a mistake, and you being stubborn could be the end of your life. Any wild Pokemon, regardless of the size could overpower you. Whether that is a Zigzagoon or a Nincada. She didn\u2019t want you to do this... but at the same time it was commendable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have the desire to be a champion, you aren\u2019t even letting your size stop you. She knows that she should be take action, but she couldn\u2019t just stop your dream now. At least, has to make it fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell Roxanne was wondering and thinking about what she was going to do. Until finally she gave out a sigh, coming to her conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay listen, I will make you a deal.\u201d Roxanne said. \u201cWe will have this gym battle, if you win, you get the Rock Ribbon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I win however, you gotta stop this stupid dream. You will quit being a trainer, and stay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What! That\u2019s not fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely fair!\u201d She shouted back. \u201cYou are lucky i\u2019m even giving you this, I don\u2019t think you are safe. When you lose, I will look after you. Making sure you are fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to Roxanne, thinking about the deal. She\u2019s not gonna give you a gym battle if you don\u2019t agree. You\u2019ve come this far, you gotta go along with it. You need to beat her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s just a little bit more risk, you are use to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re on! I\u2019m gonna show you how strong I am!\u201d You shout to her. Roxanne in her mind was doing this for your own good. However... she was hoping you were strong. She will see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne didn\u2019t expect during today, that she might have a small man to look after all later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Gym Battle between the Rustboro City Gym, Roxanne and the challenger will now begin!\u201d An officiator said. Both of you facing each other in the large empty room. It was something else for you, a brown ecstatic with a rocky battle terrain. Roxanne was like a whole city away from you, and the officiator in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roxanne, she could barely see you on the other side. \u201cI doubt this will turn out well for you, but i\u2019m giving you this chance! Don\u2019t waste it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d You shout, being so far away though of course she didn\u2019t hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe battle will be a 2 vs 2 Pokemon battle. While the challenger can switch out their Pokemon! The Gym Leader cannot. The winner will be determined when two Pokemon from one side are knocked out and unable to battle!\u201d The officiator said as it was time. You grabbed your little microphone and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo Geodude!\u201d She yelled, sending out her Pokemon. Growing up in Kanto, you recognised the rock with two arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cGeo!\u201d</span> He shouted, stretching. It\u2019s rock ground, with high defence for this level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta save Nidorina, Go! Teddiursa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><span class=\"corange\">\u201cTeddi!\u201d</span></span> She shouted, happily jumping and stretching. While Roxanne breathed a sigh of relief. At least your Pokemon were normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cIs that your trainer!\u201d </span>Geodude said. <span class=\"ctan\"> \u201cHe\u2019s not fit for battle, must suck being his Pokemon!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are so going down!\u201d Teddiursa said taking a battle stance. Nobody insults her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady Teddiursa, go Scratch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTackle Geodude!\u201d Roxanne said as your two Pokemon rushed each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, focus on dodging it!\u201d You change your mind as Teddiursa listened, leaping over Geodude as he rushed forward. Both Pokemon turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeodude\u2019s strong, we would of taken more damage if we traded blows.\u201d You say to yourself. Strong attack, strong defence, but terrible speed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTackle again!\u201d Roxanne yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet ready, dodge it and counter with a Fury Swipes!\u201d Which she did exactly like that, sidestepping the Pokemon, and landing so many attacks and swipes. So many, to the point where it was doing some damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRock Tomb!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the air!\u201d You countered her, almost instantly. Geodude struck the ground, sending pillars in the air. Teddiursa didn\u2019t get count, jumping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit that was impressive.\u201d Roxanne said. \u201cHow about this, Defence Curl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Teddiursa it\u2019s raising it\u2019s defence, get in there and lay in Fury Swipes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddi!\u201d </span>She said, going to the defensive Pokemon and striking. It was small damage, but with the amount that was happening you feel like it was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRock Tomb!\u201d She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJump again!\u201d You tried to counter. The same action happened this time, but Roxanne continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRock Throw!\u201d She shouted. You see the rock pull into the ground, grabbing a large rock and tossing it at Teddiursa. In the air, she had no space to dodge and got hit. Falling and landing on it\u2019s back, feeling pained. \u201cNow Tackle Geodude!\u201d She shouted as Geodude laid into Teddiursa with a nasty shoulder bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddiursa, are you okay!\u201d You shout to your Pokemon. She got up, but was wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddi...\u201d </span>She said between breaths. Clearly this was not working, Geodude was hurt but not as much as Teddiursa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReturn!\u201d You shout, calling your Pokemon back. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I wanted, but I gotta get past Geodude quick. Nidoran, go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sent out the Pokemon, as the poison type landed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cNido!\u201d</span> She screeched as Roxanne looked at the Pokemon. Why would he send in a poison type? Geodude was a ground, resistant to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet close!\u201d You shout to your Pokemon as it charged. Roxanne wasn\u2019t gonna take a risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefence Curl!\u201d She ordered her Geodude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cbefore she gets it in,\u201d You shout into the Microphone. \u201cDouble Kick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Double Kick!\u201d She shouted, as her Geodude felt it. Getting kicked right in between the eyes with Nidoran\u2019s front foot, only for her to swing around, taking out Geodude with the back foot. Despite the defence, it was super effective, as well as a Critical Hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the damage before, only one result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeodude is Unable to battle, the winner is Nidoran!\u201d</span></div></div>",

You just need to do this. Nidoran and her double kick was really effective. However you are sure you can\u2019t surprise her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet one, but let\u2019s see how you go against my signature Pokemon. Go, Nosepass!\u201d She shouted, sending it forward. You see the Pokemon come out, and... well you have never seen anything like it. It\u2019s obviously a rock type, but a Hoean one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNosepass...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Roxanne shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move your hands around and reach for your Pokedex and pulling it out. Listening to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNosepass, the compass Pokemon. It moves less than an inch a year, but when it\u2019s in a jam, it will spin and drill down into the ground in a split second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, well i\u2019m still gonna beat it! Nidoran, charge with a Double Kick once again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cNido!\u201d </span>She said happily, running it\u2019s way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarden!\u201d Roxanne said, as to your surprise. That was all the Pokemon did. One hit, followed by another to Nosepass. The kicks although super effective barely moved the Pokemon. Nidoran was close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Rock Tomb!\u201d She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJump Nidoran, that\u2019s how we get away!\u201d You shout as well, as your Pokemon jumped. The rocks shoot out of the ground, only for you to be shocked. The rocks easily caught the Pokemon. Entrapping her. The rocks were like pillars, that\u2019s how they reached your giant Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Nidoran!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTackle!\u201d Roxanne yelled, as the Nosepass collided with the rock. Not only did this cause a rock slide, Nidoran was in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNidoran!\u201d You shout to her, as you look in the middle of the battle field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNidoran is unable to battle, the winner is Nosepass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. \u201cReturn Nidoran.\u201d You say calling your Pokemon back to he ball. \u201cYou did great, we will finish this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is for your own good. If you can\u2019t get pass me, you can\u2019t continue your journey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it, I am gonna get pass you! Go Teddiursa!\u201d You send out your Bear as she stood ready. The two Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, then let\u2019s finish this. Rock Tomb!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddiursa, run around.\u201d You shout as your Pokemon sprinted. Clearly, jumping high wasn\u2019t gonna do it. She realised it as well, as you switched up your strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep the rock tomb up, don\u2019t let her stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddiursa, run towards Nosepass.\u201d You shout to your Pokemon. With the rocks shooting behind her still, she turned over there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was happening, Roxanne thinks she knows your plan. Lay in attacks slowly but surely. Dodging the rocks all of it. That\u2019s some faith you have in your Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two Pokemon got close, Roxanne acted. \u201cTackle!\u201d Her Pokemon stopped the rock pillars and charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlow... it\u2019s slow. Teddiursa jump over the Pokemon. Get behind it!\u201d you yell at your Pokemon, as she listened. Jumping and getting behind. \u201cNow Tackle Nosepass yourself, push it into the rock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddi!\u201d</span> She said, hitting the Pokemon with a shoulder. The Nosepass collided with the rock, as it did more damage than a normal tackle would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, tackle on the rock above and get out of there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddi!\u201d </span>She yelled, moving and slamming into the rocks. Teddiursa got out of there, but Nosepass didn\u2019t. It jumped to the side as Roxanne looked at her Pokemon, in the pile of rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to admit, you do have a trainers instinct. Not just anyone can think of that strategy from just watching it once. However... if you think that can beat Nosepass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNose!\u201d </span>It chimed, as you guess that didn\u2019t work. You see it move out of the rocks. Bruised but still standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRock Throw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddiursa, dodge it.\u201d Which she had no problem with. Jumping left and right as you try to think of something you can do. The Nosepass kept throwing rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait a second!\u201d You shout to her. \u201cTeddiursa, get close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddi!\u201d </span>Your Pokemon chimed, running close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing, your Pokemon has complete faith in you?\u201d She questioned. She can\u2019t help but be confused. \u201cHold a rock, throw it when it gets close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Nosepass did just that, as Teddiursa got closer. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNose...\u201d</span> He said, finally throwing it forward. Teddiursa thankfully barely sidestepped it as it got ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTackle!\u201d You shout as your Pokemon charged into the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne expected more, however she wasn\u2019t gonna just let the poor move go free. \u201cRock Tomb, under it\u2019s feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJump up on Nosepass!\u201d You yell as Teddiursa did just that, on top of the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d Roxanne chimed as the rocks got shot up. A pillar, but this time, both Teddiursa and Nosepass was on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJump down Teddiursa, and then tackle the rock again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUr-Sa!\u2028</span> She said leaping off of Nosepass. Roxanne knew what you were trying to do, but she also knew that Nosepass was far too slow to get down as well. Teddiursa charged her shoulder into the rock, and brought it down once again. Knocking it down as well as Nosepass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever... due to it\u2019s weight, the fall was much worse for the rock type. A dust cloud came up when Nosepass smashed into the ground. Teddiursa still standing ready for the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was happening, you were hoping that was it. You can\u2019t see much from your vantage point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever... you heard the officiator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNosepass is unable to battle, the winner is Teddiursa! With that, the battle goes to (Your Name)!\u201d And at this, you loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe won! We won!\u201d You chimed, jumping around happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddi?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddiursa! We won, we won our first gym battle!\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><br>\r\n\u201cTeddi? Te... Teddiursa!\u201d </span>She yelled happily, running over to you and dropping down. Not crushing you, but pulling you into a big bear hug. One you just had to reply. You proved it, you proved you can beat a gym leader, even at the size you were at!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Roxanne, she was left stunned. That was a smart move, and with strong Pokemon. She can\u2019t even deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a trainer.</span></div></div>",

Of course, they would rather go around and go to their food. They went and took many bites. Both of them eating pellets and even drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, okay I will let you eat.\u201d You say turning back to Roxanne. The group of you were all in a waiting room. It was just you and Roxanne, as she smiled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her hand down to you, and grabbed you. Roxanne grabbing you and lifting you up to her hand. She places you onto the table in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have to admit. You impressed me, to the point where I can\u2019t deny it. You are a good trainer, so you can keep going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn right I can! Did you hear that guys!\u201d You say beyond happy about. \u201cOkay, I will let you girls eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen was the last time you fed them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause before thinking. \u201cWhen was the last time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even remember! You need to take better care of your Pokemon Mister!\u201d She said, pointing her finger at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, uh... yes miss.\u201d You say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPokemon aren\u2019t playthings, they are partners. Treat them as such.\u201d Roxanne said. \u201cThat is what we tell the children.\u201d She said as you calmed down. You calmed down with her as the both of you look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, i\u2019ll do better by them. Now... I think I might deserve a reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne looked at you, before sighing. She pulled out the Rock Ribbon! One of the 18 Ribbons. She gave it to you as you held the large ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a case?\u201d She questioned raising her eyebrow. You showed it, as you pull the shrunken one of your bag with a nervous laugh. \u201cWell, how will you carry the ribbons?\u201d She said, a bit annoyed at how unprepared you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Teddiursa! Over here!\u201d You say to your Pokemon. The bear had her mouth full of food. \u201cOh her arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will have to do for now.\u201d Roxanne said. Leaning her way over and tying it on her arm. It would seem she was very happy about it, only to go back to your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow do you have a Pokenav?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right I do!\u201d You say to her with a laugh, pulling it out. You totally forgot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to become a trainer, you gotta remember these things better!\u201d Roxanne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I was good enough to get the rock ribbon an-\u201d You didn\u2019t finish those words as she pushed you with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou also can\u2019t talk that way to people bigger than you! You won\u2019t know how they will react. Act better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right I will.\u201d You say to her as you guess this was happening. \u201cAnyway, why did you want me to pull this out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut my number in. Call me if anything goes wrong.\u201d She said as you did just that. You can make calls with this thing, man it is pretty funny how you forgot. \u201cAnd check your map.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight...\u201d You say going to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I recommend-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I will go to Route 115, then Meteor Falls, and to Lavaridge Town! That\u2019s the plan.\u201d You say as you look up to her. \u201cNot good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you pick something a bit more... safer?\u201d She said as you shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I will be fine!\u201d You say to her with a smile. \u201cDo you know the Gym Leader?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlannery, she\u2019s a fire type Gym Leader.\u201d Roxanne said. \u201cFine, you can go. I stand by my statement though, if you have a problem call me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it! Thank you so much for doing this for me. You are the best.\u201d And with that, you get going. You get going and move your way away. You move your way away, going down to your Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReturn!\u201d You shout to both of them. You then turn around to see the Gym Leader. \u201cHope we get to meet again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do too.\u201d Roxanne said down to you, moving onto her knees. \u201cJust be careful. It\u2019s not gonna be an easy trek up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have faith in my Pokemon.\u201d You say to her, as she had to smile as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they have faith in you. Good luck, i\u2019m... rooting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are? Really?\u201d You question, a bit excited about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone loves an underdog story. Good luck.\u201d And with that Roxanne stood tall. Very tall, she waved at you as you slowly made your way out of the building. She would rather keep you safe, but she\u2019s not gonna blame you. You wanted to be a trainer, like many others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie!\u201d You shout to her, seeing the girl not so far away. She looked back at you for a couple of seconds, very happy about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how\u2019s it going! How did it went!\u201d She said. The both of you were on the edge of town. Right towards the routes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady? I won!\u201d You shout to her. The giant girl a bit shocked. \u201cY-You won?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, kicked butt with them. It was pretty nice if I was going to be honest.\u201d You say to her. \u201cYou are gonna love facing her. She\u2019s a nice Gym Leader.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Katie said. \u201cI am a bit against the idea of playing catch up to someone your size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, we rivals?\u201d You chuckle to her. \u201cWell i\u2019m going up to Lavaridge Town. Want me to wait for you and we can go together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fire Gym Leader. I have an Ice Pokemon and a Grass Pokemon. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s for me. If you can go to the gym by yourself, you can make this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it!\u201d You say back to her with a laugh as it is about to start. \u201cwait Grass Type?

Next time we see each other, i\u2019m winning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wish giant girl.\u201d You say back to her. \u201cW-Wait a second, let\u2019s exchange numbers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a Pokenav. Since when?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince uh... always. Kind of forgot.\u201d You say as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you swapped numbers, as finally she looked down. \u201cWell there we go, see you later! Call me if you need help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does everyone think I can\u2019t handle myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause you can\u2019t tiny.\u201d She said tapping you with her finger. She then walked over you, proceeding into the city. \u201cSee ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye Katie!\u201d You say waving back at her, as you proceed to leave the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNidoran, Teddiursa. Come on out!\u201d You shout sending your Pokemon out. \u201cDo you two uh... think you can give me a ride?\u201d You say nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them laughing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you three walked your way through Route 115. Besides the occasional Pokemon battle with a Zangoose it went good. You three got closer to Meteor Falls as you were left stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s so big. Meteor Falls? I wonder why it\u2019s called that?\u201d You say to them. \u201cWe can camp in there, under shelter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeddi!\u201d </span>Teddiursa said with a big smile. The three of you walked up. It was a weird landscape, one side of you was the beach, the other side was a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the beach you were more interested in. You say something that made you smile. \u201cNidoran, there is a Pokemon at the beach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoran listened and went down there. Being slightly faster than Teddiursa she got to the shore quick. Just as the Pokemon went back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn, it must of swam out.\u201d You say as you step off. Moving down onto the sand as Teddiursa came back. \u201cDo you two see anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon of course looked as well. Neither of them seeing something. Until finally you saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! I see it. It\u2019s a... Magikarp?\u201d Now you would be disappointed if it was one. It was on the surface far out. You took a long look at it though. It had the same shape, but a different colour. \u201cWait no... it\u2019s the Hoenn version.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your Pokemon looked at you confused as you pulled out your Pokedex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeebas, the Fish Pokemon. Although unattractive and unpopular, this Pokemon\u2019s marvellous vitality has made it a subject of research.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, These ones evolve into Milotic!\u201d you say looking at the fish. It was staring back at the three of you. You don\u2019t think Feebas sees you as a trainer, and probably only sees your Pokemon. \u201cMilotic is said to be one of the most beautiful Pokemon in the world. Aw, it would be nice to have one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cNido?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you are right. She is far too far away.\u201d You say to them. \u201cWell, guess that\u2019s that. Let\u2019s keep going.\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><br>\r\n\u201cTeddi! Teddi!\u201d</span> Your Pokemon said seeing that you wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo point, it would just swim out. Come on, maybe we can see a cool Pokemon in Meteor Falls.\u201d You say climbing onto Nidoran. The three of you leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\"><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cH-He just called me beautiful.\u201d</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of you went ahead and into Meteor Falls, it just got dark. Although their was lumanite lights in the cave. You think it\u2019s from crystals or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this place is pretty! Let\u2019s see how far we can go until we get tired.\u201d You say to your Pokemon. They seemed to listen as they came with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Fire Gym Leader next. There should be no resistance or anything like that, so the both of you will have an easy match. We should probably level up near the town. You two okay with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\"><br>\r\n\u201cRan!\u201d </span>Nidoran said. At you on it\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna do that. Nidoran, you gotta. You might be too weak and you might lose.\u201d You say as she disagreed. \u201cHow about if you do, we will have a rest after that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoran listened to her master, until finally she nodded her way. <span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cNido.\u201d</span> She said with a nod as you were glad about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lot of walking in, you three came across a stream in the cave. \u201cWow, look at that.\u201d You say getting off Nidoran. \u201cI wonder how it tastes.\u201d You move ahead and get close. Taking sips as your had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I don\u2019t know what minerals are in, but it tastes so nice!\u201d You say to your Pokemon. \u201cIt seems good to drink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, your word was all Teddiursa needed as she came and kneeled right next to her. Scooping water in her mouth as she gave out a very satisfied \u201cTeddiursa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoran of course wasn\u2019t so sure, but if you two are then it must be good. She came onto your other side and began shovelling water in it\u2019s mouth. Licking it up as you wore a big smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kind of glad about how it went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two kept having it, you see Teddiursa and Nidoran perk up. Moving and going behind. You of course didn\u2019t give a reaction as you looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up girls? Is there something wrong?\u201d You question to her. They just kept looking, as you realised something. \u201cRight you girls have bigger ears, is there something coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, you just had to get away. Standing by them and fiddling for your microphone. You pull it out as you were ready for battle.<br>\r\n\u2028What\u2019s coming, was it a Pokemon, was it another trainer that was coming. You were paused, thinking about what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddiursa and Nidoran were ready to protect their little trainer, when suddenly it came. They saw _________</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, the ball breaks open and the wild Pokemon emerges. She immediately glares at you, and you gulp. You hadn't expected her to break out, seeing as she took a lot of damage during the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear heavy steps behind you, and then feel two giant fuzzy paws wrap around you. You're brought back up to the chest of your starter, who embraces you tightly and growls at the Nidoran. In response, the rodent rears up and lets out a cry towards the sky, much louder than any noise she made before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know why she made that cry, but you have a bad feeling about it. Perhaps she was calling for help? What if she has a whole family nearby? There's no way you and your starter could take on more than one Pokemon right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon see some movement in the bushes behind the Nidoran. Seconds later, a Nidorina appears, running on all fours. She's twice the size of the Nidoran, and even bigger than Teddiursa. The new Pokemon stops next to the Nidoran, then stands up and roars at you and Teddiursa. It hurts your ears, and you wince. Meanwhile, the Nidoran runs behind the Nidorina and chatters rapidly. You get the impression that these two are sisters, and the younger one called to the older one for aid. And now the older one is here, ready to beat you and your starter up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't let that happen, but the only way to avoid that fate is to run. There's no way you can win a fight against this new Pokemon. Not only is Teddiursa currently injured from the previous fight, this Nidorina is bigger, stronger, and surely more experienced. This is a fight you can't win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you tell your starter to run away. She looks down at you with a surprised expression, but you're sure you're making the right choice. You repeat your order and wait to see what Teddiursa does.</span></div></div>",

She raises her claws, stomps the ground, and roars at Nidorina. It was supposed to be intimidating, but it sounds utterly adorable, and you can\u2019t help but grin. However, Nidorina replies with a much louder and more frightening roar, making both you and your Pokemon step back in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidorina takes advantage of this distraction to charge. You run to the side to get away from the impending fight, while your starter stays in place and tries to guard herself. Unfortunately, the attack is too powerful. She\u2019s headbutted and thrown into the air, landing heavily a short distance away. Nidorina then uses Poison Sting to launch needles at her. The cub cries out in pain and tries to get back up. Meanwhile, Nidorina looks at Nidoran and points at Teddiursa. Nidoran nods, then rushes in and tackles the helpless Teddiursa, who continues to struggle and cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t bear to watch any more. You need to help your friend! You rush towards the fight, even though it\u2019s surely a crazy thing to do, considering you\u2019re so much smaller than either combatant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t get far, though. You feel the ground shake, and before you know it, a huge blue paw has descended on you. Three stubby fingers, each tipped with a sharp claw, wrap around you in a vice-like grip. You scream and squirm uselessly as you\u2019re picked up and brought to the face of Nidorina. Her huge red eyes stare into your soul, and you freeze in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Teddiursa is still getting attacked by Nidoran. Nidorina looks over and watches with a satisfied expression as her little sister gets her revenge. Now that her intimidating gaze is elsewhere, you regain your composure and try to squirm out of her grip, but it\u2019s no use. You soon give up, and simply watch as your starter is tackled repeatedly. It\u2019s heartbreaking, especially because there\u2019s nothing you can do to help. The best you can do is try to encourage her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeddiursa!\u201d you shout. \u201cPlease don\u2019t give up! Fight back! I believe in you! You can\u2014augh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry out as Nidorina squeezes you painfully, forcing you to be quiet. You fall silent and continue to watch the fight. Hopefully Teddiursa received some encouragement from your words, and gets the second wind required to fight off her attacker.</span></div></div>",

The younger sister happily hops over to her sibling, but then she gasps as she notices that her sister caught you. She rears up on her hind legs to get a closer look at the tiny human in her sister\u2019s clutches, and she quickly adopts an amazed expression. Nidorina smiles and holds you out to the younger Pokemon, who sniffs at you and examines you closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you\u2019ve lost the motivation to do anything except stare back at Nidoran. It seems like all hope is lost. Your starter was easily defeated in her very first battle, and you\u2019ve been snatched up by a giant wild Pokemon, leaving you at her mercy\u2014and the mercy of her little sister. There\u2019s a very real possibility that these Pokemon will take the opportunity to eat you, or torture you, or both, especially since you attacked the younger sister and tried to catch her. It all feels hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you look at the unconscious form of Teddiursa lying nearby, and feel some sudden courage well up in you. What would she think if she saw you acting depressed like this? You can\u2019t give up. You\u2019re a trainer now, and your Pokemon partner relies on you to be a good, brave leader. You have to keep fighting, both for yourself, and for Teddiursa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back and forth between the two giant Pokemon and finally speak up. \u201cHey!\u201d you shout, though your voice shakes. \u201cI... I\u2019m very sorry for attacking you, Nidoran. I\u2019m a new trainer, and Teddiursa just joined me, and I simply wanted us to become stronger by battling you a bit. I was also hoping you\u2019d like to join us. We didn\u2019t want to hurt you or anything. So, please... both of you, can you please let me go and help my friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rodents\u2019 ears twitch as you talk. They clearly hear you, and they also understand you, as they start contemplating what you said.

You recalled her last words, 'come find me'. Was it a challenge? Some kind of trial? Or just a stupid game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, it was unlikely for you to win... at least, if you were alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up at the last thought, which you discarded as incorrect: you weren't alone, you reminded yourself as a small wave of relief washed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered your Pokemon partner coming with you. She was just sleeping nearby when Mew appeared and shrunk you, but now the tasks of getting out of this forest of grass and finding her seemed impossible, given your current stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you couldn't just sit still and wait for either your partner to wonder where you were or for some other Pokemon to show up and turn you into a meal without even thinking twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, getting up, you began running across this forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get to your Pokemon, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran as fast as you could, forced to push the blades out of the way so that you could pass while wondering where your partner was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, she was still in the same spot as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, it wasn't a terribly long time until you finally emerged from the grass; And not too far away, curled up in her own patch of grass, was a white and pink Pokemon with four ribbons messily scattered around her as their owner slept with her head in her pink paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Sylveon was resting peacefully, blissfully unaware of your predicament or anything else around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, figuring that you had to get her attention and, eventually, help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded pretty simple, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you made your way to the sleeping giantess and reached her paws, grimly noting that you weren't any bigger than a paw alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, you'd take care of your size later. First things first, you had to wake Sylveon up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to simply call out to her and hope she could hear you, despite your reduced stature, though you guessed her ears were going to be a 'big' help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally groaned at your thought process as you proceeded to call to Sylveon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylveon, wake up,\" you spoke, getting no response or reaction. Nothing at all, not even a twitch of her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylveon, wake up. C'mon girl, I need you!\" you called again, getting the same response as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept trying a few more times, getting absolutely nowhere. At some point, your mind went to Mew as you wondered how far she had gotten while you were pointlessly trying to wake up your Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use: the fairy-type was in deep sleep and couldn't hear you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, figuring you'd have to wake her up the 'manual' way. And that meant you had to climb all the way up to her head and try to wake her up there; you guessed that, if you got closer to her ears, then she'd be able to hear you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you moved to one of her paws and jumped on top of it, putting your hands against the side of Sylveon's furry head as you got ready to climb; her fur was silky smooth, and it was going to be your ticket to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with a little push upwards, you began your climb to the top, while your now giant Pokemon kept snoring quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a couple minutes to reach the top of the pink and white giantess' head; the fur, you noted as you stood up, reached your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than being stuck in some grass...\" you mused to yourself as you looked around your Pokemon's head; aside from the large white, pink and blue bow, Sylveon's equally colored ears were there, on each side of you, standing tall like towers, looming over you. You just had to pick one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chose her left ear and moved in front of it. Then, carefully low as to not irritate Sylveon's delicate hearing, you began speaking within her ear,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylveon, wake up. I need you,\" you said, beginning to stroke the side of her ear gently, hoping she'd feel you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe definitely did, because she began moaning in her sleep. Certainly a better result than the one you got back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept stroking Sylveon's fine fur while pleading for her to wake up until she finally did; her eyes opened slowly, the ribbons rose from the ground and she heard the voice of her master in her ears. Yet, as she glanced around, she saw no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you took notice that your Pokemon had finally woken up, so you sighed in her ear,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your head, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon hesitated a moment. Then, slowly, a ribbon crawled to her left ear; absentmindedly, you began petting it, allowing its owner to locate you and wrap the ribbon around your waist. After that, you were brought in front of Sylveon's blue eyes; seeing her white pupils widening in surprise, you began chuckling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, hello Syl...\" you muttered as you began explaining why you were so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began by telling her of your encounter with Mew while Sylveon herself listened carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was long before the end of your tale that you noticed how Sylveon was reacting to the situation. </span></div></div>",

This is the last place you ever wanted to go because you did not like having to walk all over the place were wild Pokemon go around and attack you. Sadly, you forgot to bring one of your Pokemon with you but then again, you didn't expected to be one of the unfortunate gatherer to be sent here in all place; you still have some pokeballs with you, but that's still not enough to make you safe. After taking a quick nap from all that walking, you managed to find something that you never expected to find: Mew! And then, another unexpected turn of events: You have been shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back to the present, you are now totally defense and there's no way you can protect yourself now. Mew have told you to find her, but how could do that in this condition?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try to find a Pokemon and catch it while it's not looking, but way too dangerous. You don't have any clear idea what to do so you are gonna just walk among the giant plants to avoid getting seen by any Pokemon that wants to eat you or trainer that wants to catch you. You went and walk through a series of bushes, beginning your trek across this great jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't very easy to walk through the bushes as you have to move away the branches and twigs that keep blocking your path. You are not sure how are you going to escape as you couldn't quite remember where the exit was. You did know that there was a clearing nearby so you hope that you could get there and get a better idea on where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood news, you have found the clearing that you have been previously as the large rock in the center makes it recognizable. Bad news, the grass are much taller here than you expected. While it can protect you from being spotted, the taller grass is where wild Pokemon can be spotted. With much effort, you tried to walk across this dangerous spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You couldn't see what's in front of you but you can see where the rock is and that's where you will be using for directions. The giant rock serves as a clue on what spot you are standing. A few minutes later, you managed to get near the jungle pathway meaning that you are now leaving this clearing and possibly closer to the exit. However you stop right in your tracks; you could've sworn you heard something beyond the darkness in front of you, but it was too soft to make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there; listening real carefully at what sounded like a series of booms which gets louder as it gets closer. You quickly figured out that it sounded like someone is coming, most likely a Pokemon trainer. You look ahead and can make out a figure walking down the jungle path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person appears to be a young girl with short black hair under a large red hat. She wears a yellow floral shirt with a tied-up ribbon on the hem, green shorts that were very short to the point it reveals nearly her entire legs, and a pair of red-black sneakers with no socks. With that red bag she's holding with on her shoulder, you can easily tell that this is indeed, a Pokemon trainer. However, you realize that you have seen this girl before back at the hotel. While both of you never meet face to face, you did saw her talking to another girl at the hotel lobby before leaving. You will never expected to come across her yet again and right now, you don't think you could face her very easily due to your size. Because of that, you don't think you are going to get her attention out of fear that she could mistake you for a Pokemon and try to catch you. Speaking of which, you can see her face looking down among the grass, searching for some Pokemon to capture. You stand still at the very spot and hope that she wouldn't find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you also kinda want her to see you because let's face it, you are going to need some help getting out of this jungle, but that's all pure luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she gets closer and bigger until she is now towering over you. The worst part is that she has stopped right in front of you and begans to search below. You gulped and hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she see you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Because of how tall the grass strands are and how dark this jungle is, you would expect that this young trainer won't be able to see you. So with that, you slowly tiptoed as quietly as possible to escape her sight when she suddenly gasped from above. You look up and see that to your utterly surprise, is now staring down at you with her mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, is this a Pokemon?\" You hear her said. You couldn't believe on what she said. The idea of being mistaken for a Pokemon has come true and now, you are in her sight. You tried to call back to her and try to tell her that you are a human being, but you saw that she has already taken her Pokeball; ready to catch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you are supposed to be, but I'm gonna catch you.\" She said in a slight cheerful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to get her attention now, you have choice but to run away from her as far as possible. You turn around and make a dash; forward ahead. You didn't even look back but you could hear her saying \"Wait, come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran across the pathway with the girl running in pursuit of the strange \"Pokemon\" that she found, you wondered how can she see a tiny creature like you in a dark place like this. This girl seems to have some excellent sense of sight because her eyes still haven't left you. You dodge several obstacles along the way which are mainly branches, rocks, and leaves; the girl however, can easily step on them as it they were never there. You were slowly losing your breath as you ran until you can barely escape from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I finally got you now.\" She said excitingly. But just as she was about to get closer, she did not noticed that she is walking towards a large tree root and immediately trips onto it. She rapidly flail her arms in surprise before losing her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped when you hear a loud noise from behind you that sounded like crashing. You look towards that direction only to realized that the giant girl is no longer chasing after you. Right in front of you, she is now laying on the ground; eyes closed. Why is she's now sleeping? It must've been the fall that impact her head to the point that was enough to knock her unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked towards her hand and poke it to see a response, but nothing is coming from her now. You sat down on her thumb, trying to think on what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try to stay here and wait until she wakes up in order to properly contact her, but you don't know how long will that take. You spotted her Pokeball that has now dropped from her hand; it could be one of her Pokemon inside so maybe you could get their help instead. Of course, maybe there's no point of reasoning from her so it would probably be best to abandon her and find someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat... just happened?\u201d You groaned, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was certainly unexpected. You never thought you\u2019d meet the legendary Mew in your life! Of course, you also never thought that Mew would shrink you and abandon you in the wild. If that was the price to pay for meeting Mew, it didn\u2019t seem worth it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe this is why so few people say they\u2019ve seen Mew.\u201d You thought, smiling a bit at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you focus on the matter at hand. You had to figure out what you were going to do next. You weren\u2019t a Pokemon trainer, so you didn\u2019t have any partner to go find. Fortunately the Pokemon around Icirrus City were mostly docile. Probably because the gym leader, Brycen, kept everything nice and peaceful. So at least you won\u2019t have to worry about aggressive wild Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that didn\u2019t mean you were safe from danger. Right now, you were tucked away in a nice dry area of forest. But you definitely remember the massive bog that surrounded Icirrus City. That thing was already dangerous and a pain to get through at normal size. At your current size, you\u2019d probably just drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had to go and risk it. Once you got to town, you could get someone\u2019s attention and they could take you to Brycen. You doubted he could fix you, or knew anyone who could, but he\u2019d at least be able to arrange for you to stay somewhere. Maybe get you someone to guard you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that bog was so massive and the city was already far away when you were normal size. What took you a day or two before would likely take you weeks now. You were well stocked for a long trip, but that was for normal size you. You couldn\u2019t even see your bag now; Mew probably took it. And even if you could find it, you had no way to carry any of the massive supplies inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould you even survive a trip through that bog?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched your head contemplatively. Your only options really were to stay here and wait for help or risk the trip. If you could find your bag, you\u2019d have plenty of supplies to wait here, but if you couldn\u2019t then you\u2019d have to scrounge stuff together and survive off the land. And there was no guarantee that help would come, or even notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think this through carefully\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat there and debated, you thought that you could feel or hear something. At first you ignored it, but the thought kept creeping into your mind. The sensation felt so faint, but it felt so real. If you focused hard on it, it almost felt like... movement. Like something was coming to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly jumped to your feet when something massive slammed down in front of you! The object appeared to hit the ground hard, but it barely made a sound. And the grass beneath it didn\u2019t get trampled either. It simply bent, sort of conformed to the shape of the object. It was like it was like the thing wasn\u2019t even there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMostly recovered from the shock, you steady your breath and take a good look at what landed in front of you. It was\u2026 a massive blue hoof! Thinking you knew what it belonged to, you craned your neck to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was the legendary Pokemon Keldeo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe your eyes! You were seeing another legendary, just moments after the first one shrunk you! Not to mention, Keldeo was one that you were much more familiar with. You grew up hearing stories about Keldeo and his teachers. Most of the stories focused on Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion; but you always liked Keldeo the best. He was a trooper who worked hard to become even greater and more heroic than his teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t have stumbled into better help! All you had to do was get his attention and you\u2019d be set. Just had to figure out how you would get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out, though, that you didn\u2019t have to. Keldeo was already scanning the ground and, before you even tried to get his attention, his eyes locked onto you. The determined look on his face morphed into a reassuring smile as your gazes met. Stepping back a little, he made enough room between you two so that he could settle down onto his front legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that you were in a precarious situation, but you were honestly ecstatic right now. Keldeo was pretty much your favorite legendary Pok\u00e9mon! And he was here, right in front of you! If you were normal size, you\u2019d probably have gone crazy petting his mane or something. Right now, all you could do was give an admiring stare to the giant, which made him blush a little when he noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the slight embarrassment didn\u2019t stop him from doing what he came here for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI knew I sensed someone in trouble nearby. You don\u2019t have to worry anymore, I\u2019m here to help!\u201d</span> He reassured you in a telepathic\u2026 feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Are you a girl!?\u201d You instinctively blurted out, a lot less tactfully than you would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo\u2019s reassuring smile shrank into a neutral expression and she let loose a long sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhy does every human ask me that?\u201d</span> She rolled her eyes dismissively. \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">I mean, honestly, what\u2019s so weird about me being a girl?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that it was a rhetorical question, but you figured you had to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-there\u2019s nothing weird about you being a girl!\u201d You said hastily, \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 all the stories I was told about you said that you were a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI hear that a lot too.\u201d</span> She noted a bit sourly, <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBut why do all the stories say I\u2019m a boy? Girls can want to be brave heroes too. ...Is it because a lot of me is blue?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh- probably?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cVirizion never has this problem. Maybe I should ask her for tips. I shouldn\u2019t really care about this, but-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry if I offended you!\u201d You interrupted Keldeo. \u201cYou\u2019re like my favorite legendary Pok\u00e9mon, so I really hope I didn\u2019t make you angry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your apology made Keldeo smile and chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Like I said, I hear it a lot. You don\u2019t have to lie about me being your favorite legendary.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie though. You really are awesome! The way you train under three other legendaries, trying to become stronger and more heroic than them is so cool! You\u2019re inspiring!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo just chuckled dismissively. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWow, you\u2019re really laying it on thick. But I appreciate the compliments.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kind of wanted to convince the legendary that she really was your favorite, just to show how much you admired her, but decided to drop it for now. If she was here to help you, then you\u2019d have plenty of time to sing her praises later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you here to help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo looked at you with a puzzled expression and tilted head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cUm, yeah. I just told you that I sensed you needed help.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, you were looking like a dork in front of your favorite legendary! It hardly mattered, but the idea upset you. You just had to try and play it cool right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right. I\u2019m just really overwhelmed right now. I never thought I\u2019d meet you. And if I did, I never thought I\u2019d be smaller than your hooves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYes, I imagine that being so small is quite overwhelming.\u201d</span> Keldeo noted. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBut do not fear. Your gallant musketeer is here to keep you safe and near.\u201d</span> She said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 what\u2019s up with the rhyming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 something I thought I\u2019d try.\u201d</span> Keldeo sounded a bit embarrassed. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMaybe make it a catch phrase or something? Ah-I don\u2019t know, still working on it.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made you smile. It really made her sound like the inexperienced rookie she apparently was. One thing about her was obvious, she was seriously eager to help people. She had come to your help some quickly, it was almost like you had never been left alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your simple question, Keldeo giggled and said nothing. You waited patiently for her to say something, but she never did. You just stared and waited for her to tell you her plan. After some more silence, Keldeo began to silently avoid your gaze. Something was clearly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeldeo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess chuckled nervously before looking at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

You can\u2019t keep up with her and you don\u2019t want to slow down her search.{ \u201cI guess... go ahead and look around the area. I\u2019ll wait under that tree okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNope, won\u2019t do.\u201d</span> Keldeo said as she turned to you. Moving down and lowering her head to the ground. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cClimb on.\u201d<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cClimb on, i\u2019m not leaving you alone for a second. You are staying with your favourite.\u201d</span> Keldeo said as she did kind of like that. Being your favourite that is. You of course go ahead and climb her. You feel a bit weird stepping on her, but it didn\u2019t mean you hated it. You got right on top and rested down right on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... for a second though, until she turned her head and moved it. This caused you to fall right back and down her head. You land on her back, right on her bright mane as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><br>\r\n\u201cSorry, thought you would be better there. Hold on, i\u2019m gonna be moving fast.\u201d </span>Keldeo said looking at you. You listen and grab the fur, as she got moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo was a literal saint to you in the moment, something to care for you and help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNothing.\u201d</span> Keldeo said. She saw which direction you pointed to where Mew went, and even with her speed... it was useless. She saw no legendary. Heaps of Pokemon but no legendaries. She was right now looking out into the forest on top of a hill. She could see the city not so far away. If Mew went in there, she could hide... Keldeo could not.<span class=\"clblue\"><span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cYou okay back there?\u201d</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping her fur as you could as you were giving her a thumbs up. \u201cY-Yeah. Riding a legendary it\u2019s... something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked about this and looked forward. \u201cOkay, chasing Mew isn\u2019t gonna be easy.\u201d She jumped back.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cSo I guess... well don\u2019t expect this to be a quick thing.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got no response, as she turned her head. Laughing \u201c<span class=\"clblue\">Are you... seriously cuddling with my mane?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What!\u201d you say to her. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s soft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t sure if you knew how much that touched her heart, but the brave Pokemon wasn\u2019t going to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d You question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell, I could go and find a psychic, that could probably help you.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA psychic Pokemon?\u201d You add. \u201cWell, i\u2019d be up for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWe could keep looking up for Mew, but that\u2019s gonna be hard. All we gotta do is find her though, and she will grow you.\u201d </span>Keldeo said as she raised a good point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... she forced this game on me, and I forced this on you.\u201d You say to her.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><span class=\"clblue\"><br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d </span>Keldeo said. \u201cI wanna help you. Now, what else? I know, so Terrakion told me about this place overseas, that have giant Pokemon!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right... Galor, but... how will you get there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI\u2019m a legendary, I got my ways.\u201d</span> She said calming you down. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo what will it be?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to me?\u201d You question her. \u201cI think it should be up to you, you are taking charge aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, she blushed. You have that much faith in her, she can\u2019t help but smile.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cW-Well... if I get a choice, I think our best course of action my little human, will be _________\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat there in complete silence and disbelief for a little while, your brain trying to process what had just happened; Mew, one of the most powerful Pokemon ever, so rare that she was believed to be a myth, had appeared in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the amount of power she supposedly possessed, her personality matched her looks: playful, cute and... mischievous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou abruptly returned to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pesky pink fiend had shrunken you down to the size of a blade of grass and had took off, leaving you behind in a patch of said grass, near Undella Town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now you were stuck like this, tiny and alone and- and what was this sound?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Huh?\" you left your thoughts, looking around for the source of the sound that had penetrated your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was faint, but you could distinctly hear it, probably because of your now more sensible hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than just a sound, it was like... a song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you stood up, momentarily putting your size-related issues aside to listen carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, someone was indeed singing a tune, though it was nothing you had ever heard before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beautiful, harmonious, you would even dare to say... heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, almost like hypnotized by the music, you began walking, following the song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted- no, you <i>needed</i> to find its source. You needed to know what was producing such beautiful music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even knew it, you had exited the patch of grass you had been left in by Mew and were traveling to find the source of the song, having forgotten about everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked for a while; your new stature certainly didn't help shorten the distance, but it didn't matter to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music's volume grew each step you took. Despite everything, you weren't completely enthralled by the music: you thought about turning back several times, but the desire to discover what was producing the music was too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, eventually, driven by that same desire of yours, you reached a tall tree, not that far from where you had begun your little trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music came from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, you discovered looking up, from a Pokemon that was sitting on the lower branches, singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the green-haired Pokemon singing, a black, fingerless hand resting on its chest and the other held in the air, its white legs hanging from the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though most of your mind was focused on admiring the Pokemon, a small part of it was still working; you felt like you were in a dream when realization dawned on you and you discovered that you actually recognized this Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, it was another legendary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out an audible gasp; the music stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo legendaries in the same day!? People would probably kill to be in your place!... Or maybe not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed back at Meloetta, only to discover that it was no longer singing, and was instead gazing back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at each other for a short amount of time. Then, you realized that you were still tiny and that a giant Pokemon with unknown intentions and a supposedly tremendous power had you in its sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the moment you thought about fleeing, you felt your legs leaving the ground, your body enveloped in a faint blue glow that rose you higher and higher in the air, until you reached the astonished face of the gigantic Meloetta, who pointed its glowing light blue eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long moment passed, until the green-haired legendary... spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">... Are you a human?</span>\" it asked, perfectly understandable and in a feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you found yourself replying with another question, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wait, you're a girl?\" you asked, remembering this legendary was supposed to be genderless, like most other; despite its looks, it had never gotten close enough for people to determine its gender, but Meloetta was apparently a 'she'. And a pretty annoyed one, too, you judged from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">What kind of question is that? Of course I'm a girl!</span>\" she protested, her voice now raised a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped to attention, realizing you had just angered a legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm sorry! It's just that people believe...\" you paused. How were you supposed to explain to her that you initially believed she wasn't a 'she', nor a 'he'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Meloetta picked up on your line of thinking, because, in a less annoyed tone, she asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Do I look like a boy?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly didn't. And she didn't sound like one, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt microscopic under her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing furiously, you lowered your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" you meekly apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green-haired giantess contemplated you for a moment, before she let out a low sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">It's alright,</span>\" she accepted the apology; she moved a hand beneath you as the psychic grip she still had on you vanished, causing you to fall in the middle of her hand,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">You really are a human, huh? Why are you so tiny though?</span>\" she asked, her annoyance replaced by curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reminded of the situation you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, that's... I woke up a while, and there was a Mew-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Mew?</span>\" Meloetta interrupted, wondering what would be Mew doing in Unova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny human on her hand nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, Mew. She started playing with me and then... she did this to me.\" you concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta blinked. Then, she spoke gently, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">That is... strange.</span>\" she simply said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Mew didn't live in one location like most legendaries did, and instead preferred to travel around, but shrink random people? Mew was playful, mischievous even at times, but this seemed a bit too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told me to go find her, but I, uh...\" you trailed off as you a thought ran through your mind; you began feeling excited as the hope that your problem could end as soon as it began settled in,<br>\r\n\"... But you're a legendary too, right? Then maybe you know how to help me, don't you? Can't you make me big again?... Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't really sure she could pull a trick like that, but she couldn't just leave you like this, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, she could do it... or, perhaps, there were other ways to help you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shrunk to the same extremely small size as you, most people would immediately start thinking about how they would find Mew. You, however, did not have that luxury because you were currently freezing! Without warning, the cold of Snowpoint City\u2019s locale bore into you and sent you into a shivering spree. Just moments ago you felt comfortable enough, but somehow the cold seems to have invaded your very being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflexively you wrap your arms around yourself in a vain attempt to stay warm. As you wrapped your freezing body with your equally freezing arms, you immediately figured out why you suddenly felt so cold. All of your snow gear was gone! The only thing protecting you from the cold was the clothes you wore everyday. Did Mew psychic your clothes away with you noticing? How could she expect you to find her like this!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-forget finding Mew. I t-think I\u2019m going to die before I-I can even find, ugh, anyone.\u201d You barely mumbled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe initial numbness of the cold wore off slightly, letting you feel the bundles of snow that were piling up on your body. You tried to swipe some of the stuff off of your back, but more quickly took its place. Your bare head now had a literal snow cap on it, and the feeling of numbness was returning to you before you even started to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would Mew do this? D\u2026did she even want me to find her? Or was that some kind of cruel taunt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill willing to try to avoid freezing to death, you began trudging forward through the snow. The snow on the ground barely registered to you when you had all your equipment, but now the stuff was nearly up to your waste. If you tripped, you\u2019d be falling into your coffin and the snow would bury you so deep it would be like you never existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I really\u2026 going to\u2026 die?\u201d You mumbled, now exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t understand how your body was losing energy so quickly. Yes, you were freezing and getting coated in snow, but surely you could last longer. You were a Pok\u00e9mon trainer after all! Sure you weren\u2019t incredible, but you\u2019ve won several badges and traveled through all kinds of conditions. You could be proud when you called yourself a trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour freezing face managed to grow pale. You were a trainer, and you had Pok\u00e9mon.  How would they feel when you didn\u2019t get back? What would they even think? Would they spend days worrying about you, before tearfully giving up? Or would they hate you, thinking you left them after all your time together? Just the idea made you start to tear up, if you had the energy to do so at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t die\u2026 out here.\u201d You thought. \u201cNot while those two are waiting for m-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted when\u2026 something collided with your back and forced you into the snow! But instead of being shoved into an icy coffin, it felt like you were covered by an amazing heated blanket! Somehow all of the bitter cold had disappeared, replaced with a comforting warmth. Too relieved by the sudden ambush of heat, you allow your body to go limp and relax. You laid on the snowy ground in silence for a while before you heard a comforting voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cGlaceon\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat soothing voice could only belong to one person, your Glaceon. That explained why you were so warm all of a sudden! Glaceon always had an ability to manipulate the cold, she had done it for you plenty of times to make your tent warmer at night. But now, at your reduced size, she seemed to have complete control over your body temperature! She just saved your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-your so warm.\u201d You mumble dumbly, unable to think of anything else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI thought I sensed that you were in trouble.\u201d</span></u> Glaceon muttered gently. <u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI\u2019m glad I could help.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are\u2026 so warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon breathed a sigh of relief as you drifted off to sleep. She wasn\u2019t sure how you managed to sleep, but she was glad you were alive regardless. Right now, she was extra grateful that she\u2019d gotten so good with controlling temperature. She might have never realized there was an issue if she hadn\u2019t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cGrace, *awch*! Where\u2019d yo- you g*awch*?\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace ignored the familiar voice, working on moving you to her back without disturbing you. It took a bit of effort, and some awkward distorting of her neck and back, but she eventually managed to deposit you on her back. Grace knew that she should be super concerned about your new size, but right now she was focused on getting you somewhere naturally warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201c*Tsknt*! Ugh, stupid cold. I feel awful.\u201d</span></u> The voice from before complained. <u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cGrace, what are you doing?\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace turned around to face the voice that was behind her. The voice belonged to a Leafeon with a red shade around her nose, showing she was a bit under the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI was just-\u201d</span></u> Grace was cut off by a petite sneeze from the Leafeon. <u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI was just saving master from the cold.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cWhat do you-*Tsknt* mean? I don\u2019t see him, anywhere.\u201d</span></u> Leafeon noted confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cTake a look.\u201d</span></u> Grace said simply, turning slightly to show you resting near her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstounded, Leafeon brought her head in closer for a better look. Not believing what she saw, she blinked and shook her head, but you remained on Grace\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cOh my gosh! What happened to-*AWCH*!\u201d</span></u> The grass types exclamation of surprise was interrupted by her harshest sneeze yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon growled in utter rage and contempt, while Grace nonchalantly turned back to her normal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cStupid stupid cold! I hate the snow, I hate it! I\u2019m all stuffy, snotty, and gross, and I can\u2019t even be concerned about our trainer without getting inter\u2026 interruuuu, interruuu*pft*ed!\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked at her fellow Eeveelution with a smug smile. Honestly, she was super amused by the grass Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s cold. It made her sound funny and her getting irritated was a rare sight in any other circumstance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cWait, Rose, I just realized something.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cWhat, ugh, is it.\u201d</span></u> The Leafeon asked with a sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cThis whole time I\u2019ve known you, I thought just your ears and tail had that red tint on them. But I just realized some of your face is red too! I can\u2019t believe it took me so long to notice!\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose glared at her partner, her cheeks also becoming an irritated red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cHaha.\u201d</span></u> She laughed sarcastically. <u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cYou\u2019re a real comedian. Keep that up and I\u2019ll sneeze in your food.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace snickered and nodded her head forward, moving with Rose back towards Snowpoint City. She hoped she wouldn\u2019t ask too many questions, because she didn\u2019t have answers to any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t-\t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cSo we\u2019re taking him back to the Pok\u00e9mon Center?\u201d</span></u> Rose asked Grace as they walked through the snowy streets of Snowpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cThat\u2019s the plan. I can\u2019t keep him warm forever, we gotta get him somewhere safe and private so he can tell us what happened.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cOkay, that makes sense. But how are we going to get inside the Center without getting attention? We\u2019re kind of just two strays with our shrunken trainer on our back.\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201c...\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you didn\u2019t think of that!?\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cOf course I did!\u201d</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Then what *sniff* what's the plan?\"</span></u> Rose asked swiping a paw at her irritated nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\"It's simple. I'm going to have you trigger the motion sensing door, and then I'm going to blast the inside with Blizzard. Everyone inside will be too startled and distracted to notice us sprint to our room!\"</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\"That's *achoo* that's your plan?\"</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\"Do you got a better one?\"</span></u> Grace asked the Leafeon sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\"No.\"</span></u> Rose replied with a sniffle. <u><span class=\"cbgreen\">\"I guess that's what we gotta do.\"</span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"cteal\">\"Yep, we got no choice. Let's get going.\"</span></u></span></div></div>",
