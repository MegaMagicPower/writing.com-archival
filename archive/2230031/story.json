That damned school where the halls howled with the cries of murdered children was the only home you\u2019d ever nonetheless, providing you with food, education and shelter in between sessions of electrotherapy and the prodding and the poking that came afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were of a rare batch that\u2019d survived the experiments. Battered, bruised and filled with immeasurable seeds of rage and resent but alive still. Many years had passed with only five of you surviving into your teenage years. Who were you exactly? You\u2019d no idea who you\u2019d been before the facility but now you were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dean:</b> eighteen years of age, dependable and trustworthy yet hopelessly bland, de facto leader . Levelheaded but can quickly snap if he feels he or one of his \u2018brothers\u2019  is threatened. Not thick by any means but exceedingly naive and easy to manipulate. Reasonably tall and beefy like a rugby player, with a crooked nose and trimmed hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Edward:</b> seventeen years of age, headstrong, cocky with a quick wit and even quicker tongue. Too smart for his own good and as a result permanently bored and eager for some misadventures. A wily snake, one can never tell what he\u2019s thinking behind those black ghoulish eyes and cunning grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Andrew:</b> eighteen years of age, uncontrollable, unpredictable and batsh*t crazy. A thrill seeker to the core, Andrew has little qualms for possible consequences and chooses to live everyday as if it were his last (side effect of seeing so many around him perish day-to-day). Lanky and spider-like in mannerisms and appearance with crazy brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Daniel:</b> seventeen years of age, analytical and academic. Though he is easily Edward\u2019s equal, or even superior, he has little ambition for power or excitement, focusing rather on maintaining his extensive literary collection. Not much to look at, slightly podgy with circular wire-frames and slicked back hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Steven:</b> sixteen years of age, jittery, feeble, timid. Steven is the youngest and most vulnerable of the five teens. The experiments have left with him with little hope for the future and terrified to his very core. Also know for his distinctive nervous tick, exacerbated in tense moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s nonetheless looked up to by all the other girls and has an alarming amount of tolerance to pain. Dark-skinned with curly Afro hair and built like a woman many years her senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hannah:</b> seventeen years old, intelligent but with a sardonic sense of humour and elitist attitude that makes it hard to appreciate her intellect at times. Very cold and manipulating with more vulnerable specimen but can play nice with those she considers equals. Conservative appearance, straightened red hair with cute freckles &amp; smart glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Olivia:</b> sixteen years old, humorous, upbeat and peppy, much to the behest of her adopted \u2018sisters\u2019. Works hard to lift the spirits of the girls around her, often making herself the butt of jokes in order to cheer the others up (leading to some serious feelings of repressed anxiety under the surface). Average looks apart from the fact she\u2019s slightly rounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Samantha:</b> eighteen years old, both lustful and lithe, this nymphomaniac neither cares for the person nor their exterior, just as long as certain \u2018needs\u2019 are met. Possibly a side effect of the mental tampering. Not exceedingly pretty but sexual mannerisms, tones and a killer lower body make her a very popular person on campus indeed.</span></div></div>",
