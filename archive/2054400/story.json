She looks at the clock, it's 7:35am meaning she's already running late for work. Amber is an administration officer for the police force and normally starts at 9am after an hour commute by train. Amber walks out into the living room of her eleventh floor apartment, and can see Ben sitting on the couch she yells out \"What's up buddy!

After humming the Walking Dead theme song she smiles at her master piece of a breakfast, which is just a bowel of cereal. She grabs a spoon and hears shuffling behind her. \"Oh so now you've come to join me?\" she questions. Not turning around she starts eating, the sound of shuffling and now growling continues. She turns around thinking Ben is trying to be funny acting like a Zombie. By the time she turns around Ben is almost in her face. She notices his deathly complexation and yellow eyes. Amber screams as his hand comes down ripping her shirt clean off. \"Holy fuck oh my god, you're a!\" she screams as she staggers backwards. Her breasts fully on display jiggling as she moved backwards.</span></div></div>",

Hearing Ben moaning in the hallway, Amber panics and runs out the apartment door naked as the day she was born. Luckily, for her she has already washed all of the soap of her lovely, wet smooth skin. She runs out the door, and sees blood on the walls. She also sees three more of the undead walking towards her, eating body parts. Scared, she runs the other way down the hall but it dead ends. However, there is a laundry shoot on the wall, and she can fit through the open. Scared shitless, she jumps headfirst into the shoots, barely missing the undead, heading towards an unknown fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After zooming through the snake like shoot, she gently lands on some clean sheets. She grabs a white clean sheet, wraps it around herself, and heads out of the room. She a second room, an office really, and she looks out the window. She sees that the city is on fire, police and the military are everywhere fighting scared human crowds and the undead. Just then, she sees Alex\u2019s car pulling up to the apartment. She meant Alex four months ago at work, and one thing led to another, which led to a romantic relationship. She was about to dump Brad anyways, he treated her like crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Excited, Amber runs out of the office to Alex\u2019s car. Alex looks like a male model, and works as a firefighter. He is white, clean-shaven, in his 20\u2019s, with smooth tan skin, short brown hair, and blue eyes. He has a well-defined body, a hairless chest, and he is well hung, with a nice ass. Amber runs past some zombies, and humans, jumping into his car, still wearing the sheet. Alex smiles and says, \u201cLet me guess, a zombie caught you in the shower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Amber grins back saying, \u201cLet me guess, that happened to you too?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alex only has a towel wrapped around his waist, \u201cGee, how did you guess,\u201d he says grinning, \u201cNow let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the Alex speeds down the road, attempting to miss cars, humans, and zombies, Amber asks, \u201cTell me you grabbed some clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDidn\u2019t have time, I had some zombies on my ass,\u201d he says laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, one of the tires blows out, and Alex manages to stop in front of the botanical gardens. Basically, it\u2019s a huge glass dome, but the glass is really strong, it survived a tornado last year. The unbitten couple runs out of the car, and towards the glass dome. However, as luck would have it, Alex\u2019s towel falls off towards some approaching zombies, and one of the undead, a grinning boy grabs Amber\u2019s sheet pulling it off her lovely body. The now completely nude couple run to the door, and tries to get in, but the door is locked. Just then, Amber remembers the code to get inside the dome. It was given to the police in case of a break-in. As the heavy-duty glass door opens, the nude couple runs inside, and quickly closes the door behind them. After a quick rest, Alex has a look around, and comes back. Annoyed, he says, \u201cThe good news is we are safe and alone in here. Nobody else, dead or undead is inside. We also have plenty of food and water to last us for a long time. All of these weird green plants will give us fresh air to breath. The bad news is there are no clothes, or even sheets for us to wear, and we cannot go outside, there are a hundred zombies out there watching us right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDamn,\u201d Amber says, \u201ccan we use the plants for covering?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat would be a bad idea. Most of these plants will ether give you a bad rash similar poison ivy, or they have hallucinogenic qualities. If you wear them, you could get a really bad high,\u201d Alex says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI guess we stay naked,\u201d Amber says blushing, while wrapping her arms around her chest, and looking at the hundreds of the zombies looking at them. She could swore that some of the male zombies are sporting woodies. Next\u2026</span></div></div>",

Not giving up she then races over to next door repeating the process, her unsupported breasts shaking around. She keeps trying, far down from her room now. Suddenly the door she is banging on hurls open. Amber stumbles forward and is faced straight down the barrow of a gun. \"Wait stop I'm human don't shoot me!\" A terrified Amber screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man's voice says \"You won't be for long with all that noise\". He then holsters his gun. A figure appearing behind him. Amber goes to point out the figure but the man reacts anyway. He pulls out his knife, turns around and stabs the figure in the head. Amber lets out a small shriek but quickly put her hand over head mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick follow me, it's not safe here anymore\"<br>\r\nHe snaps and races past her down towards the lifts. Amber quickly races behind and watches the lift light up that it's about to open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors open and the lift is full of zombies. The man grabs his gun and starts to dispatch them with ease. \"You're a good shot...\" says a shaken Amber but the man only nods and enters the lift holding it open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe selects the car park level and they descend not saying a word with bodies surrounding them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door open and it looks clear the man steps out first and it instantly taken surprise by a zombie, he still has his gun and shoots the zombie point blank. The zombie's head explodes splattering blood all over Amber. Amber doesn't time to react to her now bloody clothes (or lack thereof). \"Quick my car is over there\" say he man as he points throwing his keys to Amber. Amber catches the keys looking back at the man. \"You want me to drive?\" She says. The man replies \"can you shoot? Probably be better if you drive and I shot yeah?\" Amber nods as the hurry by to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber gets to the car and hears a yell behind her. The man is caught by a zombie he tries to shoot but his gun won't fire. \"Get in there now!\" He yells fighting off the zombie trying to reach for his knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber tries the car, it's an old Cadillac. The key won't work. \"Smash the window dammit!\" Amber had no choice, there nothing to smash the widow with her bare hands so she pulls her shirt off exposing her medium sized breasts, a chill of embarrassment comes over, but the man is to preoccupied to notice still struggling with the zombie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wraps her shirt around her hands smashing the windows after a few blows. As she is about to pull her shirt on a zombie grabs it and starts to use it as leverage to pull her in. Amber snuggles pulling back to her shirt back. \"Leave it! For fuck sake let go!\" Amber looks shocked and let's go, the force knocks the zombie back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber hears a loud yell and turns to see the man get bit by the zombie, falling to the ground. \"No!\" She screams. She gets herself together as the other zombie state to approach her again. Amber runs to the car puts her hand through and unlocks the door hoping straight in slamming the door and turning the ignition. The car comes to life and she puts her foot on the accelerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few near misses the topless Amber reaches the exit crashing through the boom gates. Outside she is confronted with a world on fire, zombies walking the streets, screams in the distance. </span></div></div>",

Papers, a huge pile of unpaid parking tickets, and a pair of scissors.  Checking in the back seat, she found several old magazines and a moldy ski mask.  Hopping outside to pop the trunk, Amber hoped desperately for a shirt, or something she could use as clothing, her only wearing her blue and white striped panties, nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up the trunk, she saw what looked like a shirt!  Pulling it out, she held it up and saw that it was a 'wife beater' tank top, \"Better than nothing.\"  She muttered to herself as she slipped it on, only to find that it was a few sizes too small.  Because of her breasts, the shirt only came down to just above her belly button, and the shirt was thin enough it was practically see-through.  Digging through the rest of the trunk, she managed to find a crowbar, but no footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to see what I can find.\" Amer said to herself a sister she continued her trek out and away from the city.

Readying her crowbar, Amber headed through the trees, carefully looking for any zombies that could sneak up on her.  Coming to a clearing, she saw a swarm of zombie shooting tearing apart a house, scratch that, several houses.  The entire neighborhood in front of her was being destroyed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I'm surviving <b>that</b>.\" She muttered to herself, looking for any other survivors, but not finding any.

She watched as the horde just about leveled everything between them and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning and starting up her sprint again, Amber felt a quick tug at her panties before it disappeared, deciding that she'd worry about it later she kept on running, checking over her shoulder once more before she fell into a free fall.

Turning the corner to where she knew the shopping centers were, she'd hoped to begin looting supplies to survive, but it seemed that's this had the greatest concentration of undead wanderers.  Turning a quick 180, ignoring how her braless breasts swung and bounced freely, she ran until she found herself at what's appeared to be an untouched Pancake Place, the yellow signs lights were off, but the building was otherwise untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously stepping inside the restaurant, she listened carefully for any zombies in the building, not hearing anything, she crept inside, her heart pounding in her chest as she inched her way along to the bar.  Slowly looking over, she was relieved that it was devoid of any undead, and a quick check in the bathrooms confirmed the same thing.  Empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Amber said as she looked around, gently tugging her shirt downward over her bush, but failing to do so due to how short it was, \"I might as well get some food.\"  As quietly as she could, she began gathering the various food items from behind the bar and making breakfast, this one act of normality helping to calm her nerves, and allow her to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!  Lucky find!\"  She said as she pulled out a chefs belt, complete with a knife and knife holder, strapping it on, she finished cooking her breakfast, surprised but relieved that she wasn't discovered by any zombies while cooking.  Sitting her bare bottom down on one of the bar stools, she dug into her eggs, pancakes, and bacon, planning out where she could go next.</span></div></div>",

A quick swing at the former Ms. Walsh's head drops the zombie to the ground.

Inching down the alleyway, she cautiously peaked down both sides of the street, and saw that while the block had been pretty much destroyed, the dollar store seemed to be fairly intact, and as a bonus, the street was deserted.  That didn't mean she moved carelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving as quietly as possible, her bare feet inched their way over the rubble, and Amber had her hands at the ready, prepped to defend herself should anyone try to grapple with her.  After what was perhaps the most stressful crossing the street that's she'd ever done, Amber made it to the dollar store, tiptoeing into the store, she saw that it'd been alomost completely stripped bare, only a few items still on the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up and down the aisles, she found an abandoned hatchet and belt in the outdoors aisle.  Strapping the belt on, she sighed as she realized that to keep the hatchet quickly accessible, she'd have to wear the belt over her shirt, which meant that her butt and crouch would be permanently exposed until she found something to wear for her lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it'll have to do for now.\"  Amber said to herself as she looked for the food section.  Eventually, she found the food section, but there was a zombie eating what appeared to be an employee of the store, thankfully the zombie had its back to her.  Mentally prepping herself, Amber grabbed her hatchet and inched her way to the zombie, and once she was close enough, she swung the hatchet as deep into the skull as she could make it.  The zombie struggled, trying to get to her, but she held on to her hatchet, doing her best to stay behind the zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the zombies hands managed to grab her shirt, and in thinking it had a hold of whoever was attacking it, the zombie pulled with all its might, ripping the top half of the shirt clean off Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  Amber yelled, her face almost as red as her hair, \"That was my last shirt you undead freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her hatchet out of its head, she struck the zombie repeatedly in the head until it stopped moving.  Standing there breathing heavily, she groaned at her current state of undress.  Looking over a tweet the employee, she saw that his apron was entirely blood free, a little dirty form the dust and rubble, but otherwise clean.  Taking the apron off the employee, she took her hatchet belt off and remover the pitiful remains of her shirt, before donning the apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately by some ridiculous means, the rest of his clothing was completely blood covered or ruined by rips and tears, forcing Amber to only wear the apron until she found something else.  Sliding her belt and hatchet back on, she looked at her outfit, glad that her crotch was now covered, but the top of the apron was too narrow, meanin that's her breasts hung out in the open on either side, and not to mention that her butt was still hanging in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing at a time Amber, one thing at a time...\"  She said to herself as she grabbed a can of tuna and popped it open.  Grimacing at the strong fish smell, she remembered that's she didn't really have a choice anymore, and, reluctantly ate the tuna for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Moving cautiously and carefully through the aisles, she found that practically all the clothing on the rack was either already taken by the people who'd looted the place, or bloodied by some poor unfortunate soul or zombie when all this was going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard a display fall to the ground at the back of the store, followed by groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her hatchet, Amber inched her way to the back of the store, intent on killing the zombie so that she'd be safe to look for more supplies.  Peeking around the corner, she saw a female zombie wearing what looked like a very bloody business suit shambling around by the cleaning products.  As Amber made a move to get closer, she accidentally knocked a tissue box off the shelf, and the sound got the zombie's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow moving as fast as it could (at a moderately paced shuffle), the zombie headed in Amber's direction, startled by the box, and losing her nerves, Amber let out a squeak of fear and ran in the other direction.  Going as fast as she could without hurting her feet on something sharp or hard, Amber moved down the aisle, her exposed breasts bouncing with each little skip and hop over debris, the bottom of the apron occasionally flying up to expose her red bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Amber rounded a corner, she remembered that she had her hatchet, and she held her hatchet high, ready to end the zombie threat that threatened her life.  Once the zombie rounded the corner, Amber brought the hatchet down on its neck, severing the spine but not cleaving the head off, and the zombie dropped to the ground.  It was then she noticed that the zombie blood had practically congealed, meaning there was no splatter when she killed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting little detail.\"  Amber said as she brought her hatchet down on the struggling zombie.  Two quick strikes and the zombie was dead.  Taking a deep breath, she decided to check the back where the zombie came from, if there was another way out, it would be nice to know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way in the back, Amber saw several boxes of cereal lying in the hall, and a service door in the back.  Peeking outside, she ensured that nothing was around and closed the door, locking it firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least now I don't have to worry about zombies from behind.\"  Amber said as she headed back to the front of the store.  She did find a Dora the Explorer backpack as she looked around, but aside from that, no other clothing that she could wear.  Stuffing as much food as she could (which given the small size of the backpack, wasn't much) and a roll of toilet paper in the backpack, and headed for the entrance of the dollar store, hatchet in hand, breasts swinging freely, and her butt jiggling with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out front, she saw a pair of zombies down the street, but if she was sneaky, she probably could get by them unnoticed, alternatively, she could try out the backdoor and see if it was clear, but there was no promise that the zombies out front would be far away enough from the store to still make it unseen if she changed her mind...</span></div></div>",

Inching her way down the street, our practically naked heroine managed to evade being spotted by the pair of undead up the road, but she knew from her experience in watching the Walking Dead and her (ex)boyfriends zombie movies that shelter was a must to protect oneself from zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way down the next block, she was a little but astonished at how empty the street was, in such a large city, there should be packs of zombies wandering the streets, or at least other survivors, where were---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's train of thought was derailed as she saw a block full of zombies begin to walk down the next road, dropping to a crouch behind a nearby car, she peeked carefully over the hood of the car to see that the zombies hadn't noticed her.  Looking back however, didn't give her much hope, the pair of zombies that's she'd avoided earlier had followed her, and if she wasn't careful, her adventure would be over before it really began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her right, she saw a reason estate building with the door open, and deciding that being in there was better than delaying with a massive horde, she quietly slipped inside and locked the door behind her.  Once inside, she began a thorough search of the building, leaving no room unsearched.  The buisiness floor was empty, but what about upstairs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInching her way up the stairs, she felt her heart stop when she stepped on a squeaky step, and froze, listening for any zombies that were moving around.  Not hearing anything, she continued upstairs, and opened the first door she came across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmpty, just a bathroom.  Next room then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmpty, a kitchen.  Next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZombie!  Swinging her hatchet down on the shoulder of the zombie, Amber knocked the zombie over and as she brought the hatchet down on it again, it reached up and tore the apron off her, which sent her stumbling back in the hall, knocking the breath out of her as she landed on her back.  Laying spread eagle on the floor, the redhead scrambled back after catching her breath, getting space between herself and the zombie crawling after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding courage and strength in her fear, she got on her feet and ran toward the zombie, kicking it across the head, seemingly stunning it while she brought the hatchet done over and over and over again on the undead beast that surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sure it was dead, Amber shakily got up, the adrenaline and fear highenting her senses and making her heart pound in her chest.  Inching back into the room, she saw it was just a bedroom, and a closet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging the door open, she was disappointed to see that it was empty, but she started searching the dressers still in the room.  She did find a pair of socks and tennis shoes, but they were too small, so she settles for the sandals she found that had been brushed under the bed.  And in the other dresser, she found a singlet t-shirt, but man, if it wasn't the apocalypse she'd never wear this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Hello Kitty t-shirt that was a good bit too small, coming down to about 2 inches above her belly button, and was way too baggy to offer her breasts any support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does the universe hate me?\"  Amber groaned to herself as she looked at herself in the mirror, braless, with a too-small shirt, a Dora backpack, and sandals.  \"Some zombie survivor outfit.\"  She said, lamenting that's she'd never found a pair of wearable pants or panties since this whole mess started, leaving her lower half permanently exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that the building was a good place to hole up for the rest of the day while she took everything that she could use from it, she dragged the zombie body out back and locked the door.  She also closed all the blinds and locked all the windows on the first floor, before finally deciding to take a nap and figure out what to do later.</span></div></div>",

As she scrolled through, she was astonished at how much had gone down, no radio, she left her phone in her apartment, and the landline here worked, but no one was picking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually on channel 3, she saw a program working.  The news Anchor was sitting at her desk topless, the studio logo placed crookedly over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Lily Kwan with what's left of the Channel 3 staff, and I'm letting you know that if you make to the broadcast tower on the northern end of town, we are here, not much of us, but we are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheering, Amber danced a bit in the kitchen, glad that's she wasn't alone, but at that moment, the power cut out.  Sighing, Amber decided to finally grab lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a pack of deli turkey from the fridge and some bread, she made a simple turkey sandwich, and decided to observe the zombies, to get a better idea of what she was dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window, she saw that the zombies were wandering around in small groups, no more than four, no less than two, and none of them seemed capable of fast movement, either stumbling around slowly or crawling if they couldn't.  Nodding to herself, Amber realized that's it'd be best if she cut her hair, it was fairly long, and the least thing she needed was to get it caught by a zombie's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her sandwich, she headed over to the bathroom and found a pair of scissors and roughly cut her hair into a pixie cut, her hair not going any further than her jaw.  As she walked down the hall, she thought she heard something stumble around downstairs, drawing her hatchet, she creeped over to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"  Amber called out, hoping it was a fellow survivor, \"Anyone there?\"</span></div></div>",

But as she placed a piece of broken table against her window barricade, she heard a *ssshhhrrriiiiiip!*, looking down, her shirt had been torn in half, exposing her C-cups to the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ssshhhrrriiiiiip!* She heard from behind, looking over, she saw Lilly holding a now torn in two tank top, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly,\" Amber asked, trying to remain calm, \"why'd you just rip your shirt in half?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said to be like you, so I am!\"  Lilly said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I said...never mind!\" Amber continued to build her defenses in silence, with a bit more force than what was probably needed, all the while trying to figure out if staying with Lilly was a good decision in the long run.  But, she was able to finish her work in peace, and Lilly did find enough food for the both of them before laying on the improvised beds that were the booths built into the walls.  And the two naked girls drifted off to a restless night.</span></div></div>",

Terrified of the thing Ben had become, she realized that her safest bet was to find her buildings security.   Problem was, the security was on the ground floor and the elevator was slow.  <br>\r\n  \"Screw it,\" Amber thought, \"It'll be safer than out in the open.\"<br>\r\nAs she made her way from her apartment, Amber could hear a loud pounding coming from inside. It grew louder and louder as she came closer to the elevator.  \"Shit!\" She thought to herself, \"Ben's still that crazy thing.\"  <br>\r\n       She kept pressing the elvevator call button faster and faster as the pounds grew harder and faster.  Amber was on edge from only being in a white shirt and her blue and white striped panties.  The lack of cover made her feel even more like prey.<br>\r\n        The elevator had finally reached her after a few more seconds of dread.  However when she entered the worst possible thing happened, Ben had broke down the door and was rabidly charging after Amber.  \"Shit! Shit! Shit!\" Amber exclaimed.  Ben moved mindlessly at his prey, not carrying about their previous relationship<br>\r\n       Right as he was nearly a foot away from Amber the elevator doors shut, preventing Amber from being his next meal.<br>\r\n      Amber was terrified, the tragedy of the moments prior had finally hit her as she crouched down in the right corner of the elevator.  \"He's gone, he really is gone,\" Amber thought.  Ben was her rock, how could she go on with out him.  <br>\r\n     Suddenly the elevator stopped right before the security office.  \"What the hell!\"  Amber shouted.  The redhead than remembered how the elevator never was reliable before.  Good news was that the top of the elevator had a hatch to evacuate from.  Bad news was that somebody or something began pounding on the door.  Amber had to decide how the hell  she's going to get out of this</span></div></div>",
