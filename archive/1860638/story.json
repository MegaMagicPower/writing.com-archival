The other looks like spider but it wasn't just a spider his upper body looks humanoid and the lower part of his body is a immense spider, Tyler's eyes widened it couldn't be, it was a drider. A creature from the video game dungeons and dragons, the drider's body was covered in black fur from head to toe, his humanoid half had four arms and three fingers, his face had four eyes, his mouth was full of sharp teeth and fangs, both monster's stood the same height like around 200 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and saw a group of anthro dinosaur's on the right there were four of them,  one a T-Rex, one a spinosaurus, one a triceratops, the tallest one was the brontosaurus.

As his foot lifted to take another step it left behind a crater shaped foot print, as Nargacuga passed by you looked up his backside you saw his tail swishing from side to side and below his tail made you blush slightly, he had quite a bubble butt as they giggled from every step he took, \"damn he's thick\" you blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about following him or you can stay and observe the other monster's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little thought to yourself, you decide.</span></div></div>",
