He has four arms, wings, two digitigrade legs, larg abdomen like stinger. The other looks like spider but it wasn't just a spider his upper body looks humanoid and the lower part of his body is a immense spider, Tyler's eyes widened it couldn't be, it was a Drider. A Centaur like creature from the video game dungeons and dragons, but this was no dark elf/drow, this drider was different his whole body was covered in black fur, his humanoid half had four arms and three fingers, his face had four eyes, his mouth was full of sharp teeth and fangs, both monster's stood the same height like around 200 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and saw a group of anthro dinosaur's on the right there were four of them,  one a T-Rex, one a spinosaurus, one a triceratops, the tallest one was the brontosaurus.

Others were Anthropomorphic animals, mythical creatures, and all kinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You dive back down into the bushes, the site of these giant creatures were fascinating, suddenly the ground started to shake and hear a loud thudding crashing sound then a large shadow engulfs the bushes you ware in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peak out of the bushes and saw?</span></div></div>",

But this one wasn\u2019t the one you recognize from the video games, this one had slight changes. It had dark blue-ish fur and his underbelly was white, his pointy ears were a little longer kinda bat like, wings on his arms, his body shape was slim a little athletic, and it was definitely a male as you can see his sheath and balls between his legs. You looked up at his face, the expression on his face looked calm/relaxed with a small closed smile, I can say that he looked quite...(attractive)... for a monster at least in your opinion. You were so amazed by this giant anthro wyvern, you didn't even realize the fact that he was heading directly towards your direction. His giant scaly feet was making the ground shake with loud crashing thuds...THUD...THUD...THUD...you snapped back into reality, but it was to late as nargacuga already had his giant foot right above you. Time seemed to stand still for a moment as you can see and observe every detail of the foot's underside, it looked firm/calloused to a degree but still looked strangely soft with small wrinkles, and slightly dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time returned to normal, the giant foot slowly continued downward's towards the bush you were hiding in, in fear of being crushed you dive Back into the bush, arms above your head and closed you\u2019re eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait for your immediate death, you hear a loud crashing THUD and the ground shook on impact, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened you\u2019re eyes surprised you weren\u2019t crushed, you peaked out of the bush and looked forward and saw that the side of narga\u2019s foot has landed several feet across from you. As his foot lifted up to take another step it left behind a deep foot print, You gasp for breath as you were lucky you didn\u2019t end up crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nargacuga continued walking passed you, Looking up at his backside you saw his tail swishing from side to side and below his tail was his well sculpt bubble butt, <br>\r\nyou couldn't help but blush a little as you stare at those perfectly round cheeks of his \"damn he's thick\" you blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a choice to follow after nargacuga or you can stay and observe the other monster's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n you chose?</span></div></div>",
