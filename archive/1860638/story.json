You recognize the monster as the \"Nargacuga\" a wyvern from one of your favorite the video games \"Monster hunter\", as you examine him more, he looked slightly more humanoid his body shape was slim a little athletic, between his legs was his sheath and balls, the 200 foot tall giant Narga started to look around and sniff the air as you stayed hidden. As you watched him for at least a minute, you saw the giant Narga turn the other direction and start walking away, as he did so you saw the view of his tail swaying from side to side as he walked, but what got most of your attention was his impressively large rear. You couldn't help but blush as you watch his glutes jiggle with each step he took as he walked further away, \"damn he's thicc\" you blurted out, you thought about following him, but was it a good idea to chase after a giant beast like that?. there's was no telling what the Nargacuga could of done to you if he spotted you, you could stay and explore the rest of the island or you could follow after the Nargacuga, after a little time of thought you decide. </span></div></div>",
