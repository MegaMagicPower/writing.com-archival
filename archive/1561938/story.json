You long for action, battles, becoming the strongest pokemon ever! That was the life you want. You wish that one day a trainer would come up and catch you in a pokeball, then train you and go on adventures. You often fantasize about taking on the pokemon league and becoming a champion, meeting the hundreds of kinds of pokemon from all over the world, a life of adventure, a life of things that were never the same...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was just a dream, no trainer would ever catch you. No humans never came to this forest in fear of the large amounts of predator pokemon who wouldn't think twice before eating a human. You sigh and sit up, somehow you feel today will be a day of adventure.</span></div></div>",

You lived in a small cave underwater that had an air pocket, it was pretty roomy, and the grass that you had formed a nest out of made it comfortable too. Nobody else knew about your little cave, so it was your safe haven for hiding for any preds that you would meet. But right now you were hungry, so you couldn't keep hiding here and had to go to the forest to stock up on berries again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dived into the water towards the exit to the cave, the coldness of the water perking you up quite a bit, you bent your body and used your two tails to propel yourself forward, then broke through the thick coat of algae that served as a door to keep your home well hidden, then you inflated the sack on your neck with the air you had stored in your mouth and floated to the surface. You jumped out of the cold water onto the shore of the lake, then shook the water out of your fur and continued on into the forest.</span></div></div>",

A quick movement from the corner of its eye caused it to turn its head, and there it saw a buizel running across the forest floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a usual species around here,\" the tropuis said to itself, \"This may be worth my while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tropius got up, and followed the buizel that it saw in the distance.</span></div></div>",

She was stunned for a few seconds but as soon as she felt muscles pulling her backwards she panicked and tried to run forwards, but the throat had a hold on one of her tails and was quickly sucking her in, with the tongue pushing her face back too. She desperately tried to breathe fire on the tongue, but it seemed to have no effect, so all she could do was squirm and struggle as the tight confines of the throat sucked her deeper into the predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--x--x--x--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonair haddecided that the vulpix would be a delicious morsel to have as a snack, so he started so circle around her in the water, darting around in the shadows, waiting to strike. The prey was unsuspecting, and would be an easy meal. He came up behind her, and turned his direction towards her, locked on to his target, jaws open, nothing could stop him now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...except that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonair veered off his course in surprise as a huge feraligatr swam up and caught the vulpix in its jaws in an instant.

It was up around her stomach now and she could feel the rippling throat muscles at her hindpaws, pulling her further in. She began to be pushed down faster, and felt more of her fur getting sticky and wet with saliva. She felt a movement as the predator eating her lifted up its head. Soon only her face and muzzle was still in the mouth, she was panicking even more now now, she looked out at the says of sunlight through the massive and sharp teeth, the last of daylight she would see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all she saw was pink as her whole body was squeezed in the tight confines of a throat. She desperately tried to scratch the sides, do something to end this, but nothing was working. She felt a finger pressing on her from the outside, and a muffled voice that sounded like \"Mmmurrrrrr\" This sent her into another fit of wriggling and trying to twist her body around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, she passed through a ring of muscle and felt most of the tightness disappear. She realized that she was being deposited into the beast's stomach. She felt her whole body being sucked into the wet sack and kicked and squirmed as much as she could. As soon as her head was out she begin to writhe around and wriggle at full force, trying to get whoever ate her to spit her out. She soon became exhausted, and stopped her attacks, laying down. She felt the stomach move all around constantly, the walls contracting. She got up again, ready for another attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--x--x--x--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonair watched enviously while the feraligatr swallowed its prey down, tracing the wriggling bulge down its throat with its finger, and murring all the while. The dragonair's eyes narrowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was supposed to be MY vulpix,\" He thought angrily, \"That feraligatr has no right to take whats mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonair's eyes followed the bulge the vulpix made down the feraligatr, where it dissapeared in the chest are and reappeared on the belly. The feraligatr smiled and rubbed its belly a bit, then it casually swam out of the pond, and walked into the forest surrounding it. Little did it know that it was being followed.</span></div></div>",

He had no idea that another pokemon was moving through the underbrush behind him, plotting an attack. He smiled to himself, quite pleased with himself for catching a nice midnight snack, and stalked into a nearby cave. He looked around, noticing that nothing had been disturbed in the time he was gone, and settled down on a sleeping bag that he had stolen from a newbie trainer that had screamed and ran at the first sight of him. He closed his eyes and tried to sleep, but he couldn't seem to when there was another pokemon inside him, he just decided to enjoy the feeling of the wriggling in his stomach before the vulpix tired itself out and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--x--x--x--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonair snaked through the grass, being sure to not let the feraligatr out of its sight. He moved to the side of the dirt path and slithered up a tree, coiling around one of the branches. He watched as the feraligatr changed course and settled down in a cave directly across from the tree. Dragonair quickly moved down from the tree and kept low as he moved towards a bush at the front of the cave and settled there. It closed its eyes and thought of ways it would get revenge in the morning when it could see, and at the same time trying to get itself to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--x--x--x--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulpix desperately tried to bite and claw at the stomach around her, only to see that the walls absorbed all her attacks. She angrily bashed her head against it, breathed fire on it, nothing worked. She was beginning to wear out, and she tried one last attack, a flamethrower, but the fire only illuminated the squishy pink stomach for a second before going out from the hot humidness of the water type's stomach. She slumped over, and whimpered a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was going to die in there, or at least thought, as she felt no liquids enter the chamber she was is, felt no burning sensation around her, heard no gurgling and grumbling sounds that a stomach usually makes when digesting its contents. She just heard the muffled sounds of the outside world, and the beating heart of her captor. She closed her eyes, exhausted from what happened that night, and quickly fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She blew out a small puff of fire to illuminate the area around her, finding small dusty footprints that had been sure of where they were going. Her tails flicked once as she was off onto the trail, dashing as fast as she could to follow her daughter. She jumped into the bushes where the footprints stopped and encountered a small pond. The paw prints led in, none led out. She walked around the pond, inspecting it to see if someone was in there.  She blew out more fire so she could find her way, and then noticed something on the other side of the lake. More footprints, but these were larger, and still fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen ninetails was off again, following her daughter's captor.</span></div></div>",
