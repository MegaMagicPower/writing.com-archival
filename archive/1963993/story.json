A patch of the ground had started to pulse, it swelled and warped as a figure emerged. The figure grow as it stepped out of the floor, until it's whole body was waling the Earth's surface, the figure was 7 foot tall, she had dark skin, long green hair with twigs in, and was wrapping around her arms like vine which has been left to grow, she was wearing a blue robe, the whole thing was moving, it was a deep, watery blue, and the fabric would wave, emulating water. IT covered her shoulders, torso and a thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step she took, left life in it's wake, with patched of grass shaped like her immense foot. Her steps on grass caused the land to become more lively, the grass was greener and had flowers and dandelions, she turned around, and grabbed the stem of a dandelion, and plucked it from the ground with it's roots, and raises it high in the air,, near her mouth, and blew. Each seed was cared on her breath, some for several miles. She placed the dandelion down, and the root acted like legs, or testicles, as it pulled itself to were it was and it's roots dove back into the ground, planting it's self again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued her walk, going to her destination, where a door was locked, but she continued walking, and passed straight thought the wall, emerging on the other side, as if the door was a gas like the air.<br>\r\nManeuvering her way around the mortal realm, seeing what had become of the planet she molded all those years ago.<br>\r\nShe knelled down by a spot of light coming from the moon. Lifting her arm, a small light in her hand formed, as pole ends of a pole expanded from the center of her palm reaching 6 and a half foot long, she grasp the pole, as the top of the staff twinkled a golden shine, and the staff morphed, as it grew features, several arcs formed, two large ones attached at one end to the staff, as two smaller ones appeared below it. At the top of the staff, in between the arc, a shiny blue ball shimmed into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear,\" she said in a gentle voice with the strangest accent, the voice was pleasing to her, even without anybody around. <br>\r\n\"Powers of mine, gifted to you.\" She smiled, lifted the staff up, and a drop of the blue light fell on...</span></div></div>",

And as if you have super powers or something, you saw Bethany's chest start visibly swelling. Almost like watching a watermelon grow underneath her blouse in a time-lapse, you couldn't peal your eyes away. Her white blouse rising slowly underneath her as the buttons holding her top together popped off and shot across the room exposing Beth's new larger cleavage. Awestruck to the sudden to the revelation of your gift, you was further astonished as to the deadpan stares the rest of your family gave to sudden change in Beth's chest. And even more so when she nonchalantly unbuttoned the rest of her blouse to expose her new swollen rack to the family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh..finally the girls are ready.\" Beth said as she casually dragged her frilly dark purple bra past her nipples and underneath her enlarged rack allowing her mammaries to spill past the cups.' Anyone want some?\" Bethany asked the family who mumbled a decline clearly more interested their own food or phone in Lucy's case her phone rather than her toast. \"More for me then!\" Bethany chuckled as she licked her lips and positioned her bowl underneath her right breast and let out a deep groan as milk started gushing out from the nipple. Nearly choking on your pancakes you quickly got up from the table ran for the bathroom hiding your dick straining in your pants from the family. \"Wonder whats wrong with him?\" Bethany said turning her attention away from her chest to watch your sudden panic attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It actually was real</i>.. you thought to yourself as you stared at your sweat ridden form leaning against the marble countertop in bathroom mirror. Grinning you repeated that statement in her head..<i>It actually was real</i>. Laughing you traced your right hand underneath your white t-shirt until you landed on your right pec. Closing your eyes you forcibly willed a small pair of milk filled breasts onto your body. Biting your lip as your sensitive nipples made contact with your shirt you could only smile at the small dark spots that suddenly appeared in the same spot as your new tender teats. </span></div></div>",
