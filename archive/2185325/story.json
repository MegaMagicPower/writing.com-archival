Here, babies are learning to explore their world and move-so we test Wrigglers Stretch, to help them move and go. We also test the thick wipes, as babies's changing diets mean hard to clean diaper messes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoom 2: The Cocoon Room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor young toddlers-about 12 months to 24 months, or two year olds. With children getting their feet, it's no wonder that here we test Wrigglers Slide-Ons, for squirmy toddlers. We also test on-the-go wipes in easy to carry packages-Thicky-Gos, Sensative-Gos, and Clean-Gos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoom 3: The Butterfly Room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor older toddlers. It's sort of split in half-the half that's testing the bigger sizes of Streches and Slide-Ons, and other young toddler products, and the potty trainers, who are testing our Rovers Trainers, our Flushies, and bathroom products like Super Soap and Handy Clean.</span></div></div>",
