            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The headlights of your car cut through the darkness of the cool night as you drive down a long dirt road, past countless miles of fields and wooden fence. Apparently, your Uncle Derrick must have been a hermit or something, because the farmhouse up ahead is the first house you\u2019ve seen in at least an hour. You have no idea why he left it to you, or that he even owned a farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also have no idea what you are going to do with it. You know nothing about farming, and you never even considered doing it for a living, because getting up at four in the morning and working your ass off until nightfall, no matter the weather conditions, just didn\u2019t sound very appealing to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decided to check it out anyway. Which is why you flew all the way across the country to see the place. Maybe you could just sell the place and be done with it. As you pull into the long dirt driveway, the place looks like any other farm you\u2019ve seen. Wide open fields, a barn, stable, etc. But there is no sign of any corn fields, or crops of any kind. Guess Uncle Derrick didn\u2019t really do any farming either. But why would he own this place then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou park directly in front of the farmhouse and get out of your car. You can\u2019t really make out what the house looks like in the dark. As you walk up the steps and across the porch, you dig into your pocket for the house-key that had been included with the land deed for this place in your uncle\u2019s will. You insert the key into the lock, but you have to jiggle it a little before the door opens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the moonlight streaming in through the windows, it looks like you\u2019ve entered the kitchen. You can see a table in the center of the room and can make out the outline of cabinets and a stove on the walls. But you notice something strange. A dim light coming from the doorway into the living room. Odd, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone here. You peek around the corner of the doorway, and see that the fireplace at the far end of the room is lit. Laying in front of the hearth, curled in a ball, is a strange black shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d You think to yourself. You cautiously make your way towards the black shape, almost tip-toeing. But as you are about two feet from the strange thing, you fell your foot tread on something, and in that instant, the black shape leaps up to it\u2019s full height , giving off a yowl of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange creature is almost eye level with you, maybe just a bit taller. It appears to be some sort of cat! Except, it\u2019s standing on two legs, and seems to have a body similar to a human\u2019s with cat like features! It is covered from head to toe in black fur, with glowing yellow eyes and a small hoop earring in it\u2019s left ear. Claws as sharp as razors tip each of it\u2019s fingers and toes. It appears to be female from it\u2019s rather trim body and breasts that looked to be a C-cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize the thing you had stepped on was this creature\u2019s tail, as you could see it leading from under your foot, all the way to her backside. Her tail was very long and flexible, and made this creature seem all the more strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat ever this thing was, she looked pissed. She yanks her tail out from under your foot and gets down on all fours, claws digging into the floor. She arches her back, the fur standing on end, and hisses at you angrily, showing her gleaming white fangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back, knowing that this cat-thing was about to maul your ass. Then you hear footsteps coming from upstairs, and a female voice. \u201cTara? What\u2019s going on?\u201d You see a light illuminate the staircase to your right and see a shadow coming down the stairs. When the figure reaches the bottom, you can\u2019t believe your eyes. Standing there in another animal/human hybrid. This one was a dog, a husky to be exact.  She had a white belly, breasts and face, the same for her hands and feet. The rest of her body was covered in black, except for the tip of her tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer icy blue eyes light up upon seeing you, she charges towards you and practically tackles you to the ground. She sits on top of your stomach, stradling you. You close your eyes and wait for the chomp, thinking that these strange creatures are going to eat you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of teeth, you feel her tongue slide across you face again and again, her tail wagging excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re finally here!\u201d Says the husky. You open your eyes to see her smiling down at you. \u201cUm\u2026\u2026.thanks?\u201d You say. \u201cCould you please get off of me?\u201d The husky obediently does so, allowing you to get up. You steadily get back on your feet, eyeing the strange creatures in front of you. The cat stands there with her arms crossed, a look of contempt on her face, while the husky stars at you with a happy, excited look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d you finally manage to ask. \u201cBetter yet, what are you?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Says the husky. \u201cI suppose an explanation is due. My name is Sasha, and this is Tara.\u201d She nodded toward the cat, who only gave you a cold stare as a response. \u201cAs to what we are, as you can see, we are animals, but no completely so. I believe you humans commonly call us \u201cfurries\u201d or \u201canthros\u201d.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly. \u201cCan you tell me what you are doing in my uncle\u2019s, well, actually my house?\u201d Sasha walk over to a nearby sofa and motions for you to sit. You do so, and she lays down across your lap, belly up. \u201cDidn\u2019t you wonder why your uncle left you this farm?\u201d she asks. \u201cYes, the entire way here.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2018re the reason.\u201d Says Sasha. \u201cYou see, your uncle took care of me and my friends for several years, but as his final days wore on, he told us of his nephew who volunteers at a local animal shelter and loves animals. He knew you would take good care of us.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d You say. \u201cIt\u2019s true I volunteer and care for animals, but this is all a bit much to take in. I mean, did my uncle inherit this farm too?\u201d \u201cOh no.\u201d Says Sasha. \u201cHe found this place one day when he got lost and stopped here to ask to for directions. He was the only other human to know about us because we live so far from human civilization.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time Sasha had been speaking, Tara continued staring at you, which kind of unsettled you. \u201cWhat\u2019s with her?\u201d You ask, gesturing to Tara. \u201cOh, she\u2019s always moody, that and you stepped on her tail. Pay her no mind.\u201d Tara hissed at Sasha, but she ignored her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there any others like you?\u201d You ask. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d says Sasha. \u201cThere\u2019s Bess the cow, Marie the mare, Jane the sheep, and Luna the bat. You\u2019ll meet them tomorrow. In the meantime, you must be so tired after your long trip here, would you like to rest.\u201d you nod, sleep sounds pretty good right now. \u201cCome with me.\u201d Says Sasha as she gets up and leads you upstairs as Tara gets back in her spot in front of the fireplace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince your uncle passed on, I\u2019ve been running things around here.\u201d Says Sasha as she leads you up the stairs. \u201cNow that you\u2019re here, things can get back to normal.\u201d \u201cBut how can you expect me to just give up my life to baby-sit a bunch of animals?\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha turns to you, a scowl on her face. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you did before you came here?\u201d You pause for a moment and realize that she\u2019s right, that was basically what you did anyway. She takes your silence as a yes. \u201cWell then, you can\u2019t really complain, can you?\u201d She says as she leads you to the bedroom. \u201cBesides, I think you\u2019ll like it much better here than in the city. It\u2019s peaceful and quiet here, and all you really have to do is make sure we\u2019re fed and cared for, and keep us company. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be doing any farm work around here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe open the door to the bedroom and leads pushes you inside. You can\u2019t really make out the room due to the darkness, but you feel yourself flop onto a soft bed. Sasha crawls in next to you and cuddles up with you. \u201cgoodnight.\u201d she says, licking you once more before falling asleep. After all you\u2019ve been through, you fall asleep yourself. your last conscious thought is \u201cWhen I wake up, I\u2019m getting a cat-scan.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you don\u2019t open your eyes right away. You can feel you are in your bed by yourself, so you think what happened last night must have been a dream. But as you open your eyes, you see that it wasn\u2019t. You\u2019re not in your room, you\u2019re in a strange room you\u2019ve never seen. Guess it wasn\u2019t a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of bed and head downstairs. In the kitchen, Tara sits at the table, lapping at a glass of milk, while Sasha stood in front of the stove with an apron, cooking eggs and bacon. \u201cGood morning!\u201d she says cheerfully as she places your plate at the table. You sit down, but don\u2019t eat just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you get the food?\u201d You ask. \u201cOh, the eggs we get from our flock of chicken. They\u2019re the only normal animals on the farm. The bacon we had in the freezer, and the milk we get from Bess. Speaking of whom, you might want to milk her today. The poor girl hasn\u2019t been milked for weeks, now she\u2019s so swollen it looks like she has two pink beachballs attached to her chest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d You ask, taking a bite of bacon. \u201cWell, Jane needs to be sheared, Marie needs to be groomed, and you better keep an eye out for Vicky.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d You ask. \u201cVicky, that pesky fox from the forest at the edge of the farm. She\u2019s always trying to steal our chickens and causing trouble. One more thing, Luna is normally asleep now, but maybe you should go wake her up just so she knows you\u2019re here, since we rarely even see her.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll go and milk the cow first.\u201d You say. \u201cFrom the sound of it, she needs my attention more than the rest.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll be grateful for that I\u2019m sure.\u201d Sasha says. \u201cShe\u2019s probably still in the barn.\u201d After you finish breakfast, you step outside and head towards the barn in the center of the farm. You open the door a crack and peek inside. Sunlight streams in from a small round window set in the top of the rear wall. The place looks the way you would expect any barn to look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA workbench stood in one corner of the barn, next to a wall lined with tools. Opposite that was a row of stalls for cattle. You heard a light snoring sound coming from above. You look up and see a huge black shape hanging upside down from one of the rafters, its wings wrapped tightly around itself, obscuring its face. This, you assumed, must be Luna. You decide to let her sleep, she probably won\u2019t appreciate being woken  up during daylight hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning against the stall door at the far end of the row, was an anthro cow. Her body from the neck down was hidden by the stall walls. Her muzzle was short and pink, and her face was mostly white with a back splotch over her right eye. Long black hair tied in a ponytail hung from her head to the small of her back. Her mouth continually moved sideways as she chewed her cud. Her elbows were propped on the top of the door, her head resting in her hands. She looks over at you and smiles. \u201cWell hello there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was kind and gentle, like how a mother would speak to her child. \u201cHi.\u201d You say. \u201cI\u2019m the new caretaker of the farm.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d She says. \u201cSo you\u2019re the one Derrick was talking about. He always spoke highly of you.\u201d That confused you. You never even saw your uncle that much, so how could he have known you worked at an animal shelter, or have known enough about you to tell these strange animals? You just nod and say \u201cI was told you are in need of milking.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank goodness.\u201d She says with a sigh of relief, \u201cI was beginning to worry that I would burst.\u201d As you approached the front of her stall, she opened the door, and your eyes visibly widened, your jaw nearly hitting the floor. What Sasha had said about Bess\u2019s breasts being as big as beach balls was an understatement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to have been two feet across, each weighing at least twenty pounds. They were both pink, perfectly round, and completely hid the rest of her torso. As she stepped out of the stall, you could hear an audible sloshing sound as the milk inside her breasts shook around. It was now that you realized you had been staring at her. You feel your face burn red as you visibly blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s okay dear.\u201d She says, seemingly unfazed by your gawking. \u201cThis is perfectly normal when I go for weeks without being milked.\u201d She points at the corner of the room to two large tubs. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be needing those.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and quickly set the tubs down in front of her, next to each other. Bess bends over, allowing her engorged breasts to hang. The two pink, overflowing orbs putting visible strain on her back. \u201ccould you please get started now sweetie?\u201d She says. \u201cIf I stay in this position with these babies for very long, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll snap in half.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get down on one knee next to her right breast, and gently grasp her nub between you thumb and index finger. You give it a light pinch and tug, and a small stream of milk squirts from her tit, echoing as it hit\u2019s the inside of the tub. You get a feeling that this is going to take a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor half an hour you drain her right breast, squirt by squirt, Bess sighing with relief as the weight on her back  ebbed away. As you milked Bess, you decided to chat with her to make the situation less awkward. \u201cSo, what\u2019s life like here?\u201d You ask. \u201cOh, it\u2019s wonderful here.\u201d She says. \u201cSo peaceful, wide open spaces, good company. The only real problem is Vicky.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Sasha told me about her.\u201d You say as you move from her right breast to her left, it having seemed to be completely drained, but still rather large, about the size of a basketball. \u201cSasha really hates her, and she\u2019s not my favorite either.\u201d Says Bess as you repeat the process on her other breast. \u201cOnce, she mixed some sort of hay that makes me produce milk even more than usual in with my regular hay. Then while I slept, she snuck in and tied string around my nipples. You think I\u2019m big now? You should have seen me the next morning, I couldn\u2019t even get out of my stall!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know it was her?\u201d You ask. \u201cWho else could have done it? Sasha was ready to go into the forest after her herself, but you uncle managed to restrain her. We had more than enough milk for over a month after that.\u201d You both laughed at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finally finished, Bess stood straight up allowing you to see the rest of her body. She had a nice trim body, with slender legs and hooves for feet. \u201cOh, my back is killing me.\u201d Bess groaned, rubbing her sore back. \u201cI can give you a nice massage later, when I\u2019m done with my chores if you like.\u201d you offer, which she eagerly accepts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the two tubs, which are now filled to the brim with Bess\u2019s milk. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with all this?\u201d You ask. \u201cJust leave them here.\u201d Bess says. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d You bid her farewell and leave to finish the other chores on your list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon, you were walking past the barn, and you heard a light snoring sound coming from inside. You open the door a crack and peek inside. There, passed out on the floor, was Tara. She lay on her back, milk all over her face, her stomach looking as though she had swallowed a beach ball. \u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d You say to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step inside the barn, and\u2026..yep, she did. Both tubs were empty. Tara drank the entire thing. You guess that, being a cat, it was in her nature. But still, Sasha probably wouldn\u2019t be too happy about this. Tara licked her lips in her sleep, wiping away some of the excess milk, and smiled. You know she was kind of violent and moody usually, but when she was sleeping, she looked so peaceful and content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should probably wake her up, but doing that might result in you being maimed. Perhaps if you rubbed her now rounded belly, she would be calmer when she woke up? Or maybe you should just go tell Sasha and let her sleep?</span></div></div>",

Maybe if you tried being nice to her, she'd warm up to you. You thought long and hard about how you were gonna wake her. You didn't want to just yell \"WAKE UP, TARA!\". Not only would she be mad at you, but Luna would most likely get mad as well. After some thinking you decide to try and rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start with some gentle strokes, and she started to purr. Then you start rubbing her stomach for real. Tara starts to stir around in her sleep, eventually waking up. When she sees you she sneers at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do <b>you</b> want?\" she asks, her voice full of contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to get angry, but then you remember that promise you made to yourself about being nice to Tara. You then say \"I just wanted to know why you had to drink all that milk. I took me a while to get it, you know.\" You tried to say that in the nicest way you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that.\", she said. \"I just couldn't help myself, I guess. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, no sarcasm, no evil looks, and she said sorry. Looks like the \"be nice\" plan was working faster than you thought it would, assuming that it would work at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I wanted to say that I'm sorry for stepping on your tail last night.\" You figured that apologizing for that incident would help put the water under the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's eyes widened at what you said. Nobody ever apologized to her before. It was weird because she never cared if somebody apologized to her, no matter how angry it made her. Now all of a sudden a guy she knew for barely a day is doing it to her. It made her feel a little better about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" she said. \"And I'm s... ss... sorry for being so mean. I'm just kind of... like that. You know. Mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying the word \"Sorry\" is one thing, but actually apologizing was a whole other thing for Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say. \"Why are you like that? You know. Mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not talk about it,\" she answered. She then lets out a yawn and goes back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Tara's finally starting to warm up to you.

Luckily, you didn't see any sign of Vicky, which surprised Sasha. When you got home, you set up a TV that you had in your car in your room and started playing some video games. After about two hours, you got hungry, so you decided to go downstairs for some dinner. When you were near the kitchen, you heard Sasha and Tara talking in there, you peek in there, trying not to be seen, in order to hear what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara, I know you drank all the milk.\" Sasha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not mad, but I was a little frustrated when I heard. Why did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thirsty, I saw the milk, and I drank it.\" Tara said. \"What else do you want to hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara, you've got to stop thinking about yourself. There's other people living here and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara interrupts Sasha with a frustrated grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your problem?\" she says, getting mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My problem is that I'm nineteen years old and you're talking to me like a child!\" Tara yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you stop acting like a child, I won't have to treat you like one!\" Sasha snaps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Sasha? I'm DONE talking to you!\" Tara gives another grunt and starts out the kitchen. You quickly run upstairs to your room, trying not to make any noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night you walk over to Tara's room. You still don't know if you should talk to Tara. You finally got her to like you a little, and you didn't want to ruin it. You slowly open the door and walk inside. \"Tara, you softly say. Tara turns her head towards you and seems surprised to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard what happened.\" you say. \"Do you want to talk about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A cold and unforgiving \"no.\" You were worried that you just lost any progress in earning her trust. Not only that, but you were truly worried Tara. You knew first hand what it was like to be treated like that. Moving a bit closer, you tried once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that I'm definitely not you're favorite person right now, but if you need to talk... I'm hear to listen.\" You did your best to force a smile. Sadly, it was wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I <b>need</b> is some sleep,\" Tara quickly snapped back, \"Just leave me alone.\" You swear you heard a slight sniffle as she finished.  You knew she didn't really mean that. After all, seldom does anyone really want to be completely alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped closer reaching your hand out a bit, \"Hey, I've been there and I know it's not fair.\" You pause for a moment, \"People always telling you that everything you do is wrong. That your way is never going to work. And so they treat you like a child without even seeing things from your point of view.... It's not fair. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me...\" She whispers softly as her body tenses from your hands presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile once more, this time truly as you speak, \"Trust me, it's helps to talk about stuff like this. If you don't, it'll eat you up inside.\" You slowly place your hand on her shoulder. Suddenly, you feel her whole body tense up all at once as she turns around faster than you could react. She slaps you across the face rather hard. Hard enough to knock up to the ground. Her face full of anger, she started shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about it?!\" Tara's voice was loud and fierce, \"About ME?! You're just some stupid kid who shouldn't even be here in the first place! You don't know a damn about my life, so don't come in here with your sentimental bullsh-\" Tara stopped almost in the same breathe as you moved your had away from your face. Her slap had not only left claw marks, but was also slightly bleeding. The pain wasn't all that overcoming but it did sting like a the devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at our own hand for a moment and notice the light speckles of crimson here and there and determine that you must not be bleeding to badly. Though, it was enough to scare Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God,\" the feline's tone was almost the exact opposite of what is was only a few seconds ago, \"I-I'm sorry! I... I didn't mean to... It's just I- and you and...\" Her began to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your best to give a smile tough the pain, \"It's all right, I've been though worse.\" Quickly, the cat rushed over to look over the wound. After eying it with a panicked looked she rushed out of the room. You sat there confused and dazed, not sure what to think. You look up to see Tara hold a a small first aid kit, most likely the one from the bathroom. Shaking, she did her best to try to doctor the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put some of the neosporin on the wound you can't help but greet your teeth. Tara looked down at wound with sadness in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must hate after this... Don't you?\" You stopped and looked up at her. \"I don't blame you. I'm not friendly, I'm not cute and I'm not even a good friend...\" You wanted to say something but the words wouldn't come. \"I'm just cold, heartless, lazy, no good excuse for a cat.\" Slowly she began to cry, but as she did and despite her shaking,  Tara did her best to mend the wound. As she was almost done, you finally found the words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't hate you Tara.\" The feline stopped dead in her place with a shocked look upon her face. \"I try not to hate anyone. It's not in me. But I will say this...\" You look right into her glowing yellow eyes, \"You were right, I don't know a lot about you, but I want to. So will you tell me... Please?\" Tara looked more shocked than she already did, completely taken back by what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" was her only answer. A warm and surprised \"why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I want to be your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

It didn't help that my full name is Tara Longtail. I would often get into fights at school, and I ended up getting expelled. I never exactly loved my parents either. They were still treating me like I was two when I was fifteen! That\u2019s why I was so upset with Sasha, I don\u2019t like being treated like a child.  So I ran away from home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen to Tara intently. Now you begin to see why she was normally so bitter and mean. You couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for her, and on some levels you could relate to her. You were often bullied in school too, and you didn\u2019t have many friends either. Hell, you never even went on a date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue stroke Tara\u2019s back as she continues, seeming to calm down. \u201cFor a few months I lived on the streets alone, eating out of garbage cans. During that time I became addicted to milk, cream, dairy in general. We cats naturally have a taste for the stuff, but it became a constant craving for me. Sometimes at night, when everybody is asleep, I\u2019ll sneak out of the house to Bess\u2019s stall and suck it out of her myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara scoots closer to you and lays her head on your shoulder, her tail wrapping around your waist. \u201cThen one day, I met this guy who said he felt pity for me, and he wanted to help me. He invited me to come stay with him. He even treated me to the first decent meal I had eaten in months. But when we got to his house, he said I wasn\u2019t going to get to stay there for free. I told him I had no money, but that wasn\u2019t what he was talking about. \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly knew where her story was going, and tears began to flow from her eyes again. \u201cNeedless to say, he soon realized his mistake after I clawed him in the eyes and escaped. That\u2019s when I swore to never trust anyone, ever again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut here you are telling me your life story when only yesterday you wanted to kill me.\u201d You say. \u201cSo you must trust me to some degree.\u201d Tara doesn\u2019t respond. Instead, she looks you in the eyes and suddenly grabs you in a hug. \u201cThank you.\u201d She says. \u201cI\u2019ve never really had someone to talk to about this stuff. Now that I\u2019ve gotten it off my chest, I feel much better.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hug her back and say, \u201cIf you ever want to talk again, I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d Then, you realize one thing about her story that didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cWait a minute.\u201d You say. \u201cYou said you went to school and lived on the streets. But that couldn\u2019t have been around here, or anywhere on this planet! Where did you come from?

You were at a loss for words. Sure, Tara was pretty in her own right, but was it really okay to kiss a girl a day after you met her, even though she's the one asking for the kiss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you think about it, however, it makes sense that Tara would become attracted to you so quickly. You were the first guy to show her kindness in years, and she trusted you enough to tell her life story to you. Hell, she probably hasn't even told Sasha. Besides, if you didn't kiss her, the sense of rejection would make Tara depressed again, and you'd be right back where you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Tara said. \"You seem to be staring off into space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. It's just that I've never kissed a girl before.\" you say without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Tara asks in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....\" you say, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it makes you feel better, I've never kissed a guy.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell this was just perfect. Not only was she asking to kiss you, she was now asking to be your first kiss and for you to be her first kiss. You were having a dilemma. But to reiterate, Tara was cute. Who knows? Maybe furry girls may turn out to be better kissers than human girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can kiss me.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's face instantly went red. \"Wow, I wasn't expecting you to say yes.\" she says. After a few awkward seconds, Tara leans in, closing her eyes. You start to do the same, then your lips meet with hers. Tara puts her arms around you and coils her tail around your back. The kiss actually felt really nice. Tara's lips were soft, and the fur on her face and body felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the two of you, somebody caught sight of your kiss.</span></div></div>",

Basically, I got paid to just sit around and eat all day.\" \"Sounds like anyone's dream job.\" You say. \"Well, it was really the only career choice we cows have if we don't want our milk to go to waste. Plus, the milk machines tend to get a little rough on the udders after a few hours or so. I prefer it by hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on to say how all cows on their planet were naturally well endowed like her, and become swollen after going so long without be milked. Believe it or not, while Bess's breasts would be considered quite large here on Earth, back home, she would be considered an average bust size. \"Man,you cowgirls must have spines of steel!\" You both laughed at that. After half an hour or so of massaging, you finally stop. Bess wraps her arms around you and hugs you tightly. you can't help but blush at the feeling of her breasts squishing against your chest. \"Thank you very much dear.\" She says \"My back feels so much better now.\" \"No problem.\" You say, patting her on the back. \"But you must be thirsty after all the work you've done today. Let me help you with that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she places you in her lap, and pushes your head towards her right \"udder\". You look up at her with a quizzical look. \"You mean you want me to...\" \"Go ahead, drink up.\" She says with a motherly smile. You were rather thirsty, and you didn't want to offened Bess, so you gently take her nipple into your mouth and gingerly begin to suckle. Warm, creamy milk flows from her tit down your throat, while Bess gives a light moo of contentment. You close your eyes and begin to actually enjoy this. Here Bess was, nursing you as if you were her own baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes or so, you open your eyes and release Bess's nipple from the confines of your mouth. But you recieve the biggest shock of your life when you see that you body has changed! Firstly, you have shrunken down to the size of a toddler. Also, your skin is covered by a thin layer of black and white fur, and your feet have been replaced with hooves! Two small horns protrude from your head, and a long, thin tail with a tuft of fur on the end swishes lazily behind you. Bess's milk has turned you into an anthro calf!

What am I going to do? How will I explain this to the others?\" She stops for a moment, and hugs you tightly to her soft, pink bosom. \"I'm so sorry dear! I swear I had no idea this would happen!\" You open your mouth to speak, but all that comes out is a little mooing noise. Looks like you've lost the ability to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Bess decides she might as well tell Sash about this, no point trying to hide it. She lays you down on your back in a pile of hay. \"I'll be right back.\" With that, she lease to get Sasha. While she's gone, you look over your new, diminutive body. The thing that felt the strangest was how your feet had been\u00a0replaced  by hooves. You try to stand up to test them out, but only manage to take a couple wobbly steps before falling onto your front. Those were going to take some getting used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bess comes back she opens the stall door, and Sasha looks down at you with a mix of disbelief, and frustration on her face. \"You mean to tell me that (your name) turned into this, just by drinking from your boob?\" Bess blushes as she nods and picks you up, holding you like a baby. \"I don't understand it either. It would seem my milk has this effect on humans. But why didn't it happen to Derrick then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derrick was lactose intolerant, he never drank any of the milk he got from you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha sighs, then furrows her brow in concentration for several minutes before finally saying \"I guess the only thing we can do is raise him again.\"  \"I'll do it.\" Says Bess \"It's my fault this happened to him, I should be the one to take the responsibility.\"  Sash nods \"Good point. Well, I better go tell the others about this.  Though I doubt they'll believe it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasha leaves, Bess curls up with you on a pile of hay for a nap. \"Don't worry, sweetie.\" She says \"I promise I'm gonna make up for this. I'll take really good care of you, count on it.\" You fall asleep, snuggling up to your new mother.</span></div></div>",

A brief pause ensued before her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're back to normal!\" Bess gasped, coming fully awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and nodded. \"Yeah, I was afraid I was going to stay like a cow forever! It didn't help that I couldn't talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sad smile played on Bess' lips and her ears flopped down a little. \"Ah...well hon, I'm happy the effects of my milk wore off. I'm sorry about that, by the way. I didn't know you'd transform into that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the disappointment in Bess' voice. It was obvious that, despite your situation being an accident, she was a little happy. The thought of having her own foul pleased her it seemed. You were a little happy too that Bess was willing to take care of you in the possibility that you didn't turn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I should thank you Bess. You were ready to take care of me in the case that I didn't change back. You would've been a great mother, I'm sure,\" you praised; however, your words only seemed to make her sadder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I still want to be actually,\" she admitted with a light blush, turning away slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused as you didn't understand what she was talking about. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess faced you with sad eyes. \"I...I still want to be your mother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis declaration surprised you a bit, but before you could open your mouth, Bess elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you've always taken good care of me, hun. I only feel its right to take care of you now...whether you are human or anything else. I hope you don't think of me as selfish or weird, but that's how I feel,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were actually touched by Bess. Indeed, the thought of being taken care of her seemed more realistic now especially after you transformed. There was a problem though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you wanted to be my mother, how would you take care of me? I'm 18 and can pretty much handle myself,\" you questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess nodded with understanding. \"I just want to be there for you sweetie; like you and your uncle have been there for me and the other animals. That's why, I'll ask you...will you allow me to help you and take care of you from now on? I want to do the little things...making you breakfast, tucking you in,, and nurturing you...so, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking breakfast? She could do that? Certainly, that wasn't impossible or unlikely for that matter given their human-like structure. You weren't sure about being tucked in, but it certainly sounded nice. Finally, what could she mean by nurturing him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you'd simple reject her offer, but you were her foul for a short period so you knew the feeling.

Hearing her soothing heartbeat calmed you down a little; however, you were a little ashamed to find that your little neighbor had gone erect. You didn't want Bess to know, so you kept your bottom half with some distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...it'll be weird to call you mother though,\" you explained with a slight blush, \"...I'm not sure if I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess frowned, but nodded slowly. \"Of course, sweetie. I don't expect you too, but I hope that you'll get used to me being around you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything but contemplated whether your decision was the right one. Right now, it didn't seem that bad. The fact that you were the only human on the farm helped a little too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here? I heard some squeals. Are those damn pigs bothering this barn?\" Sasha came in, wondering what the commotion was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and stared wide-eyed at you. \"Well I'll be...you turned back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you breathed a sigh of relief, \"...thankfully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha put her hands on her lips and grinned. \"Well Bess here must be disappointed. There's no need to take care of you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess smiled and giggled. \"Maybe not as a cow, but he's agreed to become my adopted foul. I think he deserves to be taken care of after all he's done for me...and us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha raised her furry eyebrow. \"Your foul? You can't be serious, Bess. He's human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess frowned. \"...and? We can talk and walk like a human. There's not really much we can't do compared to humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha was about to protest but then caught herself. She sighed and waved her hands. \"Fine, do what you want. If you plan to take care of him, I hope you realize that you can't be sitting in the barn all day. Your going to have to start helping around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess shrugged. \"That's fine by me...I've always felt guilty whenever I see you working so hard around the farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha shook her head and left the barn mumbling. It was clear she thought it was ridiculous and the relationship wasn't going to last long. Bess was determined to prove her wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at you held comfortably across her chest. You looked back at her, taken back a little by the warn, maternal eyes that stared at you. It was a little overwhelming to be honest. Not even your real mother stared at you like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...can you not stare so much?\" you requested, feeling a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to further incite Bess at how embarrassed you were. \"Oh baby...your reactions are just going to make me want to hold you and cuddle you more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked away and had to take a deep breath, trying to focus your mind as you felt yourself feeling a little hazy. Her maternal aura was definitely overwhelming and you weren't sure if you should be weirded out or comforted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking you by surprise, she lifted you up with her arms causing an audible gasp from you. She was actually pretty strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess giggled. \"Oh hon, you're so light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned red in slight shame. Honestly, you didn't want to think you were skinny or of the sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-could you put me down, please? I'm not a baby,\" you requested with a little stuttering.</span></div></div>",

This new live on the farm, however, didn't take as long as you thought it would have. When compared to humans, young anthros grow very quickly. Seven weeks ago you were a toddler suckling Bess as she carried you in her arms, but now you are somewhere in the teen state of your redevelopment. It was hard for Bess to have to stop feeding you everyday as you can eat for yourself, but you still occasionally indulge yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you spent quite some time in your new body, you still aren't completing comfortable. The hooves on your feet wouldn't flex when your were walking, causing you to trip and fall multiple times. Luckily you still the fingers on your hands or else life would have been so much harder. Your fur covered the entirety of your body, but you still felt completely naked.At your request, Sasha sheared Jane's wool at did her best to fashion some clothes for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you're able to do some work, you milk your adoptive mother everyday. Figuring you slept in the barn with her, you catch her literally first thing in the morning. Today was no different as you set everything up around Bess who is still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sweetie.\" she yawns. \"Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could have been better. My back is killing me.\" you answer back to her. You pull the second tub into place without much effort. You doubt you would've move the tub this if your were a human teenager, but apparently anthros are that bit stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor dear...If you're hurt, you shouldn't overdo it.\" she said  obviously worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. This is farm life after all right...more or less?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it is.\" You continue the milking session, making ideal conversion with the cow. Despite both of you knowing that your mind is still that of an adult's, she still speaks as if you are her precious calf. With the first tub full, you were instructed that you were finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me or are you making less milk than before?\" asked you in your curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The first time you did it that day was because I've haven't been taken care for a long time. And ever since you've drained my udders everyday, one way or another.\" she looked directly at you with endearingly. \"Thanks (your name), I've never been happier in my life. You make my day brighter, and you help with my back; it never felt this good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Bess, but can you please not talk about backs right now...I wonder if I can take an aspirin.\" you remarked as you lean and stretch out your spine. While your head is looking up, you do not see Bess inspecting you. She reaches for you shirt and starts to lift it before you know what she doing. \"Ah! What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still, I need to see something.\" She gave a stern look showing you she was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\" you folded. She lifts  your shirt again, revealing the fur trapped underneath. Suddenly she gasps. \"Hun...I-I think I know why your back is stiff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked. It can't be, can it? You whip your shirt off and see the problem. Your chest now has two boobs that are already looking stacked for your figure. How could you have messed those? She grabs onto one of your nipples with her fingers and pinches it. You start to feel weird as she is touching you, but you are too shaken at the moment to oppose her. To both of your increasing surprise, milk flies out in just a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you are supposed to be around that age.\" she thinks out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what do we do...?\" you nearly scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of silence, she leads you to the tub. Now she was the one draining you, emptying your udders. After she was done, you mind cleared up a little. Bess hugs your head and whispers, \"I'll go get Sasha, then we'll go from there.\" She gets up and exits the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were alone with a new lactating rack. Many things are racing through your mind, but one outweighs them all. 'Are you a girl now?' You were desperate to know this as soon as you can. Using this opportunity, you peek to see that...</span></div></div>",

You lost pretty much everything you could think of that you had before you came to the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" the ears on top of your head twitch as Sasha and Bess approached from behind you. You realized that you still had your pants open and quickly try to hide what you were doing. Unfortunately, Sasha understood what was going through your head. \"Well, let me be honest, I had a felling this was going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused in how she saw this coming. \"Wait what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of Sasha, Bess answered with a look of regret. \"Well, you didn't really show the signs of a bull when you were growing. You were supposed to get bulkier, your horns bigger, full coat of fur in mostly one color. But rather than that, you looked...almost exactly...like me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bess...it's not your fault.\"  you attempted to soothe her. \"I 'm not hurt or anything. It just...different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I took so much away from you.\" Bess nearly cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it wasn't sincere, you forced a smile, \"but I knew my life was going to change at this farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha saw that Bess held a mixed expression of understanding and remorse. After a few seconds, she continued, \"In any case, this raises another problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess jumped in. \"Between the two of us, there soon might be too much milk flowing.\" If you really end up as Bess, you seriously doubt Tara could keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can manage.\" Sasha grabbed the tub and moved it to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you can't really think of anything else, you left the barn and pondered your situation. There was a small boulder a bit in the distance that you sat on as you gathered your thoughts. You were truly at a loss on what you should do. You see the large clump of wool that was Jane a good ten yards away. The top of her coat had a noticeable dent that was used to make your clothes. You weren't sure what she was doing, but see turned around and ran as fast as she could without falling victim to her own wool weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she being shy or was she scared? You guessed she was looking in your direction, so there was something behind you? Before you could check, a figure jumped over you and stopped in front of you. It turned out to only be Marie, but it still scared you half to death. \"Sorry about that.\" she apologized , \"Force of habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez... Next time, can you give someone a warning?!\" you shrieked. \"I couldn't really get a hint from Jane, either. She saw you coming and left me here without saying a word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know how she is...But I say it was because of that that she ran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you asked, not catching her drift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be shy too if you saw that.\" She points at your chest. You forgot your shirt at the barn so your pink udders are revealed. You instantly cover yourself with your arms in front of Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be shy though. Bess already told me. So now you're one of the girls.\" Marie encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the girls..?\" you repeated, weighing that information in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember, we are in this together.\" She pats your head before trotting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure of this was supposed to make you feel better or worse. However, you knew pouting was not going to be helpful. You jump down from the boulder and feel your chest swaying upon landing. You just got them taken care of a few minutes ago, yet they already feel like they're starting to build up again. Still, that is not your only problem as you are still shorter than you were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were concentrating when the tip of your bovine tail hit someone.  Your ears and every bit of fur on your body stood on end as you turned to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can only catch a glimpse of an orange blur before you are tackled to the ground. With the sudden ambush leading your head to the ground, you winced in pain as your aggressor looms over you. When your eyes open again, the face of a grinning fox woman stared back, not pinning you in place but asserting a predatory dominance all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear compelled you to call for help, but this fox was quick to cover your mouth. \"Shh...No noises! I want to get a good look on you.\" She whispered. Taking into account that you were turned into a calf on day one, you have not met Vicky before. You remember a few days when you were in the barn and you heard gunshots whenever Sasha would drive her away, but you never saw her up close. With her face inches away, you can cross that off your list. For that matter, she was taking note of you as well. \"Seems like the old man left a gift before he kicked it. I didn't think he had it in him, having a kid with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not given time to mentally point out the flaws in her statement before she poked at one of your exposed pink udders. You felt her digit stick into the skin as it got surrounded by the rest of the udder. The sensation caused you to reflexively arch your back, which did not help. \"Looks like you can start making milk soon. You wouldn't want it to go to waste, do ya? Why not let Vicky here have something to drink when it becomes a problem, okay?\" She cooed at your vulnerable state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you were scared, you were also getting pissed. She had no idea what was going on and you were not sure how you yourself were going to deal with it. The tension in your body telling you to act continued to build as she twirled her finger around the deflated mound. As she kept playing with you, you curl your back and were able to place your hoofs onto her torso. Before she knew what hit her, your legs pushed with impressive strength that launched her into the air. Feeling the sunlight caused you the breathe a sigh of relief. You were glad that you were able to get her off of you, though you were not sure why you though that in particular would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sense was snapped out of you when the sound of Vicky hitting the ground rang your eardrums. After groaning for a bit, Vicky flipped upright with a different set of predatory eyes. \"You're going to pay for that!\" She growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she brandished her claws, a shot interrupted her second assault before it started. Not taking a chance to look back, Vicky dashed away in panic. Her frantic footsteps were soon drowned out by Sasha's screaming. The dog anthro came charging on as quickly as her bipedal form allowed her, maybe even surpassing her normal limit. She crashed into a slide as she covered you from your fleeing assailant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery other time you heard her shout, she had used typical threats any homesteader would throw at those in crossed into their land. This time around, she was beyond barking mad. It also made you unnerved as she used her free hand to guard you and the other to point the shotgun. If a shot was fired, you were worried about not only the bullet, but the recoil as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting sick and tired this shit, Vicky! Run like a bitch! But I am just about done with giving you warnings!\" Her loud voice gave way to panting for air. She turns her head to see you slowly composing yourself. With a sigh, she raised the barrel skyward and offered you a hand. \"Sorry. She's really on my last nerve. But...She didn't hurt you, did she? That stance...it looked like she was ready to...\" She continue as her grip on the stock grew firmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonono no no no! I am fine. I...kicked her off me, I guess.\" You spoke the truth no matter if you believed it. \"Ummm...Were you serious back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated to respond to the question. \"No. At least...I don't think I really would bring myself to shoot her or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saying 'at least' does not really calm me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I wouldn't do it if she tried to take some chickens or pull 'some' pranks. Get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda digging a bigger hole here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! She better not lay even her eyes on you!\" She blurt out to stop your replies. \"I'm not going to let anything happen to you, or anyone else. Especially since...\" She stopped herself. Taking a moment to unload the gun, Sasha turned away. \"Today is quite a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard dog took her leave as you can see her pinch the bridge of her nose. You shot one last glance in the direction Vicky ran off to before you shake off your remaining fears. You can say with confidence that you never had that kind of experience before. You felt like you were completely venerable one second, and came out overpowering near the end. Granted it was only one move, but you did it without even thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you meet her again, however, you are not sure if it will work for you again. If not, she would be able to do what she wanted with you. \"Why not let Vicky here have something to drink when it becomes a problem, okay?\" Her words rang in your head. You are barely coming to terms with your transformation and her idea was to use you as a milkshake machine. As your thoughts pass, you unconsciously place your hands on your new pair of twins on your front. You then noticed that they are slightly engorged with more milk. It was not even that long since you have last been milked dry. Vicky might be right, this could be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--At the Barn Hours Later--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnytime when you were a normal young man, your mind would constantly changed its train of thought towards sex. One fantasy you thought never be achieved was becoming a woman and being able to grope yourself whenever you pleased. Now, you were pinching yourself but not for any kind of kinky act. Milk kept building in your chest and the weight was getting noticeable. You tried to take care of this before it becomes a problem, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie, that is not going to work.\" Bess came up to you with a pail. \"If we could milk ourselves, giant, back-breaking boobs wouldn't be an issue. It has to come from someone or something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how did you do it when you were raising me?\" You asked as you were getting more frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You helped...\" Bess said without looking into your eyes. It was obvious that she was blaming herself for this. Not only for this little crisis, but for everything that happened to you. That just got you feeling bad. You knew she was only trying to be comforting but things just seemed to keep getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not really know what to say in this situation, but you had to try something. \"Bess, as much as you are beating yourself up over this, you know it's not your fault. No one could have guessed that drinking anthro milk would turn you into one. You still did your best to help me. Even if you're feeling guilty, you also did it because you care.\" You tried to convey your voice in a mixture of convincing and heartfelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess took a moment to digest what you said. She lifted her head to meet your gaze. Then she started to smile, but not her motherly one rather an amused one. \"I sometimes forget that you still have a full-grown mind. It just seems out-of-place when you say such intelligent things in such a childish voice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, I have a childish voice now?' You thought to yourself. You could not really dismiss that that would not be unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...When you began talking again, it took you no time flat to get the sounds and words out. I guess that saved me some time and effort.\" Bess continued to smile. It was a little contagious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...laying in a stall and eating hay did take some getting used to. They can't all be winners.\" You offered to lighten the mood. Bess nodded as readied the pail, preparing remove to the weight on your chest. It was not like what you had earlier, but she understood that you were new to it. You hoped you would not need to fill that tub for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen milk started to enter the pail, the both of you grew silent. You blushed as you are forced to remain still as Bess worked to empty your udders. You were stuck facing her, seeing her expression shift slightly. With this kind of silence, she was probably thinking of something. That might not be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Vicky wasn't trouble, was she? Sasha said you kicked her away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Not quite sure how that happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cows anthros have powerful legs. We need them for obvious reasons.\" She answered. \"Anyway, you need to be more careful. That trick will not work a second time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A second time?\" You questioned. \"You make it sound like she wants to eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess shook at the remark, \"No no. But you know, she's, pardon the pun, clever like a fox. I just don't want you to get hurt again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't even get hurt this time.\" You pout. Her concern is apparent, making you feel guilty for arguing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And to be honest, she'll probably doesn't want to either, but that doesn't mean she's good.\" You fell silent, leaving only Bess to continue as she drained your udders. \"Since it was the first time she saw you, she probably had her guard down. And while everything here being tight-knit has its advantages, that also means that you will definitely see her again. I don't know what she'll do, but she now knows your one good trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is coming from the best of intentions, but her words of concern were having another effect on you. After the short milking session finished, the feeling that compiled in your head expressed...</span></div></div>",

I was starting to worry my spine would implode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you get to work milking Bess, and thanks to the extra help from Marie, it only takes you roughly a half hour.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The whole world had gone as quiet as the grave after Sasha\u2019s emotional outburst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply stood there behind Sasha completely baffled, not quite sure what to do next. Lying on the ground looking very lost was Vicky, her hair and orange fur disheveled and coated in dirt from her landing. She had one hand on her jaw, which was already looking swollen. Her expression was a strange mix of anger, shock, and to your surprise\u2026..guilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing deeply with teeth bared was Sasha, both fists clenched tight and shoulders rigid. Years of pent up rage and sadness had finally been released that sunny afternoon. And you knew without looking that Sasha was seeing red. In spite of your opinion of her, you feared for Vicky\u2019s safety. Leaning back slightly over Sasha\u2019s shoulder to look at her in the eyes, Vicky took notice and looked toward you. Without making a sound, you mouthed the word \u201cgo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, she took the hint. Slowly getting to her feet, Vicky turned and walked away into the woods. Not once looking back. The entire time, Sasha kept her eyes firmly focused on Vicky as she left. With Vicky gone, the task of disarming the husky girl was your next priority. And that had to be done carefully, lest Sasha decide to release her rage upon you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSasha\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, you reached forward and softly grabbed both of her shoulders. She jumped violently at the touch and turned to look at you. Tears were quickly beginning to form in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSasha, it\u2019s alright.\u201d You say softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Sasha\u2019s spirit crumbled. She threw both arms around you and buried her face into your chest, sobbing uncontrollably. You too wrapped your arms around her and pulled her tight. Both of you stood there for several minutes until Sasha\u2019s crying finally subsided. Pulling away from her a little, you reached with your hand to lift her face to look at yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go back inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha nodded slowly at your suggestion. The two of you slowly walked toward the farm house, your arms still wrapped around each other. Nearby, Bess the Cow and Marie the Mare had watched the whole ordeal in silence. Both feeling immensely proud and sympathetic to Sasha for finally standing up to Vicky, and for all the years of heartache she had to endure. Once inside, Tara met the two of you at the backdoor with one eyebrow raised in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was going on out there? All that shouting woke me up.\u201d She said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVicky denounced their friendship completely.\u201d You explained. \u201cShe then went back to her den with a dislocated jaw thanks to Sasha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a gesture with your fist meeting your chin. Tara\u2019s eyes widened at this, but her expression changed to a devious smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you finally gave that bitch what she deserved! Oh I wish I could\u2019ve seen that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha smiled at Tara\u2019s excitement.  Heading into the kitchen, you sat Sasha down at the kitchen while Tara got her a glass of water. Sasha was thankful, but the sadness could still be seen in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll make dinner tonight. I think Sasha could use a break tonight. Want to help Tara?\u201d you said, heading to the pantry in the basement. It was more of a command than a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, Fine.\u201d Tara said with a roll of her eyes, following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, the three of you retreated into the living room and piled onto the couch, with Sasha leaning up against your arm while Tara sat on the floor against Sasha\u2019s legs. A police drama was playing on the television, bathing everyone in an alien blue light. No one had said a word since coming in. A soft cool breeze blew through the windows from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn officer on the TV opened fire on a terrorist, foiling the criminal\u2019s escape attempt from prison. Tara pumped her fist in celebration, you clapped lightly as the credits rolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting late\u201d said Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it is.\u201d You said, not really paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Sasha slid herself out from yours arms and began walking toward the stairs. Surprised and a little worried, you turned the TV off and quickly got to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed, it\u2019s been\u2026..a long day\u201d she said without looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m just tired\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed anything? Snack? Drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m fine, goodnight\u201d she said without emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was halfway up the stairs when you spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to sleep together again?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha stopped dead in her tracks, her eyes widening in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that sounded really REALLY awkward.\u201d You said in defense. \u201cBut it\u2019s just, today you just told off one of your oldest friends\u2026.because you realized they really weren\u2019t who you thought they were. If I was in that position\u2026..last thing I would want is to be alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal smooth\u2026. You thought sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence that pervaded the room was unbearable. If Sasha\u2019s rejection didn\u2019t crush you, the embarrassment from your little speech surely would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.I would like that.\u201d Sasha said with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile of your own, the two of you headed upstairs toward your room. Leaving Tara alone downstairs, who stretched out her arms and legs once before curling into a ball on the floor, having witnessed the whole conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoron\u201d Tara said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving your shirt and jeans, you slipped into a pair of clean sleeping shorts. Unbeknownst to you, Sasha was watching you undress and change into your sleep attire very intently. She looked away quickly as soon as you were finished and turned to face her. Pulling the covers back, you allowed Sasha to lay down first before you crawled in bed next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said a word for several minutes. The two of you lost in silent thought. Summing up a bit of courage, you decided to try some small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite a day today.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarie was fine, she wanted to run with me again, I\u2019ll have to accept her offer eventually I suppose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBess was cheery, quite a chatterbox, where as Jane\u2026..isn\u2019t\u201d you finished lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha didn\u2019t reply. The whole bedroom fell silent. After what seemed to be an eternity, you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had every right to say what you said to her. She was the one who trumped your friendship. She was the one who chose to be heartless, not you\u201d. You said.<br>\r\n\u201cSo why doesn\u2019t it feel that way? Why do I feel so\u2026.so\u2026so horrible?\u201d she said, nearly breaking into tears again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing both arms around her, you pulled her closer, softly rubbing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d you began, picking your words carefully, \u201cBecause you are a good person Sasha. I haven\u2019t been here long, but I know that much. You are cheery, kind and very sweet from sun rise to sun set. Any problem that arises you tackle it head on. You never give up, especially not on the person you\u2019re helping. I mean, think about it, Tara is still here right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha chuckled at that last statement, a smile forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feel bad because despite your anger, you never gave up on her, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026..No\u201d she said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnnd let me guess, you probably still haven\u2019t, even after today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t\u201d said Sasha more firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what I mean? Good person\u2026dog\u2026thingamajig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha playfully pounded your shoulder with a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! What did I say?\u201d You asked, your smile never fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha smiled as well. \u201cThank you for being there. And\u2026.I\u2019m really glad you came here to live with us.\u201d She said softly, lowering her head on to a pillow, eyes half shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her. \u201cGoodnight Sasha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026.ni\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down to see why she trailed off her sentence, only to find Sasha fast asleep, snoring gently. Chuckling to yourself, you turned off the bedside lamp and laid back down in bed, keeping the warm husky girl safe in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They never loved you for who you are.What did you do for a living on your home planet anyway? Porn star? Stripper? Hooker?

You don\u2019t have to worry either because you also have Tara, Bess, Marie, Luna and Jane to help you,\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell when I feel like it, you know me,\u201d Tara says in teasing tone trying to lighten Sasha\u2019s mood as she walked in. Then in a more serious tone says, \u201c[your name] is right Sasha, you\u2019re not alone here we\u2019ll help you when you need it. The only one we\u2019ll have to watch out for is Vicky but with the way you get when she\u2019s causing trouble driven by maternal instinct I think Vicky will some bad luck along the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha gives you a small lick on your lips followed by a kiss, \u201cThank you [you name] and thank you Tara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat her head and say, \u201cNow come on, I\u2019m hungry for breakfast and you have to eat for two. Then we have work to do and Tara has naps to take.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here for very long yet and you already have me figured out. I guess I\u2019m more predictable than I thought, that\u2019s scary,\u201d Tara says with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Sasha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have to?\u201d She says in a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes now let\u2019s go,\u201d You say with a smile holding a hand out.

Soon he heard the loud clomping of Marie running in the opposite direction as you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering where you should go next you think about Bess probably in some pain from what Sasha told you. But as you look around you see what looks like a white cloud walking around in the grass periodically getting lower and then moments later getting up and moving around some more. Curious, you decide to go investigate what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer you notice it was a big ball of wool. Thinking back to your talk with Sasha you decide it is probably Jane because Sasha did tell you she hadn't been sheared in a really long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you neared you saw two black things on top of the mass of wool twitch and quickly she turns to look at you, she looked like she was about to run when you said \u201cWait please don't run I won't hurt you Jane. I am new to this farm and I was just going around to meet everyone and help them out with there \u201cproblems\u201d.\u201d she stopped and looked at you then relaxed a little. As you looked at her she looked like she was a little pudgy but there was just so much wool you couldn't tell where the wool ended and she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walked up to her and stuck your hand out suddenly making her jump a little then you said \u201cif you want I can shear you, I mean that coat sure looks hot and heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe looks you over and then hesitantly takes your hand. You smile at her and say. \u201cLets head to the barn, I think that is where the shears are.\u201d She nods and follows you still holding your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you find the barn and look kind of lost she quietly takes the lead and pulls you into a small horse stall that was rigged into a private room with high walls and a completely wooden door with no windows or anything. on one side there was a mirror and on the opposite side There was a desk with an electric razor and a tool box on it, and a dusty note in your uncles hand writing that said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear nephew,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nif you are reading this note then that means I have passed on and you have come to take care of my farm. I am leaving this note because I finally lost the strength to shear poor Jane. It just hurt me to much to even try which is why she hasn't been shears in a while.  But that isn't the reason for this note, it is to tell you how she likes to be trimmed (if you haven\u2019t noticed she is shy and doesn\u2019t like to talk.) but over the years I found she preferred to keep some wool over her privates both above and below. Not much just enough to hide these spots (try to blend them so they look nice).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally I wanted to thank you again, there weren\u2019t many people I liked or trusted enough to give this special place to and I am just glad it went to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished reading the note you looked at Jane sitting on a stool looking at a bug that was flying around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and picked up the razor and turned it on. And walked to her back running a straight line down her back you could tell it would take a couple strokes to get the mass of wool off her. It took about 20 minutes to clean off her arms, legs, back and stomach. You were surprised at how good of shape she was in, the more you took off her the better she looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully you trimmed the wool off her breasts leaving a line all the way around like a tube top while shearing off enough so it covers just enough. Then you did the same thing to her lower region giving her a short skit looking patch of wool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to start on her head but she stopped you and pointed to the tool box. You walked over and looked inside. Inside the box you saw some scissors and a straightener thinking you got what she wanted you pulled out the scissors and curler and went to work you told her that you weren\u2019t the best barber but you would give it a shot. She blushed and bowed her head. First thing you did was straighten it careful to avoid her ears. Then you cut it just a little bit so everything was even. You sat there for a couple minutes trying to make sure it looked good. Finally, you stopped and told her to look and see if that was good. She got up and looked at herself in the mirror. She turned from one side to the other and then looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were getting kind of tired of her quietness but asked  \u201cso do you like it?\u201d she smiled and nodded then looked down at the ground as she blushed a deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, well is there anything else I can do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe shook her head still looking at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK I am going to clean up your wool where should I put it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe looked at you then walked over to you genitally grabbed your hand and pulled you out of the room then she walked back in and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there for a moment before saying to yourself \u201ci guess that is her way of saying she will do that.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Luna likes to hang out in the barn, so you better get going.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the barn and look inside, you see that Sasha had meant that literally. Luna was hanging upside-down from one of the barn\u2019s rafters, her wings wrapped tightly around her body, obscuring her face. \u201cHello?\u201d You say, with no response. \u201cHello?\u201d You repeat, louder this time, still nothing. You repeatedly call out to Luna getting progressively louder, but she remains asleep. You look at the revolver in your hand and suddenly realize why Sasha gave it to you. You point it straight up and pull the trigger once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cry of surprise, Luna instantly wakes up and lets go of her perch plummeting towards the ground, flailing her wings. Fortunately, there was a large pile of straw right below her, so she landed unharmed. She irritably gets on her feet, brushing straw off of her body. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d She says angrily, then she sees notices that it is still morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to get fourteen hours of sleep a day! It can\u2019t be later than 9 AM! Who are you anyway?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the new caretaker of the farm.\u201d You say. \u201cSasha told me I should wake you, just so you would know I was here.\u201d Luna visibly calmed down a bit on hearing this. \u201cOh. Well, I\u2019m sorry I yelled at you then. I just don\u2019t  like to be disturbed, you know?\u201d You nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were able to get a good look at her. She was covered from head to tow in black fur, except for a single white stripe stretching across her scalp from her nose to her back of her head. Her ears were long and pointy, standing straight up from her head. Her arms doubled as her wings, each on must have been five feet long at least. Her nose was bright pink, giving her a somewhat cute appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, now that I\u2019ve met you, can I get back to sleep?\u201d She asks. You nod, but as she spreads her wings to fly up to her perch, her stomach growls. \u201cI suppose I had better have a early-morning snack first.\u201d She says, blushing. \u201cMaybe I can get you something.\u201d You offer. \u201cWhat do you eat?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Before you could move you felt her grab your shoulders, completely forgetting the length of her arms she had easily gotten within reach and now while you couldn't feel the claws on her fingers pressing into your skin, you could feel the strength of her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, isn't there something else I could get you, milk, fruit juice, maybe we have some tomato juice that's kind of like blood\" you say trying to keep calm, Luna just shakes her head and takes a step towards you, causing you to take one back. The smile on her face grows as step by step you both move backwards until \"thunk\" you fell your body hit the bard door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiles for a second at you her calm demeanor doing little to soothe your nerves, \"don't worry it doesn't hurt\" she says before she was upon you. She somehow covered the meter length between the two of you in a second her mouth opening revealing her fangs which glittered in the morning sun for just a second before sinking into the area between your shoulder and your neck. You recoiled instinctively your body pressing itself flat against the door as Luna pressed herself against you. True to her word it didn't hurt, and unlike all those vampires movies it didn't seem that she was sucking up the blood, in fact she just let the blood well up from the wound, then she lapped it up. She continued this for a few minutes thankfully it seemed she only took as much as they'd take if you gave blood, so Luna took about a pint as you didn't feel too light-headed as she lifted her head from the wound. You were suprised as Luna pressed her lips against your cheek giving you a bloody kiss \"you were delicious farmer\" she says letting her weight and her body rest on you for a few seconds before taking a step back. \"If you're up late, you should come meet me out in the field, I promise you'll enjoy what you find\" she says before taking a few steps back, jumping, and flying back up into the rafters where she cocooned herself in her wings and went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid back against the door, suddenly all strength leaving your body. You just lay there for a few seconds, finally having the sense to look over at the wound in your upper body. Surprisingly it wasn't bleeding, in fact other than two small almost pinprick sized wounds in your shoulder, it looked like nothing had happened. You sat there for a minute just getting your strength back before standing up, you see a tub and since you were in the barn anyways you decided you might as well milk Bess. Grabbing the tub you pull it over to the one stall that looked occupied. You looked inside to see a black and white cow who had to be Bess as she stood against the back of the wall although she was having difficulty standing, what with the fact there were two pink beach balls hanging from the front of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\" she says her a smile quickly breaking out over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" you reply a small smile crossing your face as she looked at you. She took a single step forward, then rushed towards you seeming to forget about the size of her overfilled mamarries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say you were knocked over into the hay and she stopped, blushing for a second, \"I'm sorry about that, it's just your shoulder\" she says pointing to the wound Luna had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that\" you say waving it off, \"Luna was hungry and well..\" you trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You offered her breakfast, I heard...I don't know why Sasha didn't tell you\" Bess says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, besides I'm not the one with the big problem\" you say indicating Bess' front. She nods and moves back into the stall letting you pull the tub in so it sat between the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over she looks up at you \"ready farmer\" she says, in a soft voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly in reply as you had been a bit...caught up in the sight of Bess leaning over \"just let me know if I do even the slightest thing wrong, this is my first time milking\" you say. Bess nods and you begin, grabbing one nipple between two fingers of each hand you gently push down, and pull forwards a small squirt of milk coming out before you let up a bit let the nipple move back and repeat the process. This continues for a straight half hour, by the end of the session Bess' breasts had deflated greatly in size although you could still see she was a very well-endowed cow, and the tub was completely full of milk. \"Where do I put the milk?\" you ask, Bess indicates a spot on the far wall of the barn and you drag the heavy tub of milk over to the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha will come and get it in a few hours, so you don't have to worry about it\" Bess says, you nod and give off a small sigh letting yourself fall back into the hay. Near instantly Bess was above you \"are you alright?\" she asks concern evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine\" you say but instead of letting you get back up she pushes you gently back into the hay, then seeming to think better of it, lifts your head into her lap. \"Comfy?\" she says as you don't initially react to her action, \"yeah\" you reply quietly, quite embarrassed by how close you were to her. Now that you had time to observe her, Bess was a quite beautiful figure, sure she had \"curves\" but it was in all the right places and even if her beautiful green eyes and her caring personality were very appealing. You just lay there for a while her hand gently stroking over the top of your head, \"thanks Bess\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome\" she softly replies. After a few minutes however you remember that you have other stuff to do, and you were sure even though grooming Marie, may not be high priority, you couldn't imagine how hot Jane must be in all her wool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I need to get going, i've still got other chores to do\" you say sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess nods slowly before she hugged you quite tightly to her chest \"come visit me again, even if I don't need to be milked every day, it can get lonely\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Bess\" you reply, slowly standing up and wiping a few stray strands of hay off your pants. You walked out of the barn, and headed off for the fields where you were sure Jane would be when....</span></div></div>",

You decide not to worry about it, since she was occupied with Sasha. \"Oh, you have such a beautiful dog, sweetie!\" she says to you. As soon as she says that, Sasha's tail instantly stops wagging. This is bad. \"Okay, Bella. Why don't I show you where you'll be sleeping.\" you say, taking her with you, with Sasha following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to your room, Sasha starts growling.

You go to Sasha and pet her head, leaning close to her ear. \"Calm down.\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you tell Bella that she'll be sharing your bed, she squeals in delight. \"Oh, [your name]! You're the best boyfriend ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute Sasha heard the word \"boyfriend,\" she snapped. She starts barking up a storm and goes after Bella, taking bites at her that, thankfully, missed. Bella screams in a panic, and you jump between her and Sasha. \"What is up with you, tonight!\" you say to her. You try to get her out, but she instinctively scratches your arm with the nails on her paws.

She grunts in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you head over to the barn you see Bess in her regular cow form. You give her the OK to turn back into an anthro.

Just don't tell Sasha.\" \"Um, okay...\" You said. \"Hey, if you do me a small favor I'll bring you a sandwich tonight,\" She gives you a suspicious look. \"Um, okay. Sure.  What do you want?\" You were shocked that she would actually agree to do something for you. You say \"because all the others are in animal form, could you do the same until I drive away to take Belle to the airport?\" \"Oh sure, that's easy.\" She said as she turned onto a fox and ran off. Wow. That was the smoothest encounter you'll probably ever have with Vicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got back into the house you looked for belle, but she wasn't in the kitchen. She wasn't in the living room. She wasn't in the bathroom either. She had to be done packing by now, you thought. Well, that is what you THOUGHT.<br>\r\nWhen you found her she was in her room, which was really Sasha's room. You didn't like this, but Tara always slept wherever she wanted and you weren't gonna put Belle in the celler, and if you slept down there she'd ask unwanted questions, so that's how it had to be. You hadn't really been able to explain that to Sasha because you two were almost never alone. You knew you would have some serious talking to do when you got back from the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell was stuffing something in her suitcase. She said \"I just remembered that I left my bra on the hook over there.\" You tried to sound casual, and act casual. You had been acting like this for 3 days. \"Can't forget that,\" you say in a joking manner. She said \"Hey, listen. About that dream I had a few days ago. It was so real! I just can't help thinking about it.\" \"I had a dream like that once\" you say, trying to sound casual. \"Only I had been sky-diving and both my chutes wouldn't open.\" \"And how did I end up in this bed?\" \"Well uh, YOU were the one that fell off Marie. You were knocked out cold. So I brought you here.\" You had never lied faster in your life. That was the one question you were not prepared for. \"Oh. So that explains this bump on my head.\" She said. That did not explain that bump. She got that bump when she fainted, and hit her head in the ground. She looked at her watch and said \"Oh crap, lookit the time! I'm gonna miss my flight!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDropping her off at the airport was uneventful. She went on and on about how much fun she had, but you git the idea that she hadn't had any of the fun she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home you stopped at McDonald's and got a big mac, a large coca cola and large fries. When you got home you parked a little ways down the road and walked the rest of the way to Vicky's den. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?!\" You called into the den \"Oh hi, I was wondering when you'd be coming.\" She said as she walked out of the shadows. You hoped to get out of there as fast as you could. You said \"Hey, I know I said a sandwich but how does a cheese burger and fries sound?\" Her eyes lit up when she heard that. \"great! Wanna come in and share some with me?\" \"Sorry, I gotta go.\" You said as you handed her the bag. \"Okay, how bout a little kiss then?\"  \"Keep dreamin' You said as you walked out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got home, Sasha knew right away you were up to something. \"Okay two things. 1. What took you so long, and, 2. What have you been doing with Vicky!?\"  She yelled. Tara looked at you, then Sasha, then you again. You finally said, \"I saw her today causing some trouble and made a deal with her. She would wait untill tomorrow to cause trouble, and stay on animal form until you had I had dropped belle off at the airport, in return for some food.\" \"You sure you're not lying?\" \"I've done enough lying today already. How did you know by the way? A little bird tell you? Did Luna tell you?(pun not intended) \" \"No, I can smell her on you.\" \"I shoulda Known.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was spent in \"serious talking\" When you were finally done, you started walking upstairs to bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You went over to the window and saw someone almost right on the window sill. For a second you thought it was Tara, but she didn't have that white streak in her face. You turn around and go right out the door. All the way outside. At first you can't see anything, and then suddenly she comes into view. It was Luna. Oh yeah, duh. Tara turned in a long time ago. And how the hell would Tara get on the window sill of the 2nd floor? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was you I saw.\" You said. You didn't really know what to say, you just knew she wanted to talk to you about something. \"Who else would I be?\" she replied. \"Well, for a second I thought you were Tara. But that got me really confused. How would she get to the window you were at? \" \"Yeah, I'd like to see her try. Anyway, I heard something by the driveway, I think it was Vicky. I dont know what she was doing, but what would she be doing at this time of night?\"  \"I made a deal with her, she wasn't supposed to cause any trouble untill tomorrow.\" \"She almost never holds up her end of any deal. And, technically it is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then you heard your truck start. Then you saw your headlights go on. \"Oh hell no...\" You said, and then ran into the house and grabbed a flashlight and a revolver, and loaded it with real bullets. It seemed to have been loaded with blanks. You ran out to the barn, which was pretty near the driveway. Marie called out to you \"Hey! Vicky hit Sasha with something, tied her up and threw her in the back of your truck!\"  \" Can you catch up to it?\" \"If it were day, yes, but I can't see at all out there right now. \"  You held to your flashlight and said, \"we'll have to cope. I can't let her get away with this.\" \"okay grab the saddle-\" \"we don't have time!\" With that she turned into a horse, and you jumped on her back and you shot out the door. You had to hold on to her shoulders so you wouldn't fall off. You shined your flashlight at the ground in front of her. Then you saw the truck. Then your flashlight died. \"Oh crap, just follow the tail lights! You said. You almost caught up when Vicky turned those off, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan Marie started to slow down. Then she stopped. Neither of you could see the truck. You got off Marie, and she turned back into an anthro.\"I'm sorry, I just can't see.\" She said. \"Shit Shit Shit Shit Shit. Now what?\"  Then you heard a voice behind you. It said, \"You need to catch up with that truck? \" You turned around and saw Luna. \"Uh yes!\" \"Okay, turn around.\" You did, wondering what she was going to do. She started flying, and grabbed you under the arms with her feet/talons. Then she took you up into the sky. Then she swooped down over the truck. \"What now?\" She asked. You hadn't really thought about that part. You still had your pistol, you could shoot a tire. But you didn't want to damage your truck, and didn't know what the recoil would do to Luna and her stability while flying. She interupted your train of thought and said \"keep your feet up. Open the door when you can reach it.\" She flew down on the passenger side of the truck. You had no idea how you were going to pull this off, but landing in the back of the truck would mean risking landing on Sasha. So she swooped down and you reached for the handle. Almost... Almost... Got it! You swung open the door and were in the seat before Vicky could turn her head. You gave her a look which would put chills down anybody's spine. Then you put the barrel of your pistol on her heart. You said \"Stop the truck, NOW.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe,pulled over. \"Where the hell did you come from? Humans don't just fall out of the sky!\" She said. You answered \"You're not the one who gets to ask questions here. I thought we had a deal!  You aren't allowed to cause trouble untill tomorrow!\" \"It is tomorrow!\" You look at the clock on the truck and it says 12:34 am. \"So that's what Luna tried to say to Mr earlier...\" You thought. \"Why aren't you in bed!\" \"I couldn't sleep! You must have done something to the food-\" \"Oh crap. There must have been caffiene in that coca cola I gave you. I'm sorry about that. But that's no excuse for what you did. \" \"I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the keys (which you never figured out how she got them) and went to see Sasha. She was out cold. Luna was already there. \"Should I take her home?\" She asked. \"Sure, here.\" You took the housekey off the keychain and gave it to her. When she flew away, you tied Vicky up with the same rope she had tied Sasha with, threw her in the back and drove home.  When you got there, you immediately went down to the celler, leaving Vicky in the truck. There wasn't much in the celler, so you took the bullets and the wine upstairs. All that was left there was a couch and a table. Then you untied Vicky's feet and led her down there. She laid on the couch, and you locked the celler. Then you went to see how Sasha was doing. She was fine, but still out. She would probably be out untill tomorrow. You thanked Luna and She went to find some food. Tara said she would sleep in sasha's room, and would wake you up if anything happened. Then you went to bed. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up the next day at around 10:30 am, with a banging headache. You had dreamt last night, (or rather, this morning,) about every possible way that last night could have went wrong. Everything from Luna dropping you, to landing and killing Sasha, to trying to shoot your trucks tire but having the truck blow up in everybody's faces, to accidentally shooting Sasha... You woke up with a start at that one, REALLY glad it was a dream and that you were finally awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You got up, changed your clothes, and then went to see how Sasha was doing. When you peeked into the room, you saw both Tara and Sasha asleep. That wasn't like Sasha, she was usally awake a long time ago. But today was an exception for everybody. Heck she had been hit on the head with something hard!  Your thoughts had been interupted when you heard a scratching sound, coming from the celler door. You grabbed the shotgun above the fireplace, and walked over to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you're finally here! I was wondering if you were just gonna leave me here.\" She said. \"Do you have any idea what time it is?\" You answered,\"Stop complaining. After what you did last night, do you really expect me to rise at whatever time you got up and just let you out or make you food or all that nice stuff? Or to even give a damn about you? You're not a guest, your a prisoner. Now I'll bring you some food, but nothing fancy\" You closed the door, locked it and went to the chicken coop. These had been the only things not disturbed last night, (maybe Jane too,  you didn't know) and you grabed a few eggs. You then went and grabbed a peach and went back to the celler. You gave the food to her, and then went to milk bess. By the time you were done, Sasha was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went inside to check on her, and found her standing up, displeased at the time. \"What happened?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered, \"You probably won't believe me, so you should ask Marie and Luna. They saw. Oh, and Vicky is locked in the celler.\" \"WHAT!?\" \"I said, Vicky is locked in the celler.\"  \"Okay. What did she do this time?\" \"Basically what happened was I was talking to Luna when my truck started. Then the headlights went on. I grabbed a flashlight and that revolver. Then I jumped on Marie, (not literally) and we chased my truck. Then my flashlight died. Then Vicky turned off the tail lights and we were blind. Then luna helped me get in the truck and I made her stop with the help of Smith and wesson here.(you held up the revolver) Luna took you home, I tied Vicky up and locked her in the celler. She can't handle caffeine worth a damn.\" She said, \"I remember hearing something outside, and getting hit, but then everything went black\" \"She had tied you up and put you in the back of the truck.\" You had to admit, she was taking this well. But then you started to get the idea that she didn't believe you. \"I think I'll go talk to Marie. I'm not gonna wake Luna cause if what you said is true, she deserves to be left alone. Why is it 11:00 already? I NEVER sleep in this late.\" You gave her a smug look. \"Maybe its because you were hit on the head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the doorbell rang. Sasha went to answer it, and you were close behind her. It was a fox, just like Vicky, but younger. Much younger. She looked about 10. Sasha said\"Well hello Tali, what are  doing here? And where's Vicky? \" you could tell \"Tali\" was scared. There were tears in her eyes. She said simply, I don't know.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha let Tali in, and you dragged Sasha off to a corner. \"Who is that?\" You asked. She replied, \"That's Tali, Vicky's sister. I almost never see her.\"  You were interupted by Tali, who was starting to cry. \"Where's Vicky? I need her. She disappeared last night.\" You decided it was best to tell her the truth. You told her everything. (it would be dull to write it a third time and just wast time and space.)  The only thing she wanted was to see Vicky. She begged you to let her go, but you had no idea what to do. You let Tali go down into the celler, where you heard a shout of joy and then a lot of talking. You talked to Sasha about what to do with Vicky. In the end you decided to </span></div></div>",

You tried to reason with her, but to no avail. When she swung at you though, Sasha had her in the celler, door locked and bolted before you could say \"knife.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha, I need to get some things.\" You say, grabbing the keys. \"What do you have in mind?\" I have some things back in California that I want. I have also been paying rent for an apartment I don't even visit. So I'm gonna move out of there and bring some things here.\"  \"How long will you be gone?.\" \"well, that depends. I don't have a computer here to book a flight with. Also, that truck out there? That's not mine, but an airport rental. And I'm paying for that on top of my other car payments. I'll have to drive my car back up here. So, a week maybe? \" \"Um, okay, can I come with you?\" \"Well, I wish. But we can't let anyone know you're an anthro, so you'll have to be an animal almost all week. And they don't allow dogs on planes. So you'd have to ride in a cage in the back of the plane for 10 hours. Then when we get there Belle will be all over me,  so you'll have to be careful. And then she'll wonder why I brought you, leading to unwelcome questions. Then there's the ride back.  My car is a Corvette. It has two seats, not designed for dogs, not really designed for comfort for humans either. You'll have to ride in that for 3 days untill we get back here. Then the hotels will either charge through the roof to let a dog in, or you'll have to sleep in the car. Plus I need you to hold the fort here. You did pretty well when uncle derrick died, can you do it again?\" \"Well, okay, I guess...\" She really seemed disappointed, but you couldn't do anything about that. \"What about Vicky and Tali?\" She asked? \"I think they should stay here until I get back. Tali can be free, Vicky can only leave to use the bathroom. When that happens, Tali will take her place in the celler. That way, she would be leaving behind her sister of she tries to run. At meal times, or whenever you open the celler door, either you or Tara should have the shotgun. As for the meals, they shouldn't be fancy. Raw eggs are fine, scraps are fine, maybe a peach or two a day. But it shouldn't cause you any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, you got straight into the truck and went to the airport. You booked a flight for tomorrow and went home to pack. You had all your stuff at home, so you packed the necessities for a 10 hour trip. Basically nothing. You grabbed a book at the airport book shop, for one heck of a bad price. You left your cell phone with Sasha, because the dark didn't have a phone, and you had a home phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that it would be hard to pull this off without letting belle know in some way... There were now 3 girls that wanted you. There was no way you were choosing Vicky, so make that two. Sasha would be hurt in a few ways if you didn't choose her. Plus you and belle didn't go very well at the last meeting. She never really had any fun, and by now, you thought, she may have found another guy. Telling her was out of the question. Try telling her that the person you love is a creature you didn't even know existed before you moved to the farm, that that creature she actually saw, and you had made her believe (code for lied) that it was a dream. Then, she would only want to see this mysterious creature, and then soon it would be public, and sooner or later there would be scientists involved... No. Not happening. You decide to sneak in to town. How hard can it be? You had lived in a city, with a large population. We'll see. Your Corvette wasn't a stealthy car, either.  A flashy blue/purple checkered paint job, fancy underbody lights, EVERYONE knew it was yours. It wasn't new York, but that city never really slept either. What should you do? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One lone guy was walking up the escalater when a lady on the top floor tripped, throwing the pen she had in her hand on to the escalator. The guy slipped on the pen when he was 5 feet from the top of a two story high escelator.  Then he fell backward, and soon he was falling down the up escalator, falling down many stairs but actually moving very slow. He was a slinky on an escalater. Never stopping, never progressing either. You just had to laugh at the sight. You reached down to get your phone to take a video when- you remembered Sasha had it. You went and stopped him from falling down the up escalated and when you looked at him you saw that he was pretty badly beat- up. He thanked you, and you ran to catch your plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first half hour of the flight went fine. You were suprised to see the unfortunate escalater man had the same flight as you. Eventually you had to go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done, and were washing your hands, you heard a scream. Or rather, a bunch of screams, all at once. You looked out the door, and saw that the escalator guy had taken a wine bottle with a long neck, and broke the cork and the rim off, leaving him with a Sharp edge and a sturdy handle. With this weapon he had stabbed the security guy You close the door. You had noticed that most of the people on the plane were women, children and old people. He had already killed the man that could help you, so you were on your own against this foe. You looked at yourself in the mirror, wondering what you were going to do.  There were no weapons to be had, wait... The MIRROR! You smashed the mirror with your fist as hard as you could. You got a bloody set of knuckles, but had also found your weapon. A triangle shaped piece of glass, that was pretty thick for a mirror, and was about 9 inches long. You cut a piece of your shirt off, wrapped it around the end of it for a safer handle. You walked out of the bathroom, \"knife\" in hand. The bathroom was at the back of the plane, and the man was trying to get to the pilots, at the front. Then he turned around, and faced you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man opened his mouth to say something. But you spoke first. \"Wow. You look pretty beat up after the escalater incident. You sure you don't want to surrender now?\" Stalling me won't change anything. Were 45 minutes in to a 10 hour flight. And the pilot doesn't know what happened, so that won't change. \" \"I guess that means only one of us is getting off of this plane alive, and I intend to be that person. Parents, cover the eyes and ears of your children. What may happen here will scar them for life-\" with that, he ran at you, \"bottle\" in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 minutes later you both have cuts and bruses. He had the cuts, due to the nature of your weapon, and you had the bruises due to the nature of his, you were able to avoid the edge on that bottle.  Eventuality you caught his bottle, kneed him in the balls, punched him in the face with your left, grabbed his bottle with your right as he fell to the ground. He sat up, with his and your weapon at his neck and heart. A little boy, as if on cue, ran to get the pilots. He banged and banged on the door, and eventually  the co-pilot came out, and saw what had happened. Then the flight attendant, a female, came out from a corner and explained what had happened. You thought she used the word \"hero\" a little too much. The co-pilot went and got some zip-ties from somewhere, and you tied the escalater man up. You sat down in your seat, and were immediately upgraded to first class at no charge by the pilot. For the rest of the flight you were praised like a hero. You claimed it was all chance, saying to people, \"I guess I was in the right place at the right time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got out of the airplane you were greeted by a bunch of reporters and they made it hard to het back to your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to your apartment you were greeted by the phone ringing.

You said, \"Hello, you have reached (NAME). I am currently not able to answer the phone right now, so please leave your name and number in a short message at the click.\" With that you hung up the phone. Yes that was a little mean, but you wanted to get in and out of town without all this publicity. Then the phone rang again. It couldn't be Sasha you knew, the time zones are different and she would have been in bed 2 hours ago. This time the regular answering machine answers. The person leaving a message was Belle! You thought fast. Then you picked up the phone right before she finished her message. \"Hello Belle? Yeah sorry I was in the bathroom. Oh. Yeah that's me on the television... No I'm fine, he was fine too. Its wierd. Anyway, I just wanted to suprise you when I got into town, I'm moving to to my uncles-er-my farm. What's that? Oh. I was actually hoping that that would happen. I found someone else too- no I'm not angry. That's fine. I knew this would happen. No I said that already, I'm not angry. Anyway, ill be out of town in 4 days. Okay, see ya.\" Well that fixed the problem of sneaking out of town in a flashy car. Now you had to see if you can get out of town on time and avoid reporters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your tv and its devices,  your CPU, and all of its toys, your lamps, your gun and its equipment, and a few other things, and discontinued the services you were paying for like phone, internet, rent, etc, and also went shopping for some \"gadgets\" like night vision goggles, a gps tracker in case Vicky stole your car again, and a tranquilizer gun, in the course of a few days. During those few days whatever time you weren't spending packing or sleeping you spent being interviewed, getting a medal, that kind of stuff. The presedent wanted you to come to dc so he could decorate you himself. Yes, it wasn't everyday that you prevent another 9 - 11 and the presedent wanted to give you a medal, but you couldn't be gone that long. You thanked him, but had to say no. So the mayor decorated you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that was finally done, and you could take the fake smile off your face, you were able to make it home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you for home, it was about 2 am eastern time zone, and about. 11 pm western time zone, and everyone was in bed. So you decided to go to bed as well, without waking anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reminded you of the first night. You walked in, and saw the kitchen, and saw that Sasha had installed a 2x4 over the celler door, and then went into the living room, saw the fireplace roaring; and Tara, curled up in a ball in front of it. Just like your first night. But this time you kept your distance. You put on your new night vision goggles and saw, and avoided her tail. Then you saw Tali, curled up on the couch. Odd. She must have grown on Sasha or Tara pretty much, or they wouldn't have let this happen. \"Oh well,\" you thought, \"I'll figure this out tomorrow. With that you went to bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, you thought you would have a little fun. So you got up earlier than everyone else, and made. Breakfast for everyone. You took yours upstairs, and left a bowl of milk and two plates of Bacon and eggs on the table at the correct spots. You then went upstairs to your took and looked at your watch, got confused, reset the time zones and then looked at your watch. 7:27. Any minute now... You started setting things up in your room. You put your computer on the table, hooked it up to the tv, hooked the electronic piano up to the laptop- and then you heard something. You peeped out the door of your room and just saw Sasha walk down the stairs. Then you listened. \"Well Tara, it was nice of you to make breakfast for me and Tali\" \"But I didn't. I thought you did.\" \"What? I just got up. Tali?\" \"Wasn't me\" \"well then who the heck made this?\" \"I did.\" You said as you walked down the stairs, with an ear to ear smile. You then braced yourself as Sasha came flying at you, and almost knocked you down in a hug. She kept saying stuff like \"Oh (name) you're finally back! I was worried sick after hearing what happened on the plane on the radio. Your not hurt are you? Was he hurt? Didja kill him? Wow look at that car in the driveway! Is that yours? It is?\" To every question she asked you could always answer with a simple yes or no. Tara didn't really jump on you the way Sasha did, she just wondered how you got here without waking them up, and why you didn't wake them up. Tali gave a nervous \"hi\", and that was all. You knew exactly what she wanted, but couldn't give it to her just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your chores, and then heard from Tara that they needed more wood for the fireplace. But you couldn't do that just yet. Now no one ever came down the road unless they were going to your farm, so you used that to your advantage. You installed a security system. And about 70 yards down the road from your farm you put a motion sensor out on the edge, well hidden, so that when a car came by, it would trigger an alarm by the house that no human ear could hear from that distance. Then everyone would know, and could change into animal form if needed. You put a laser beam across the barn and stable doors, so Vicky couldn't get in without tripping the alarm. You also put in a special alarm that was ultrasonic. Sasha said it was very loud, and you could barely hear anything. This you put in the barn to wake Luna if necessary. You put about 15 security cameras around the place, and 2 were watching the road, just in case. You reinforced the window locks and door locks, and put your glocks in a few convienant places so you would have them if needed. That airport incident really scared you, but that wasn't the only reason you did all this stuff. Vicky and unwanted supprise visitors were the others. Now that that was done, you could start getting some firewood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dead tree in the front yard that looked like of was going to fall, and you decided it was a danger to the house.  Now you needed a chainsaw. So you went to the stables, and found nothing, and went to the barn, and found an axe, a hatchet, a splitting mall and some brush trimmers.  You got started, and in two hours you had cut down the tree, and had cut it into pieces. Now all you had to do was use the splitting mall, and chop it up even more, and then handle the brush, pick up sticks, that sort of thing. As you were splitting the large chunks the alarm rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran inside and looked at video footage. A blue Ford focus was coming to your farm! You told everyone to disguise themselves, and then ran back out in the front yard to cut the wood, as if this had never happened. As you saw the car pull in, you thought about if there was anything you forgot. Sasha was good, Tali and Vicky were in the celler, Tara was good, bess was good, Marie was good Jane was good, Luna was- oh Shit!  She was in the barn, hanging from the raftors. Directly in front of the driveway. You never got to tell her what the alarm was for. You kept your cool as you kept chopping wood as if nothing else could be more important. The man got out of his car, and started walking your way. At least he didn't see Luna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said. \"Hey, are you (name)? Hi I'm Steve higgens and im with the-\" \"you're yet another reporter who wants to get his own take on what happened on that plane last Thursday.\" You interupted. You whipped out a notebook and started writing. You wrote a small note, which said \"handle Luna!\" And said \"it says here that you're the 24th guy to come and try to talk with me about that.\" Swinging the splitting mall and chopping some wood. He replied, \"Uh yes, sorry to bother you. A little advice: if you don't handle this now, (swing) they'll just send someone else again and again until they get the story they want.\"  \"Wow. I already explained what happened 23 times and twice on national television. What more do you want?!?!\"  (swing) \"well, I just wanted to tell you that the man that attacked you was traced back to Saudi Arabia. (swing) As you may know, there were a lot of terrorists there. We traced from there a few more back to the us and arrested 6 terrorists. Because of you we were able to save 500,000 lives.(swing)  because of this, and all the publicity, a common question is \"Where did he go?\" And \"why did he move to a farm?\" I'm here to try and answer those questions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about this for a moment. There was a hill in your back yard... And maybe you could... Yeah. You could. \"Let me show you around, and maybe you'll see why.\" You walked back around to the backyard. \"Here\", you said \"I can do almost whatever I want. I'm too far away from anybody to bother them with any kind of noise. You grabbed a glock. He gulped. You gave him a look and said \"I'm  not gonna shoot you... If that's what your wondering. Here\".  You gave him a can that used to hold tomato paste. \" throw it. Here I can do things like this.\" He threw the can, and bang bang bang bang, there were three holes in the can. (you missed once)  \"there are very few places where one can do that without getting yelled at.\" The real reason you did this is so Luna would wake up. You timed the shots so that the first one would wake her up, the second would drown out the crash, that usually occurred when she was woken up, and the third and fourth for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You took him into the house and offered him a drink. He declined, and during this time Sasha barked and barked like any other dog would. Sasha the note and she kept barking, but you knew she knew what had to be done. You \"shooed\" her outside, and she went to handle Luna. Tara, now that the dog was gone, was a lot more friendly. She walked up, sniffed the man, and walked away. \"Do the cat and dog get along?\" He asked. \"Yes. They've never had a fight that I've seen. What I was trying to show you, was that it doesn't matter what I do here, but in the city there are so many limitations. The road you came from? That's my driveway. I can go as fast as I want in my driveway. I can shoot, I can make noise and nobody will care. That's why I'm here. Privacy and freedom. Now I've got to finish that tree while there's still daylight.\" \"Ah yes, I'll be on my way.\" He said. \"Thank you for your time.\" With that he walked out the door, and you followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he drove away, you went to the barn. Where was Luna?  You looked up, and there she was, a lot smaller now, as a normal bat. You said \"hey Luna, its clear now.\" She flew down and turned into an anthro right in front of you. \"What was that about?\" We had a visitor, another reporter. Now he's gone. Hey by the way, can you hear this?\" You turned on the high pitched alarm. \"Are you kidding me? That would wake me up anyday.\" \"perfect. If another unwanted visitor shows up, that alarm will go off. You know what to do.\"  \" Oh okay. What was with the gunshots then?\" I had to wake you, but without making that guy suspicious.\" \"Clever. All right, I'm going back to sleep.\" \"allright, see ya.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to congradulate the others, this had went pretty well. Now you had to deal with Vicky. You let her out of the celler, and let Tali go as well. You never told them about the new gear, you knew the less they knew about it the better.  You told her the next time she did something like that again she would be locked in the celler again, for 2 weeks. And if she did anything to your car... You gave her a look as you said that. A look that meant \"instant death\" that being said, she ran off into the woods.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Sasha helped you with the chores. She milked bess on the right while you milked her on the left. She grabbed another brush and helped groom Marie. She helped shear Jane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was getting the eggs, she saw Vicky, with a chicken under her arm. She for angry at this and threw a punch. What you saw after that, you didn't understand. You heard a large Zap, and saw a circle, about 2feet in diamitor, and what you saw through it was... Some sort of alley!? You were just who'd to get a glimpse before it disappeared. Then you noticed Tara, who had seen it from the window. She had the widest eyes you had ever seen. You went into the house. \"Tara,\" you said, \"was that-\" \"Yes... It was!\" \"Did they ever figure out how the portals kept appearing?\" She shook her head, still dumbfounded. \"Do you know what that really was? It was static electricity! Sasha's like a walking capacitor. She must have charged up when she had contact with bess, Jane, and Marie.\" She looked at you confused. \"Then why am I here? And Luna? she never had contact with me or her on the day we came here\" \"You two must have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"  It looked like a soap bubble wall would. As long as there was no hole, or a break in the circle, it would last, you figured. You asked, \"Tara? Would you like to go home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever tell you what my life was like there?\" She said, with tears forming up in her eyes. She continued. \"All my life I've had it hard. As a child, I was often picked on for my tail being so long. It didn't help that my full name is Tara Longtail. I would often get into fights at school, and I ended up getting expelled. I never exactly loved my parents either. They were still treating me like I was two when I was fifteen! So I ran away from home. For a few months I lived on the streets alone, eating out of garbage cans. During that time I became addicted to milk, cream, dairy in general. We cats naturally have a taste for it, but it became a constant craving for me. Then one day, I met this guy who said he felt pity for me, and he wanted to help me. He invited me to come stay with him. He even treated me to the first decent meal I had eaten in months. But when we got to his house, he said I wasn\u2019t going to get to stay there for free. I told him I had no money, but that wasn\u2019t what he was talking about.\" You instantly knew where this was going, and tears began to flowing from her eyes again. \u201cNeedless to say, he soon realized his mistake after I clawed him in the eyes and escaped. The point is, if one doesn't strike out well, or if you're different in any way...\" The look on her face said it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, you and your uncle have given me a life here, that I wouldn't trade for any other.\" \"Would you trade it for the same thing, only without Vicky? \" She looked at you with a look of excitement. \"I'd get rid of Vicky any day.\" \"Good. Now I'll have to stop Sasha from killing her. I'll send her home. Somehow, I'll need to find another material though, that Sasha can make the portal by touching. If Vicky leaves, she can charge, but without Vicky she can't discharge and make a portal.\" Tara smiled at you and said \"Maybe you should just wait a week, and then you'll have a rug in the living room, and Sasha will be able to use that.\" You laughed, and ran and broke up the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your chores, and went inside and got on the computer. You designed a large rectangle, that was about 8 feet tall, and 15 feet wide. You then went to the local hardware store, and bought the materials necessary to build it. You also went to the local security store, and bought 4 stun guns, and then went to an electronics store and bought a power supply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought this stuff home and assembled the rectangle.  At each corner of the rectangle you put a stun gun. You hoped that these would supply power to the portal. The power they put through the air was almost similar to the static electricity, but a lot more powerful.  You then hacked into the stun guns and hooked them up to the power supply, so thier power could be raised or lowered  or shut off if needed. You then called Sasha, and explained what this thing was.  She didn't understand hoe it worked until you told her the 4th time, and it still didn't really make sense to her. Eventually she agreed to try it. Now you needed Vicky's consent. You went down to her den, alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had brought a glock, just in case, in a holester on your hip. Ever since the plane incident you always had one there. You walked up to the entrance of her den. \"Vicky!? You here!?\"  \"Yes, I'm here.\" She said as she walked out of the darkness. \"Whazzup? You finally want to have some fun?\" \"Keep dreaming.\" \"Then why are you here?\" \"Well, you see, I um, well, let's just put it like this. How'd you like to go home?\" \"I am home. There's no way to get back to my home planet if that's what you're talking about.\" \"Actually there is.\" Her eyes lit up with curiousity. \"But I need your help.\"  \"Why me?\" She asked. \"Why not Sasha? Or Tara?\" \"Because your fur is the only kind I know of that can start the portal. But here's the hard part: you'll have to work with Sasha.\" \"Um... No.\" That simple no, stopped you in your tracks. You knew they were enemies, but maybe you could appeal to her better nature. \"Why not raise Tali in a world you and her were familiar with? Around friends? Around people like you?\" Just then Tali came around the corner, apparently eavesdropping. \"you can get us home?\" She said. \"Um yes, but Vicky has to help. We can't do it without her.\" \"What about me? Could you do it with me?\" You thought about that for a moment. They were sisters, why not? \"Probably...\" Was the best response you could think of. \"Then I'm doing it. Come on Sis.\" With that she started walking in the direction of the house. Vicky reluctantly followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the house, you had Vicky and Tali stay outside, while you went and got the others. When everyone was there, except Luna,  you explained to then what the rectangle was, and how you thought it would work. You got a metal stick from the garage that was about 10 feet long.  You held on the corner making a small triangle. You said \"If you can get the portal to get on this triangle, it should work. Think of it like a soap bubble. Transfer the bubble to the triangle. Then I will spread it out over the whole thing.\" Sasha rubbed her hand on Bess's arm for 30 seconds, and did the same to Marie and Jane. Then she made an arc between her finger and thumb. Then Vicky did the same. And when they joined the arcs to make a circle between them, it worked!  They were holding a portal! They quickly tried to transfer it to the triangle and it worked, until just before you turned on the taser in that corner. Pop. On the second try, you turned it on just in time, and then turned on the others, and moved the stick along the rectangle, making it bigger and bigger, until finally the whole rectangle was holding a portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked through. What you saw was a very blurry picture of an alley. Then you turned the tazers up.as you did the image got clearer,  until it was clearer than blu-ray. It just had a hint of blue to it. You then saw a confused anthro fox, almost like Vicky but male, and about Tali's age. He Looked at the portal that had opened up in front of him, said something. But nobody could hear him. You took your camera, taped it to the end of the metal stick, and poked it through You waited about a minute until you thought he was done talking, and then brought it back and played the video. What he said was a lot of questions like \"Who are you? How did you do that? Where is the other end of the portal? Is that Tali?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard that last question, you said to Tali, who was in tears, \"Is that your brother?\" She nodded her head, and you took another video, of you this time. By the time you were done,  there was a large crowd on the other side. Yet nobody dared to touch the portal. You made the camera play the video, and stuck it through the portal. It said to them \"My name is (name). I am a human. Explaining how I made this portal would be difficult useing a device like this. My end of the portal is on a planet that humans call earth. Until four years ago, the only intelligent life on this planet was humans. Four years ago, which would be about two years of your time, 8 anthros were sucked onto a dimensional hole. Then they found themselves here. They are all alive and well. They are Sasha, the husky, Tara the cat, News the cow, Marie the mare, Jane the ewe, Luna the bat, who is not present at this time, and Vicky and Yes, of is Tali, who are Vixens. Now nobody will be coming through the portal just yet, I'm not sure if it is safe. I need to do a few tests and then  it should be ready to use. Also, the portal cannot be opened without a certain combination of anthros. You see, these dimensional holes are made by...\" You explained to them how it worked, and told them that you would bring another portal to thier side, so contact could be made from both sides. As you watched them listen to you message, you saw what would have been loud cheering when the names were  announced.  Then you shut the portal down, and went to get a mouse from the pet store. When you got back, you put it on a tray, restarted the portal, and tested it. The mouse</span></div></div>",

It felt like touching water, but when you withdrew your finger it was not wet. You then tried it again, sticking your whole hand in. The portal seemed to be about a half inch thick. You held your breath, and closed your eyes, and then stepped through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you heard was loud cheering. Then you looked at  them, and then looked back at the portal. It looked the same as it did on your side except you saw your driveway, and with an ear to ear smile motioned for them to come. Tali started running toward you.  Then, something happened. It started to look funny, and then blurry. Then, you saw Sasha running, then POP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked, and then told yourself (not out loud) to remain calm. You were really about to panic. Then some little boy in the crowd said \"What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know...\" Was all you could say.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOV change to Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked. He made it. And there's Tali, going to see her brother. Wow, you didn't know they had a brother.  Then you saw Vicky walking toward the corner of the portal. Then she turned a knob. \"Vicky what are you doing?\" Then the portal started to fade. \"Vicky NO!\" You yelled as you ran at her. Then POP! Then WHAM! You hit Vicky right in the nose. She fell to her back. \"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!? WHAT WOULD EVER DRIVE EVEN YOU TO DO THIS!?! NOW HE'S TRAPPED THERE!\"  \"An improvement I'd say.\" She replied. You kicked her. \"WHAT? YOU NASTY HEARTLESS BITCH! Wow. I don't even think that's insulting enough you fucking perverted asshole!\" Then Tara grabbed your shoulder. \"Hey hey hey calm down,\"She said. \"Were all still here, so we can make it again.\"  Vicky got up. You said \"Well that's true. Alright. Tara, you stand by the computer and hold the stick. I'll go \"charge up\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOV change to Vicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. Gotta find some way to escape. Fast. I gotta bring Tali with me too. Oh my. Look at that car.  There's no way Marie would be able to keep up with THAT. \"Hey Tali! Come here.\" She came slowly, wondering what you wanted. When she finally got there you threw her in the car, jumped in the driver seat and smashed your claw into the ignition.

You seemed to be on the side of a road, in a city. In the alley you saw a dumpster, a trash can... It looked like a normal alley. What stunned you was how normal everything looked. Except you never saw a single human. Then you were approached by a bat. She looked just like Luna, but different in some way which you never could figure out. Then it spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sir? Are you the human that discovered the secret of the dimensional holes?\" You nodded. \"Listen. My name is Heather. I lost my sister two years ago, I was wondering if you knew anything about her.\" Well, you knew exactly who she was talking about. You said \"Let me guess. Her name is Luna, she looks just like you and is nocturnal.\" \"Well, all bats are nocturnal. But yes that's her. Do you know anything about her?\" \"Well, she is nocturnal, and I'm not, so I don't know as much as I'd like, but I have a incident where she really helped out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in the other planet, there was a fox named Vicky. She just LOVES to be a pain in the ass. In fact I believe she is the reason the portal closed on me. She also hates Sasha, a husky, to the point of all out war. So one night she abducted her, and threw her in the back of my truck, and drove away. Marie the mare couldn't keep up due to the lack of light. Luna was the only one that could see, and she basically appeared out of nowhere, and helped me get in the truck. Vicky spent a week locked in the celler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back to Luna's POV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up to about 300 feet up, and looked down and saw the car. You had grabbed Sasha backwards due to the rush, and you couldn't flip her around without risking dropping her. Sasha said \"Okay, I told you I wasn't afraid of flying, but this is a little intense!\" You would have given her a look, but neither if you could see each other's faces. You replied, \"Really? I don't think so... Then again, I do this every night, and you haven't left the ground since the airplane incident on our planet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky appeared to have taken the road along the gorge, and 200 feet down, at the bottom of the gorge there was a deep river. You asked \"Sasha? Did Vicky ever figure out how (Name) got in the truck with her that night?\" \"Um, I don't think so.\" \"Good, because were gonna do the same thing. Hey, it looks like Tali is there too... Why is she standing up? Sasha, can you hear what she's saying?\" Suddenly Sasha panicked. \"SHE'S GONNA JUMP!\" Oh Shit. What would make her do that!?  There was no way Tali would survive the landing into the river. And even if she did, the chances were pretty good that she would have broken something. And, the chances of her being able to swim were lousy. You thought fast. You said \"Sasha, do you trust me?\" All you heard was \"Oh crap. Do we have any other choice? Yes, I trust you. Don't mess up-Waugh! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you threw Sasha up in the air over the gorge, and swooped down as fast as you could. Tali jumped, and you caught her 50 feet from the water. You set her down on the side of the river, and then went for Sasha. She was falling fast. She had maneuvered into a diving position, which was not good for you. Also, she was heading for the one damn rock in the river. You again moved as fast as you could, which was faster than you ever thought you could, and caught her mere inches from the rock. You then flew up to Vicky, who had slowed down considerably because she thought her sister had just committed suicide. The engine noise, along with Vicky's crying, made it easy to sneak up on her, and after catching Sasha, you found that she was facing the right way. Before you dropped Sasha in the seat, you said to her, \"Don't kill her.\" Then, you dropped Sasha, and then vanished under the gorge, to find Tali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found her, frantically trying to climb the wall out of the gorge, but it wasn't going well. When she saw you, she ran, and almost tackled you with an embrace. She said a lot of things, but the two that really mattered, (and the ones that you really could understand,) were \"Thank you\" and \"Why did you save me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply asked her, \"Why did you jump?\" Her answer shocked you. \"Because I and Vicky are the only ones that you need to start the portal, and I wouldn't leave (NAME) in a world he's never known.  I'm not like Vicky. I was hoping I would survive, and be able to start the portal for you.\" You answered, I saved you because that's what I thought. But what made you think you would survive?\" \"I thought if I landed in a stick position, I'd be okay. But flying, (without wings,) is difficult.\" \"Well, nobody would survive falling 200 feet like that, (unless you're me, I do it all the time) and there is also no way in hell that you would be able to survive the way you were gonna land, you would have broken at least 5 or so ribs. Now listen. Vicky doesn't know I saved you. Do NOT tell her I saved you, just say you were lucky during your landing. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard something. You looked up and saw <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh SHIT. You shoved Tali into the river, (for show reasons,) and ran straight for the wall underneath Sasha. You were completely hidden, because there was a ledge above you that hid you, she couldn't see you from there. You listened, and you heard both Sasha and Vicky yelling Tali's name, and then saying something like \"I'll go down on the left, you go to the right.\" It sounded like Sasha, so you went to the left, which would've been their right. You ran right past her, and flew away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your POV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had tried to make Luna sound like the hero in your story, but truth be told, it didn't work so well. Heather simply said \"You know, I thought she was dead...  I thought I had a chance at seeing her again... But now she's gone....\" Her eyes forming tears as she said this. Then she started to cry, and then you remembered. You said, \"It's not hopeless you know\" she stopped crying, and said simply, \"What?\" You put your hand on her shoulder. I made the portal, and I know how it works, I may be able to do it again. She dried her tears, and said, \"Really? Can you get me there? Or to earph?\" \"Well, it's actually pronounced 'earth', but theoretically yes. I just hope I can figure out how to make the tazers...\" \"You know, tomorrow, a man named Dr. Lansing will be looking for you. He has been studying and trying to figure out how to control or prevent the dimensional holes you came by. We didn't want to lose anybody else, so we hired him. He may be able to help you.\" \"Why not now?\" \"Well, you are talking to a bat. Need I say more?\" She was right, it was very dark out now, and had been for some time. Funny, it shouldn't be this late on earth, or rather, back home (its always that late somewhere on earth) It should be about 8 o'clock right now. She continued. \"That reminds me. Shouldn't you be in bed? \" \"Well, the time zones are a little different there, I still have a couple hours left. But how am I going to so this? I have no money, no way to get a job...\" \"Tell you what. If you work on the portal, I would be more than happy to provide for you. Dr. Lansing has funds coming out his ears, he could pay for the portal. You know, he still hasn't figured out how the dimensional holes appear.\" That left you wide eyed, and you physically recoiled. \"WHAT!?!? I figured it out on a lazy afternoon for crying out loud!\" \"Then it shouldn't be hard.\" She said smiling. \"Come on, let's go to my apartment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started walking over to a car that looked like it was made 3 or 4 years ago. You both got in, and she started driving. You looked out a window, and were shocked at what you saw. The only creatures you saw were the ones you would expect to see at night on earth, except, they were anthro. All of them. You never saw a \"Regular\" animal. But that wasn't what shocked you. All that made sense. What shocked you was the fact that everything seemed so normal. Just like L.A., or Chicago, or NY etc. Tall buildings, flashy lights in appropriate places, (ie. Theater) huge traffic jams, all this had used to be the norm for you. It was so wierd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Heather interupted your train of thought by asking \"What is it like on your world?\" You thought about this for a second. \"Well, this city actually looks just like any other city I've seen on earth. It's really shocking. I lived in a city like this until my uncle died. You see, he left me a farm in his will. So I went there to see it, and that's when I found that there were 6 anthros living there. Now, being a human, and having never seen something like that before, I was dumbfounded. In then end I moved there.\" Just then you pulled into a parking lot. Heather led you into a building, you took the elevator to the top floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got in to her apartment, she told you to make yourself at home, and that there should be some food that you could eat in the fridge somewhere. She showed you a room, which was apparently the guest bedroom. The room was empty, except for what looked like a chin-up bar in the middle. You figured that that was what bats slept using. She then pulled a sleeping bag from somewhere, and said you could use that. Then she said she had to go to work, and would send Dr. Lansing an email. He would probably be there at 9 the next morning. You thanked her, and she jumped out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the fridge, and saw what must have been jars of blood. You saw in the back corner of the fridge what looked like... Pizza!? This was so wierd. You ate the pizza without even putting it in the microwave, and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, you were awakened by a loud noise. A VERY loud noise. You jumped up, wide awake, and covered your ears. You then went to see what made the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a phone. It must have been set to ring that loud are certain hours of the day. Bats must be very hard sleepers you thought. By the time you figured out that it was a phone, the answering machine kicked on. You heard \"Hello, you've reached the residence of Heather Blackwing. I am not currently available to receive your call, so please leave your name and number and a short message at the tone and I will return your call at the earliest, or latest convinence, depending on your race. (Beeeeeep) Hello, this is Dr. Butch Lansing. If there is a (name) in the house, would he please come to the phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the phone. \"Hello, this is (Name).\" \"Hey, I'm in the parking lot in the only orange car there, Heather told me in an email that you knew about the dimensional holes, and that you would be here. She also explained your situation.\" \"Well, I didn't tell her the entire story really.\"  \"Well, come on down, I'll get you to my  lab and we can solve this.\" \"Okay, be right there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung up the phone, and made sure you had everything. You had your phone, great. It had some information about the portal on it in the calculator memo. You looked at it and found that it had half a charge, not good, you would have to be careful. Your glock had never left your side, good. Were you all there upstairs?  Not really. You thought you were crazy, but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran down the hall, and got in the elevator. All the way down, and your ears popped. It was in the elevator that you noticed that the building was 150 stories high. It took 2 solid minutes to get to the ground. There it was, that Orange car stood out like... Well, examples failed you. The car door automatically opened, and folded up, unlike the other cars you had seen. You got into the car, and the door again closed by itself. Then you looked to your left, and saw what must have been Dr. Lansing. He was a dog, not a husky like Sasha, but more like a German sheppard. He said \"You must be (Name)\" you laughed a little, and said \"How could you tell? And you must be Dr. Lansing.\" \"Oh please, call me Butch.\" He said as he started to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you were on the road, he asked \"So, how'd you do it?  I've been working on this for two years, and I can't figure it out.\" You looked at him a little funny, and said \"Do you have records of when, where, and who was present when the dimensional holes appeared?\" \"Well, yes, of course.\" \"Have you seen any patterns?\" \"Well, I didn't really look for any.\" \"Then there's your problem. I'll bet you a million dollars that there's some kind of pattern there.\" \"I won't take that bet, partly because I think you're right, and partly because I don't have that kind of cash.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lab was pretty close to Heather's apartment. Soon you pulled into a parking lot, and he parked in a spot with a sign that said \"This Space Reserved For Dr. Butch Lansing.\" And then it had some fine print about a 500 dollar fine... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lab was an entire floor of a 30 story building. He was on the 27th floor. You both had to go up by stairs, do to elevator problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you was his lab, you were stunned. He had absolutely everything you could imagine in there, from soldering irons to welding equipment to a 3D printer, and you had only seen the first room. He took you to a room in a corner, which was the computer room. Somehow, it was running Windows. Windows! It looked exactly the same as what you were used to, too. \"Now what are the chances of that.\" You said, more to yourself, but Butch's sensitive ears heard it. \"What are the the chances of what?\" That computer is running Windows 7 professional edition. I have the exact same thing on my laptop god knows how many light years away.\" \"Well, there's always been a small link between us, nobody knows anything about it though. You would probably know more than I.\" With that, he brought up on the screen the records of every single dimensional hole that had ever appeared in their world. There were about 50. \"Okay, the positioning will be random.\" You said before he had even showed that to you. \"Bring up the names and species of those that were present. (Click) What do you see? Exactly what I thought.\" \"Here, let me try this.\" He did some typing and clicking, but eventually it showed you what percentage of the time each species was present when dimensional holes appeared. The husky group had 99.5%. Foxes had 85.4%. \"There's your pattern. You see that? Dimensional holes appear under certain conditions. Now before we attempt to make a portal, we need to make the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was spent working on designing the frame. Butch was all about safety, you were all about speed. Butch made you wait while he made two small ramps for the bump on the floor,  and you installed a rail on the top and bottom, and then put a thin metal bar connecting them, and then motorized it, so the portal could be spread across the rectangle at the push of a button. Then you did some welding while Butch built the tazers to go into the corners, and installed them into a fancy computer... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both were done, you looked at the clock, and then saw Heather, coming to pick you and she seemed interested in the progress. \"Amazing! Is that it?\" She asked. \"Yep. Now we need some helpers.\" \"Helpers? Why?\" She asked as she walked around your invention. \"I'll explain later.\" You turned to Butch. \"I need the names and numbers of a husky, a fox, a cow, a ewe, and a horse, preferably immediate relatives of those who disappeared two years ago, and if possible, female.\" \"Got it. I will have a list ready by tomorrow morning.\" \"See ya then.\" You said as you walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got in Heather's car, and she surprised you by not asking any questions about the portal. When  you got to her apartment, she said \"You want to go up the slow way, or the fast way?\" Well you knew exactly what she was offering. You answered \"As long as It's not any trouble, the fast way.\" She smiled, and grabbed you the same way Luna had, and then she flew up in a spiral parrern around the building. When you were 1500 feet up, (a story is 10 feet, do the math) she flew over to the window, which you opened, and then she set you on the window ledge. You went in, and she followed you. Then she locked the window, and went into the kitchen. You followed, but kept a 7 - 8 foot distance.  You said,\"Well, this morning I was woken up by the phone... Damn that thing is loud...\" \"Oh, sorry,\" she said, \"I never wake up unless there's a REALLY loud noise, or of I've had enough sleep. We bats are like that.\" So that's why that gun was loaded with blanks during that truck incident with Vicky. Yep, That must be how Sasha would wake Luna if she needed to. You said, \"I guess that makes sense, Luna is like that too. Sasha had to use one of these to wake her if she needed to.\" You tapped your glock. \"On that subject,\" she said, \"What is that thing?\" \"You don't know what this is? Wow. Well there's one thing that's not the same about us. This is a gun. Model glock 21. It's a very powerful (and dangerous) weapon.\" You said. You took it out of the holester, and then removed the clip and made EXTRA sure there weren't any bullets in the chamber. \"It uses an explosion to propel a bullet at supersonic speeds, and with such force it could bore its way through six inches of flesh. I only carry it for self-defense, and on the earth I carried it in case Vicky did something that required me to threaten her with her life to stop. (Which happened quite often you know). She looked at you, a little frightened. When you saw this, you realized you had made a mistake. You said \"Don't worry, I will never use this on anyone here unless they threaten me with my life.\" \"That's not what I'm worried about.\" She said. \"I'm worried about the fact that you would kill someone if they become a pain in the ass.\" \"You know, I only use this to stop Vicky. Once I have control of the situation, if I need to I'll bind her hands, and put her in a makeshift prison. I will never kill her, unless she is going to kill someone else. Okay?\" \"Okay,\" she said seeming to calm down. \"But couldn't you use a less dangerous weapon?\" \"If I had one I would. You know, when you're not using it for a weapon, its a lot of fun just to shoot at targets with. I could hit a soda can from 50 yards away.\" \"That's kind of cool, at least you can controlled what you destroy.\" \"Yes\"  she went into the fridge, and you went to your room. You left your glock there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came back out, she had put a new pizza in the oven. She then said \"Anyway, you were saying that Sasha had to use one of those to wake Luna up. Did she shoot a bell or something? \" \"No. You see, the gun makes a VERY loud noise when fired. For safety reasons, she always loaded it with blanks. Blanks are fake rounds that make the noise but don't shoot the bullets. They are perfectly safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the timer beeped, but that time you could barely hear it. Then you remembered the ultrasonic alarm you had installed in the barn for Luna. You figured it was pretty loud for Heather, but you couldn't hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then ate pizza and watched the news, and you were surprised to see Heather eat pizza too. Then you saw the cup of blood, and you didn't say anything. You didn't quite understand, but you had a pretty good idea and that was good enough for you. You just commented on the news. The news seemed to be the same too, except anthros were the ones giving the show. Then they started talking about YOU. They did it talk show style, and they were taking calls and asking people for any information they had, and/or their opinion on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Heather. She looked at you. Then you both smiled. \"Should I call them?\"  She thought for a moment. Then she looked at the screen, then looked at you, and said</span></div></div>",

I'll patch you through, and put you on the top of the callers list.\" You then heard everything that was going on on the tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you heard the words, \"Thank you for calling. I think what he said there (about humans coming and taking over their world) is absurd. Why would they? It's not their planet. And - Oboy... our next caller just so happens to be the human himself! Hello (Name) how ya doing?\" \"Good, good, how are you?\" \"Good.\"  \"Thats good.\" (Awkward silence.) Then the host of the show said, \"So, what do you think about that last question? Would that be something they might do?\" \"Probably not. But people there would probably not take this very well though. I mean, the fact that they are not alone in the universe.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"Well, a sort of, - how should I put it - comfort has arisen among them, in the fact that they are alone in the universe. If that comfort is lost, the first thing they will do is get suspicious.\" \"How so?\" \"Well, the same way that last guy was. Of attack. I believe it happened the same way for you as it did for us. Stories were written, horror movies were made... and a general idea of aliens was established. Some would support it, saying that you as a race, would never try anything like that. Others would stand on the fact that for most of you, that would be true, but it would be impossible to really be certain, and stand on it to the death. I suspect that this may already be happening, vice-versa, here\". \"Well, if, say, the humans attacked us, we have blades so sharp a handkerchief can fall on it and get cut with its own weight, and some have gotten pretty good at using them.\" \"Well, I don't think it's a good idea to explain the power of our weapons on live television, and, if things work out, it won't ever matter. You see, the humans can't hurt what they don't know about. And so far, I am the only living human that knows about your existence. There was one other, but he died if age. You see, they must never know. I have been able to keep the secret, and where the anthros are on earth, nobody ever goes, ever. I lived in the middle of nowhere, and you would have to drive for an entire hour to find it, from the next nearest residence. I also have hidden security systems set up to alert if a car goes down the road, long before he gets to the farm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter asked next, \"So how did you get here? You figured out the portal? That's what some of the other callers said.\" \"Well yes, I did. I saw one, and it all made sense. All day today I spent working with Dr. Lansing. The portal is made by people. You see, huskys are like walking capacitors. When they have contact with certain species correctly, and then touch a fox, a dimensional hole is made. At this stage, it is like a soap bubble. You can transfer it to a metal frame. Then, if you supply power to it, (I'm not going to say how, this can't get out of control) it can be sustained, and made larger. In fact. Tomorrow, 5 people will be called, to participate in making a portal. It will not be shown on live tv.\" \"Well, I'm sorry, it's time to take a break, stay on the line, we will continue after these messages... CUT! Thank you so much for calling. It's good to hear everything from the mouth of the one were talking about, plus, the amount of people we have watching is going through the roof right now.\" \"Well, good.

I'm dead.' You thought. 'I wonder what it's like to die. It shouldn't be much pain, its a gun. I wonder what happens after. Where the hell did Sasha come from anyway?' Then you got an idea. You waited until Sasha pulled into the driveway, and went to park. It was then that you made your move. The car always got parked next to where (Name) built the portal. So you reached over and jammed the steering wheel to the left at just the right time, and CRASH! Right into the portal. It was out of commission. Shock was written all over Sasha's face. Then her expression turned to horror, and then to anger. Then everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up on a cold, concrete floor. You had a banging headache, and what you thought was a bump on your head. You recognized where you were, in the celler. You noticed that the table and the sofa were gone. It was a completely empty room. Then you found that your hands were bound. With handcuffs. You also found that your feet were bound the same way. You also noticed that your handcuffs on your hands were on a chain that went through a pulley in the wooden beams above you. Tali was not in the room. Then a door opened. Sasha came down. She looked at you, with a look of anger that gave you the fear of death, again. Then she spoke. \"You know, you should consider yourself lucky. I wanted to kill you while you were out, but I couldn't find a gun, except one loaded with blanks. (Name) moved the bullets for that on me and now I don't know where they are. And we are out of ammo for the shotgun too. And you can thank Tara and Tali for convincing me not to just break your neck. I hope you like it here, because you're never going to see daylight again. (Name) is the only one that can change that, and we both know where he is. We both also know that he probably wouldn't change that anyway. Tali will not be allowed to see you. Ever. You've dug yourself into a deep hole my 'friend' Only (Name) can change these rules.\" With that, she went back upstairs. Well, at least you weren't going to be killed, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha's POV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back upstairs. It was dark, very dark. You looked at the clock, 12:36 am. Time for bed. Tali was asleep on the sofa. Then Luna knocked on the window. You opened it, and she came inside. She said \"So, did you kill her?\" \"No, she is in the celler. She just woke up.\" \" What's gonna happen to her, and how long will she be there?\" You looked at her funny. \"I'd say she earned a 99 to life. She damaged the car, and ruined any chance of us getting (Name) back.\" You almost started crying as you said this. Then, to your surprise, Luna just said, \"There is always hope.\" \"What?\" \"(Name) made the portal, he can do it again. You can't forget that.\" She said as she flew away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had to wrap up the night. Tali was on the sofa, the bars on the celler door were down, Where was Tara? You looked around, and after about 3 minutes you found her, desperately trying to repair the portal, even though it was clearly demolished. Fumbling with the tools, trying not to fall asleep, trying to remember how it had went together... When you asked her what she was doing, she answered, in a fit of anger and determination, \"Do you know what my life was like there? I was rejected, everywhere. I lived on the streets, sleeping behind this one dumpster, eating out of garbage cans... People attempted to violate me more than once, I will not let the same happen to him!\" \"Look, I'm sorry, but there's no way we can fix this without him. All we can really do is wait, maybe he will be able to make another and run it from there. It's not like there aren't any anthro's there!\" She sighed, with a tear falling from her eye, and said, I guess you're right. But what if another reporter comes?\"  \"Well, we'll just have the car parked in the forest or something, and if someone comes, the alarms will go off, and you know the drill, but if he doesn't see a car, he will assume (Name) isn't here. We'll be all right.\" She went into the house, and sat down next to Tali. Then you went upstairs to bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back to (Name's) POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you were again woken up by the phone. This time however, Heather answered it. You walked out of your room, and figured she must have been talking to Dr Lansing. When she was done, she said, \"Dr. Lansing will be in the parking lot by the time you get down there. You had better go now though, don't want to keep him waiting. Call me before you test the portal, I want to be there.\" You nodded as you went out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the lobby you saw an orange car pull up. When you got in it, Butch handed you a list, the list you had requested last night. It had everything you wanted, and more. Male and female of each species, and their names and numbers. Most were related to the people you knew. Butch said, \"I saw, or rather, heard you on the news last night. I'm glad you didn't tell them too much about how the portal works. That reporter guy tried to ask you about your weapons like 4 too many times.\" \"I didn't think it was worth smashing their sence of security. Our weapons are far more dangerous and effective then a blade.\" \"Really? How so?\" You gave him a look and said \"Now don't YOU start on me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got there, you started calling the people on the list. Only one or two declined, for business reasons, but they were males, so you didn't think it mattered. About 40 minutes later they arrived. One husky. One cow. Two horses. Two ewes. Two foxes, one being that boy you met when you first came to this world. Then you remembered. You called Heather, to give her plenty of time to get there. 30 seconds after you Hung up the phone however, you saw her out the window, flying. Of course. She jumped out the window, and just glided her way here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had 8 furrys in the lab staring at the portal frame, and Heather is less than a minute away. You decided it was time to tell them what they had been called there to do. When they asked how it would work, you explained \"Huskys are like walking capacitors. When charged, of they have contact with a fox, they discharge. The discharge releases a very large and long lasting lightning bolt. You all have probably seen this happen, already. It's called static electricity.\" On hearing this, the husky asked, \"Then how do we get charged up?\" \"Simple\" you said, grabbing a pair of nasty-looking alligator clips that looked like they came from a jumper cable. She recoiled back in horror, but then, Butch started laughing. Not a mad scientist laugh, just a laugh as if it was a joke. \"Just kidding.\" Then everyone in the room started laughing, except Heather,who had no idea why they were laughing, as she had just got there. You continued. \"If that were true, then why would you 5 be here? No. You charge by contact. How this works is you would clear rub her arm for 30 seconds, then his, then hers likewise. Then you would touch your hand to the foxes here, like this.\" You made your hands into C shapes, and put them together to make an O shape. At this stage, the portal you will have created, will be much like a soap bubble. Simply transfer of to the frame, in that little corner there. When that's done, I'll do the rest on this computer. Go ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they had transfered the portal to to the frame, and you turned on the power. Then you pressed your magic button, and instantally the portal spread over the entire rectangle. What you saw on the other side was a blue sky, not a ground. You played with the fine tuning to try and fix this, but nothing happened. Then it hit you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to the portal, and stuck a camera through, facing down. When you replayed it, you saw that the ground was a long way away. The portal was on the 27th floor, and the ground through the portal was almost 300 feet away. You and Butch said the exact same thing at the exact same time. \"We need to do this on ground level. But how?\" Then you saw the window washer elevator thing. Yep, you knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch didn't really like the idea, but he didn't really have any other choice either. About half an hour later, it was at ground level. Then you moved it to the same spot you came to this world from. When the portal was started, the first thing you saw through it was- oboy. That must be why they hadn't started it from thief end. There it was, a perfect picture of your car, smashed into the first portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't what Heather saw though. She saw what was behind the wreckage, a certain bat in the barn.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though you were right in front of the portal, you were not the first one through it. That was Heather, and that fox boy. He ran like heck and almost tackled Tali. You then looked over and saw Heather desperately trying to wake Luna up. You forgot about the car, and ran through the portal, grabbed your glock, and fired a shot into the ground away from everybody and everything else. THAT woke Luna up. It also got the attention of everybody in the house. You ran toward the door, and when you got about halfway there Sasha ran out the door at full speed, and almost tackled you in an embrace. Just like when you came back from California, she started asking questions at a very high speed. Again, you could always answer every question with a simple yes or no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was out of questions, you then braced yourself for Tara, who also came flying at you at a PDQ. She hugged you the same way Sasha did. But, she was in tears. When you saw this, you remembered what she said her life had been like there. She also asked a lot of questions, but slower than Sasha and all of them concerning the safety of your \"trip\". Your conversation went something like this: <br>\r\nTara: Are you hurt?<br>\r\nYou:  No.<br>\r\nTara: Did anyone try anything with you? (You knew exactly what she meant.) <br>\r\nYou:  No. You see, 4 or so minutes after the portal closed, this bat came over to me. Her name was Heather blackwing. Sound familiar? <br>\r\nTara: Luna... Her sister?<br>\r\nYou:  Yep. She told me who she was, asked me what I knew about Luna, and then asked me if I knew how to remake the portal. She knew I was the only chance she had of ever seeing her sister again. So she proposed to me a deal. If I would work on the portal, She would give me everything I needed.  She held up her end of the bargain, and I held up mine. She is in the barn right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara only smiled with relief, and then hugged you again saying, \"I missed you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you asked, \"So. What happened there?\" Motioning toward the wreckage. \"Well, Maybe you should ask Vicky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led you downstairs, and left you there with Vicky. She looked like she had seen the gates of hell. Too scared to cry, to scared to move. You noticed she was staring at your glock. You removed it, and set it on the steps. that seemed to calm her down a little. \"Vicky,\" You said in the kindest, softest most comforting tone you could, \"I'm not going to hurt you in any way. I just want to know what happened.\" Then she started crying. You didn't want to do this to her, so you went upstairs, taking your glock with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went and found Sasha, and asked her what had happened. Her answer was, \"If I ever find a gun I'm gonna KILL that bitch!\" So you asked Tara, but her answer was the same as her first one. Luna was occupied, Jane didn't know, Marie didn't know the whole story, Bess didn't know, Tali was occupied... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you went downstairs again, WITHOUT the glock. That you left on the table in the kitchen. When you got down there, Vicky had calmed down substantially. When she saw you, she said, almost in tears, \"Oh (Name), I'm so sorry, I thought you were going to kill me...\" You interupted, \"Slow down, start from the beginning. Why did the portal turn off?\" \"I turned it off. I knew that you wanted to do that to me, because of the trouble I caused. So I did it. Then Sasha almost killed me, but Tara convinced her not to, and to simply re-start the portal. I thought you would kill me when you got back, so I had to take the one thing they needed that they had. Me and Tali. So I threw Tali in your car and drove off. Nobody could catch up. Then Tali jumped from the car, down into the river. I thought she was dead, so I slowed down a little, unsure of what to do. 30 seconds later, Sasha appeared out of nowhere, and choked me until I stopped the car. Then we went to see if somehow Tali had survived.  She had, but was drowning in the water. Sasha ran like mad, and saved her. Then we drove back. I was certain you would kill me now, so I jammed the steering wheel to the left, and hit the portal.  Then everything went black, and I woke up here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door swung open. It was Sasha. And she had your glock. \"Finally! A gun! Say goodbye you little BITCH! \" you smacked the gun, making the shot miss Vicky's head by mere inches. \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?\" You screamed in her face. \"Ending our little pest problem.\" She said as she</span></div></div>",

It felt like a whack, and didn't really hurt, but you knew it would... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha recoiled on horror at what she had just done. She ran up the stairs, to find Tara, you supposed. Then you felt it. Then, you leaned against the wall, ignoring the pain, and picked up the gun Sasha had dropped. You took it apart. Things were starting to go black. You grabbed the firing pin of the gun, and stuffed it into your pocket. The last thing you saw was Tara, rushing down the stairs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you woke up in your bed, with a Sharp pain in your side. You had been bandaged up, but you knew the bullet was still in there somewhere. Tara was sitting by your bed. You asked, \"Is Vicky okay?\" \"Yes. It's Sasha you should be worried about, she looks like she could commit suicide.\" You smiled, and pulled the firing pin out of your pocket. \"The gun won't work without this. Is the portal still open?\" \"They closed it, because they knew you could rebuild the portal, and I don't think you'll need to either. Nobody wants to go home.\" \"Tara,\" You said, \"Two things. 1. Sasha can never find this.\" You said, handing her the pin. \"2, I need to drive myself to the hospital. That bullet is still in me, and lead is poisonous.\" She freaked out. 20 seconds later, you and Tara were in your car, which was still in pretty good condition, except for a dent in the front left corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started driving. You said, \"Tara, it's nice for you to want to come with me, but you can't be seen as an anthro. It's just too dangerous. Which means, you'll have to stay in this car, for a long time.\" \"How long?\" \"I'll have to have surgery, and surgeries like this could take anywhere from 2 to 5 hours.\" \"I don't care. I'm not leaving this car.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the Emergency Room, they told you you needed an X-ray. After that, they told you you needed surgery. You gave the lady a \"You dumbass\" look and said \"No Shit Sherlock! When can this be done? I think the bullet was lead, and I don't know what it damaged.\" \"We're ready now.\" She brought you to a hospital bed, and gave you an injection. Then she taped your eyelids shut. For the second time that day, everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up, removed the tape from your eyelids and looked around.

After a fit of coughing and sputtering, you said, \"Sorry, Dr. Butch who?\" \"Lansing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about this. Coincidence? Maybe. Maybe not. \"And how did you figure out that my bones are mutated?\" You said this to excuse the slight pause. \"By the density on the X-ray, and the overall structure of the bones\" \"Is anything else mutated?\" \"Not that we know of, but a mutation like this, it could do anything. I would suggest seeing him as soon as you can. Can I schedule an appointment?\" \"How about tomorrow?\" \"Be here at 12:20.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got out to the car, You found Tara, waiting for you, in anthro form. This wasn't a good idea, but you had had your windows tinted, it should be fine. You got in the car, and asked her \"What are the chances of there being a doctor on earth, that has the exact same name as one on your planet?\" She looked at you, confused. \"Well, we know of some sort of small bond between us, but that sounds a little far fetched. Maybe you should go back and see Dr. Lansing, he would know about this-\" You cut her off. \"I DID talk to Dr. Butch Lansing. He helped me build the portal, and the lady in the building told me to see a DR. BUTCH LANSING! What are the unimaginable chances of that?\" She was clearly shocked. \"I've got no idea. Why did she want you to see him?\" \"Somehow, my bones have changed. Their structure has improved, like way beyond natural, and bone density has went through the roof. They are an estimated 40 times stronger than average.\" She seemed lost in thought for a good 15 seconds, and said, \"Just like ours...\" \"What?\" \"Your uncle had an incident one day, in short, his four-wheeler trailer ran over his arm, And he had to go to the hospital. He came back with a cast on his wrist. He showed us his X ray pictures, because we were curious as to why he broke something. Sasha could have had her wrist rolled over by that thing all day, and there wouldn't have been a problem. You see, you must have gotten that from us somehow.\" You thought about this for a moment. \"Well, what now?\" \"I'd say you should go talk with our Dr. Lansing, and maybe go to a hospital there, and see if they know or can figure out what happened. Not tonight though, the only things awake will be bats, badgers, nocturnal people. Tonight though, you need to repair the portal, and In fact, since we're in town you should get some of the supplies required.\" \"But I can't do that to you. You've been here how long, 4 hours?\" \"Look. I don't know what this mutation of yours will do. It may kill you. The odds are against it, but it could happen. So what's more important? GO!\" With that, you left the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got home, you both went inside, and left most of your stuff in the car. You were going to find Sasha, but you heard something else. A sort of wimpering, like a puppy, but it couldn't be Sasha. It just wasn't the voice. You asked Tara, \"What happened to that firing pin?\" \"Oh don't worry, I ate it. Sasha will never figure out where it is, it will never go anywhere, and even if she figured it out she wouldn't be able to get it out of me without cutting me open.\" \"Um, will I be able to get it back?\" \"Of course. You need it?\" You shook your head, and ran down into the celler, where the noise had been coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found Vicky, who despite the time, was still crying. Your gun was still there in pieces on the floor, and Vicky was hugging her knees and crying so loudly that she didn't even know you were there. You put your hand on her shoulder, and she looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she hugged you, so fast that it caught you by surprise, and then you hugged her back. Through the sobs she said, \"Oh (Name), Why? Why did you do that? You s-should have just let her k-kill me... Why? Why did you save me? I've only ever cause you problems, I'm s-sorry, why?\" \"Because you didn't deserve to die, there is nothing you could have done that would drive me to kill you. But you and Sasha seem to have a little history, and it seems that she would. However, Until I see some MAJOR change in her I will not let her touch another working gun, so you don't have to worry about that. What you need to know is that I'll be fine, they got the bullet out and bandaged me up, it should heal fully in a month. Let me worry about your safety, I'll install a new lock on the door up there, and set it so that she can't get in. I'll do that right away.\" She just hugged you tighter, and then you said, \"You know, I know of a little boy that really wants to see you... If you're all right your brother and sister can come down here.\" \"My Brother!? Benny? How did you know I even had a brother!?\" \"He happened to be the first one I saw on that planet, and he came back with me. He and Tali are probably somewhere out there together right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went and found them in the woods, in Vicky's den. As you walked back, you had to explain that you were all right. When you were done with that, you said, \"Listen, guys, when we get there, I'll let you in, and in 5-10 minutes I'll come back and let you out. I have some work to do on the locks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they went down into the celler, you closed the doors like you said, and went to your room and looked through your \"Gadgets\" You came back with a eyeball scanner. You changed the locks to electronic, and set it to both your eyes and  both of Tara's. After some testing before closing the door, you asked them if they were ready to come out. They weren't, so you locked the door.  Now you had to deal with Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured she'd be in her room, and you were right. There she was, crying, or rather wimpering like a puppy, into her pillow, which was pretty soaked. Like Vicky, she did not even notice you until you put your hand on her shoulder. Then, like Vicky, she hugged you so fast, it took you by surprise, again. Her questions were almost the same. \"Why? Why did you save her? All she's ever done is cause trouble.\" \"Because,\" You answered, \" No one deserves to die, I don't care what they do. And because, you would never forgive yourself afterwards.\" \"What? After all she's done to me?\" \"Killing another being, is such a horrible thing, and nobody ever feels right afterwards. Everybody wishes they could change what they did, but they can't. I just couldn't let that happen to you. You were in a fit of rage, and that's when its the worst.\" \"But why did you take it? Why didn't you just hit the gun again?\" \"Because, it was the only way. The only way to stop you. I can't fight you, I couldn't hurt you in a way that would make shooting her impossible, I'm not anthro.\" Not yet anyway, you thought. \"I'm sorry I-I...\" And then she broke off into sobs. You hugged her a little tighter, \"It's all right. I know you didn't mean to, and would never. And I'm going to be fine. I will be back to normal in under a month, don't worry. They got the bullet out, and bandaged me up, it missed all vital areas, just a flesh wound.\" She seemed a little relieved at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You went downstairs, and went to check on the little foxes in the celler. They came out, and you closed the door. Tali asked you, \"How long will she be in there?\" You thought about this for a moment, and said, \"Just until my car gets repaired. I have insurance, it should be simple. Probably under a week.\" \"You mean, you're not mad at her?\" \"No. I would let her out right now, but if I don't do something Sasha may have a problem. I doubt it, but maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was getting dark, you put on your night vision goggles and started to work on rebuilding the portal. You decided to put a new design in it. You made it work like an etch-a-sketch. Two bars, perpendicular to each other would be 3 inches from a side. Then, when you pressed *this* button, they would both ride on thier rails and make the 3 x 3 square spread throughout the entire frame. As you were building this, you heard something. It was</span></div></div>",

Then they made a growling sound, and then, ROAR! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were obviously trying to startle you, so you said, \"Nice try you two\". They looked shocked, and Luna, or Heather, you couldn't tell, said \"Aw, no fair. How the hell did you know we were here? And what are you doing out here?\" \"I'm working on the portal.\" \"Uh huh... My eyes have proven themselves FAR better than yours, and yet I can barely see a thing. What are you REALLY doing out here?\" \"Rebuilding the portal.\" \"Okay, if you're not going to answer that, answer this then.\" The other one said. \"How did you know it was us?\" \"Well, first I heard something, so I turned around and saw you.\" \"You SAW us. Again, not possible.\" \"What if I told you that you both are leaning on each others shoulders, and you both have your legs crossed to the outside. And what if I told you that you, on your right, my left, was the one talking, and using a lot of hand movement while talking, while the one on your left, my right, made no hand movements at all. Would you believe me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on your right said, \"Heather, were you making hand movements?\" \"Uh, yes... Were you Luna?\" \"No... how the hell... Okay, I believe you. So how can you see us when we cannot see you?\" Human technology. Can you see the headgear I'm wearing?\" They squinted, looking VERY hard at your head. Then you turned on a small flashlight. \"Can you see it now?\" \"Cool.\" Said Heather. Luna said, \"So that thing let's you see in the dark?\" You nodded. \"Here, let me go get the other pairs... \" You went into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came out and told them to try them. \"Cool\" they both said at once. Then Luna was able to notice your bandage. \"Hey, what happened to you?\" \"You mean you two slept through both gunshots?\" \"GUNSHOTS!?\" \"Yeah, but it was an accident. Sasha found my gun and almost killed Vicky, I stopped her, but I had to take a bullet. Then I went to the hospital... Which reminds me... I have to finish this.\" \"But, are you all right?\" \"Yeah, I'll be fine, it should heal in under a month. No big deal, I haven't had a claim on either health insurance or auto insurance in 10 years, they shouldn't be too finicky.\" \"But why are you working on the portal now? I mean, it's midnight!\" Heather asked. \"I have to talk to Dr. Lansing again, the doctors in the hospital found some kind of, well, difference in me. My bones have improved, and are now 40 times stronger then average. Tara thinks I may have gotten it from you.\" \"Me?\" Heather asked, confused. \"Not personally, but from anthros in general, or from something on your planet. I don't suppose you know anything about it?\" \"Sorry\" \"Anyway, I should really figure this out there rather than here. They know of my, and my race's existence. We do not. They would have an easier time figuring this out than we would. (When I say \"we\" I mean the humans)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we would help you build that thing, but we need to find some food,\" She paused a second before saying, \"or drink.\" Then you remembered Heather eating pizza. You also remembered that you had a few in the freezer. You didn't know if she was just eating it to be polite, but you might as well offer. \"Hey, I have a few pizzas in the freezer if that would help, would that work?\" \"Pizzas?\" Said Heather, \"That's odd. I didn't think you had those here.\" Luna said, \"Well, you'd be surprised how much is the same here as it is there. (Name) knows that better than I do. Anyway that would work, but in the case of bats, blood is the main food sourse. However, if we help you, will it be ready by tomorrow?\" \"Absolutely.\" \"Then tomorrow morning we'll go get some blood there. It's a lot easier to get it there than it is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather volunteered to put the pizza in, so you gave her a house key. At about 2 in the morning you had the new portal finished. You were able to salvage most of the electronics from the other one, so you only had to buy one taser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked them and went to bed, setting your alarm for 7:00 am. Yes, it wasn't much sleep, but you didn't want to have to wake them. You'd rather catch them before they went \"to bed\". </span></div></div>",

You grabbed some breakfast, and ran to the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught the bats just before they got all \"hung up\", and said \"Hey guys- er- girls, Sasha's starting the portal if you want to sleep at your apartment.\" \"Good idea. We'll be there.\" With that, you ran out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost ran into Tali, who had seemed to be looking for you. \"Here,\" she said, \"Its the best I could do. I think it'll work\" she handed you your gun, the one you had taken apart yesterday in the celler. You looked at it, and saw that everything was the way it should be, except it was missing the firing pin. And only you and Tara knew that. \"Thanks, it looks right.\" You said. You grabbed a holester, and put it on. You did that more for Tali than anyone else. You didn't need it, it didn't work anyway, but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went through the portal, and saw the bats fly off to the left. You went to the right, to Butch's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found Butch working on his computer. \"Hey,\" you said, \"What's up?\" \"Hey, I'm trying to track this wierd radiation that's been going through here. The source seems to be within a 50 mile radius if here. Apparently its harmless, but they want me to check it out.\" \"Interesting. But uh, I need your help again.\" \"Again!? You helped me more than I helped you, I owe you one. What's up?\" \"Well, you see this? (You tapped your glock) It's one of our weapons. Long story short, I got hit by it, and I ended up on the hospital. After an X-ray, and surgery, the doctors discovered a mutation in me. My bones, they've improved, like, beyond natural. They are now 40 times stronger than average.\" \"Cool.\" \"Thats what I thought, until I heard the name of the doctor they were going to send me to.\" \"Who?\" \"Dr. Butch Lansing.\" \"WHAT!?\" \"Uh huh. You mentioned that there was some kind of connection between our planets, but you didn't say anything more. Can you explain this?\" \"Well, I know I shouldn't be surprised, but I am. I mean, after all the similarities between our planets, I should've known. I'm afraid I can't explain why, but everyone here feels a sort of bond with something they just can't quite place... It's very small, small enough that some ignore it so much they forget about it's existance. It's really odd.\" Well, I was hoping you could explain why I have this mutation, and if something here caused it.\" \"Well, I'm sorry, I don't have a good answer. How much stronger than average did you say? 40 times?\" \"Yep\" \"Cool. How strong is average?\" This brought back to you everything you knew about the human skeleton. Then you remembered the story Tara had told you, and a little memory on the strength of fingers. You said, \"Well, let's just say this. My uncle broke his wrist under a, I don't know, 500 pound trailer. Upon investigation, it was concluded that anthros have much stronger bones than humans, an people suspect I got the mutation from here because of this. And, ummmm... What was it....? I think it takes about 12 psi of force to break the average human finger.\" \"Okay, much weaker then. It takes about 60 psi of force to break the average anthro finger. So I guess I should take an X-ray, and a few various scans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just enough time to take the X-ray, and a scan with a name you couldn't remember. Then you went back home. The portal opened in front of you when you got there, and you looked at your watch. 10:59, a minute early. Good job Sasha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got back you found</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You got to the hospital, and, after just making it to the front desk, you were stopped by a security guard. You then remembered your glock at your side, and knew why he had stopped you. He asked for ID, and took your gun. He told you to find him before you left to get it back, he just couldn't have you walking around in a hospital with a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the little incident, a lady led you \"Right this way\" into an examination room, and told you to wait for this new Dr. Lansing. About four minutes later, he came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be (Name).\" He said. He looked, well, like the Dr. Lansing you knew, without the fur, the tail, the muzzle, and the ears. His voice sounded exactly the same. You replied, \"That's me, and you must be Dr. Lansing\" \"Oh, please, call me Butch.\" Hmm. That was the same thing the Dr. Lansing you knew said when you first met him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says here that you have a mutation that increases the strength of your bones. I believe we should take a couple different scans, and another X-ray.\" He said. So the next 3 hours were occupied with these scans. You could never remember the names of any of them, except two. X-ray, and CAT scan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter these scans, he brought you back to the examination room. He said, \"Well, the only thing I can do is wait, and see what happens. You should probably come back next week. How about next Monday at 4:00?\" \"Fine by me, but um, is there anything I should do about this?\" \"Well, mutations like this sometimes occur at points of high emotion. Very high emotion. It doesn't really matter what kind, but It's rather difficult to do with anything other than thrill, and fright. So, why don't you do something like sky-diving?\" \"Well, I guess the chances of injury are pretty small...\" \"That's the spirit!\" Go live life on the edge! Have some fun. Do the stupid things nobody in their right mind would do. (Within reason.)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, on the way home, you went to the one place where you could go sky-diving. they were pretty busy, so you looked around the little shop they had. Then something caught your eye. It was an advertisement about a new parachute. It was a safety chute, that used an airbag-like explosion to deploy the chute, and had two chutes, in case of a failure. It also had cartridges you could buy that made the explosion, which were optional. They were popular among builders and construction workers in the city- Hmm. That thought gave you a nasty idea. So, you bought one, and then, oh, Damn. You left your gun with the security guard. So, instead of going home, you went all the way back to the hospital and got your gun. Twelve minutes later you were again whizzing down your driveway at a plain old stupid speed. 10 minutes later, you were home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you got home, you looked at the time. 5:30. Oh well. You were hoping to go back to the anthro planet, but the time wouldn't really matter. You saw your house, so you slowed down. You were going about 30, when, a portal appeared out of nowhere, right in front of you! You slammed on the breaks and then pulled the emergency break, and started sliding sideways. On the other side of the portal, there was a road. However, you were going perpendicular to it. You then saw your parking spot. You saw Butch come around the corner, see you, and dive to the left. You slid right through the portal, and did a perfect parallel park between Butch's familiar orange car and someone else's, with just inches to spare. Well, there was now no need to go sky-diving. Heck, you might need a new pair of underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT! WHAT THE HELL...!\" Butch yelled. \"You could've got both our asses killed!\" \"Well, next time you should start the portal 15 freakin' feet to the left. It's right in the middle of my driveway! You know what's really damn lucky? The fact that the emergency break works on this car and the fact that the portal didn't appear half a mile that way.\" You said, pointing. \"I was going 120 mph back there.\" \"Jeez. You're crazy.\" You got out of the car. \"You know, sometimes I wish that were true...\" \"Anyway, I told you about the other project I was working on right? Well, in your DNA, I noticed something missing. When I looked further, I found what was missing, but it was very immature. I also found that same kind of immature pattern in the odd radiation they asked me to figure out. Basically, it's turning you into one of us. When I told this to the authorities, they told me that either you had to turn into an anthro, or leave this planet until the war is over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"war\" stopped you in your tracks. \"War?\" You said. \"Uh, yeah... I thought you knew. We're at war with the Nazis, again. It's the second time they've started a world war.\" \"You mean you're still fighting world war 2? We won that like 50 years ago...\" \"It started 60 years ago. Anyway, the radiation source is in their territory.\" \"So that's why people keep asking me about our weapons.\" \"Yep. And because you were so closed-minded about the weapons on the news last week, the authorities didn't even bother to ask you about doing some trading. We're starting to lose the upper hand as well. If we had better weapons we could secure the device and deactivate it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm. Butch was basically asking you for weapons. You thought about this. You didn't want to become an arms dealer, and that would only fly so long on earth. Anybody looks at you and sees what you buy, will think you're up to something. You didn't want to kill anyone, you weren't a soldier. You did know a gang of people that just finished serving either in the army, navy, or black ops, but then you would have them to deal with. You couldn't tell them what you knew, and then have them tell someone else, that would just be trouble. And then, with the weapons you had, you wouldn't be able to get very far. A couple of glocks, a shotgun and a revolver won't do much against an army. You probably should just keep your hands clean. What do you do? </span></div></div>",

You see, I don't think It's a good idea to become an arms dealer.\" \"Why not?\" \"Let me put it this way. One has to jump through quite a few hoops to get a gun there. They want to monitor what you have, and how many of them you have, and the damage you could do with them. Because of this, the more dangerous weapons are very difficult to get. Now I couldn't afford to buy you hundreds of guns, you would have to pay me. Your currency isn't valid on my planet, so it would have to be in gold and/or silver. Now when someone buys a ton of guns, and all of a sudden gold starts coming out of nowhere, I'll look like a gangster. That means the other option is to buy one of each kind of weapon, and make a factory here. But, some of the materials I'm sure you won't have, like gunpowder. I don't know how that stuff is made, and every time you search something like \"How to make gunpowder\" on the internet, your name is added to a list. Every time you look at pornography, your name is added to the list. Every time that stuff is searched, your name is put higher on the list. Then, if something bad happens, and martial law is established, they will round up the people most likely to start a revolt. The top say, 400 people on the list, and anyone with a  against them are usually the first people to go. So you want to stay off the list if you can. (Author's note: This is true by the way). But, I don't want to do nothing, so I'll tell you what I'll do. Before I inherited the farm, I had some friends that I knew very well, and 10 years ago, they all went into different branches of the military. I've been keeping tabs with each of them ever since. If there's anyone we can trust, it would be them. They have been trained to fight, with or without these weapons.\" \"So, you won't give us weapons then?\" Butch said. \"No. It won't be needed. You really should see what these guys can do. Anyway, when can I see these authorities? I want to male sure they're okay with this.\" \"I'll make an appointment with them tomorrow. Would you like to meet them here, or there?\" He said, pointing through the portal. \"There will be fine, preferably fifteen feet to the left though...\" You both laughed. Yes, you both almost got killed, but really, what else could you do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got Butch to move his car, so you could get yours out of there. There was no way you'd be able to get out of there with the 2 inches of space on each end. Butch told you that they would activate the portal from their end sometime tomorrow. With that, you drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, nobody at the farm knew that this had happened, so when you got there, you were flooded with questions. When they were finally done, you said, \"You know, a funny thing happened to me on the way home... I was going pretty fast, and a portal opened up right in front of me. I almost hit Butch, and almost wrecked my car, and someone else's. But I started sliding and parallel parked perfectly, with 2 inches to spare on either side. He told me that there was an odd kind of radiation there, and it was causing my mutation. So, I wanted to shut it off. But, the source was in enemy territory. That's when I found out that you were at war.\" Sasha said, \"Heather never told you? Well, yes, we were. What does this mean?\" \"It means, I either will have to turn into an anthro, or not return until the war is over. Now before this, I never figured out why people kept asking about our weapons. Now I know. But, I'm not going to become an arms dealer, I've bought too many guns already. And I'm not going to run a factory there, that would be dangerous and I don't know everything one would need to to do that. So, I'll just have to do it myself. But, I can't do it myself. Here's where you come in. Who here wants to go on a, well, boring adventure?\" \"Wait, you want US to be soldiers?\" Asked Sasha. \"No,\" you replied. So Sasha, Tara, and Tali all raised their hands/paws. Then Sasha said, \"Then what do you have in mind?\" \"Well, if the authorities approve tomorrow, I will have to go back to California and round up some people I know. They are soldiers.\" \"Wait wait wait.\" Said Tara. \"I thought you said telling other humans about us was a bad idea.\" \"Yes, I did. But these people I trust. I would trust them with my life. But, they would think I'm crazy when I tried to tell them,  so I'll need some proof.\" \"So you want one of us to come with you, all the way back to California, to reveal ourselves to them. Right?\" Said Sasha. You nodded. Then you said, \"So, who wants to go?\" Both Sasha and Tara raised their hands. Who should you pick?</span></div></div>",

They had a 60 mile range, and would be ideal with keeping in touch with your friends during an attack. Then you signed out of eBay, and then searched for a place where you could get an automatic weapon. You were NOT going up against perhaps half an army with a pair of glocks and a shotgun on your back. You found a place about three hours away, and got their number and address. You did not like the prices they charged for their guns. But, you didn't have any other choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time, it was getting late, but you decided to head to the police department to get a licence to own one of these guns. The lady behind the counter did a full background check, and checked your contacts. There were quite a bit. Belle, a pizza place, a bunch of calls to your insurance companies, a ton of calls from reporters, various calls to road-runner about deactivating services from your old apartment, that kind of stuff. Then she checked your email, and even your deleted items. Then she charged you for all this, and gave you the licence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a day. When you got home, you went up to your room, and collapsed into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you had the portal opened by 6:50 am. You told Sasha to keep the portal running, it wouldn't be more than 15 minutes. You grabbed your parachute, and went to Heather's apartment. When you got there, you found them watching the morning news. \"Oh hi (Name),\" said Luna, \"Right on time.\" You looked at your watch. 6:59. \"You two ready to go?\" You asked. \"I think so.\" Heather replied. Then you remembered your nasty idea. You said \"Hey, you guys up for a little challenge?\" You said, walking further into the room. Heather nodded, Luna did not. \"Something tells me you're up to something...\" \"Well, I've got fifty bucks that say I can get down to the portal before you can.\" \"Well, first of all, your currency isn't valid here, and second of all, there's no way in hell you'de be able to get down the elevator, or the stairs faster than we can go out the window.\" \"Well then, make it a little refrigerator then. And maybe I've got something up my sleeve, or know something you don't know.\" Heather said to Luna, \"Whaddya think?\" She replied \"I think he's up to something. But I have absolutely no idea how he intends to pull it off. You can if you want to, but I don't trust it.\" \"Hmm. All right, I'm in. Ready?\" At this point, you had walked up to them and were right next to her. \"GO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran and dove out the window! Heather and Luna yelled something, first your name and then something that you couldn't hear. You moved into a diving position, and shot straight down. You knew both bats would be behind you, but they couldn't go any faster than you. You watched the ground in front of you. You flipped around and saw both bats, flying the same way you were, at almost the same speed. You turned back around, and waited for just the right time. You had angled your fall so that the open portal was now almost directly below you, so you turned so that your back was to it, but still in a diving position. 3.... 2.... 1.... NOW! you jerked the cord, and it shot the parachute straight out from your back.It deployed, and the cords sort of swung you straight around, STRAIGHT THROUGH THE PORTAL. When the parachute ropes hit the top of the portal, it swung you up, about 10 feet in the air, and then straight down. Wham. You pressed the button, and the parachute wound itself up. Then the bats landed, and ran through the portal. The only thing you could think of to say was \"I win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna thought it was funny, Heather did not. Then you got a bunch of bla bla bla bla blah from Heather about how stupid that was, how easily you could have got yourself killed, why you thought it was a good idea to scare her... While Luna was laughing the whole time, saying things like \"I knew it! I knew he had something up his sleeve!\". Then she went to get a couple of jars of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they hung up for the day. You had deactivated the portal, and explained to the others exactly what Heather was mad about. Tara thought it was funny, Sasha did not. Then you got the same bla bla bla blah you got from Heather.   When that finally died down, you ended up wondering what to do. You played some Xbox, checked your stocks, and then played the piano. You played something like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3ojt7e88g2I\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3ojt7e88g2I...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finished, you looked behind you, and saw Sasha, Tara, and Tali, standing there. Then they started clapping. \"Wow, I didn't know you could play like that! That's awesome!\" Said Sasha. The others nodded in agreement. \"Thanks,\" You said. You realized this had been the first time anyone had heard you play in a long time. You had always played in your apartment, when you were the only one there, which was basically, always. You shook your left hand a little, saying \"That song really gets to my left hand, so much playing, not much rest like the right hand.\" Tara opened her mouth to say something, but was interupted by</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sasha interrupted her \"Shh- you hear that?\" Tara and Tali listened. Then they nodded. You couldn't hear a thing, but you remembered their sensitive hearing. Then it hit you. You looked out the window, and saw a portal, moving around in an odd fashion, then stopping, then growing to the familiar size. You said, \"Sasha, I'm going to need a soda can from the recycle, and a few pieces of metal from the old portal, down there.\" \"Got it.\" She said as she ran off. \"Tara,\" you said, \"I'm going to need that firing pin.\" Then you left the room. You heard her start hacking as you went down the stairs. You grabbed the shotgun, your glocks, and some ammo. Then you went to greet your visitors. Tara caught you just before you went out the door, and gave you the pin. You stuffed it into your pocket, because you didn't have time to reinstall it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had 4,visitors. Butch, a doe, a leopard, and a white tiger. \"You must be (Name).\" The doe said, \"And those must be the weapons you were talking about.\" You assumed they were talking about the guns you had in your hands. \"Yes, I didn't know what Butch told you about them, so I brought a few for demonstrations if needed.\" Butch said \"I told them everything you told me, and their decision depends on the power of these weapons. We brought a bow for comparison.\" You noticed that the doe was holding a crossbow. You also noticed that Sasha had set a stake in the ground, about 100 feet away, and had leaned a piece of sheet metal up against it. On the top of the stake, she had set the soda can. \"Okay, hit the sheet of metal with the bow.\" It took the doe about 3 seconds to do this. For that crossbow, it was fast. The arrow made a dent in the metal, but not much overall damage. You said, \"I should warn you, these guns are very loud- which reminds me. Sasha? Could you let the bats know what's going on?\" She walked off to the barn. You grabbed the glock that worked, and put a hole right next to the dent made by the crossbow. Butch asked, \"What kind of metal is that?\" \"1/4 in steel.\" Then the tiger spoke. \"Then we have no armour that can stop a weapon like that. How fast do they shoot?\" \"Well, this particular weapon will fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. (Bangbangbangbangbang) But, we do have some that you can hold and run around with that fire 15 to 30 shots per second, and we also have one in particular that must remain on a tripod, that can fire 100+ rounds a second. If your decision is a yes, I, and my men will go and buy better weapons.\" The leopard said \"And these men you want to bring, who are they? Have they been trained to use these weapons? Will they be okay if they run out of ammo?\" \"They have been highly trained in using these weapons, and in hand to hand combat, and can take on almost anyone without using weapons.\" \"What if the people they are fighting have say, a knife?\" \"They'll still win.\" \"We would like to see this, I mean, that almost doesn't sound possible.\" \"Well, it is.\" \"Oh, how many of you will there be?\" \"4.\" \"Okay, and what will you charge? How does 20 million to each of you sound?\" Your eyes went wide. You answered \"I'm sure they wouldn't charge even a 10th of that.\" \"Believe me, if you are able to end the war, with even a peace treaty, you'll all have absolutely every bit of that, and even more. People are dying every day, the entire nation, and our allies would simply beg to pay you.\" \"Then your answer is yes?\" Everybody except Butch nodded. \"Then I'll have them here as soon as is possible.\" \"About how long would that take?\" You frowned. \"Six or seven days.\" \"WHAT!?\" All four of them said. \"You see, I have to drive there. They will require some proof, which means I'll have to bring one of you. Which means I can't take a plane. It's a three day drive. It's the only way.\" The doe said \"Well, just keep in mind that every day, people are dying... Do you know about the prison camps?\" \"Actually, I believe I do.\" \"Then go, now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha had gotten into the car, and right then and there you ran straight for the car. And, almost for show reasons, you floored it, leaving 75 foot tire marks behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you were going to get there FAST. 120... 140... 160... 180! The speedometer had went all the way up. Over the engine noise, Sasha said \"I'm glad Vicky didn't gun it like this, there's no way even Luna can keep up with this.\" You smiled, and said \"That's why I didn't want Vicky to know how we kept appearing right next to her in the seat. This car is too fast.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got to the T in the road, you slowed down again. You went straight to the highway, and decided to call the men you were going to get. You told Sasha that it was pretty important that she not say anything. You first decided to call Kelly. You had known him quite well, and he had went on to become a navy seal. He had an in-your-face personality, and anyone that told him what to do, he always called \"SIR!\" It didn't matter if it was his commanding officer or his dentist, or even if the person commanding him was female. You had kept in touch for the last ten years via email and the occasional phone call. You had heard recently that he had gotten out, so he should be able to do this. He didn't really have much family, and the family he did have hated him due to the relations with his mother. His real dad had become a navy seal, so that's what he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dialed, and put it on speakerphone. Your conversation went something like this: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly: Hello? <br>\r\nYou: Hey man, its (Name).<br>\r\nKelly: Hey! What's up man? <br>\r\nYou: I actually have an odd question for you.<br>\r\nKelly: Shoot.<br>\r\nYou: What would you do for 20 million dollars? <br>\r\nKelly: Um, why? <br>\r\nYou: Come on. Humor me.<br>\r\nKelly: Anything, as long as it's legal. <br>\r\nYou: Good. I hear you're back in town.<br>\r\nKelly: Uh, yes... What does this have to do with 20 million dollars? <br>\r\nYou: I have a job that would take probably under a year that would give you that. <br>\r\nKelly: Uh huh... (sarcastically)<br>\r\nYou: No, really. But, you're not going to believe me until I give you proof, so I won't tell you what it is. However, do you remember that parking lot at the Kmart in the country?\" <br>\r\nKelly: I think so... <br>\r\nYou: Meet me there at 23:30 the day after tomorrow, I'll have some proof for you there. And don't plan on anything after.<br>\r\nKelly: Hmm. Ok, I'll be there. But seriously, what kind of job are we talking about here? <br>\r\nYou: You're not going to believe me if I tell you man. You'll probably ask me to get a CAT scan. Well, I've had 2 of them this week.<br>\r\nKelly: Okay, fine. How long have you known about this job? And how many other people know about it? <br>\r\nYou: You're the first one other than me that knows about this. I'm going to bring 2 others into this though. And don't tell anyone else about this. It's very important that we aren't watched. Don't worry, its legal, but it must be kept secret.<br>\r\nKelly: Hmm. Well, okay. Where are you anyway? <br>\r\nYou: I'm in my car, driving to the parking lot as we speak. <br>\r\nKelly: So, if I go there right now, I would meet you there? <br>\r\nYou: No, I'm in Pennsylvania, so I won't be there until the day after tomorrow. <br>\r\nKelly: What the hell are you doing in Pennsylvania? <br>\r\nYou: I think you should Google my name, and then ask me what I'm doing here. Anyway, I have to call the others. See you then.<br>\r\nKelly: Okay, bye.<br>\r\n*Click* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour calls to the others were pretty similar. Jeff was an ex- black ops soldier. He said his family didn't care about what happened to him, they were always doing their own thing. He had a quiet personality, when he wasn't being a soldier. He had always had a thing for guns, and the weapon he had never seemed to be big enough. He didn't give a damn about the bullet proof vests, and protective gear, because \"Whenever I shoot, I expose my head unless I'm in a tank.\" You had been keeping in touch with him via email and the occasional phone call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon was a computer nerd when he went into the army, and a computer need when he came out. You didn't know what he did with the computer, but you didn't think it was good. However, he could fight. He could fight like hell. You had been keeping in touch via webcam and email. He never used phones. He would use radios, but not phones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done calling, Sasha stuck up conversation. It ranged from your piano playing, to why you played the trick on Heather, how you thought you would survive going up against an army  with four men, to what happened when you called the news reporter on the television on their planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you both slept in your car, because the hotels were going to charge 70 dollars to bring a dog in. You couldn't find even one place cheaper, so you drove into a suburb, found a pick'n'save, and parked way off in the corner, out of the light. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was 11:00 when you pulled into the parking lot. Even though it was early, Kelly, Jeff and Don were there. You had Sasha turn into a dog before they saw her. You pulled over to a corner, near a bunch of trees, and motioned for them to come over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had them park their cars in a square formation, so when Sasha did her thing nobody but them could see. Before you said anything Don asked \"What's with da dog?\" You answered, \"Well, that will get answered soon, but not just yet. Did you guys Google my name?\" \"I did.\" Said Kelly. \"Then, why do I live in Pennsylvania now?\" \"Because you inherited a farm there. And you liked the privacy? At least that's what CNN said.\" \"That's true, but does that really sound like me?\" Everybody shook their heads. You smiled. \"Exactly. Now what if I told you that we aren't alone in the universe?\" \"Well, you said you'd have proof...\" Then Sasha jumped out the open window, and changed into an anthro right before their eyes. Then she said \"Is this good enough proof for you?\" Both Jeff and Don yelled \"WOAH!\" And took a few steps back. Kelly didn't say anything, or move. He didn't even blink. He just looked at Sasha for a moment, and then looked at Don and Jeff, with a look that said \"Are you kidding me!?\" Then he said to you and Sasha \"Okay, you got me interested. So, what kind of job is it?\" Sasha answered, \"Well, our planets are basically the same. The history is very close to the same. We don't know why, or how, but the maps are the same. Different names, same shape and size. We had a world war 1 and 2. However, (Name) tells me that about 500 AD you invented gunpowder. We made no such discovery. As a result, World war 2 did not end.\" \"You want us to win a war for you. Well, there's only three of us. If (Name) comes, four of us. And we'll be going up against entire armys. If I recall, the Germans, who started the second world war, had millions of soldiers. Four men can't do this.\" \"That's not exactly the plan. You see, if you demolish a few of their camps, free the prisoners, (which will act as reinforcements), you'll have them freaked out. If 4 men can do that, their every idea of victory will be gone. Also, do you know what happened to (Name)?\" \"I heard he shot himself. If he intends to fight with us, he'll have to wait until he is fully recovered.\" \"Actually, I didn't shoot myself, its a long story, but when I went to the hospital, they noticed something. Kelly, break my arm.\" Now that caught Kelly by surprise. \"I'm not going to break your arm-\" \"Exactly. You can't. No matter how hard you try. My bones are 40+ times stronger than average, and the more time I spend on their planet, the stronger they become. If we win the war, we will be able to control the device that's doing this to me. And if you spend time there, it should happen to you.\" Now Jeff spoke. \"That's actuality pretty cool, but what can you really use that for?\" \"For instance, to kill me with a headshot, you'd have to hit me in the eyeball. I will never lose a tooth in a fight. A bullet, or in this case, arrow in the leg won't stop me. It won't even slow me down.\" Kelly said \"Okay, fine. But, I doubt their currency is worth anything here, I mean, the lady behind the counter at McDonald's won't accept a bill with Abraham Lincoln with a muzzle and ears on the top of his head.\" Sasha laughed, and then said \"I'm sure if they give you it in cash, you could go and buy say, gold. And hen bring it back here and get your cash that way... If you want to buy anything that we don't already have there. Almost everything is the same. The only things we don't have that you do would be guns and anything related to them, and clothing. We don't need it. Fur comes in handy that way. If you want, you will almost surely be given apartments at the most expensive places, the coolest cars...\" \"Well, it seems almost as though (Name) is turning into one of you. No offense, but I'm not sure I would stay.\" \"That's the beauty of it. You see, his mutation is being caused by an odd radiation source. If the war is won, we will be able to go to that source and shut it down, maybe even reverse it. You in?\" He nodded, and so did Don and Jeff. You said \"Good. Then we need to go first thing in the morning. We have to get back to my farm as soon as possible, and I need to find some WiFi. I have to order some radios. There's a place not too far from my farm that sells automatic weapons. You will need some money, but I'm sure they'll reimburse you. Pack plenty of clothes, and if you have any military gear, bring it. I have some night vision visors, but not much else. Meet me here tomorrow at what, 0600 hours? (You got a nod from Kelly) And make sure you all have plenty of gas.\" With that, they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drove over to the nearest McDonald's, and logged into their WiFi, and bought those radios. You bought faster shipping, they should be at your farmhouse when you got there. Then you went to a Walmart, and bought a cheap prepaid cell phone. You activated it, then went back to the parking lot, and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

When he finally pulled in, he was driving a fat-ass RV. He yelled from the window \"Hey, sorry I'm late, I hit a train. But, why don't we leave your cars here, and take this? It has a kitchen, a couch and a flatscreen, a bathroom, and 2 bunk beds, so we can save money on hotels and gas.\" He parked, and got out of the RV. You said \"Well, why didn't you say something about this last night? I mean, seriously.\" Jeff said \"Dude, its not a problem. Nobody ever comes here, we can leave our cars here.\" You looked at your vette. \"Well, you can, but I can't leave my car in a state I don't even live in. But I guess that's all right. I'll drive, but you guys can share a ride if you want. By the way Don, this is for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou handed him the cell phone. He said \"Well, thanks, but I don't use phones. You know that.\" \"I bought it so if we get split up, I wouldn't have to wait for you to find some WiFi and then meet up with you somewhere... Or if you have to go to the bathroom during the trip. I'm the only one who knows where this is, so if we get split up, you'd be lost.\" He sighed, and took it. Why he didn't like phones, you never could figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon then said, \"Oh by the way, who is she going with?\" Sasha looked at you. You said to her \"It's up to you. I don't blame you if you don't like the seats in that car, that car isn't designed for comfort. It's great for a few rides with your girlfriend, but not the highway.\" Don interrupted \"You mean she's your girlfriend? Have you been bangin' her?\" Everybody looked at Don. Sasha looked at you, and then him. Kelly looked at you, then Sasha, and then Don. Then he said \"I don't think he has to answer that. I mean, so what if he has, and you're not supposed to ask that kind of question anyway. Plus, they don't really seem to me like they've done that.\" You said \"Don, I'm gonna try to forget you said that, and not slug you upside the head with a rock hard fist and the velocity of a baseball bat.\" Don just rolled his eyes, and you said to Sasha \"I'm sure you'll be more comfortable with them. (although maybe not with Don) Even I kinda wish I could go in that.-\" Jeff interrupted \"You mean you don't want to drive that? Great. I've always wanted to drive a car like that.\" He started walking toward your car. \"Um, I'm not sure I trust you...\" You said, staring at the dent in the front if his car. He replied \"You don't seem to be one to talk.\" Pointing at the dent in your car. \"That wasn't my fault... I wasn't even in the car when that happened. Heck, I wasn't even on earth when it happened! Anyway, maybe we'll just take turns. I mean, if we do this right, it won't matter what you do to it. Again, we've drifted off track.

Shortly after, you heard your car start, and rev wildly as it did. You rolled your eyes, and explored the RV. Wow, Don was not kidding when he said that it was gonna be a better idea. You saw two tables, with 2 chairs each, and just beyond that was a couch, and on the wall opposite it was a rather large flatscreen. Beyond that were two bunk beds against the wall on either side, four beds in all. After that there was a wall, with a door right in the middle. That you assumed, was the bathroom. You sat sown on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Don started the RV and started driving. You said, \"Don, where you going? You don't know where my farm is.\" He said \"I'm going to Pennsylvania. Why don't you punch the address into the gps there? And call Jeff, and tell him to follow me. I'm not using one of those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes again, and called Jeff. When you were done, you set the gps, and turned back to the couch. Kelly had sat down next to Sasha, and had just started a conversation. \"Well, I don't think we really got introduced. I'm Kelly.\" He said as he offered a hand- er- paw shake. She shook and said \"I'm Sasha. Nice to meet you. (Name) tells me you can fight.\"He almost scoffed and said \"Well, you should see what I can do; with just my thumb.\" You sat down. She said \"I mean, with your guns.\" He said \"Well, any idiot can fire a gun, but not any idiot has been trained to use one like I have. It's actually kind of tough. We're trained to fight without remorse, and kill at the slightest breaking of the rules, follow orders to the most terrible ends, its hard on a guy. I've killed more people than I would care to count, and well, it gets to you at night. Most of the missions I've run were against armed terrorists, trying to steal or kidnap something or someone. Some back down and surrender, others well, I had to crush. To answer your question, yes, I am very good at using almost any gun. Almost.\" \"Well, you'll be fighting people that shoot crossbows and throw knives and use swords.\" \"Okay... Then it won't be hard to force a surrender.\" \"Well, the president and some of the top soldiers will want to see you in battle before they send you into battle, they'll probably put you in the arena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said \"Arena?\" \"Yes. It was originally a football stadium, that was built right where the border fell to the enemy.  So, they worked on it a bit, and made it into a sort of prison. The prisoners of either side are kept on either side of the arena. So, if I were to get captured, they would put me in their prison on their side, in their country. If we captured any of them, they would go into our prison, in our country. The arena has been set up with arrow-proof glass all the way around, so real battles can be held there. Each month, one random prisoner from each side is selected, and they battle to the death. The survivor wins his freedom.\" Kelly said \"Hmm. So, they're gonna put me in there with someone who's gonna try to kill me, and I have to show off my skills and kill him or her.\" She replied \"It's good because each side videos it and puts it on national live television. If you want intimidation, that's a good way to start.\" He looked at you. \"I don't know if that's a good idea right away. You see, I'd like to hit them hard once or twice before I do that. I'd like them to be completely oblivious to the fact that we are the reason say, 3 of their camps were demolished. Then we can show them. Once we show them what we can do, we can tell them that we are arming our army with the same kind of weapons and training them with the same skills.  That's when they'll surrender unless they're just stupid.\" </span></div></div>",

Then you swapped again, until about 1 in the morning. Because Sasha wanted to know about the human vision of aliens, you watched Men In Black, and one of the Aliens series, and Independance Day. You had just finished when Don pulled over for the night. Sasha said \"Interesting. We kind of had the sand idea about aliens, trying to take over for no apparent reason, but we never thought about the fact that that may be the same fear for them.\" Kelly said \"It started out as a simple conversation starter, and then a possibility, and then, well, almost a certainty.\" She asked \"Are you suspicious of us?\" \"Personally no. We have shown our good will to you, and intend to risk our lives to help you. You Sasha, have shown me that you have a good moral sense of right and wrong, and you seem to be just like one of us, and we wouldn't do that, so why would the majority of  you even want to try anything like that? (I say majority, because half of my life was spent fighting the small amount of people who don't care about others, and are willing to kill for even small amounts of money.) By the way (Name), you keep talking about being on their planet, and how similar our planets are, how did you end up there, and in the beginning, who discovered who?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\"You said, \"In their universe, about four earth years ago, there were reports of random dimensional holes appearing. They appeared in a different place every time, but nobody was reported missing. \"Yeah.\" Sasha said. \"Until the day I met Vicky in a cafe. We started arguing, and then she threw a punch at me. Then the portal appeared. We didn't understand why at the time, but it sucked us in, along with six others. I and Vicky were the only ones that had some history.The others were just minding our own business when it hit, but it sucked them in as well, and we all wound up landing on Earth on his farm, where his uncle was living, except for Vicky, and Tali, who landed near a cave less than a mile away. Why? Nobody knows.\" Kelly said \"So, his uncle knows about you too?\" She nodded and said, \"Yes, but, he died about a month ago. He took care of us all for 4 years.\" \"I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Don and Jeff came in, and Don said \"Okay, lights out. Oh and uh, who's gonna sleep on the couch?\" Both you and Kelly raised your hands, To make sure Sasha didn't end up on the bed. Then you both saw each other's hands, and you both put then down. Then back up, and then you all laughed a little. Then Kelly said \"Go ahead man, I'm used to a hard bench, it'll be easier for me than you.\" You thanked him, and got in bed.</span></div></div>",

You looked in the barn, but the bats had already went out, and you knew there was no way you would be able to find them. So you all went inside, and, it being 11:00 you all went to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next MORNING you went downstairs, and found Kelly talking with Tara and Tali at the breakfast table. When he saw you, he said \"So it really wasn't you that made the dent in that car.\" \"Yeah.\" \"So this \"Vicky\" hit Sasha, threw her in the back of your truck, and drove off. After then she shut the portal down behind you. And then ran like the wind, and then destroyed the portal. Is that right?\" You nodded, and asked \"Why?\" \"Because that tells me about them a little bit. Either she doesn't know about the power of the gun she was more than once almost killed by, (Which I desperately hope is the case) or she has some serious balls. Which is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said \"I guess I have bad news.\" \"Damn! Do you know what this tells me? It means they won't go down without a fight. So in the arena we'll have to hammer them HARD and literally knock the hell out of them to make them want to surrender. My day just got a whole lot harder. And the only gun I have is a berreta 92.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what were going to do today. About an hour from here, or rather, from the end of my driveway, is a place that sells fully automatic guns. Were gonna get some stuff from there, and then go to their planet. What happens then, I've got no idea.\" You said. He replied \"When do they open? Do they have the H&amp;K Mp5? The m4? Jeff won't settle for anything less than a m124, and I think as a secondary we should have an Uzi mag 9.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard him start saying the names of the guns, you grabbed a notebook and started scribbling. When you finished, you said \"Well, they open in about an hour, so we should go. Are the others awake?\" Just then you heard an alarm clock go off. You waited for it to stop, and it didn't, so you went upstairs to your room. Everybody had slept in your room, And when you got there you found Both Jeff and don, sleeping away as the alarm blared. You rolled your eyes and called their names. They still didn't wake up. So you went and grabbed two clothes pins and put them on the nose of don and Jeff. Then you ran out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 minutes later, they came walking down the stairs, grumbling. You didn't say anything about it, and they didn't either. You then told them that they had to go get some guns, so they grabbed some food and ran out the door. You and Jeff took the Corvette, and the others took the RV. You told Kelly to \"Follow me if you can.\" He looked at you a little funny, but he didn't say anything. You started driving, and when you were a little ways down the road, you waited until Jeff looked like he was asleep, then you gunned it. Let's just say he was REALLY glad he left his suitcase in the RV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou took them to get their licenses, and then to the gun store. You were amazed at what they had. Kelly recommended that you get an Uzi with a collapseable stock, and then either a AK 47, a M4, or a H&amp;K mp5. Eventually you decided to go with the AK 47. You also followed his advice and bought an Uzi. Then you bought a few different straps and holsters, a bullet proof suit, 4 magazines for each weapon and a Shit-load of ammo. Kelly picked the same, except he chose an mp5 instead. Don did too, but he picked an m4 instead. Jeff? Well, they didn't have his M124, (If you haven't looked it up already, that's a minigun) so he settled for 2 large Uzis and one micro Uzi. You made them all buy silencers for their secondary Uzis, and checked out. The guy behind the counter looked at you like he knew you were gonna cause trouble, but you didn't care. If anyone came looking for you, they'd never find you. Ever.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the RV, you had them gear up. When you got back, you showed them the portal. While Sasha activated it, you grabbed your parachute, just for fun. Then you all went through. It closed right behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started walking toward Butch's lab, and before you got halfway there, you were stopped by a black SUV. You knew it was armoured, but it didn't appear so. A gorilla got out, and said \"You must be (Name), and these must be the soldiers you were talking about. My orders are to bring you to the police station, for a little evaluation. Get in the car.\". He seemed friendly enough, so you did as he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the police station, they led you into a rather large room with security cameras, a bow backstop, and a table with 8 chairs. You all set your weapons down on the table, and looked at the backstop. Hay, and well, hay. But hey, it could stop an arrow, but not a bullet. You told them this, and a sheet of 1 inch steel was produced, and leaned up against the wall behind it. The gorilla told you just to wait until a few more people get there. What disturbed you all was the fact that they locked the door. You all sat down at the table, and waited. Then you heard something. It was</span></div></div>",

A panther in handcuffs had shoved a police man into a metal door, knocking him out cold. He then started running like hell, and soon he was going to run straight past you. Kelly saw this too, grabbed his Uzi, and after checking the doorknob and finding it locked, shot it off. You both then burst open the door, and faced him. He was only 10 feet away. He said \"Outta my way monkeys, or I'll do the same thing to you as I did to him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly said \"Is that a challenge?\" He gritted his teeth, and ran at you. You shot his right leg, and Kelly shot his left. He simply fell on his face. You both stepped back about 4 more feet, and waited until someone came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the same deer, tiger and leopard came walking down the hall, led by the gorilla from before. When they saw the panther on the ground, and the policeman on the floor, they guessed exactly what happened. The gorilla called for a few more men, and presently both of the wounded were removed. Then you all went back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all sat down at the table. When the praise died down, the deer said \"You must have used one of these weapons, but why didn't we hear them go off?\" You smiled, stood up, grabbed an Uzi, and \"Ka-chink\" fired a single bullet through the hey, and into the backstop. She nodded, and wrote something down on a clipboard. The tiger looked at you and said \"So, these are \"Them\"?\" You nodded and said \"This is Kelly, Don, and that's Jeff.\" \"And they can fight? I mean, without these guns?\" Kelly simply nodded. The tiger said \"Well, we were waiting for a soldier, the head trainer of our army. He called and said he will be here any minute now. As for these weapons, are they the kind that shoot 15 a second?\" Jeff grabbed one of his unsilenced Uzis and said \"This is a Israel model nine milimeter Uzi. It has a 60 round clip, and can fire 20 rounds a second.\" With that, he fired the gun for about a second, making a mess of the hey, and dropping about 22 spent shells clanging on the concrete floor. He then sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a bull walked into the room. \"Sorry I'm late.\" He said. The leopard said \"Dont worry about it. In fact, you came just in time. Show here fights the best? Kelly, Don, Jeff, and the bull raised their hands. The deer said Kelly, show us what you can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull walked to the center of the room, and Kelly got up and walked right in front of him. Then they waited. And waited. Then the deer said \"Uh, ding?\" The bull swung at Kelly wildly, with too much force to stop, exposing his left terribly. Kelly ran to the left, kicked him straight in the ass, ducked another swing, and smacked him right upside the head, knocking him clean into the air, until he landed on his back. Kelly said \"Oh man. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You NEVER turn your back on your enemy. You need to back off a bit. You fight with too much rage. I only kicked you to make you angry, so you would swing again. When you swing, you shouldn't swing so hard you expose yourself that much. Take it down a couple notches.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at the tiger, and then the deer, and then the leopard. They had wide eyes, and the deer still hadn't picked her jaw off the floor. The leopard said \"Well, then, I guess the only thing left is the matter of armour. We have some very-\" You interrupted and said \"We got that taken care of. I'm wearing it right now.\" You grabbed Jeff's micro Uzi, and shot a bullet into your sleeve. It bounced back onto the table, and the tiger picked it up. He looked and saw the deformed head, and also saw the tiny pattern of the threading of your bullet proof vest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay... I don't think an arrow could puncture that. Or a sword. Do you mind if we have a few minutes to talk?\" They left the room. The bull got up, and asked Don of he wanted to try. Don got up, took one step, slipped on the bullet casings, and fell on his ass. He got up and said \"Damn it, Jeff\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff had already went, and started sparing with the bull. He simply taunted him. Dodging every swing, but never losing any ground, and just going in circles, he continued until the bull smashed his fist into the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the leopard came back in. He said \"Well, were still doing paperwork, but as far as I'm concerned</span></div></div>",

This armour is the only reason we haven't lost the war already. You could have a tank roll over you and you would be just fine. You could even wear your armour underneath it if you wanted. Just, give it a look. Your armour seems to lack a headpiece, gloves, and boots. We will have some specially designed for you if needed, but please, it would honour our allies if you did.\" (They invented the armour) You answered \"Sure, but don't design it just yet, I'd like to have a little input.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes you four were whisked away, straight to an army base. You eventually ended up in a large room, with a large table in the centre, and on the table a huge map, with little towers and flags all over it. The Tiger from before, had been the only one that followed you. He said \"All right. We are here.\" He tapped a little tower with a long stick with a hook in the end. \"All the little blue towers are our forts. The red and green and yellow ones are enemy forts or camps.\" Looking over the map, you saw that the enemy had about 20 forts, and 10 camps. What you didn't like was the number of blue forts. There were 15. However, you noticed that the enemy towers were rather spread out, but friendly ones were rather concentrated. You asked \"Which ones are concentration camps? Which one is the nearist? (The tiger pointed one out) Good. We should probably hit that one first, and probably go in by stealth, maybe blow something up, and then start shooting like hell. Do you have C4? Grenades?\" He nodded. \"How much do you need?\" \"I'm not sure yet. And by the way, who should lead the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody moved. \"Kelly?\" \"I've always followed orders. I don't know how to command.\" \"Same here.\" Said Don and Jeff at the same time. Should you do it? Or should you let them run the show?</span></div></div>",

The falcon led each of you to a different person at a different computer. You were led to a cat. He reminded you of Tara.

He said \"Hello. My name is David Longtail, but everybody here calls me Dave. I heard you had some design input for the suits. My job is to redesign the suit for your needs. What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name \"David Longtail\" stopped you in your tracks.

I don't even need a bullet proof vest.\" \"Jeff, you're not going out there without this armour.\" He simply looked at you, almost in a challenging manner. You said \"That's an order.\" At that, his attitude completely changed, and he said in that military style \"Yes, SIR!\" and immediately turned back to the computer screen with a completely different attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised Dave a bit, and he asked you about it. You said \"Thy are trained to obey any order given to them by a superior officer. And I mean absolutely any order. I could order him to kill an innocent 4 year-old and he would do it without questions, and without hesitation. Not that I would, of course. Anyway...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really should've talked to your men about this, because in the end your suit was the most modified. It had tow holsters for your glocks right above the knee on the outside, at your waist on the right you had 6 slots for grenades and a radio, on your left you had a holester for your Uzi. In the middle of your back you had a parachute,and on the left of that you had a slot that fit the top of your AK 47. Between your glocks and your waist, you had slots for all of your clips. Every modification made had a button that had to be pressed to release the item. They were in the most convinient  places possible. For instance, to grab your glock, you had to press a little button with your pointer finger which was right where the trigger would be, so it didn't slow you down at all. Your mask, or rather, helmet, would be equipped with night vision, thermal view and an air filtration system, (in case of gas) as well as a radio, both to your men and to the nearest base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had holesters, but no parachute, and no mask upgrades, and Jeff and Don forgot to put a place for their clips, and had no mask upgrades either. In the end, they all ended up with a suit like yours, just modified to fit their weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that was finally finished, you noticed a few bats coming in to replace everyone. You looked at your watch, and well, yeah, it was 10:02 pm. You all were offered fancy quarters, and Kelly, Don, and Jeff accepted, but you didn't. You didn't know how loot you could go before you turned into an anthro. So you went home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got back, everyone wanted to know what had happened, but not everybody at once.

Eventually you found Dave, and you asked him to put a sort of slot on the belt, where an attachment could be installed if needed, on all of the suits. Because they had already made the torso of yours, he made you try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed at the flexibility it had, and the weight. It fit you perfectly. He then asked you what color or camo you wanted. After considering this, you went with </span></div></div>",

They had a general idea of where everything was, but didn't really know what to do. After they showed you a map of the entire camp, you suggested \"Why don't we enter from the sky? I mean, how else are we gonna get in? Don, can you hack security systems?\" He answered \"Probably, SIR! As long as they're the standard security cameras, laser beams and pop-up machine gun turrets, it'll be easy.\" The tiger, from before, said \"The locks on the prisoners cells are most likely electronic. Either remote controlled, or equipped with eyeball scanners, or both. If they are equipped with eyeball scanners, only the guards will be able to open the cells. The prisoners will act as your reinforcements, but if you can't get the cells open-\" You interrupted \"I don't think we need to worry about that. Obviously someone will have to take out the guards before the doors are opened, otherwise everyone will be killed. That will be easy if we can maintain stealth. So, we'll have someone hacking into their systems, and shut down the defenses, mainly the cameras. We don't even need the cells unlocked.  We can use the eyeballs of the dead guards for that, and if that doesn't work we can always just shoot the locks. Worst case scenario we lose stealth, kill the guards, blast open the doors and lead them out of the camp blowing off heads. Which reminds me. This main building here, (You tapped the map) is probably where the generals are, and that one there should be where the soldiers bunk. So I think one of us should set C4 in each of those places, and blow them to kingdom come. Whadaya think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon said \"Wrong order SIR! Shoot the guards first, then blow up the buildings, then open the cells and exit while \"Blowing off heads\". I mean, if the building is blown up first, the guards will know something's up, and our job will be 3 times harder. Not that I mind of course...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Now I guess, the only thing left is to decide who will do what. That building is the workhouse. Kelly, I want you very near that building. The instant you hear the buildings blow up you storm it, and kill anything that's holding a bow, and get the workers out of there. Don, I want you to plant C4 on each corner of the Generals' building. Jeff, you put C4 under the bunker. That building is 18 inches off the ground, held up by wooden stakes. Why? I think it had something to do with flooding. Use it to your advantage and plant C4 in each corner, but equidistant from the center. I will go to the cells and handle the guards. I'll have the detonater. I want you to radio me when you are clear of the blast radius. Boom. Then when I lead them all out, I want you to handle any survivors able to shoot a bow, and the guards at the gate. When its clear, that's where I'll lead them out. Then we radio home and have transportation brought to take us the rest of the way hi-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open, and the falcon from before said almost in panic</span></div></div>",

No way. Plus, if I drive around with any of those cars, people would first comment about the car, then ask me how I was ever able to afford one of those. You really shouldn't spend more than $30.000 if you really want to spend money.\" \"Well, alright, how about a '06 Ford mustang for $40.000?\" You shrugged. \"I guess that'll work. Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately started talking into a radio as she walked towards an office. You decided to wait by the door. Within 10 minutes, the most amazing Ford mustang came rolling up to the building, with a nice engine sound to it. It was black with the standard two streaks of white down the middle of the hood, roof and trunk. You felt like an idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then remembered what year it must be here, considering their 1 to 2 year ratio. By '06 mustang, she meant '13 mustang. And by '06, she really meant 1006. Yep, you really messed up this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother car was following it (Which would've been perfect for the job you needed one for) to apparently bring the driver back to the dealer. You looked at the mustang. This huge lady got out of the car, and dialed her cell phone. She clearly had a \"coupl' xtra suitcases in da trunk\". It really was a funny sight. It was a wonder her rear actually fit through the door. And a lady, that size, in a car like that? It was like seeing an old lady drop her cane, grab some six barreled monster of a gun and start sprayin' and prayin'. The cat from before ran out, signed some papers, and ran back in. The fatso got into the other car, and drove away. Right before she returned to her office, the cat said \"It's all yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff went immediately to the driver's side. You didn't care. Once you were on the road, he commented on the cars you could have had. He drove you through the portal, and you hopped into your car, put the hood down, and VRRROOOOOOOM! You and Jeff were cruising down your driveway at 110mph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it really necessary for me to go into what happened in the three days of nothing that followed?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nothing really happened during those three days. Kelly gave a little combat training class, and you got pretty good. He did it military style, but nobody liked the 15 minute non stop pushup sessions and the way he kept calling them \"Ladies\", and it scared a few people away, but you couldn't afford to quit. You noticed that the reason they were so easy for Kelly to beat was because when they fought, their animal instinct kicks in, and all training, all strategy is lost. They simply fought like animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey clearly couldn't be trained. There went the idea of reinforcements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you found yourself in a plane at 3:00 AM 15,000 feet up and about 5 minutes from the enemy base, putting on the armour. It went on in pieces that linked together. You were amazed by it's weight, and the flexibility it gave you. it didn't slow you down in the slightest. Most of today was spent in getting used to it. How to reload your gun, how to do it without looking, how to grab your guns and return them to theory holesters easily. Everything had been tested and was ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing, testing.\" You heard Don say into his mask. \"Is this thing on?\" You answered, \"Yes. You guys ready?\" All three of them answered in unison, \"Yes, SIR!\" \"Activate night vision.\" You heard a few clicks and turned yours on too. You never really got to try this, and it was rather surprising how much you could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all heard the pilot say, \"As soon as you jump, I'll have to get the heck out of here. However, we have a few transports under a minute away waiting for your call.\" \"Understood.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody jumped and moved into a diving position, just like you had when you jumped from Heather's apartment. Same height, same maneuver, different reason. About 50 feet up you pulled the chute, and you all landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whispered into the mike \"Kelly, your building is on the other end of the compound. Let me know when you're there. Try not to kill anyone yet. Use your silenced weapons only. Jeff you got that one, and Don, you're over there.\" Again in unison, they replied in a whisper, \"Yes, SIR.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour boots were designed to be silent. They were perfectly silent. There were large lights illuminating the main paths, but you could stay out of them if you kept to the wall. Your building was surrounded by a barbed wire fence. You found a spot out of the light, and began cutting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a 15 foot strip of grass between the fence and the building, and you followed that to the corner, but not around it. There they were, two guards. You had to get past them, without making noise. You walked around the other side of the building, and found a window had been left open. You looked in. You saw all the prisoners, but the thing that interested you was the large water bucket by the wall. Ka-chink! You put a hole in it, and a steady stream of water started pouring out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards didn't hear the gun, but they heard the water splashing onto the floor. They both came charging in in a violent rage, screaming \"No pissing in the cells!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant they saw the water was the instant you shot them. You took care to shoot them in the neck, so their eyeballs would be preserved. You hopped through the window, attracting the attention of everyone in the room. You picked up one of the guards and opened his eye to the scanner, unlocking all the cells. You said to them \"Wait, its not safe. We have roughly 4 minutes until someone notices they're missing. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost messed your pants when you heard the words \"Kelly is in position.\" And then \"Don has set the package, and is clear of the blast radius.\" You took a deep breath and said, \"Jeff, status?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost clear of the blast range... You can blow it now if you need to.\"  \"Good-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interrupted by panther who said \"If you're gonna get us out of here, you gotta get the people in the gas chambers building. They JUST got sent there and the odds are pretty good that they're still alive.\" \"I'll try.\" you answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoke into the radio \"Don and Jeff, change of plans. I need you two to in the prison room to lead them out, now. I gotta go and see if I can get the people being sent to the gas chambers.\" \"You sure you don't need a hand with that?\" A voice that really could've been either Don or Jeff said. \"No, I got it. Remember, stealth is everything. You mess up and I won't be able to save them.\" \"SIR yes SIR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three bats with you, and they seemed the most aware, the most awake. You said to them \"Take the crossbows of the guards, and stay in the corners. Anyone except people in armour like mine you shoot.\" With that, you ran out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the gas chambers, you peeked around the corner and saw a small crowd being shoved into a room by spears. You waited until the heavy door was shut, set your Uzi on full auto, and sprayed a long streak at about head level. You only missed one guy. He turned around, and said \"Wha-\" and fell down with 4 holes in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran in, and ripped the door open. The room was already full of green gas. Most of the people ran out, but your thermal vision setting revealed two people passed out on the floor. You immediately ran in and grabbed them, and you were very glad they were children and therefore didn't weigh much. You ran out and gave them to the stronger looking anthros. You then spoke into your radio, \"Switch to main weapons. Jeff, Status?\" You started loading your AK 47.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don and Jeff are in position.\" They replied. You said \"Kelly?\" \"Ready to Roll\" you looked out the door, and grabbed the detonater. \"Good, cause its showtime.\" (Click) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a deafening explosion, the kind that one hears when two explosions sound as one, and your ear was ringing. Since you were sure none of them could hear you, you motioned for them to follow, and you ran out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed a problem. The building that had the generals quarters and the security equipment (which had \"malfunctioned\") must have had another bunker underneath, because soldiers were flooding out of the ground like ants. You started shooting like hell. When you had to reload you screamed \"GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!\" And pointed toward the gate, which Don and Jeff had already handled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they started running for the gate you yelled into the mike, \"Kelly! Are you done?\" \"Yes, SI-\" \"Point your group toward the gate and run to the north west building that got blown up, I need really your help here!\" \"Yes, SIR!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to fire in short bursts to conserve your ammo. You ran toward the prison building and started firing from the door using the wall as cover. From this position the soldiers came flying out straight at you, about 20 yards away. Your gun stopped firing, so you threw a grenade and reloaded, and started shooting again. Then you saw Kelly. He was running towards the bunker entrance. Then he stopped in the middle of the road, and grabbed a manhole cover, and started running again until he was right behind the entrance. He threw the manhole on the ground, and stood on it. Then he threw a grenade down the hole, waited for the bang. Then he threw a pack of C4 Down the hole and said \"Fire.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started \"But you'll-\" \"FIRE!\" (Click) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother deafening explosion made the ground jump. The manhole Kelly was standing on protected him from the explosion, but threw him up into the sky. Below him was a sea of fire, so he pulled his parachute. But the hot air caught that and threw him up into the sky even farther, just like a hot air balloon. He didn't seem to care though, he just started shooting the few guys that had survived the explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he stopped firing. You said into the radio \"So, Kelly. How's the view way up there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer you got wasn't from him, but from Jeff. \"Way up where? I don't- HOLY SHIT! Don't tell me you stood practically on top of that C4!?\" \"Yep, that's what I did. That's a new one. You should try it sometime. Did you call the transports?\" \"Affirmative. The first just took off, and I have a visual of the second, but that won't hold everybody, so we leave on the third.\" Then you said \"Then mission accomplished, let's get out of here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Kelly landed, and you all went out the gate to the second transport. You made sure the children that had passed out in the gas chamber got immediate medical attention, and then waited with the rest of the survivors for the third transport, which wasn't far out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help asking Kelly \"So, what the hell made you think that was a good idea? And how come you're still in one piece? A blast like that would-\" He interrupted \"A blast like that would break every bone in the average man's body. Fortunately we're not average men. I probably would have survived that landing without the parachute too, even without the armour. By the way, the view was great up there. You know, nothing says we can't do the exact same thing to a few more camps as their mostly identical. This could get pretty easy.\" \"I dunno, I've only got four shots left in my AK 47.\" \"Well, buy a couple more clips and you'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the transport landed. You heard the voice of the commander, the tiger from before, say \"Well done boys, first round 's on me.\" And then the voice of someone else say \"And the second 's on me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Kelly and shrugged. You knew he was thinking the same thing: There was no way you were going to get any sleep tonight.</span></div></div>",

It was about 5 feet off the ground, had some huge speakers, and a decently sided jumbo-tron directly on the wall behind the stage. On the ground directly in front of the stage were a bunch of tables, and chairs, but everybody was sitting on the opposite side so they could face the stage. Here and there young waitresses popped up, bringing food, refills, taking orders... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the side of the room were four tables, each elevated above the rest by about two feet. Each had on the tablecloth the name of You or one of your men, with many other chairs around the table. You were told that people that wanted to sit in one of those chairs had to pay around $300, but that didn't seem to matter because the tickets had gotten sold and resold, and now were valued at about $700. You were also told that a few people had had those seats from the start. They had been the popular people like the president, ambassadors from other allied countries, the inventor of the armour you wore, a couple of supermodels and movie stars... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big booming voice blared from the speakers \"Ladies and gentlemen, please put your paws, hands, legs and/or flippers together for President CHARLES FARGO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a roar of applause as an almost overweight badger walked out onto the stage with a Mic in his hand and said \"Thank you, thank you.. I cannot tell you just what an incredible honor it is to be here today. Here, in the presence of true heroes, who went out against incredible odds to save those people over there.\" Another loud roar of applause broke out as he pointed to the left where there was a party already going, between families and friends who had been recently reunited. When the applause and cheers died down, he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They changed their plans to save those being sent to a gas chamber, which ended up with one of them running into the gas to save two dying children who had already passed out. I am proud and relieved to say that these children are here with you tonight, alive and well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another round of applause, he continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why they changed their plans, I do not know, but show better to ask then the heroes themselves!? So ladies and gentlemen, without further adieu, (Name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to walk off the stage, and met you on the middle. He gave you a handshake, and passed you the mic. Some music had started playing, and a few fireworks went off, the audience roared yet again. You walked right to the center of the stage, and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What better way to tell a story than from the beginning. I started about 1500 feet up falling straight down. About 50 feet from the ground, I pulled my parachute, and landed. Using a completely silent weapon, I snuck around the compound while the others did the same. Fortunately we were not discovered. I went to the cells where the workers were locked up for the night. I walked around the building until I found a window, and looked in. I saw the guards, but shooting them would mean having someone see them fall. Now if someone heard a scream but didn't see anything, they would just assume it to be from one of the prisoners. So, I had to get them away from the door of the building. That's when I noticed a large bucket of water on the ground. Now my weapon fires a small projectile, almost like a sling shot, but with 10 times the power. So I put a hole in the bucket, and a steady stream started pouring out. Now the guards heard this and thought that someone was peeing in the cells. As there are some younger children here, I won't say what he said, so let's just say I killed them and unlocked the cells. That was when a panther, whom I now know to named john blackpaw, told me of the people being sent to the gas chambers. So upon finding that two of my other men were done with their jobs, I told them to come and lead these people out. I went towards the gas chamber myself. Here again, I cannot describe exactly what happened, but I killed the guards and ripped open the door. Now thanks to Mr. George Ironclaw and David Longtail, my helmet was equipped with a thermal view setting. This revealed two children passed out in the corner. I ran in and grabbed them, as anyone would. Now, Jeff and Don were terrorists in the plan, they went and set bombs in or under the generals quarters and the soldiers' bunkers. I had the detonater. This is when I blew both buildings up. That would've taken care of everything and everyone there I thought. Well, that wasn't what happened. Under the general's quarters there must've been another bunker, because soldiers were flooding up the stairs, bows and blades in hand. Now I will have Kelly tell you what he did about this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly walked onto the stage. Again, there was another round of applause and a few fireworks and some music, until he got right next to you. You gave him the Mic, and he continued your story. He said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my job from the start was to go to the forced labor factory, and when he blew the other buildings, I was supposed to head in and get the workers out of there. I shot anyone with a whip, sword, or bow, and led them out. That's when (Name) called me. So I pointed the group towards the gate, which Don and Jeff had already secured, and ran to the, well, scene if you will. I knew exactly what I was going to do. I stopped in. The middle of the road, and grabbed a manhole cover. I threw that on the ground directly above the underground bunker. I threw a grenade down the hole, and waited for the bang. Now each of us had been equipped with,a pack of C4, that I threw down the hole after the grenade. I stood on the manhole cover, and was shot sky-high by the explosion. The manhole cover protected me from most of the blast, but below me was a literal sea of fire, and a bunch of rocks still in the air. I figured I didn't want to land on that, so I pulled my parachute. The hot air from the fire caught my parachute, and lifted me up higher much like a hot air balloon. I just started shooting whoever survived the explosion. I mean, what else am I going to do, you know? After that, I waited 'till I landed, loaded everyone up on three different transports, and 12 minutes later I find myself here. Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gave him another large round of applause as he walked off the stage, and the same big booming voice said, Well, we now have a few bands who are still setting up, they should be ready to go in about ten minutes. Thank you for you patience.\" </span></div></div>",

You noticed that at your table were Dave, Sasha, Luna and Heather, Bess, Butch, Marie, and then five other anthros you'd never seen before, and two empty seats. You were very glad that all guests were required to wear name tags, or you'd probably have a few awkward incidents. I mean, these other people were movie stars, billionaires or multimillionares, maybe a sports star or singer... To anyone who lived in that country, these people would've been recognized by anyone. (What if you had to ask a guy like say, Will Smith, \"I'm sorry, who are you?\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down, and the commander, (Whose name you finally found to be Joseph Slash) true to his word, asked you what you wanted to drink. You thought for a second, and chose a fireball whiskey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked off, everyone at the table introduced themselves. There was a cat, not like Tara or Dave, but a calico. Her name was \"Cali\" Cottontail. She was a singer. Then there was a turtle named George, who owned some multi-billion-dollar corporation, a deer named bertha, who owned a different one, a fox, named Todd, who apparently worked for George, and a hulking giant of a tiger named Avory. He was a movie star, a weight lifter, and had a bunch of medals around his neck from something or other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and the empty seats are for the others from the farm. Jane, well, you know why she's not here, and Tara. I really have no idea why she's not-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara?\" Interrupted Dave, \"Tara Longtail?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know her?\" Said Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know her, she's my niece!

They all ran pretty much the same way. He got insulted, someone got maimed. Every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the great big jumbo tron started showing satellite footage of you and your men. There was a lot of sneaking around, now that you thought about it. After your team split up, the screen followed Don. It was a little odd, but you didn't mind. You were just confused because Don really didn't get to do much. That was when you saw it. Don had had a fight. Two bats had seen him. They cut around a corner and stopped right in front of him, crossbows ready. In one swift movement he shoved both crossbows to the outside. Then he just beat them up. Everyone laughed when Don ducked and one hit the other accidentally. Soon they were both out cold, and Don continued his route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed with everyone else, but then it hit you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were witnesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they told anyone about that there would be preparations made for another such attack.

Apparently Don had injured them beyond a whack on the head, because neither of them were flying. Satellites revealed them moving about 15 mph towards the nearest camp. They were already about halfway to their destination. The plan was to intercept them. Plain and simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pilot,\" said Don, \"ETA?\" She answered, \"4 minutes closer than the last time you asked me.\" in a rather annoyed tone. He rolled his eyes and put on his mask. The co-pilot started talking on the radio. After a while he stopped and said \"Apparently they've stopped. You need to jump in about 30 seconds. We'll be nearby when you're ready to go.\" You said to your team, \"You know what? I want to handle this one. Doesn't sound that hard. You mind if I handle this?\" Jeff answered \"Sure. I may have had too much alcohol back there to do this right anyway.\" Don nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your AK-47 and jumped. You landed about 25 yards ahead of them. You turned on your night vision, and approached. You started to hear heavy and fast paced breathing, as if someone were in pain. As you continued you herd some hitting, on what and with what you couldn't tell. Soon however you saw some firelight, and that question was answered. You walked over and pushed a branch out of the way. There they were. One was laying on the ground, the other was starting a fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both saw you and screamed. Then the one by the fire said in a completely panicked frenzy \"We surrender! We surrender! Just don't kill us! We surrender!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed that the one laying on the ground was laying in a pool of blood. His arm had been broken and he was bleeding out. He was gonna die if he didn't get help fast. You ran over and yelled into the mike \"Get a medic on the radio! I need a medkit now!\" Your co-pilot answered \"Were on our way down now. However the closest place I can land is in the clearing 100 yards away. However, a package should land near you momentarily.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Thud) You said \"I need you to put some pressure on it. Keep the pressure on. Look at me and stay awake.\" The other bat brought you a box. A standard medkit. This must've been the package he had referred to. You opened it and started bandageing him up. When you were done, you grabbed him and pointed your glock at the other bat. \"We're going to the clearing over there. If you try anything I'll kill you both.\" He started running at top speed, and you were somehow able to keep up and carry another person at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And if I were you, I wouldn't try.\" Kelly responded. \"Why?\" \"Because there's a chance we'll let you go, but if we do, we won't want you knowing to much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe co-pilot came back and helped you property bandage the winded bat's wounds, but other than that the rest of the ride was uneventful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you landed, four guards escorted the prisoners away, and someone had brought a few flashy cars to drive you back to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you said in explaination for your sudden departure on the stage was \"Just a little prisoner problem.\" Back at your table, that wasn't good enough.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, or rather, afternoon, your training session with Kelly seemed easier. Sure, it had been getting a little bit better everyday, but this time it was through the roof. He had you carry your rifle and run 15 miles, and you found that you didn't have to breath very hard. In fact, you didn't have to catch your breath when you finished. He made you do 15 minutes of push-ups, 15 minutes of sit-ups and 10 minutes of chin-ups. He made the whole team do it, and he did it himself, but when you finished, you didn't want to stop. You had been provided with a weight lifting room, with punching bags and a regular boxing ring. That was where you would spar. You had gotten pretty used to the taste of that mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Don, you verses me.\" Kelly said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes SIR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had their lucky shots, their good days, but Jeff seemed to have the most. You seemed to have the least. So, you always watched them as they spared and tried to steal as many leaves from their books as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon won that round, so he got to challenge someone. He almost always followed these rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Never fight the same guy in a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Always pick the most skilled person. (without breaking number 1)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, he never picked you. So you walked over to the chin-up bar. Then you heard your name. You turned around. Don said \"I challenge (Name)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed a pair of gloves, and hopped over the ropes. You knew you were going to get your ass kicked. But that didn't mean you weren't going to put up a fight!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bell went off and the fight began. You focused on dodgeing without losing any ground, and swinging where there was an unguarded area. The problem was, there never was an unguarded area. Then, in the middle of the fight, a certain sensation swept over you, followed by a huge rush of adrenaline, a sudden swing, and a WHAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had hit Don right above his left ear. You actually hit him. How? For the first time, you actually got a hit on- WHAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon recovered quickly, and wasted no time in mashing you on the ground. Then he got up, and you got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure didn't see that one coming!\" He said with a big grin on his face. \"I can't believe I actually hit you.\" You said. \"That was your mistake,\" He said, \"Never be afraid to finish someone off. You're in a war, nobody's gonna blame you. And nobody's gonna be angry with you except the enemy, and they all have 100 other reasons to hate you anyway. Next time, finish it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But that's not what shocked me. Something happened to me. I don't know what but it was, like, time. Slowing down. It was so wierd. I can't expalin it any better than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else happened?\" Asked Jeffx ,\"Do you think this may have anything to do with the mutation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" You replied, \"But during the training, everything was, well, too easy. It was like I had lost 50 pounds overnight. I could probably run for a solid hour non stop at full speed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you?\" Asked Kelly. \"If you can, you should. I'll have to make the training harder.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and walked away. You had to waste another 6 hours before you talk to the prisoner, so, what the heck. You went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch had done some clever thing with mechanics and a few hairs from various different anthros, so you could go back and forth without bothering anybody, at the press of a button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the GPS out of your car, and looked down your driveway. A straight road as far as the eye could see. You wanted to know what had happened with Don, and how to reproduce that, well, whatever that was. You ran down the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster, faster, faster, faster...\" You kept thinking to yourself. When you thought you'd reached your limit... Something clicked. All of a sudden, that same sensation hit you, followed by an insane rush of adrenaline. Time didn't seem to slow down, YOU seemed to slow down. So you sped right back up. That was when you saw a bird. You watched it as you ran by. It was flying, but only flapping it's wings about once every two seconds. If one thinks about that, one would find that impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was so wierd that you slowed down, and stopped. Now the bird was flying regularly, flapping its wings about two times a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only wierd thing you saw. When you looked back, you couldn't even see your farm. You ran back, and in about two minutes you had made it back. You ran inside, straight up to your room. You opened your laptop, and looked at the gps tracker stats. Recently it had went 20 miles an hour... Then 40 miles an hour, then 20 again. That meant you had actually ran 40 miles an hour. You looked at the numbers in disbelief, when Sasha walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just out of curiosity,\" She said, \"What were you doing outside? When I heard the portal, I thought you'd come inside. Not go running down the driveway!\" You said nothing, but simply pointed at the numbers and the route you had taken. She looked and said \"There's no freaking way that happened.\" \"I'm as confused as you are.\" You said. \"That can't be right, but something tells me it is.\" \"I can't even run that fast.\" She said. \"I bet Marie can.\" \"Yeah,\" She said, \"She could probably tell you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later you found yourself about to ask a horse if it wanted to have a foot race with you. You thought you were insane. You walked into the stable and said \"Hey Marie, wanna race?\"</span></div></div>",

Where's the track?\" She said. \"Over here.\" You said, walking toward the driveway. You pointed down the road. \"See that tree over there? The really far one? The third one down?\" She nodded. \"From here to there?\" \"Yep.\" Then she asked, \"Should I use two legs or four legs?\" \"Whatever.\" You answered. \"Considering you can only use two, I'll do the same. Ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Set?\" You said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO\" You both yelled together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took off as hard as you could. Somehow she was still about 2 mph faster than you. You concentrated on that well, whatever it was that doubled your speed, and nothing happened. Nothing happened. You were about a quarter of the way there and you were already gonna lose. Right before you gave up, *click* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou easily passed her up, and continued as if nothing had happened. About halfway there though, you looked back to see how far behind she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right next to you, going about a half-a-mile-per-hour faster than you. You noticed that she was keeping her arms close to her body. You copied her, (Not very well) and was able to stay neck and neck with her. Then you started thinking. You had seen Kelly run. He moved his arms more, but jolted them forward, effectively lengthening his stride by about 10 percent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried this, and she started to lag behind. You could see her try to push harder, but to no avail. You continued this way for the rest of the race. You finished about a half second ahead of her. You walked over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said \"Well, I'm beat.\" You shrugged, and she said \"I didn't know humans could to that.\" You said \"We're not supposed to, its my mutation.\" She looked at you funny before saying \"You run like a cheetah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay,\" you said, confused. \"Is that a good thing or a bad thing?\" \"You tell me. But it looks like you're turning into a cheetah. They're the only ones who run like that naturally, and can beat a horse in a race.\" She said as she started jogging back. (at about 20 miles an hour) You caught up and asked \"So, how fast do you think we were going back there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good 40 miles per hour, easily.\" She replied. \"That's insane.\" \"That's average.\" \"For a human I mean. Half that would be an accomplishment for the fastest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back to the farm, and took a nap until it was time to go back to the anthro planet. </span></div></div>",

You were walking down a hall with brown doors on either side. Then you noticed your battle armour, and the fact that you had no guns. Just a knife. You pulled it out, and held it upside-down in your fist as Don had taught you. You continued down the hall, until you hit the end. You opened the door- and ran right through a set of laser beams! An alarm went off, and the door slammed behind you. You ran back and found it locked, then looked into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a wall of soldiers, mostly large cats, armed with claws and teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey charged at you. You ran at them and fought back. You started pulling moves you didn't even know you knew, but there were simply too many of them. You ducked a swing, kicked something in the balls, jumped back up, swung your hips around and kicked something else, but then something caught your foot. He twisted you around, slamming you on your face. Then you were picked up, and handcuffed. They walked you out of the room. Then you noticed the alarm still blareing. Come to think of it, that alarm sounded a lot like your alarm clock... Wait a minute. You pinched yourself, and- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, you went downstairs, grabbed some food, you went out and turned the portal on. You looked into the barn, and saw two cows and two sheep. One cow was milking the other, and one sheep was shearing the other. \"Hey hun, what's up?\" Said one of the cows, which you assumed was Bess. \"Hey,\" you replied, \"Who are they?\" She replied \"Oh, they've been coming every other day to handle and maintain the place, you seemed to busy.\" \"I'm sorry about that, I-\" \"Dont be sorry,\" she interrupted, \"You went off to war. You're saving lives, instead of a few things around here. What you're doing is much more important.\" \"Well, okay, again I gotta go.\" \"Bye bye.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you stepped through the portal, and closed it. Your mustang was waiting, and you drove to the military base. It was pretty neat, now everyone knew your face. There were people pointing, starring, yelling to their friends \"Look! There's \"(Name)!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to the base, and were led down the hall by a hippo. He told you the prisoner who had not been wounded was named Kyle Ventor, he had been a guard, and was on patrol when he saw Don. He wouldn't say any more, and was demanding to see one of your team. Preferably the leader.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you got your armour on, and put on your mask, so as to prevent his knowing of your species. You were led into a room, and the door was locked behind you. There was a camera in the top right corner of the room, and a huge mirror on the wall to your left, and a table with two chairs in the middle of the room. You sat down, and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, an octopus was man-handeling Kyle into the room. Literally. It sat him down in the other chair, as through your mask, you gave it a \"What the heck are you doing?\" Look. Then it left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said \"You must hate that.\" \"I do. He's manipulating me like I'm some sort of puppet.\" \"Well, he's married, he knows what it's like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scoffed and said \"So you finally agreed to see me. What took you so long?\"  \"It shouldn't have been too long,\" You said, looking at the clock, \"Did you stay up all day?\" \"Yes. I was beginning to think you were nocturnal.\" \"You must understand,\" You said, \"I will only speak to you at 9 AM and PM. I don't want you to have any hint as to what I am. Had you simply slept through the day this might have been a lot easier for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't say anything, so you said \"So, why did you want to see me?\" \"I wanted to know how we were beaten so easily.\" He said. You replied, \"You're not going to fool me that easily. Tell the truth.\" He said nothing. Then you said \"Okay, then I will. You wanted information in case you were released, or somehow escaped.\" He again said nothing. So you said \"So here's how this works. There are two possible things I could want. 1. I could want you to be ignorant of how we did anything that happened back at your base, and therefore have nothing to say about upgrades and reinforcements to prevent this happening again. 2. I could want you to know it all, and then go back to your authoritys and panic the entire nation. I am not going to tell you which, and you are going to tell me everything you know. If you leave something out, I'll know. And then your chances of release will drop 90%. Do you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. You said \"Good. What do you know?\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You couldn't have entered by one of the supply trucks, they're all checked before and after departure. Septic systems are armed with motion sensors and thermal sensors, so you couldn't have gotten in that way. We always have people watching the sky, so you couldn't have done that either. My best guess would be that you hacked into the septic system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... How did you see my partner?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bat eyes and luck. Lots of luck. He, or she, made absolutely no noise. I whispered it to my partner and attempted to stop him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you radio for help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would've heard me. I thought he was an escaped worker. And we had bows, workers never score a bow and if he somehow had, there were two of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you came around the corner right in front of my partner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and he beat us up. It was so wierd. He beat us like... like... I just can't explain it. It was like we simply couldn't hit him, but he could hit us. And the bows didn't even make him blink, he just saw them, and shoved them to either side and bam!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what do you remember after that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when my friend woke up, he woke me up. All I saw was destruction. By the way, how did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please save your questions for the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... He showed me his wing, and I knew that if he didn't get help soon, he wasn't gonna make it. So I grabbed him and ran. I ran toward the nearest camp. The supply building was all but gone. Eventually though, his wounds proved to be to severe, and I had to stop to try to stop the bleeding. I couldn't see very well, so I had to make a fire... And that's where one of your guys showed up. Thank him for me, if he hadn't have done what he did my friend would've surely died. How is he by the way?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been given proper medical attention, blood, and a decent bed. He slept through the day, and is doing pretty well. He can walk, and I wouldn't be surprised if he was flying by the end of the month.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, that's such a relief. When can I see him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I see him first and confirm everything you've told me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found yourself in a hallway. You looked up, down around... It kind of reminded you of somewhere... You weren't sure where. There were doors on either side, but you decided to continue until the end of the hall. There, you found a door. When you went through it, you went straight through a set of laser beams, setting off an alarm. You looked back, but the door had locked itself, so you looked forward. A huge, endless wall of soldiers, anthro soldiers, were running at you, waving claws and grinding teeth. Then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAKE UP! WAKE UP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, right into the face of Tara. \"Tara? What th-\" You started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're under attack! They need you now!\" She screamed, in complete panic. \"Sasha is starting the portal with Tali. Go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw your sheets to the side, and jumped out the window. It was pitch black outside. You got into your car, fired it up, squealed your tires and turned right through the portal. You drove like a madman. Your armour was at the military base. You parked at the side of the building, broke through the window, threw open the cabinets and put on your suit. You grabbed your guns, all the ammo, grenades, a pack of C4... Everything you could think of. You then ran out the broken window and found that someone had parked an army jeep for you to use and moved your car out of the way. You jumped in the jeep and again were driving like a madman. What was really odd was the fact that you were the only one with a working vehicle. Everybody else's were parked in the strangest places including the middle of the road. And for some reason, the lights on your truck didn't work. You also had no idea where the attack was so you went the against the flow of foot traffic. You figured the civilians would run from the fight. And you were right. You said into your mask \"Kelly, do you read me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply was mostly static, but you could tell that he was trying to answer but that you were out of range, or there was a jammer running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you saw the battle. It was in a countryside on the edge of the city. You listened. You heard war cries, but no gunshots. Where the hell where your men? You drove straight for the advancing wall of soldiers. Then, this massive arrow flew and smashed the engine of your truck, stopping it completely. You however, didn't stop. You flew. Headfirst. Into the concrete. You were glad you had the armour. You jumped up, ripped out your knife, and started some hand to hand combat. It really wasn't that hard at first, these people couldn't fight worth a damn. But, there were too many of them. 1 vs 1 was easy. 2 vs 1 was easy. 6 vs 1? That was pushing it. Your free hand grabbed your Uzi, and you started sprayin'. Pretty soon you just had pretty much demolished this little group. You turned around, and saw a tank. Tanks on this world certainly wouldn't be bullet proof, but they were pretty well armoured and they all had a huge bow on The top. Then something hit you from the side, and you fell. You kept to your feet, knife and Uzi in hand, ready for anything. It was a brown horse... MARIE!?!? Then you noticed the huge arrow that barely missed you because of her. Oh yeah, tank. Right. You grabbed your AK - 47 and fired. Arrow proof glass is not bullet proof. You killed the drivers and the operators. Then you heard other gunshots. There was an overturned car nearby that could serve as a good shield. You ran over behind it and tried the radio again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, do you read me? I repeat, Kelly do you read me?\" \"Loud and clear commander.\" \"Where are you?\" \"Listen to the gunshots.\" \"Okay, I have Marie with me... And-\" \"What the hell is Marie doing here?\" \"I don't know. What does it look like up there?\" \"Plenty of enemies, but we can handle 'em. There's some heading around toward you though that we can't. You think you can handle them?\" \"I'll try. (Name) out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peeked over the top of the car and saw another set of enemies, like the ones you just leveled. Two tanks this time though. You handed Marie your Uzi and said \"Its not safe to run back to the city now. This is an Uzi mag 9. Look flabby the top like you would an arrow, and pull the trigger. It should have enough ammo to last through these guys. They don't know were here, so we can get right up close to them. If we let them know we're here, the tanks will ruin our cover. Just wait for my signal, then jump up and start shooting. Okay?\" She looked at the Uzi and said \"Okay, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened. You heard the soft, rhythmic sound of their footsteps, and got an idea. You took the suppresser off of the Uzi and put it into one of your glocks. You were lucky that both guns were 9mm. You shot directly through the car, and out of sheer luck, hit a soldier between the eyes. He fell without a cry. You looked through the bullet hole and shot three more. That was when they figured out they were under attack. You grabbed your AK-47 and said to Marie \"NOW!\". Then you ran out from behind the car, spraying. Marie was a little slower, but she managed to get away before the tank blew the car away. She then started shooting anything and everything that moved. You took care to shoot the archers and the tanks first. Soon, you and Marie were the only ones standing. Marie gave you your Uzi, and then ran back to the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around with your night and thermal vision, and finding no survivors, started running towards the gunfire. You reloaded your guns, and your mask highlighted your men. You saw that they were fighting hand to hand. You asked \"Are you guys out of ammo or something?\" \"Yep.\" \"Okay, I've got some... Anything you need me to hit?\" Don replied \"How about this tank that keeps following me around?\" Your mask colored the tank red. \"And then maybe the guys in that jeep... Save the jeep if you can though, we don't have any vehicles.\" Your mask colored the jeep green and the men inside it orange. You shot out the windshield of the tank, and threw a grenade into it. You heard the bang, and the tank stopped moving. You then aimed carefully, and shot the men out of the jeep. You then ran to the jeep, kicked the corpses put of it, and started driving. You used your Uzi with your left hand, and shot a rain of fire at the other tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChange to Jeff's POV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazing yourself at your skills. You were faster than them. Put simply. They couldn't hit you. You ducked a swing with a sword, stabbed something with your knife, jumped to the left and barely missed an arrow, jumped a spear, swung your foot kicking something away, slashing something else, punching something square in the nose... Then suddenly... *Click* Everyone slowed down. It was so wierd. You were fighting 5 at once, but everyone was moving at half speed. You stabbed something, and went to stab something else, but punched him instead. You looked down at your knife, and found it had broken. Damn. You kinda liked it. You dropped the handle, turned around and slammed your hands into a clap, stopping a sword from hitting your helmet. You yanked on it, and swung your foot around and kicked it's bearer in the face, causing him to lose his weapon. Then you swung it so hard it cut three soldiers in half. That was when the last 3 got so scared they ran away... Straight into your allies. What the hell took them so long? They quickly surrendered, and were handcuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard (Name) say \"Hey guys, I saved the truck, hop in.\" And saw him drive over to pick Kelly and Don up. then he drive to you. He contacted the commander, and drove back to the military base. </span></div></div>",

It took awhile but you finally narrowed it down to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should bring these guys in for questioning asap, ok guys.\" Said Kelly, you all agreed with him and sent some soldiers to go get them. Then suddenly you hear a pop and then a loud ringing sound which hurts your ear drums more then anything. You drop to the ground and start to scream in pain. While all of this is happening Kelly is yelling,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET A MEDIC NOW!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the medic arrived you had passed out due to the shear pain. Hours later you woke up on a bed with Sasha and Tara sitting across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah my head, what happened?\" You ask still dazed by the current events in which to you had just happened, but in the reality of it all they happened hours ago, you just did know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Your name) You need to take it easy ok.\" Says Sasha<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you have been through a lot\" Tara says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" You ask them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should see for yourself.\" Sasha says as she hands you a small handmere. You look at it and see your image but something looks wrong. Your ears had shifted to the top of your head and they now looked like Sasha's. You stared in amazement then you reach for one of your ears. It feels soft just like a huskies ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" You say absent minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that pain just to change my ears... Man its going to suck when a bigger change happens.\" You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it helps we will all be their for you.\" Says Kelly, he surprised you and it made you jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dam it Kelly you scared me have to death.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha sorry but I need to get in on the conversation some how and you gave me a perfect entry point.\" He says with a big smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do man, because if anybody on earth see's you like this then your going to be screwed.\" Kelly says, and he was right. If anyone seen you, then you would be screwed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I may have to live on their planet now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could just wear a hat, I mean it shouldn't be that noticeable.\" Kelly's suggestion wasn't that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's not that bad an idea, thanks Kelly.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait dude I was joking.\" Kelly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but if you think about its not that bad of an idea. On earth I will wear a hat for safety and on their planet I don't have to.\" It was an ok plan but it won't help if something else on you changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not a permanent solution but I guess it works.\" Kelly says. He then looks at Sasha then you and then back to Sasha then back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep looking at Sasha then me?\" You ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks like your going to turn into a husky like Sasha, because if you compare your ears with hers they look just like each other.\" Then you and Sasha look at each other. You look at Sasha's ears and then take the mere again and look at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I think your right it will be pretty cool if I do turn into a husky like Sasha because then-\" That's all you can get out because your then hugged tightly by Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh (your name) I hope you let yourself change fully, because then we can be closer to each other.\" She say sounding very passionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Sasha?\" You ask dumbly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude are you that thick headed.

Also she has some anger problems, so it would probably be in your best interest to not piss her off in any way.</span> Perfect, you think to yourself, I already did that last night by stepping on her tail. If Sasha hadn\u2019t been there, she would probably have torn you to shreds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif\">I had hoped to get her to be nicer with the other girls, but I just never could. Maybe you can succeed where I failed, but it might be better for you to just leave her to herself. I hope you enjoy your time here as much as I did. The last few years I spent here were the best of my life. If you take care of the girls, they\u2019ll take care of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Derrick </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Derrick didn\u2019t need to tell you Tara has anger issues. You could have figured that out for yourself. Yet, you couldn\u2019t help but feel a little sorry for her. Your uncle\u2019s letter said she has had a tough life, perhaps that\u2019s why she alienates everyone, and tries to push them away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head back downstairs, you see Tara laying belly-up in a nice sunny spot on the floor. Her chest and stomach slowly rise and fall with each breath, as she purrs lightly in her sleep. You could see the outline of a smile on her face. She must be having a really good dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but smile as you watched Tara. She\u2019s normally grouchy and scowling, but now she looked so peaceful and content. Step by step, you get closer to Tara, wanting to get a closer look at her. When you are directly beside her, you get down on your knees and lean in close to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this. Getting this close to Tara, awake or asleep, was just asking for a serious, possibly permanent, injury. But there was something about her like this, something alluring about her in such a calm state, that just made you want to get closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can stop yourself, you place your hand on Tara\u2019s trim stomach and gently stroke it. Her purring audibly increases in volume,  so you continue petting her belly for a good five minutes, the deep, rumbling sound having an almost hypnotizing effect as Tara\u2019s long, flexible tail lazily swishes from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the moment of peace is broken as Tara suddenly opens her eyes and gives off a yowl of surprise as she kicks you square in the chest, sending you sprawling backwards. She leaps to her feet and glares down at you with fire in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever touch me again!\u201d She says \u201cThe last person who touched me ended up in a body cast!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back up clutching your chest. You really hope that doesn\u2019t leave a mark. It felt like you had just been hit with a cannonball. It could be worse, she could have used her claws. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You say \u201cYou just looked so peaceful sleeping, I just thought you might enjoy a nice belly-rub\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara crosses her arms and scowls. \u201cWhy the hell would you think that? You never heard the saying \u201clet sleeping cats lay?\u201d You were about to correct her, but thought better of it. \u201cMy uncle left me a note about you.\u201d You say \u201cTold how you had a tough life and all. If you want to talk or anything, I\u2019m here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. No one had ever said that to her before, but she quickly regains her usual demeanor. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to talk to. What I need is to be left alone.\u201d You really want to help her, but she\u2019s too stubborn to listen. Then you get an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell you have a lot of anger locked up inside.\u201d You say \u201cYou need to get it out or it will just eat away at you. I know a good method to release it, but you have to trust me.\u201d Tara snorts. \u201cAnd what is this method?\u201d She asks sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWretches up ahead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see \u2018em! Ready your chainsaw!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncoming Berserker!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out your method worked very well. You and Tara had just spent the last three hours releasing her anger with the help of your Xbox 360. Turns out Tara was very good at video games. After kicking your ass in Mortal Kombat and Halo, you had decided to play co-op on Gears of War. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you feeling better?\u201d You ask as you score a headshot on Lambent Locust. \u201cOh yeah!\u201d Says Tara excitedly \u201cI haven\u2019t had this much fun in years! Eat chainsaw, Rick!\u201d You had told her to pretend the enemies in the game were people she hated. You had no idea who she was talking about, but it was nice to see her so happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what surprised you was when she disemboweled a Grunt and said \u201cTake that Sasha!\u201d You paused the game and stared at her, shocked. \u201cWhy do you hate Sasha?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Even though you had just met her today, you knew better than to trust Vicky just from what Sasha told you. \u201cYou see,\u201d Said Vicky. \u201cI live in the forest on the edge of the farm. Being  a wild animal, I must find food for myself. After a while, one gets tired of eating squirrels and robins and whatever else I manage to find. There are some days where I don\u2019t eat at all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d You say, not seeing where this was going.

If you bring a me a little something to eat every day, then each time you visit, I\u2019ll let you have some of this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she grabs your head, and forces your face into her ample breasts. For a split second, you couldn\u2019t help but enjoy the warm fuzziness of her fur and the softness of her breasts. But you quickly pull yourself away from her chest, looking quite flustered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked Vicky in the eyes and for a moment, you were about to yell at her, but then you had a better idea. \u201cTell you what.\u201d You say. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you some food everyday, but in exchange, you stop stealing from us, and leave Sasha and the others alone.\u201d Vicky stared at you, perplexed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s twice today you\u2019ve rejected me.\u201d She says. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. I mean, how can you resist this?\u201d She strikes a sexy pose, and you simply stand there unfazed, which only frustrates and confuses Vicky more. \u201cAre you gay?\u201d She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d You say plainly. \u201cI just don\u2019t do interspecies. Now, will you take the deal or not?\u201d For a minute or two, Vicky seemed to consider the offer. On one hand, she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about going hungry, but then she would have to find some other way to entertain herself, as pranking Sasha and the girls was her favorite pastime. Finally, she decided to agree to it. You both shook hands, and Vicky gave you directions to her den before slipping out the window, and disappearing into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, what were those directions again?\u201d The next day you were leaning against a tree in the forest, a bag full of food in your hand, as you tried to remember Vicky\u2019s directions. \u201cWas it take a left, or a right at the broken tree?\u201d You remember she said something about following a stream, but you didn\u2019t see one anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t for the life of you remember if you were supposed to go left or right, so you do eniee-meaniee-mineie-moe, and end up going\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After seeing what she's been able to do with Tali, you thought that Tara would be a good person to have as a friend, if only she weren't so moody and reclusive.

Being rejected several times by the same guy does that to girls like her. \"Are you SURE you're not gay?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the second time, no.\" you say, getting a little annoyed at the implication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way home, you realize something: You had agreed to bring food to Vicky every day, but she said that you didn't have to come back for three or four days. Maybe the fact that Vicky was attracted to you was a good thing. You just hope that Sasha doesn't find out. Tara probably wouldn't care, but it's best to keep this a secret from her, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to the house, Sasha greets you as you enter into the living room. \"You were up early.\" she says. \"You were already out of bed when I went to wake you up.

Now go get your breakfast before it gets cold.\" she says before giving you a smile then turning to go upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you sit down at the table, Tara was sitting across from you, lazily lapping her milk. She stops for a second, then looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hiding something.\" she says out of the blue. \"I don't know what, but it's something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" you say, not giving the slightest hint of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a thing for figuring out when people are keeping secrets.\" she says. \"And Sasha has a way of finding out what those secrets are, so I'd come clean now if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that would be pretty hard considering that I don't have any secrets to come clean about.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you don't.\" Tara says. She starts drinking her milk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next three days were quite peaceful, and Sasha was really confused as to why Vicky hasn't been around the farm lately. She eventually stopped caring, telling you: \"The less often she's around, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on the night before your next \"meeting\" with Vicky, Sasha says something that complicates EVERYTHING for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in your room, ready to go to bed, when your door opens and Sasha walks inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, [your name].\" she says. \"I was wondering if you wanted to spend the day together tomorrow, and we could share a bed again tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were screwed now. Your plan was to wake up early the next morning, then take some food to Vicky's den, but now Sasha wants to sleep with you tonight, AND spend the day with you tomorrow.

Your flashlight casts the twisted shadows of the trees on the ground, and you hear an owl hooting in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake yourself to regain your composure.

As you stop a minute and try to figure out where you are, you hear the sound of flowing water. The stream! It must be nearby! You follow the sound until you eventually do find the stream, following it to Vicky\u2019s den. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the bag of sandwiches on the ground at the entrance of the den, but no sooner than you do, the batteries in your flashlight die, leaving you standing in the pitch-black forest with only the moon giving you minimal light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is just perfect.\u201d you say to yourself \u201cJust fucking perfect.\u201d Now how are you supposed to get back to the farm?

Footsteps approaching. You suddenly go stiff as a board, your body paralyzed with fear. You start praying to God that you were right when you said there was nothing to be afraid of in these woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps are getting louder, every twig snapping, and every crunching leaf seeming to echo through the entire forest. Whatever it was that was approaching, you pray it couldn\u2019t see in the dark. Suddenly, you nearly jump out of your skin as you feel a hot blast of breath on the back of your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right behind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline surges through your body as your fight-or-flight response takes control of your body. Moving entirely on instinct, you spin around and deliver a punch to the creature\u2019s stomach. Whatever it was you hit, it made a loud grunting sound as it doubled over clutching its stomach.

You shake your head. You never even held a gun, let alone fired one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust point and pull the trigger, now come on!\u201d She garbs your arm and drags you back into the kitchen and through the door. Tara doesn\u2019t even get up. She just sits there, lazily lapping her milk. As Sasha pulls you onto the porch and down the stairs, you see the chickens running helter-skelter all over the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of one of the coops emerges an anthro fox, with bright orange fur covering the majority of her body. Her hands and feet were black, while her belly and chest were white. Long red hair hung from her head down to her shoulders. You couldn\u2019t help but notice how beautiful she was, and how luscious her body was, with wide hips, a trim waist and stomach, and breasts that had to be at least G-cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen holds a chicken under each arm, and clutches an egg in her mouth. \u201cStop right there!\u2019 shouts Sasha as she drags you up to the voluptuous specimen of a fox. \u201cDrop \u2019em!\u2019 Sasha orders, growling ferociously. Vicky sighs and sets both chickens down, before removing the egg from her mouth, holding in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does a girl have to do to get some breakfast around here?\u201d She says annoyed. She then notices you and smirks. \u201cWell, who\u2019s this? A new addition to the Funny Farm?\u201d  Sasha bared her teeth, practically snarling. \u201cHe\u2019s the new owner of the farm, and if you try to steal from us again, he\u2019s going to give you a good blast-full of buckshot, and make a rug out of you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky smirks and leans forward laying her hands and head on top of the shotgun you ha been pointing at her the whole time, her breasts hanging. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that to poor me, would you?\u201d She flutters her eyelids in a cute way. You can\u2019t help but stare transfixed, entangled in her mesmerizing beauty. \u201cI\u2026\u2026um\u2026\u2026\u2026ah\u2026..\u201d You can only stutter as she pushes the gun away from her and comes very close to you, her breasts pressing against your chest. Sasha looks as though she is going to attack Vicky at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say? Can\u2019t I have just this one egg?\u201d She holds up the egg between her thumb and index finger. \u201cO\u2026o\u2026okay.\u201d You manage to say. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want anymore trouble from you for a good while, understand?\u201d You say, suddenly speaking in an authorative to, but that quickly disappears when Vicky gives you a lick on the cheek. \u201cThanks, handsome.\u201d she says as she gives you a smile and a wink, before turning and heading into the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha face-palms herself. \u201cYou\u2019re just like your uncle!\u201d She says as you head back to the house. \u201cI always told him he was far too lenient with the pesky fox. Looks like her tricks work on humans too.\u201d  You spent the rest of the day meeting the other animals on the farm. For the most part, they seemed to happily accept you, except for Luna, who stayed sleeping in the barn all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She asked me if I would be er boyfriend, and when I said no she... she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" says Tara. \"You don't need to say anything more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you had any self-defense tricks you could teach me.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anything to help you make sure Vicky doesn't get her hands on you again.\" she says. So for the next few hours, Tara shows you some of the tricks she knows, from how you get free from a knot to how to strike pressure points to stun attackers. The training session was interrupted when Sasha calls you two up for breakfast. That afternoon, you decide to take a nap. While you were asleep, you hear a noise. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

You never thought something like this would happen to you, but then again, no one ever does. No matter how hard you try, you can't get rid of the memory of how you felt so powerless as Vicky had her way with you. You get the feeling that this is going to haunt you for the rest of your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's worse, you could never tell anyone what had happened, for fear of Vicky stealing you away in the night, and making good on her threat. She hadn't said exactly what she would do, but you shudder to think of it. Would she rape you again? Or worse? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach the farmhouse, you are thankful to see sasha and Tara still aren't back. That was a good thing, as Sasha would probably be able to tell what had happened from Vicky's scent being on you. You quickly take a shower to wash the scent of vixen off of you, and just stare at the ceiling until you fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several days, you barely speak to anyone, as you go about tending to the animals. Several times, sasha asks you what is wrong, but you just tell her nothing, and walk away. At night, you lay in your bed, reliving the memory of Vicky molesting you, over and over again, until you finally fall asleep and have nightmares about it. The total helplessness, the humiliations, but what's worse is that deep down, you actually enjoyed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been a virgin before, and Vicky was the first one you had ever had sex with. Even though it was against your will, it was like nothing you had ever experienced before, and deep within your subconcious, you longed for Vicky's touch again. You shake your head in an effort to clear your mind. What were you thinking!? Vicky had no right to do that to you, and now it's driving you to insanity! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore falling asleep, you decide that first thing in the morning, you're going to find Vicky, and confront her about this. The next morning after breakfast, you tell Sasha you're going for a walk, and head out into the woods. You find Vicky's den, and call out \"Vicky! Get out here now!\" The vixen comes sauntering out with an ear to ear smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't get enough of me, huh? Back for more?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Because of you, for the last week I've been a total nervous wreck! I've come here to settle this once and for all!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good, but before you get to your little lecture, I have some news for you....\"</span></div></div>",

She ever so gently lifted Elizabeth up to her breast as she made small noises with her mouth, Elizabeth instantly latched onto the nipple and began to suckle as she found Vicky's breast. There was a soft \"aww\" that went through the whole room, Vicky silently crying tears of joy as Elizabeth ate her first meal, you however felt a bit different. You slowly backed up and as silently as possible left the room, heading downstairs although not silently enough as you hear the soft pad of paws behind you as you leave the room, turning to see Sasha behind you in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked, as even though she and Vicky weren't on the best of terms she could tell this was a happy moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think I can do this Sasha, I can't stay here\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'm having thoughts I shouldn't be\" you reply your head hanging low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stand seeing her happy, why does she get to rape me and not suffer any for it? Why does she get to be happy, and just brush this off? I've been having nightmares for weeks and I can't stand leaving the house without the rifle or one of you\" you say tears starting to stream down your face. \"I tried to just ignore them, to tell myself they would go away, as I stared at Elizabeth I thought of doing something so horrible, I-I just can't--\" You broke down into great racking sobs, which stole your ability to keep speaking, you felt Sasha wrap her arms around you and she made soft cooing noise as she gently stroked the back of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay\" she said, the two of you sat like that for a few minutes, you gently sobbing into Sasha's coat, that was how everyone else found you, minus Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's wrong with him, Sasha what'd you do?\" you were surprised as you looked up, the angry voice belonging to Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He, he can't stay anymore, he has to leave\" Sasha replies hugging you tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-leave, why does he have to leave, did any of us do anything...\" Jane spoke up and then promptly fell silent as all eyes in the room turned to Vicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch\" Tara yells suddenly lunging at Vicky, Bess grabbing her and holding her back \"you bitch, I knew he was faking being happy, I knew it, I'll kill you, I'll kill you, we finally get someone who cares for us and you fuck it all up\" Tara trying quite hard to literally scratch Vickie's eyes out, to her credit she didn't even jump back, just stood there. She slowly walked past Bess and Tara, Jane physically recoiling as Vicky neared her, Marie looking like she was doing everything in her power to restrain herself, a growl growing ever louder in Sasha's throat as Vicky got closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha, let me talk to him\" Vicky says quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, your the cause of all this farm's problems, even before he came here, all you did was steal from us and try to humiliate and degrade us, we let you live here because he accepted his responsibility as a father, even though he had no need to. You kidnapped him and raped him, he doesn't deserve to suffer because of you\" Sasha says, her voice getting more and more...desperate, tears springing up in her eyes as she hugged you so tightly it hurt. You realized that the next words were aimed at you \"please, please don't leave us, your the best friend we've ever had, your even better than your uncle, please don't leave\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha, I-\" Vicky reached out to touch you and then quickly jumped back as Sasha snapped at her, attempting to bite the fox. Vicky stood back up slowly, \"Sasha please\" Sasha however wouldn't hear any of it and simply snapped at Vicky again and growled. That was when she did something neither of you were expecting she moved towards you again. this time however Vicky didn't move, adding her arms around Sasha's in a hug, Sasha's muzzle clamping down onto her upper right shoulder. Vicky however seemed to just ignore this as she spoke to you \"I'm sorry, what I did was wrong, I know it was, I know you'll probably hate me to the end of your days, and I understand that, but please don't take this out on anyone else but me.\" Vicky stood back up, Sasha's muzzle letting go as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you pushed Sasha away, standing up yourself, \"so you admit this was all your fault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Vicky replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, every muscle in your being was telling you to exact revenge, no one here would stop you from kicking the shit out of Vicky, no one here would stop you if you did the exact same thing she did, you physically turned and spat as those thoughts crossed your mind. \"Sasha can you go and get me the shotgun\" you say after a few moments of silence, she nods and runs off, an almost happy look on her face as she runs off to get the weapon, Vicky for her part just stands there as Sasha returns carrying the weapon and two shells. You slowly chamber the ammunition speaking as you did \"Vicky you took something from me I can never get back, my piece of mind, my sense of safety, so I should be able to take something from you, fair right?\" Vicky just stood there seemingly accepting her fate although there were tears streaming down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise me that you'll take care of Elizabeth\" Vicky said her voice cracking slightly as she did. You don't answer instead raising the weapon to right in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you want to say?\" you ask her, getting a nod as a reply. You just stand there, staring for a few seconds as she stands there, her entire body shivering before...lowering the weapon. You physically remove the shells from the gun before smashing it against the wall making it unusable. Vicky after she opened her eyes as well as everyone else just stared at you in shock before you spoke. \"Vicky you took something from me, so you're going to give it back, you're going to work twice as hard as everyone else, helping do the jobs I do, on top of taking care of Elizabeth is that understood?\" Vicky nodded. You turned to everyone else \"no one is going to give her a hard time, is that understood\" you say, the combination of our tone of voice and your eyes stating there would be consequences. One by one you got reluctant agreement from everyone \"good\" you say, turning as you felt a light tap on your shoulder, to face Vicky who was in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why didn't you do it?\" she says her voice like that of a frightened child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her for a few seconds before responding \"Elizabeth doesn't deserve to suffer for your mistakes, she deserves both a mother, and a father.\" Vicky slowly nods and tackles you to the floor kissing and hugging you with everything she has \"thank you, thank you, thank you\" she cries truly repentant for what she has done. You can't do any more than pet her head in rely. Finally she lets you stand up and Sasha slowly walks up.</span></div></div>",

It had one bullet. You chambered in the round and began to lift the gun to your head, when you suddenly start to cry. Your conscience had started to fight your mind. You thought about how this would affect everyone else, especially Elizabeth. Your still holding the revolver to your head, but your hand was shaking rapidly and you were crying out of pure emotional distress. Then  you heard a twig snap behind you.

You feel a bit sorry for her being treated this way, but what could you do about it? If you had let her sleep in your room, it would have upset Sasha. She was right about you being a bit too lenient with Vicky. While she <i>does</i> have a crush on you (And an obvious one, at that), you can't put the fox in front of your other friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, you can't shake off the feeling that there's something mesmerizing about her. Is it her hair, her thin body, or maybe her soft tail?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it is, you decide not to worry about it now as you lay down on the cushioned mattress and pull the covers over yourself, slowly drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to Sasha licking your face. All the tension from last night seems to have vanished as she wipes the sleep right off of you with the wet pink towel coming from her mouth. \"Get up, sleepyhead! It's time for another wonderful day at the farm!\" She says excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the clock, expecting to see an early number like 4 or 5 o' clock. To your surprise, it's 9:32 am. These animals really do care about your 9 hours of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching your back, you rise from your tomb and stretch your legs. \"Yay, he's up!!\" Sasha says, clapping her hands lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you keep it down up there? Some of us are still sleeping!\" An annoyed voice that can only belong to Tara groans from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Tara.\u201d Sasha says quietly as she hands you your shoes. While you bend down to slip them on, she carefully places a cowboy hat on your head. You stand up and take off the hat to look at it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat used to belong to your uncle before he passed on. He hand-stitched it himself. It was his most prized possession, next to this farm of course.\u201d Sasha replies with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hat has a golden brown color, and it looks like it\u2019s never been worn before. As you turn it in your hands, it almost seems to glow. Uncle Derrick must have been a master at sewing. Perhaps that was a hobby of his before he founded the farm. You put the hat back on in a crooked fashion and place your hand on the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you turn it, Sasha says, \u201cHey, it looks great on you. Take good care of it!\u201d she winks at you as you go downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the cellar door is open. \u201cWhere\u2019s Vicky?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoke up at 8, said she was going into the garden.\u201d Tara mutters, still getting back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk outside and see the vixen sitting on a bench under a tree, munching on a fallen peach. She turns around and spots you. \u201cOh, hi!\u201d Vicky motions for you to sit down next to her. You do as told and ease yourself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I was thinking last night\u2026 cellar door. It sounds like the name of an entrance to a dark, damp, disgusting room. But if you modify it a little, you can get something completely different. Something\u2026 beautiful.\u201d Vicky slowly and smoothly wraps her arm around you and pulls you a bit closer to her. You begin to blush, but you pretend to look at the clouds in the sky and hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is that \u2018something\u2019?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Celladora. It sounds nothing close to a depressing door. Instead, it can make you think of flowers and stuff. You know, pretty things\u2026\u201d She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Like you.\u201d You finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what the heck did you just say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t hide the blush this time, but it doesn\u2019t really matter because Vicky\u2019s cheeks are red too. You both look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you\u2019re the one that pulls her toward you as your lips meet with hers for the third time in the past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pull apart from her, she smiles at you lovingly. \u201cYou know, you look really cute with that hat on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back at her, then pull a peach from the tree and return to the farmhouse.</span></div></div>",

The two of you were sprawled across the bed with limbs all splayed around, happily basking in the warm afterglow of your tender love making. It was a long while before the beautiful vixen beside you replied to your question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon...\" she replied softy. \"But not yet. They barely tolerate me right now as it is, I don't think they could handle the news of a new couple on the farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would probably lose their minds if they even found out we liked each other...\" you began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky giggled deviously. \"Or if they knew we were staying in the say room together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile grew across your face. \"Sleeping in the same bed together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky wiggled her way across the bed to lay her head against the side of yours tenderly. \"Cuddling, kissing, snuggling...\" she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickling poor defenseless foxes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky blinked in confusion. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seized your moment. Rolling upright onto your knees you immediately dove for a tickle attack straight to the vixen's rib-cage. It was clear you had never tickled an anthro before as you had to work your nimble fingers through the vixen's lush fur just to feel the smooth skin underneath. Yips and squeals of delight escaped the fox as the onslaught continued, with Vicky fruitlessly trying to swat your arms and hands away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickle fight swiftly came to end with you grabbing her wrists and gently pinning Vicky's limbs to the bed. There the two of you were, you straddling her waist with your legs on both sides of her hips, chests heaving with panted breath, eyes firmly locked into the gaze of the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly slid your hands off her wrists and up her arms to gently cup both sides of her muzzle with your palms. Giving her the chance to do the same and lightly grasp both sides of your face in her own paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you mean it?\" she quietly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mean what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you said you loved me, did you really mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lovingly grasped one of her paws and raised it to your face to press a gentle kiss into her palm. The tough skin of her paw pad felt strange and unfamiliar to your lips, but the exotic sensation of it drove something wild in your fevered mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing you should know about me Vicky...I don't mince words. I'd never say anything that serious and not mean every syllable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky took a long somber look at you and exhaled deeply. As if she had been holding in that nervous breath for hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we've only known each other for what a day? Two perhaps? Bit quick don't you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seem to recall though a certain fox was the one who kidnapped me, hauled me off to her cave just to confess her attraction. That seem familiar?\" you teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox under you groaned with embarrassment as she turned her head away to face the far wall of the bedroom. \"Uggghh, I'm so, so, SO sorry for that. I wasn't thinking straight. I know that is no excuse, but I was so wrapped up in seeing you for the first time I just...I just....\" she stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey Vicky, it's alright, I forgive you, you know that right? I don't and will NEVER hold that against you, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky slowly turned her head back to you, her face filled with anguish. \"I'm afraid though,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught you off guard. Gently pulling back, you stared tenderly into the vixen's sad, tear filled eyes wondering what sort of thoughts were plaguing her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid? Of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a steadying breath before continuing. \"I've been alone for so long. All alone inside that musty cave, I'm afraid......I'm afraid if I close my eyes I'll just wake up and find myself right back there.....alone again,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen took one slow breath. \"And you won't be there...\" she said as a tear fell down her fuzzy cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, you heart was slowly ripping in two. This normally smooth talking, devious, sensuous vixen was emotionally unraveling right before you. You knew you had to do something, and you needed to do it quick. Promptly sitting upright, you firmly grabbed Vicky by her wide, supple hips and lifted her up towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever response she might have had was quickly silenced with a squeak as your lips connected with hers. In no time at all the vixen slowly melted into the kiss and your loving touch. But this kiss was something different, something more. More than lust, more than mere attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Vicky,\" you moaned with conviction. \"I don't care if its only been a short time, I know how I feel, and its more than you could possibly know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Vicky that began the next deep kiss. \"Way to steal a fox's heart Romeo...\" she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do to prove to you I mean everything I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon found out as Vicky's paws began to roam up and down the smooth skin your shirtless chest, her tail beginning to wag with anticipation. \"I can think of something...\" she said with a lick of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded in kind with a third tender kiss and giving her plump, shapely rear a firm squeeze. This only served to drive a lusty purr from the already perky fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I show you?\" you huffed into her furry neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky gingerly nipped at your ear and began rooting her black nose through your hair. \"What took you so damn long?\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only laugh. That was the Vicky you knew and loved. Once more the night air was filled with a chorus of breathy moans and naughty giggles.  Roaming hands and paws and synchronized movements soon grew into a crescendo as both of you fell over the edge together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you collapsed exhausted in a heap upon the bed, but this time, never once leaving the other's arms. You laid on your side with one hand scratching her back, the other behind her head so you could gently finger through her flowing hair. Likewise Vicky had both of her arms tucked between her chest and yours. Her soft face nestled within the crook of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's strange...\" you began to mutter quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" came the fox's reply, her eyes closed in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here looking to take care of an old rustic farm, now I find myself in bed, in love with a fox. Not how I expected my weekend to turn out...\" you chuckled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky's only response was to push herself tighter against you. Burying her muzzle further into your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you regret it?\" she mumbled, her voice heavily laden with sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour immediate answer was to press a loving kiss into her rich crimson hair right between her fluffy ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the slightest\" you replied firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why would she ask you such a question?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking a pretty long time.\" Sasha says, with a hint of worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to be completely honest?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'e very attractive.\" you say. \"You're a really beautiful girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha smiles and her ice blue eyes start to tear up. She pulls you into a hug and licks your cheek. \"That's the nicest thing, anyone's ever said to me.\" she says. Then, to your surprise, Sasha plants a kiss on you, slightly tightening her grip on you. Needless to say, you were in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Sure, your head was hurting too, but it was worth it. She let out a loud cry of pain, and fell to the ground, clutching her forehead. You take this opportunity to escape, but since you ere still tied up, you hop out.

Why he left it to you, God only knows. So you move from your suburb home in California, all the way to Pennsylvania, just to check it out. But when you finally get there, you\u2019re in for a surprise. Except for a flock of chickens, there are hardly any animals around the farm, and the only ones that are there aren\u2019t what you expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real rules for this story are no overt sexual content, and no adding anymore character choices. I don\u2019t want this to be another story where the option chapters go on forever. By \"overt\", I mean it may be implied, but not described.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sasha<br>\r\nSpecies: Husky <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha is an energetic and friendly husky with an athletic figure. Her back, legs, and arms are black, while her hands, feet, belly, face, and tail tip are white. She seems to be the leader of the group, having been keeping things under control since your uncle passed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Tara <br>\r\nSpecies: Cat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara is a moody, somewhat lazy cat with black fur covering her entire body. Her eyes are a glowing shade of yellow, and she has a small hoop piercing in her left ear. One strange thing about her, is that her tail is unusually long and flexible, with a tuft of fur on the tip. She can use this tail to wrap around and hold things. Her and Sasha are the only ones allowed inside the farmhouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Bess <br>\r\nSpecies: Cow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBess is a kind, motherly cow with a white coat with splotches of black here and there. Her breasts are pink and udder-like, each the size of a basketball. She needs to be milked daily, or her breasts swell bigger the fuller she becomes. She resides in the farm\u2019s barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Marie <br>\r\nSpecies: Horse<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie is a brown mare with a black mane and tail. She has a kind, but competitive personality. She spends most of her time racing around the farm\u2019s fields, loving the feeling of the wind rushing past her and her heart pounding.  She lives in the stables across from the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jane<br>\r\nSpecies: Sheep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane is a shy and quiet ewe. She spends all her time in the pasture, maybe eating some grass or simply walking around. She mainly avoids the other animals, preffering to keep to herself. The others haven\u2019t even spoken with her once, she didn\u2018t even speak to your uncle. She hasn\u2019t been sheered in months, so her wool is very thick, making her appear fatter than she really is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Luna<br>\r\nSpecies: Bat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna is pretty much a recluse, spending all day sleeping, hanging upside-down from the barn rafters with her wings wrapped around her. She only comes out at night, when she\u2019ll go hunting for food. Not much is known about her, since the other animals rarely even catch a glimpse of her awake. Her entire body is covered in black fur, except for a single white streak going down her forehead to her nose. Her ears are long and pointy, sticking straight up. Her arms are also her wings, with hands on the ends.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Vicky<br>\r\nSpecies: Fox <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky is a troublesome, mischievous fox from the forest at the edge of the farm.
