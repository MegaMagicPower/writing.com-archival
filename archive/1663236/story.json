            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\"Hey Julie, check this out!\" Carlos called boastfully to his little sis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA chubby, eight year old girl with pig tails, overalls, and sparkling blue eyes grinned broadly at her big brother, a person whom she equated with God Almighty Himself.  Julie felt nothing but pure, unbridled adoration for the boy, two years her elder and everything a girl could ask for in an older brother.  Summer vacation, the most joyous of reprieves for a preadolescent youth, was only three weeks old, and the sun was blazing high on its perch, warming Julie's skin and basking Carlos' lean, tanned figure in glorious orange light.  If there was ever justification for Julie's deification of her older brother, it was now, as he skated backwards down Wilson street, the most dangerous hill in their neighborhood, boldly defying gravity and the perils of death.  One of the most wonderful things about youth is the wreckless disregard for Murphy's Law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThomas Bradley, a gangly, quiet kid, and Carlos' best bud, chased him gayly down the street.  Julie, meanwhile, played it safe, sticking to the sidewalk and bringing up the rear.  All was right with the world for Julie Huerta, but in a few short moments her world would never be the same.  For her, at the moment, ignorance was bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor no apparent reason, things on Wilson street suddenly took a horrible turn for the worse.  Carlos' balance betrayed him.  His legs locked up and his arms began pinwheeling in front of him in an attempt to ward off the inevitable fall and scathing pavement that awaited.  His cool, cocky smile faded into a mask of horror as he sped backwards down the hill at a break-neck pace.  \"Chuckie, look out!\" Julie screamed, almost in complete unison with Tom, but Chuckie could not look out.  He had lost all control and went hurtling blindly into the Wilson and McCartney Blvd intersection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe driver of the magenta '92 Chevy Suburban, Ms. Theresa Rosa, never saw the boy coming.  A blur of blue fabric flashed across her field of vision; she didn't even have time to press the brake pedal before she felt a thud and heard the unmistakable sound of something heavy thumping against the windshield.  She slammed on the brakes and skidded to a stop, looking in her rear view mirror and praying that she was wrong.  Praying that it wasn't a boy lying on the side of the road behind her.  And it wasn't his blood splashed across her windshield.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she approached the huddled mass on the curb and the small boy kneeling over said huddled mass, crying for it to get up, Theresa Rosa knew her life had changed forever.  \"Oh Jesus, Dios mio,\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Rosa had been going the posted limit of 50 mph and she had done nothing wrong, but for the rest of her days she would be stricken with guilt.  She would be haunted by nightmares in which a crumpled and marred boy would ask her \"why?\" over and over again.  She would have no answer for his question.  She didn't know why.  Life is sometimes unfair, the world cruel and uncaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTom sped after his friend, but could not catch up.  He was forced to watch helplessly as the suburban plowed into Chuckie, sending him flying through the air like a rag doll.  Chuck landed on the curb with a sickening crunch, and Tom knew before he even reached his friend's side that it was the end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis ten year old eyes were horrified by what they saw as he approached his broken friend.  The first thing he noticed was Chuckie's bare feet.  The impact had not only knocked him clean out of his skates, but out of his socks too.  How fucking wild was that?  Tom wondered if there were a pair of roller skates in the street somewhere behind him with the socks, still molded in the shape of Chuckie's feet, tucked neatly inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChuckie was a mess.  Blood was oozing out of his ears, nose, and mouth, the right side of his head was caved in, ribs were poking out of his blue Ninja Turtles T shirt, and his left leg was bent backwards at an impossible angle.  A pool of blood was forming underneath him, and more of it was splashed across the sidewalk and street.  Tears were streaming from both Chuckie's and Tom's eyes, and Chuckie was staring around at the world with shocked disbelief.  His frightened eyes found Tom's, and dim recognition surfaced on the dying boy's face.  Amazingly, he began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're hurt, Chuckie,\" Tom cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Tom, what happened?\" Chuck asked in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're hurt bad, Chuckie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChuckie sighed and his eyes began to close.  \"NO!\" Tom cried.  \"GET UP CHUCKIE!  PLEASE GET UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChuckie's eyes fluttered open briefly.  \"Tom... I'm scared... I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Chucky, no,\" Tom cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Take... Jooo... Julie\"  The life faded from his eyes and Chuckie breathed his last.  His painfully short life was extinguished.  Tom looked back at Julie, who was standing at a distance, frozen in shock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"He's gone.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie's knees went weak.  She fell to the ground and began weeping uncontrollably.  Heartbroken and devastated, burdened beyond his years, Tom went to Julie and held her.  It was not a completely wasted effort to ease her inconsolable grief, and Julie and Tom's friendship grew strong through the coming years.  In time Julie was once again the cheerful and vibrant girl Tom remembered, although her life after that day was never quite the same.</span></div></div>",

The desert sun hung high in the sky, the mark of mid afternoon, surrounded by endless blue.  In the midst of this natural resplendence, standing alone, was a creation of nature that far surpassed any notion of beauty ever imagined.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sixteen year old girl, with hair a richer brown than the purest chocolate, skin creamier than marble and smoother than silk, eyes bluer than the skies above, with cheeks redder than the rose she held in her hand and exotically sensuous curves that could drive a man insane with lust-filled desire, stood at the foot of a grave.  Her body language expressed an air of both innocence and sexuality, her exquisite appearance bringing these warring factions to a truce, and an aura of vibrancy surrounded her.  She seemed terribly out of place in this setting, her vivacious presence surround by death.  She placed the rose on the grave and kissed the head stone.  Kings would kill for such an honor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI miss you Chuck,\u201d she said quietly.  Today was June 18th, 1995.  Eight years since Chuckie was killed in the terrible tragedy on Wilson Street.  \u201cWe won the district championship last year.  I hit the winning shot.  I wish you could have been there to see it.\u201d  Julie stood quiet for a moment, remembering all the good times she had with her brother.  She didn\u2019t cry, her tears dried up years ago, but she let the emotions wash over her, welcoming them with open arms.  \u201cGoodbye, Chuck.\u201d  Julie turned and walked alone along the rows of tombstones, her normally cheerful persona temporarily quieted by mourning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she climbed into her bumblebee yellow Volkswagon Beetle, fired up the ignition, and pulled onto the freeway, her sorrow melted away.  TLC\u2019s Waterfalls blared on the radio, the sun was shining and the rag top was down.  Julie felt the wind\u2019s soothing fingers rushing through her hair and caressing her lovely face, and she smiled.  It was summer vacation, her whole life was ahead of her, and she hadn\u2019t a care in the world.  She was young, beautiful, and free.  For Julie Huerta, life was good.</span></div></div>",

The girls would go bike riding and jogging through the desert a couple times a week to stay in shape, and last Sunday's jog proved more eventful than most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling particularly ambitious, Julie and Debbie had chosen a path through the desert that appeared to have been unused since the days when covered wagons traversed the land.  After more than half an hour of tireless running, the girls had travelled nearly three miles into the desert, and just as they made the decision to turn back a rotting chunk of wood mostly hidden by overgrown weeds and brush caved in under Julie's weight.  Her foot and part of her leg disappeared, seemingly swallowed up by the earth, but luckily little harm was done.  The only injuries sustained were a slightly twisted ankle and a light scratch - a small price to pay for what would turn out to be such a daunting discovery.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief struggle between Julie and the board, Julie retrieved her foot from the clutches of the earth and peeled back the rotting wood.  What lay beyond was a cavern of some sort, which appeared to be quite expansive.  It begged of them to explore, but they would need flashlights to find their way inside.  The girls had agreed to return this weekend with the necessary supplies, and the weekend was finally here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt excited Julie for more reasons than one, as did all her visits with Debbie.  Her diminuitive friend was the very definition of adorable, and Julie felt strangely curious when in her presence.  Julie knew Debbie did not share her curiosities; it had been made abundantly clear that Julie's feelings for Debbie were not reciprocated, but Julie couldn't help herself.  She debated and fussed over what to wear.  It needed to be something cute, but not so provocative it would make her friend uncomfortable.</span></div></div>",

It was white with the number 88 printed in blue across the chest.  It fit her loosely, but it was a crop top that left a lot of skin showing on her midriff.  She took a moment to examine her reflection in the mirror, brushed her fingers through her hair, fluffing it back over her shoulders, and she was satisfied.  She looked great, but casual.  She pulled on a pair of beat up old Nike\u2019s, grabbed a flashlight, and she was ready to roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Julie rode up to Debbie\u2019s house she couldn\u2019t help but feel a small tinge of jealousy.  Debbie had the perfect life, and her home was a glaring testament to that fact.  While her parents were not filthy rich, to the point where their careers consumed them and they had no time left for their children, they were very well off.  They were also so clean and polite and friendly, it was surreal.  Her family was like something right out of the Disney channel.   Julie reminded herself that she had no room to complain, and rang the door bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie opened the door and smiled.  \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said in that sweet, melodic voice of hers.  She was wearing short shorts and a tight fitting T shirt that clung to her body and stopped just short of her waist line.  Julie admired Debbie\u2019s taste and sense of style.  She always looked good, no matter the occasion.  Debbie also had a large flashlight and a lantern tied together and slung over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Julie agreed.  The girls hopped on their bikes and rode off into the desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Julie shoved the rotted board aside, revealing the entrance to the cavern, Debbie began to have second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re really going in there,\u201d she said.  \u201cWhat if there\u2019s like spiders and stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAy, relax Deb\u2019s, we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Julie said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you can go in and I\u2019ll wait for you out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie just shrugged.  \u201cDo what you want,\u201d she said, climbing down into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, fuck it,\u201d Debbie declared before climbing in after Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cave was larger than they had suspected, and several tunnels branched out from the far end.  Debbie fired up her lantern and the girls made their way down to the trio of tunnels.  Julie felt her heart thumping excitedly in her chest.  She felt like an explorer from the old times, embarking on some new ground breaking adventure.  This was quite a discovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Julie marveled in an awestruck voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?  Do you think it\u2019s an abandoned mine shaft?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d  Julie wondered if they would get any type of reward for finding this place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo which way do you wanna go first?\u201d Debbie asked.</span></div></div>",

Debbie just didn't have anger in her nature.  She was always calm and always sweet, and Julie couldn't recall ever seeing her lose her temper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading the way into the tunnel, Julie thought it seemed sturdy enough.  Support beams lined the walls and they did not appear to be weakened by rot or termites, but looks could be deceiving.  For Julie, putting such thoughts out of her mind was easy, but Debbie didn't seem to share her talent.  Her big brown eyes kept tracing along the walls and the ceiling with blatant trepidation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she pressed onward, following Julie for nearly twenty minutes down the twisting corridor.  The tunnel continued to wind deeper into the earth until they came upon a branching tunnel along the southern wall.  It sloped into the ground at a steeper incline, and was chiseled out of stone.</span></div></div>",

The timid Debbie that erred on the side of caution was gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Julie said, following Debbie down into the bowels of the Earth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what Julie estimated to be a one hundred yard descent, the tunnel leveled out some.  Ahead, it widened into a chamber, which at its largest was at least seventy feet wide and twenty-five feet tall.  The entire chamber was illuminated by that mysterious golden light.  <i>Is there some sort of generator buried down here, still providing power after who knows how many years?</i> Julie wondered.  She didn\u2019t think so.  For reasons she couldn\u2018t quite pin down, she had a feeling the light was natural, <i>or supernatural</i>, not man made.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie switched off her lantern and looked around in reverence, her lovely face glistening in the golden glow.  Julie flipped the switch on her flashlight and stared unabashedly at her friend.  She thought Debbie had never been more beautiful than she was now, in this light, that look of unadulterated veneration on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d Debbie called out suddenly, pointing to a doorway on the western wall of the chamber.  Behind the doorway was the source of the light.  \"Let's see what it is,\" she said hurrying over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Julie called after her.  As Julie approached the doorway she began to feel nervous, as if there was something forboding about that light.</span></div></div>",

How was she supposed to explain her gut feeling to Debbie?  Instead she simply shrugged it off and called after her, \"Wait for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie followed Debbie into the room, trying to shake her uneasiness.  <i>It's just an empty room, see.</i>  It was true, there was nothing threatening in sight.  The walls were twenty feet apart, the ceiling just over head, and everything was illuminated by that bizarre light, but there was no indication that they might be in danger.  That is until Debbie's path carried her across the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Debbie's foot touched the center of the floor, steel meshes fell down in both doorways, trapping the girls inside.  Julie rushed back the way they came, yanking on the mesh, but all she achieved was tearing the flesh off her fingertips.  Debbie tried to budge the mesh going forward into the light, but was equally unsuccessful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!  Fuck!\" Debbie pointed, and Julie saw spears emerging from the walls, spaced a few inches apart, slowly closing in on them.  Julie's hands dropped to her sides, and she felt her stomach plummet.  <i>I should have listened to my instincts.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna die, Debbie,\" Julie said in a relatively calm voice.  She tried to steel her nerves, but the realization of her impending death was overwhelming.  \"We're gonna fucking die.\"  Her voice cracked a little, and she didn't like the sound of it.  The tips of the spears were only inches away.  <i>We're really gonna die.</i>  It didn't seem possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, Julie, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie sucked in her breath as she felt the spikes pushing their way into her body.  She had tried to position herself so that most of her vital organs would remain in tact, but that seemed virtually impossible given the spacing of the spears.  Instead she had to settle for protecting her heart.  The pain as over a dozen iron rods slid through body her was extraordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two entering her lower belly, another exiting, two more exiting her upper abdomen, and a pair passing through the left side of her chest, above and below her breast, punching holes through the circles of the 8 printed on her shirt.  Another sank into her right shoulder while yet another exited her right breast.  She had a spear poking through the hollow spot between her left hip and upper thigh, a couple more gouged her right thigh, and another pierced her left thigh.  There was a spear puncturing her left calf, and to top it all off, she had a spear running right through the center of her midriff, narrowly missing her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood bubbled up from her lips, and she wondered how long she'd last like this.  She looked over at Debbie, and saw that she had fared even worse.  She had apparently not had the time or presence of mind to avoid a bar through her heart.  Julie could see the spear poking right through the center of her chest, and it was clear Debbie would be the first to die.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spikes stopped nearly a foot below the ceiling, but Debbie was several inches shorter than Julie and another spear had punched through her neck.  She also had half a dozen spears running through her stomach, and several more through her chest.  Her beautiful, dark brown eyes were wide, her mouth gaping, and she was making some awful gurgling sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Debbie,\" Julie called through a strained voice and a mouthful of blood.  \"Debbie, stay with me.\"  There was no use fighting it - they were clearly dying - but Julie couldn't stand the thought of dying down here alone.  Debbie didn't seem to hear her.  Her eyes bulged in their sockets and her mouth gaped like a fish out of water, and Julie could actually see the life leave her friend as she died.  The cheerful, happy, sixteen year old girl with whom Julie had once been so close was gone, and only a lifeless corpse remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been heart breaking, but Julie was now much more concerned with her own fading life.  \"Awww, ugghhh, you bitch!\" she spat, wriggling on her spikes.  Debbie had never been a bitch, she had been sweeter than honey her entire life, but Julie was not actually addressing her deceased friend.  Her frustration was directed towards the spikes upon which she was skewered, the damned spikes that were spilling her blood and taking her life.  Her mind was slipping, as crushing fear blotted out all rational thought, and a string of curse words that would make a sailor blush flew from her blood soaked lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her anger and frustration ebbed, depression set in.  Tears of horrible, forlorn sadness, of an indescribable desolation, flowed down her soft red cheeks.  She felt so lost, so alone, so completely and utterly without hope, and there was no consolation.  No chance of redemption.  Her life was over, and nothing could possibly change that now.  She looked once again to that golden light, which had enticed her and Debbie to their premature deaths, and wondered what on Earth it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is it?</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie would never learn the answer to that question.  She died slowly and painfully, alone in that dark, dank cave.</span></div></div>",

Julie couldn't help but smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit Debbie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe one of us should go in and check it out while the other one waits outside.  Like, just in case whoever's inside needs help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie smiled.  \"Let me guess, you wanna wait outside?\" she asked antagonistically.</span></div></div>",

If it looks safe I'll call for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, are you sure you can handle it?\" Debbie asked jokingly.  \"I can hold your hand if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bitch,\" Julie told her with a smirk, and stepped through the doorway into the dazzling golden light.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and saw that she was in a concrete room.  The walls were approximately twenty feet apart, the ceiling barely high enough for her to stand up straight without bumping her head.  At the far end of the room was another doorway, and it glowed so brightly one could not tell what was behind it, or if anything was behind it at all.  Julie began walking cautiously towards it, looking around herself for any signs of trouble.  As she reached the center of the room she felt something give slightly beneath her foot, and steel meshes suddenly slid down, blocking both doorways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Julie called out, immediately rushing back the way she had come.  She kicked the mesh that separated her from Debbie, but only succeeded in stubbing her toe.  It was solid.  Debbie yanked on it, also to no avail.  Julie looked back at the walls surrounding her and saw pointed spears, nearly an inch in diameter, emerging from them at random intervals.  They were spaced at least three inches or more from each other, and it didn't appear there was any way to avoid them if they continued to extrude from the wall as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, Debbie, there's fucking spikes coming out of the fucking walls,\" Julie said, her voice becoming frantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up, Julie.\"  Refusing the accept the implications of such a thing, Debbie assumed it was a joke.  Julie wished it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm totally fucking serious.  FUCK, this is not cool.\"  Julie sprinted to the doorway emitting the golden light and slammed into the mesh with her shoulder.  She bounced off, landing hard on the concrete floor.  The mesh didn't budge an inch.  Meanwhile the spikes continued to close in, slowly but surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ,\" Julie muttered.  She grabbed hold of one of them and attempted to bend it or snap it off.  It was wrought iron, and it only continued to slide forward, obtruding on her space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at Debbie, who was standing outside the room, watching with grim fascination.  \"Shit. Shit oh shit oh shit,\" Julie babbled frantically, her voice cracking with terror.  There was now less than two feet of space between the spikes on the southern wall and the spikes on the northern wall.  Julie was about to be skewered.  \u201cI could use some help here, Deb\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Debbie could only watch as the spikes closed in, and after less than twenty seconds the tips began to press into Julie\u2019s skin.  \u201cOh God,\u201d Julie whined, sucking in air, making herself as flat as possible.  It was useless.  The sharpened tips kept on coming, creating dimples in her flesh, then piercing it outright.  \u201cAwwww,\u201d Julie gasped as eleven different iron bars slid into her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the cold metal slipping through her guts, through her lungs, through the muscles in her thighs, her right calf, her right shoulder.  She looked down at the pair of bars sliding into her belly, and she watched as two more which had slid into her lower back made their way out through her soft, flat tummy.  She felt the bones in her rib cage moving aside to accommodate the spikes passing through her chest,  A bar pierced her left butt cheek and emerged from her left hip.  The bars were grooved to allow blood to spill, and Julie saw her blood spurting and spilling all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This can\u2019t be happening,</i> Julie thought to herself.  She looked at Debbie and saw the horrified expression upon her friend\u2019s face.  <i>It should have been you in here,</i> Julie thought coldly.  She hated herself for it, but she couldn\u2019t help it.  She grabbed hold of a couple of the bars running through her, and she knew it was real.  They were real, and this was all real.  She was dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m... done for,\u201d she told Debbie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on, I\u2019ll go get help,\u201d Debbie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\"  Blood spilled over her lower lip.  Julie sucked in a breath and continued.  \u201cI\u2018ll be... dead... long before y-... you... get back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Julie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo.\"  Julie could feel her life slipping away from her.  <i>I just wanted to explore</i>.  \"This sucks,\" she said.  If she had more time to think about it she might have chosen more profound last words.</span></div></div>",

She didn't want to look weak in front of Debbie, but she wanted to die even less.  Although it went against every fiber in her being, Julie only looked at Debbie with embarrassment, telling her with her eyes what she could not say with her voice.  <i>Please don't make a big thing out of it, but yes I'd rather wait outside if you don't mind.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie got the message.  \"Okay, wish me luck,\" she said with a tinge of sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Julie smiled and said, \"Sure thing, Deb's.\"  As her friend stepped through the doorway and into the golden room beyond, Julie hoped her ill feelings were nothing more than the jitters, and not prophetic.  How awful would it be if some terrible disaster befell Debbie, going forward in Julie's stead?  As Debbie advanced through the room, it appeared Julie's fears were ungrounded.  The room seemed to be completely harmless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in after her, Julie saw a small, empty, concrete hallway with a low ceiling.  On the opposite side of the hall was another doorway, and Julie couldn't tell if the source of the light was behind this second doorway, or if the doorway itself <i>was</i> the source of the light.  \"Fucking look at that shit,\" Julie murmured in awe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\"  Debbie looked back at Julie, grinning widely.  \"Too bad you're too much of a chicken shit to check it out,\" she cooed, and without warning steel meshes slid down in front of both doorways, trapping Debbie inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie screamed and Julie's heart sank.  \"OH MY GOD, JULIE!\" Debbie cried out.  Cool, calm, and collective, Julie instantly began trying to figure a way out.  Yanking on the steel mesh, she quickly realized it was too sturdy to be moved, so there had to be another way.  \"JULIE HELP!\" Debbie screamed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on it, Debbie,\" Julie muttered.  Her eyes frantically scanned the chamber for something useful.  Anything at all.  At the far southern end lie a rusty old pick.  She wondered if she could use it to pry open the mesh.  On the Eastern side of the chamber there was a similar door, sans the glowing golden light.  Perhaps the secret to reversing the trap was in the opposing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HURRY JULIE, PLEASE!\"  Julie looked back at Debbie and saw her friend was holding onto her sanity by a thread, and she could understand why.  Emerging from the walls, slowly closing in on Debbie, were dozens of spears, which before long would skewer her like a shish kabob.  There wasn't much time.</span></div></div>",

In the center of the room she noticed a tiny crack in the floor, and upon closer inspection she saw that the crack was actually by design.  It ran in four perpendicular lines, forming a large rectangle, and Julie understood this was a panel similar to the one Debbie had stepped on in the other room.  Stepping on it would undoubtedly spring a trap of some sort, unless of course the panel released the trap in which Debbie was currently caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked to the far wall.  Wherein Debbie's room there had been a door bursting with golden light, in this room there was only a solid concrete wall.  The wall was perforated with small holes which were in line with the hidden panel in the center of the room.  Julie guessed they would have something to do with the trap, and to the left and right of the holes were a pair of switches.</span></div></div>",

Julie wouldn't have recognized the creature as a velociraptor, due to the dinosaur's inaccurate depiction in the blockbuster movie Jurassic Park, but that's precisely what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt drew close, and suddenly, without warning, the fucking thing leaped at her.  Julie kicked at it, but it latched onto her right thigh, painfully digging its claws into her meat.  Julie screamed but kept running, swatting at the miniature dinosaur as it tore away at her leg.  She managed to connect a forceful blow on the reptile's head, knocking it senseless, and it let go of her and tumbled to the ground.  Julie cried triumphantly, but her victory was short lived.  The little fucker's friends were closing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wounds would probably become infected with God knew what type of germs these little bastards carried, but she hadn't time to worry about that now.  Adrenaline pumping, Julie sprinted like she had never sprinted before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lungs burned, as if filled with molten led, and her legs felt like rubber.  It seemed impossible to go any faster, but she pushed herself past her limits, finding a higher gear when it seemed there were no gears left to be found.  Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that she would not be able to outrun her predators.  They continued to gain on her, no matter how fast she ran.  A well timed leap landed one of them on Julie's left hip, and she stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie came up eating dirt, tumbling gracelessly to the ground.  She wasted no time in picking herself up and rising to her knees, but the stubborn bastard clung to her, its hind claws buried deep in her buttocks and thigh. Another of the monsters was now perched upon her right shoulder, like some sort of warped parrot, and it bit mercilessly into her tendons and cartilage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie screamed in agony, balled up her left fist, and struck the bastard on her shoulder squarely between the eyes.  It rocked back from its perch, but held fast.  A raptor came around in front and hopped onto her, latching onto both thighs with its razor sharp talons, and bit into the tender flesh of her belly.  Julie screamed, blood flying from her lips, as it ripped through her abdominal muscles with ease.  As it feasted another of its mates joined it, finding purchase with its claws in her already wounded right thigh, and biting into her bare and bloodied midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God, this isn't going so well,</i> Julie thought to herself as she struggled to get her feet back under her.  Two more of the filthy monsters leapt onto her and began pulling strips of flesh from her back, but still Julie rose and staggered to her feet.  She gurgled a bit as blood flooded her mouth and spilled over her lush lower lip.  <i>Fuck, these fuckers are tearing me apart.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feisty pair of jaws bit deep into her left calf, shredding the muscle there.  Her abdominal wall was breached, and a smorgasbord of internal organs came spilling out of her body.  Julie looked at her guts as they fell and were quickly gobbled up by her new friends.  Aside from the raptor on her shoulder, the pair munching on her midsection, and the pair tearing apart her back, Julie now had one eating the meat from her left thigh, one eating from her right butt cheek, and several more on the ground scavenging for left-overs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reptile on her shoulder managed to chew through the tendons and separate her right arm from her body.  His friends on the ground greedily rushed to devour the fallen limb.  Julie cried softly and collapsed, with the knowledge that she would never rise again.  <i>This is a nightmare.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Julie lay flat the beasts that had been feasting on her back shifted their attention to her front.  Julie gasped as they stripped away meat from her ribs.  One of them bit into her right breast, tearing away her nipple and a large chunk of fat.  The agony was excruciating, far beyond that which can be expressed by mere words, but still worse was the terror of her own approaching death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo weak to fight back, Julie could only grit her teeth and watch as she was eaten alive.  When one of the dinosaurs severed her jugular, it was only a matter of time before the nightmare was over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her thigh high shorts and skimpy T shirt offered little protection against the frigid air.  The dropping temperatures were furthered by a wetness around her feet, and looking down Julie realized she was standing in water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" she muttered, lifting one foot, then the other above the ankle high pool in which she stood.  Her shoes and socks were soaked.  Meanwhile, the golden light seemed to have vanished.  It was dark, almost pitch black.  Looking over her shoulder, Julie thought she saw a flicker of light down under the water, where the pool deepened at an incline, but it was difficult to discern.  Most of the light in here seemed to be coming from up above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still in a sort of cavern, but a round hole had been forged in the roof, and from it emerged a dim and dreary glean of sunlight.  A rope dangled through the center of this opening, and attached to end of the rope, resting in the deeper part of the water, was a bucket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Debbie?\" Julie called out.  There was no sign of her.  <i>Where did she go?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie waded out into the depths of the pool and the ground fell off at a steep angle.  She was treading water before she reached her goal, which was, of course, the bucket, and by extension, the rope.  The water was painfully cold, sucking the breath from her lungs, but Julie bore it as best she could.  She wrapped her hands round the rope and began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand over hand, Julie hoisted herself up the rope, like kids on TV always did during gym class.  It was slow and strenuous work, but Julie was strong and in excellent shape.  Once inside the shaft of the well, she was able to take short breaks by locking her legs against one side of the wall and bracing her shoulders against the other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire climb lasted nearly forty minutes and covered over eighty five feet, and when at last Julie emerged from the top, she was exhausted.  She collapsed beside the well, her strength sapped, gasping and wheezing in the chilly air.  It was midday, but the sun hid behind blankets of thick gray clouds, and if this was summer it was the coldest damn summer Julie had ever experienced.  <i>Christ, where the fuck am I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, Julie could see rolling hills and maples and elms and ashes dotting the country side.  An unpaved road cut through the land to the north a few hundred feet from where she lay, and only fifty feet to the east stood a cottage.  Debbie was still nowhere in sight.</span></div></div>",

Pulling this switch could be the last thing she ever did, it could effectively end her life, a thought which was too overwhelming to even entertain.  Following this line of thinking to its conclusion would be immobilizing, and Debbie could ill afford inaction at this juncture.  Summoning all her strength, Julie took a deep breath and pulled the switch on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it had any affect on Debbie's situation, Julie could not be sure.  What was certain, was that this action directly impacted Julie.  Behind her, solid glass slid down in the doorway through which she had come, sealing her in this chamber.  Simultaneously, the holes between the switches, which she had suspected might be somehow triggered by the center floor panel, began to spout water.  The obvious result was immediately apparent - the room was now her tomb, and unless her situation somehow improved, Julie would drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie tried to reverse the process by moving the switch back into the upright position, but the damned thing wouldn't budge.  Frantic to find a solution, Julie quickly pulled the left switch down, but this made no discernible difference.  The water was pooling on the floor as expected, and if any escaped through the cracks around the glass barrier, it was not enough to make a difference.  Her socks were already getting soaked through her tennies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck,\" Julie muttered, and she scrambled back over to the pane blocking her retreat.  She threw her weight into it, kicked it, punched it hard enough to bruise her knuckles, but it was solid.  \"DEBBIE!\" she screamed, her voice a bit more shrill than she'd have liked.  Of course Debbie was caught in a trap of her own, but Julie was desperate.  She couldn't die like this.  She just couldn't.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was up to her ankles when Julie got the idea to plug the holes.  She rushed back over to the far wall and tried sticking her fingers in some of them, and the flow of water slowed, but not sufficiently.  <i>My shirt!</i>  Julie pulled her shirt over her head and ripped off a piece.  Luckily it was a cut off tee, which meant the bottom of the fabric was not hemmed and easy to tear.  She wadded up the cloth and jammed it into one of the holes, and instead of a steady stream all that emerged was a slight trickle.  Heartily encouraged, Julie repeated this process again and again.  It wasn't until she had torn ten strips from her shirt that she began to realize the futility of her actions.  For one thing, her shirt was nearly gone, it had been a small garment to begin with, and there were still more than twenty holes left to fill.  For another, the holes would not stay plugged.  Some held longer than others, but every so often the water pressure would force the cloth free and she would have to jam it back into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the water had risen above her knees and was approaching her waist.  \"Oh, fuck it,\" she grunted, and tossed the remainder of her shirt in frustration.  \"Oh God, I'm gonna die,\" she whined, but her mind worked relentlessly to figure another way out.  Turning back to the glass that sealed her exit, Julie saw Debbie on the other side, watching her with grim fascination.  \"Debbie!\" Julie shouted excitedly.  She sloshed through the water, which was now waist deep, forgetting she was topless, unmindful of the gentle sashay of her bare breasts, and pressed herself against the invisible barrier.  Beating upon the damnable glass with her palms, Julie shouted for Debbie to get her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie remained transfixed, gawking at Julie like she was a spectacle in a freak show.  Time was fleeting, the water level reaching her navel, and all Debbie could do was watch.  As her desperation grew, a stream of obscenities flew from Julie's tongue, some directed at Debbie, some directed at God, some directed at random, inanimate objects.  When this failed to improve her plight, Julie began to beg.  \"Please, Debbie, you gotta get me out of here.  Please, I don't wanna die.  Please, please, please, please.\"  When Debbie finally summoned the courage to respond, Julie realized her friend could not hear her pleas.  Debbie's lips moved, but her words were lost in the barrier separating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Debbie vanished, and Julie waited anxiously as Debbie hurried off to some mysterious task, leaving her to wonder if she\u2019d ever see her friend again.  Her wait was mercifully brief, and when Debbie returned Julie felt a spark of hope.  Her companion had retrieved the rusted pick axe Julie spotted earlier, and wasted no time in taking an ardent swing at the glass.  The handle, rotted and infested with mites, snapped like a brittle match stick, and the axe head failed to make so much as a scratch on the glass wall.  Debbie picked up the rusted metal and began to chisel away, but she made no headway.  Residue marred the glass and Debbie\u2019s hands began to bleed, but the glass held firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became clear the pick axe would bear no fruit, and Julie\u2019s heart fell through her stomach.  Water now lapped at her nipples, and the severity of her situation was beginning to sink in. She could not be saved. It was utterly hopeless. A chilling terror came over her as she realized with unwavering certainty that she was going to die. <i>How much longer do I have?</i> she wondered. She looked down to see the water capping her breasts, then watched the water line rise on the glass that would keep her from living her life, and guessed she might have as much as five more minutes before she was completely submerged. At that point, who knew? Two, three minutes maybe before her oxygen starved brain shut down forever. Eight more minutes of life, just eight lousy minutes of experience and knowledge and memories and emotions and feeling, and then it would all be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie lay the pick axe down and pressed her bloody palms against the glass.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she mouthed, and Julie pressed her palms to Debbie\u2019s.  Were it not for the glass between them, their hands would be clasped together.  Their eyes locked, a powerful wealth of emotion passed between them, and Julie felt a deep longing for Debbie to hold her, and to hear Debbie\u2019s voice.  It would be a small comfort, but a comfort none-the-less.  Tears welled in her eyes, but she blinked them back.  If she gave in to her sobs, she would quickly become a hysterical wreck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all her nerve to maintain her composure as panic needled its steely fingers into her spine.  Her breath was becoming short, although whether this was from a lack of oxygen or just terror, she could not be sure.  She could hear whistling noises each time she hitched in a gulp of air, and she was hideously aware that with each passing moment the instant that there would be no air left to gulp drew nearer.  Water now covered her shoulders, and before long it would be creeping up under her chin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God, this is it,</i> Julie thought.  <i>This is really it.</i>  Her eyes darted nervously around, taking in her surroundings, taking in the golden light that still shone from the room on the other side of the chamber, that goddamned golden light that cost her her life, just as she feared it would.  The high pitched wheezing that accompanied each passing breath graduated to a panicked whimper, and Julie was glad Debbie couldn't hear her.  Around the time the water reached her lips Julie realized that Debbie must have been freed by one of the switches she pulled in this room.  <i>Was it the right switch?  Did I have to die to save her?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie guessed she was dying a hero, but it was little consolation.  In fact, she would do anything to trade places with her brown eyed friend.  If she had it to do all over again she would just let Debbie get skewered.  After all, Julie had tried to warn her.  She found herself wondering if Debbie went back and stepped on the panel in the other room if it would free her from this trap.  Of course, Debbie would never do such a crazy thing, and Julie had no way of suggesting it to her.  When the surface reached her nostrils Julie tilted her head back and began to tread water, although there was now an air pocket of only a few inches between the rising water and the ceiling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, oh my God,\" she cried.  She was surprised to find that she had some serious doubts regarding her faith, and could find no comfort in the idea of an afterlife.  All she felt as the water continued to fill the room was an unquenchable desire to live.  She sucked at the last bit of oxygen until it was impossible to breathe, then she pressed herself against the glass again and stared out at Debbie.  Debbie, who would enjoy a long, happy life at Julie's expense.  It wasn't fair.  Julie wasn't supposed to die.  After a minute underwater her lungs began to burn and panic stole her sanity.  Her bowels and bladder relaxed, soiling her black shorts, and she beat against the glass uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three minutes and twenty seven seconds of agony, everything went dark, and all that remained of Julie was a lifeless corpse, staring sightlessly into eternity.</span></div></div>",

Upon reaching the center of the room she felt a hidden panel move under her feet.  <i>This must be what Debbie stepped on,</i> Julie thought.  \"Boobie traps,\" she said to herself, thinking of the Goonies movie she used to love when she was younger.  She winced, expecting some terrible misfortune to befall her, but nothing happened.  No pendulum came swinging out of the ceiling to slice her in half, no giant ball came tumbling after her, ready to crush her like a bug on a windshield.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie blew a sigh of relief.  Relaxing, a dozen knots untying themselves in her stomach, she proceeded through the room.   But no sooner than she lifted her foot off the panel did dozens of bolts, each eighteen inches long and half an inch in diameter, eject from the wall in front of her and embed themselves deep in her flesh.  \"Ahk,\" she stammered, her eyes bulging in their sockets, as she looked down at the numerous projectiles jutting from her breasts, her midsection, her hips, her groin, and her thighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's mind refused to accept the obvious - she was mortally wounded and would soon be dead - and instead she tried to turn around and make her way out of the cavern.  As she turned her foot pressed down on the panel again, and when she took a staggering step towards the chamber from whence she came another flurry of bolts flew from the wall, studding her back, her buttocks, and her hamstrings with dozens more projectiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she sighed, sinking to her knees.  Fighting for every last second of consciousness, Julie refused to go down.  She shuffled back to the door to the chamber on her knees , stared at that hateful golden light coming from the next room, and sighed.  She had been right all along.  She was going to die young, and that goddammed light was her fate, calling to her.  <i>I'm sorry Debbie</i> she thought as she slumped to the ground.</span></div></div>",

She always felt better after talking to Tom.  He was the only real friend she had.  Sure, there were plenty of posers at school for her to have fun with, but they weren't real.  The guys all just wanted to get in her pants, and most of the girls were either jealous haters or guy crazy sluts  with whom she had nothing in common.  They only kissed her ass because if they hung around with her they had a shot at talking to one of the popular guys.  But she knew Tom had her back, no matter what.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe sun was shining brightly as Julie bounded back and forth, weaving and dribbling through would be defenders with practiced ease.  She glided to the rim, tossed the ball through the hoop, then made her way back to the middle of the street with cool, calm confidence.  But as Julie turned for the ball she saw that all the nameless faces she had been taking to school on her makeshift basketball court were gone.  She stood alone in the middle of the street.  A sinking feeling of dread sprouted in the pit of her stomach, and she knew it was coming.  Before she even turned she knew it was coming, and there it was - the magenta '92 Suburban, bearing down on her with deadly speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie was frozen.  She tried to move but her legs refused.  It was as though she was stuck, bogged down in a swamp.  That hateful, dreaded goddammed Chevy Suburban bore down on her and her feet were glued to the ground.  The fucking thing clipped her, sending her spinning through the air just as it had her brother all those years ago.  Remarkably, Julie felt no pain as she tumbled to the ground.  All the same, she knew she was ruined.  Her bones were shattered and her organs crushed.  She could hear the bleating sirens as emergency vehicles sped to the scene, but they would be too late.  They couldn't save her, just like they couldn't save her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe wail of the sirens grew louder and Julie wondered who would be the first to arrive, the police or the ambulance.  Whoooooo-ooooooooo, Whoooooooo-oooooooooeeeepp, BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe sound of the sirens faded into something much louder and much more annoying - the familiar bleep of her alarm clock.  As Julie shook the cobwebs of the dream world from her consciousness, an overwhelming flood of relief washed over her.  She was safe in her own bed, living her comfortable, easy life in the suburbs, with 70 or 80 more years to look forward to.  She was not dying as her poor brother had half a lifetime ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>Field trip</i>, Julie thought to herself.  Her class was going on a field trip today.  She climbed out of bed and pulled open her closet.  Julie took a moment to admire her reflection in the picture frame mirror mounted on the inside of her closet door.  She was blessed with eye-popping good looks, and although she tried to be humble she could not entirely escape the cloying clutches of vanity. Her perfectly shaped figure, wrapped in a pink, cream-colored skin with flawless complexion, scantily clad in white panties and a 36C sized brassierre, stared back at her, and Julie felt a rush go through her body.  Even fresh out of bed, this early in the morning, she was stunning.  Being beautiful had its drawbacks, but on the whole it was a remarkably uplifting and empowering experience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Julie rummaged through her wardrobe she mulled over what she should wear that day.</span></div></div>",

She applied some clear lip gloss and was ready to go.  She wore no make-up, and she didn't need it.  Putting make-up on a face like hers would be like finger painting on the Mona Lisa.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tJulie followed Jerry onto the bus.  They shoved their way to a seat near the back and plopped down next to each other.  Jerry was a hornball, just like all the other guys in her school, but he had a great sense of humor and he could make Julie laugh, so that was something.  He would help her pass the time on what would be an otherwise incredibly boring field trip.  They were going to visit the El Paso Times building, where they make newspapers.  What a yawn-fest that would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So are you ready to go to the El Paso Times Julie?  WHOOOO!\" Jerry shouted with mocked excitement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yes!\" Julie answered, pumping her fist in the air and following the gesture with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Alright, let's go see some fuckers make newspapers!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie smiled and rolled her eyes.  \"I'd almost rather be in class,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fuck that, watching people make newspapers is more exciting than listening to Mr. Belvedere's dumb ass.\"  Doing a spot on impersonation of Mr. Belvedere, Jerry continued, \"In 1865 Wilbur Marshall took a shit in his hat and said, 'I do declare' blah blah fucking blah.\"  He slipped back into his regular voice for the blah, blah, blah's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, but wudduyou think these newspaper people are gonna talk about?  Like that's gonna be soooo much more interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fucking A, only ditzy bimbo's like you don't wanna know how newspapers get printed.  I find the process quite stimulating, myself,\" Jerry replied, feigning intellictualism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie laughed and punched Jerry in the shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ow!  What the fuck was that for?\"  Jerry flicked Julie's arm hard enough for it to sting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ahhhhh,\" Julie groaned, but not without good humor.  \"You fucking cocksucker.\"  She giggled playfully to show there were no hard feelings.  It was just mindless flirting, Julie's style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd so Julie and Jerry continued chatting inanely about random nonsense, such as teenagers do, and as their classmates slowly filed into the remaining seats and got settled, the bus finally began to roll.  Forty minutes later they were shuffling into the main entrance of The El Paso Times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA short, middle aged lady in a cheap business suit was droning on about printers and ink and some other inconsequential drivel.  Julie thought she would die of boredom.  She went into her own world in her head, dreaming romantic dreams of dying in Debbie's arms, seeing Debbie's sweet face contorted with grief at the prospect of losing her old friend.  Such things made her feel important and cared for.  She imagined how Tom would react when he heard of her untimely death.  Not only was it romanticly comforting to picture her friends bawling and grieving over her death, she found the idea of her body being riddled with bullets strangely arousing.  Of course she didn't really want to die, but Julie had a streak of masochism running through her, along with some bisexual tendencies.  Sitting there listening to Cheap Businiess Suit, Julie longed for some excitement.  Something to make her feel alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJerry elbowed her, dislodging her from her fantasies, and directed her attention to a tightly rolled joint held low and out of sight from their surrounding class mates.  Julie had never tried drugs of any kind, and never planned to.  It wasn't because she was afraid she would be hooked; she didn't buy all that crap about being hooked with just one hit.  She had a strong mind and she would not become a slave to anyone or anything, no matter what happened, but she was afraid of being caught.  The fall out from being caught with illegal drugs was more than she cared to deal with, but she none-the-less found herself intrigued and tempted by Jerry's offer.  This might be the source of excitement she so desperately craved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce the cheap business suit lady was finally finished with her mindless jabber, Julie's class shuffled out of the conference room in which they had been waiting and headed for the elevators.  The next stop on their tour would be the printing room, located in the basement.  Julie and Jerry hung near the back of the crowd, and when the coast appeared to be clear and they could slip away unnoticed, Jerry motioned for Julie to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>This is crazy</i>, Julie thought.  The chances of them catching up with their class later without being detected by El Paso Times employees or a member of their school's faculty seemed terribly slim.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tFuck it, Julie decided.  She couldn't take anymore of this God awful field trip without some sort of diversion.  If they were caught they could always play dumb and just pretend they got lost.  Julie followed Jerry down the corridor and into a dark, empty storage room.  There was a window they were able to pry open on the far wall.  This would allow the smoke to venilate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJerry popped the joint in his mouth, held the flame from his lighter to the end of it, and sucked in air with considerable force.  The end of the joint cackled and burned, and when Jerry stopped inhaling a thin tendril of smoke rose from the smoldering cherry.  Jerry held in his breath, swallowed, then blew out a billowing white cloud.  He smiled contently and handed the joint to Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie looked tentatively at the joint before pressing it to her perfect lips and beginning to suck.  At first it did not seem anything was happening, but soon she felt her lungs begin to burn.  A violent bout of coughing forced puffs of smoke from Julie's mouth and her eyes began to water, but she felt no different.  She squinted at Jerry and asked, \"When is it supposed to hit me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It'll take a minute, but you'll feel it, don't worry.\"  He motioned to her to take another hit.  \"Hit it again.  Don't be a pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie furrowed her brow, taking offense, and began to suck more deeply on the joint now.  She was no pussy, goddammit.  She fought with her lungs as long as she could, forcing the smoke to remain in her body, before she finally broke down and began hacking uncontrollably.  While bending over, struggling to catch her breath, Julie handed the joint back to Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fuck,\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah,\" Jerry chuckled.  He took a couple more drags, then offered the joint to Julie again.  The burning in her chest and throat now somewhat subsiding, Julie took the joint and hit it again.  She was beginning to feel the THC take affect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh wow,\" she said, peering through a white fog.  She started giggling for no apparent reason, and found it nearly impossible to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDamn, this feels good, Julie thought to herself.  She just kept looking into Jerry's eyes and busting up laughing.  Jerry was trying to look cool, but to Julie he looked like a goofy kid with an over-sized ego.  She couldn't take him seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA few muffled shouts came from the room next door, followed by a popping sound.  Jerry's face lit up with paranoid concern, and he swung around to the door connecting to the next room.  \"Did you hear that?\" he asked Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Uh huh,\" Julie giggled, \"I think they're onto us.\"  She pretended to be scared, but couldn't hold her composure and quickly went right back to cracking herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJerry crept up to the door, doing his best to tread lightly so as not to make a sound.  As he approached it he stood on his tip toes so he could peek through the small square window situated near the top of the door.  Suddenly, without warning, there was another, much louder popping sound accompanied by the sound of shattering glass.  The back of Jerry's skull popped off, spraying blood and clumps of greasy black hair across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA little scream escaped Julie's lips as she witnessed the murder of her friend.  It came as such a surprise she actually giggled a little at the sight of Jerry's dead body.  <i>Wow, I sure wasn't expecting that,</i> Julie thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA glimpse of movement caught her attention and she saw a face appear in the window of the door.  It was time for Julie to get the fuck out of Dodge.</span></div></div>",

She certainly felt alive now.  She was no longer bored, no longer craving excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe scrambled to her feet and leapt at the open window, latching onto the frame and hoisting herself up through it with graceful athleticism.  Outside there was a towering scaffold used for construction on the building next door.  Looking down one could see the eight story drop to the ground below, but Julie ignored the dizzying heights and pulled herself up onto the scaffold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie spared a glance over her shoulder at the open window, saw no one attempting pursuit, and began to make her way forward along the pipes, weaving in and out of the structure.  Julie was nearly 30 yards from the window when she felt a stinging pain bite through her right hip and she cried out in surprise.  Her balance was disrupted, her grip loosened, and she slipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she fell Julie leaned forward, catching the crossbar upon which she had been balancing with her chest.  As she rebounded from the force of impact she managed to grip the bar tightly with both hands.   Her body dangled in thin air, but she held onto the scaffold for dear life.  Julie felt something warm spilling down her leg, and at first she thought she had pissed herself.  When she looked down, however, she saw a jagged hole in her right hip and her cream colored slacks were turning dark red.  She had been shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fuck,\" Julie cried out.  She grunted as she did a chin up on the bar, lifting her elbows onto it, and tried to push herself back to a position where she could once again stand up.  Her perky young breasts had just cleared the bar when a horrible stabbing pain ripped through her guts, sapping the strength from her arms.  She dropped back down, once again dangling over oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie looked down and saw a fresh bullet hole in her bare midriff, just to the left of her cute little coin slot belly button, splashing blood out of her belly and soaking the front of her pants.  Julie muttered something incoherent, and again tried to lift herself back onto the bar.  She had just managed to perform another chin up, Julie's gorgeous face was just above the bar, her expression one of grim determination, when she was shot again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDropping back into the dangling position, her chin up wasted, Julie looked down at her third exit wound, this one also in her bare belly, slightly lower and an inch to the right of her navel.  Her mental state deteriorating into that of a panicked animal, Julie giggled hysterically, but her laughter quickly fizzled into a whimper.  The pain was tremendous, but the maddening fear was somehow worse.  \"ZzzooIcantbelievethisishappening,\" she mumbled to herself.  As she was looking at herself, watching her blood spurt and spray from her body before it fell hundreds of feet to the ground, another gory hole opened high in her belly, just beneath the left side of her rib cage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Aaahh,\" Julie cried in her cute, girlish voice.  Christ, there was so much blood.  She was gushing.  The front of her pants were soaked, completely coated with the stuff.  She found nothing erotic about her gun shot wounds now.  Nothing romantic about dying.  In a desperate attempt to slow the bleeding, she released the bar to which she clung with her left hand and pressed it against her stomach.  It didn't appear to help.  Blood just continued to pour out around her palm and through her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fuckinjeezzahllurrarrrrrr,\" her stammering became high pitched and indecipherable.  Her right arm wasn't strong enough to hold her by itself much longer, so she reached for the bar again with her left hand.  The blood made her left hand slippery, making it difficult to get a good grip, but she grabbed on as best she could.  She could taste blood in the back of her throat and swallowed it in crazy hopes that keeping the blood in her body would help keep her alive longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she hung there, clinging to her life by a thread, she was shot for the 5th time that day.  This time the bullet punched through her right shoulder, splashing her beautiful face with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ayyaaannninuuh!\" Julie cried.  <i>This is it</i>, she thought.  <i>This is really it.  I should have stayed with the class.</i>  She would give anything in the world to be staring at a bunch of printers in the basement of the El Paso Times building right now.  She didn't care how boring it was, at least she would still be alive.  She would be able to laugh and joke and have fun.  That was all over for her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie's fingers slipped off the bar and she began to drop.  She wondered if it would hurt when she hit the ground.  <i>Will it feel like a Chevy Suburban slamming into me, crushing my fragile body?</i> she thought to herself.  But Julie never reached the ground.  She landed on a steel pipe jutting up from the base of the scaffold and her fall was broken as she was impaled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJulie coughed up mouthfuls of blood and stared in awe at the pole now running right through the middle of her.  She placed her hands around it as if to confirm it was real.  She struggled to breathe, agonizing over her own mortality, for several more minutes before at last she felt death's sweet release.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The lights in the office were off, and it offered numerous shadows in which she could hide.  Crouching behind the desk, she stared out at the hallway and waited for the worst.  It was only a matter of seconds before she could hear brisk footsteps echoing through the hallway, moving in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's coming,</i> she thought, her heart pounding so fiercely it would surely betray her location.  That maddening hammering in her ears had to have been audible for miles around.  A tall, slender man with gray hair, harsh brown eyes, and a wrinkled face stepped into the doorway, and looked directly at Julie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream welled in Julie's throat, but before she could give voice to it those cold, calculating eyes moved on, flickering about the office.  Then the man was gone, continuing his brisk walk down the hallway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie sat still, too terrified to move, for what must have been the better part of an hour.  <i>Did he see me?</i> she wondered.  <i>Why didn't he kill me?</i>  When at last Julie decided to move her legs were shaky, her nerves shot, and she almost collapsed when she first tried to stand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should be fucking dead,</i> she told herself, amazed at her seemingly unbelievable luck.  As her composure slowly returned, this thought was followed by, <i>I've got to get back to the class.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering Jerry, Julie wondered if she should mention what had happened.  They would find out about Jerry sooner or later, but did she need to tell them what she knew?  Maybe she could still slink back in with the class, her absence unnoticed.  Maybe they would just think Jerry went off by himself, and ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she was not honest right from the start, it might appear she was covering up more than she knew.  A charge for possession of marijuana was small potatoes when compared with accessory to murder, and if the information she provided helped the police catch a killer she would likely get off with nothing more than a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Julie fessed up, and the fall out was bad, but not as bad as she had feared.

Besides, when Julie promised them she'd never use drugs again, they believed her, and it was an earnest promise on Julie's part.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst of the aftermath was spending three long, boring hours at the police station, and for Julie that was probably just the beginning.  The police had obtained footage from the paper's security cameras, and Julie had identified the killer.  She was told they would contact her if further information was needed, and she would probably need to testify in court.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to her that she might become a target if she testified against a contract killer, but the severity of the situation didn't quite sink in.  One's own mortality can never be fully perceived at such an age.  Julie was more concerned with the hours she would have to spend at the courthouse, answering questions for officials in boring black suits while listening to fancy lawyer talk.  Basically a lot of tedious, procedural bullshit.  Still, balking when asked to testify was not an option she had considered.</span></div></div>",

A few ignorant cunts called Julie a murderer, but from Sasha and her crew that was to be expected.  The poor girl's sole purpose in life was to fuck with Julie.  She and her minions did their best to spread rumors that would incriminate Julie in a plot to kill Jerry, but with little success.  Anyone with half a brain could see through their ridiculous claims.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that sillyness aside, Julie was beginning to believe the whole thing would just blow over, and she'd never hear from the DA or the police again.  Things were looking up, Christmas vacation was right around the corner, and next month was her seventeenth birthday.  Just one more year from legal adulthood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen school finally let out on the 13th, the ordeal at the El Paso Times was all but forgotten.  Three weeks of vacation had arrived, and at the tender age of sixteen, three weeks could feel like an eternity.

When she was finished he blew out a cloud of smoke, took a sip of beer, and told her, \"You could be in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie giggled, \"Yeah, no shit Sherlock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean seriously.  This is bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, these guys are gonna kill you, Julie.\"  Tom spoke lightly of her impending death, so aloof and dispassionate Julie wasn't sure if he was really serious.  But his eyes were fierce and focused, so she decided he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What guys?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, whoever killed Jerry.  And that guy at the Times.  You got away, but they'll find you.  They won't be happy with a living witness walking around.\"  Tom was never one to beat around the bush.  Julie knew him to be very direct, but tonight it was the drink that loosened his tongue so.  Listening to her friend tell her she was going to die, and to do so so plainly, without any hesitation, gave Julie the chills.  Were he sober, he might employ a bit more tact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Julie refused to accept it.  Did I mention that sixteen year olds are not capable of grasping the reality of their own mortality?  This was perhaps doubly true in Julie's case.  She was familiar with death, had seen it rear its ugly head twice in her lifetime, but this only made her further fortify her mental walls.  She could acknowledge she might die, maybe sooner rather than later, but deep down the thought of her own death was unfathomable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to play it cool, Julie replied, \"Shee-it, let 'em try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no joke, Julie.  You're in deep shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Tom.  What do you want me to do, shit my pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.  At least be a little scared, for fuck's sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that.  I don't give a shit if I die.\"  The little girl, cowering in a newspaper office for the better part of an hour, was a distant memory, if she was still a memory at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash Tom drew a revolver from behind his back, where it had been holstered, pointed it at Julie, and cocked the hammer.  Julie screamed and turned her head, ducking down and covering herself with her arms.  Tom eased the hammer forward and lowered the gun.  He had made his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie peeked out from under her arm, saw that she was no longer at gun point, and straightened her back.  \"Fuck, Tom!\" she said angrily, and reached out to punch him in the shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom took the blow good naturedly, and just chuckled a bit.  \"Well, you see what I mean?  Don't fuckin' lie to me.  You can spout that bullshit all you want at school, if it makes you look tough, but I fuckin' know better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, so I don't wanna die, so what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So watch your fuckin' ass, that's what.  These fuckers aren't gonna fuckin' forget about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Julie said, and fear clouded her heart just a bit.  Fear in a life and death situation was a good thing, and that was Tom's point, but she hated him just a little for it.  When school let out this afternoon it was all sunshine and lollipops, and now she felt like she was back at the Times, running from a killer.  \"I'll be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.  You wanna watch Scarface?\"  She did, and they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Julie awoke in her bed the next day the world was a little brighter, her fear eroded by the morning light.  The idea of someone trying to kill her now seemed absurd.  The man who shot Jerry probably worked alone, and would not have the connections necessary to track Julie down.  Besides, an arrest had not been made and Julie had not yet officially agreed to testify.  Tom's bleak warning held little weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs noon approached, Julie finally rose to meet the day.  Her mother was eating an apple and watching TV in the living room.  \"Morning sunshine,\" she said sarcastically as Julie passed her on the way to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, mom.\"  Julie dumped some Fruit Loops in a bowl and opened the fridge.  As she jostled around for the milk, her mother called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to Aunt Margie's cabin for the weekend.  Your cousins will be there.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cloudcroft was in the mountains, where winters dumped snow by the buckets, and there were tons of hills and slopes for tubing or sledding.  \"Sweet, when are we leaving?\" Julie called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This afternoon.  You'll be joining us, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Julie replied cheerfully.  She packed some winter clothes - knee high socks, sweat pants, long johns, a couple of sweaters, long sleave T shirts, an extra pair of jeans - and pulled on her favorite sweat shirt, a well worn, gray hoodie with a zipper in the front.  This small chore completed, Julie was ready to roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Aunt Margie had birthed her four cousins, Josue, who was six, Chris, who was eight, Luis, who was eleven, and Claudia, who was fourteen.  She didn't like the way Luis looked at her, but the other two boys were adorable.  Claudia, however was almost like a sister to her, as the two of them were nearly the same age and had been playmates for much of their childhood.  It had been six months since Julie and Claudia had hung out together, and Julie was thrilled to see her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat and giggled for the first couple of hours at Margie's cabin, jawing about boys, girls, gossip, and other teenage nonsense.  As conversation began to die down, Claudia suggested they go scope out the woods.  There was still a couple hours of daylight left, and the air was not yet too frigid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was up for a walk, if for no other reason than to enjoy the scenery and clear her head.  Lately she had been thinking a lot about Chucky, and she guessed witnessing Jerry's death had a good deal to do with that.  So Claudia put on her hot pink jacket and Julie her gray hoodie, but when Julie told her mom they were going out to play her mom countered with a proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to play charades, you sure you don't want to join us?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If they had a good spot picked out in advance, that could save them precious minutes of leisure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way through the woods, up the mountain north of the cabin, and had wandered several miles when Julie got shot.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We've been walking for close to 45 minutes, and I've just finished telling Claudia my tale of woe.  I was heavy on the gore and suspense, but glossed over the part where I cowered behind a desk for an hour.  Telling her Tom's thoughts, I'm casual and nonchalant, as if it's of little consequence what happens to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, aren't you scared?\" Claudia asks me, providing precisely the response I was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, fuck it.  I'll be fine,\" I say, with just a hint of bravado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead past the trees is what appears to be a terrific sledding area.  I step into the clearing, and looking around I can see it's perfect.  The slope is at least fifty yards wide, with an incline of nearly forty five degrees.  It stretches more than two hundred yards up hill before a crop of trees encroaches, plenty of space to pick up speed.  Envisioning myself racing down the hill, I reach up to put a band around my hair and keep it out of my face.  My T shirt rises on my breasts, and I feel a cool breeze against my exposed belly.  That's when it hits me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it feels like I've been kicked in the stomach, but there's nothing around to kick me.  Warm, dull pressure slowly builds into fiery agony, and looking down I see a neat little coin sized hole in the center of my bare midriff, just above and to the right of my navel.  As I stare at it in disbelief, blood begins to spurt out of my body and slosh down the front of my jeans.  I reach down and clutch myself, my hands instantly wet with blood, and it dawns on me - <i>I've been shot by a sniper.</i>  And who would send a sniper way out here in the middle of nowhere to shoot me?  The murderer from the El Paso Times, of course.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck,\" I mutter.  Overwhelmed by pain and stark, unflinching terror, my legs turn to noodles.  As I sink to my knees I feel the sting as another round punches through my chest, up near my right shoulder.  <i>Shot twice,</i> I think.  <i>I've been shot twice, and if I don't get some help quick I'm finished.</i>  I twist around so I can call for Claudia, but she's nowhere to be found.  The fucking bitch bailed on me, leaving me here to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, keep a cool head.  Don't panic.</i>  Certain that at any time I'll feel the sting of a third shot, perhaps this time in the center of my chest, I struggle to regain my feet.  <i>Maybe the next shot will go right through my eye, splattering my brains all over the snow,</i> I think crazily.  But I manage to stand up, and as I stagger back to the woods I hear an engine reving from somewhere far above.  This must be my shooter firing up his snowblower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he's leaving, confident that second shot will finish me off.  Hope surges as I plow through the snow like a lumbering water buffalo.  It's not easy going, with a pair of gun shot wounds in my body, but I make due as best I can.  Battling mounting fear and rubbery legs, I run.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all my distractions, the burning in my belly is the worst.  I've always been good at coping with pain, but this is like nothing I've ever felt before.  It's as if someone filled by guts with sulfer and lit a match.  Meanwhile I keep feeling my intestines trying to slide out of my tummy, and I have to hold them in.  It's not a pleasant feeling.  There's a tightness in my chest where the second shot hit me, but it's child's play compared to my stomach wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery so often my feet get tangled, and I trip myself up.  On more than a few occasions I stumble to my hands and knees, and with no small amount of effort I rise up and continue on my wild path.  About five minutes into it, I realize I'm running out of steam.  My jeans are pretty well soaked with blood, and I am continuing to bleed at an alarming rate.  I wonder how much longer I can keep this up.  I wonder if Claudia will return with help.  I wonder if the sniper is still chasing me, hoping to finish what he started.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous, and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, my thoughts keep returning to Jerry.  And my brother.  Jerry was lucky, the way I see it.  He never knew what hit him.  There was no time for him to be terrified, to contemplate the eternity of nothingness awaiting him.  He was just happy one moment, gone the next.  Chucky, on the other hand, was not so lucky.  I've spent many nights thinking about how awful those final moments must have been, and it's just beyond me.  I can't even imagine it.  Now, crashing through the woods with a pair of gun shot wounds in my body I'm staring it dead in the face, and it's harder than I ever dreamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, I stop to rest against a towering pine.  I sling my right arm around the trunk to support my weight, and hold my guts in with my left hand.  I'm struggling to catch my breath, telling myself I just need a little more time, just another minute or two, and then I'll keep going.  The cabin can't be too much farther.  It just can't be.  But part of me is beginning to wonder.  </span></div></div>",

Too graceless to be a deer, too large and plodding to be a dog, it stops for a second, and in that second I tell myself it's not my sniper.  It can't be.  Sure, it's true I've been leaving tracks so deep and so clear a blind man could follow them, and it's true my progress has been painfully slow, hindered by the loss of my blood and the agony in my belly, but it's not my sniper.  It's not a dog, and it's not a deer, but maybe it's a 200 pound ape, lost in the woods.  Better yet, maybe it's Claudia.  Maybe it's my mother, coming to my rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it's not my mother, and it's no ape.  As I stand with my arm draped around the tree I feel the stabbing pain as another bullet bites into my lower back, running out of steam somewhere inside the tangles of my intestines.  My back arches, and I hear the awful mewling of a dying animal.  This harrowing sound spawns from my own throat, but it is foreign to me.  I am amazed I can even make such a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to give in, refusing to accept the futility of my plight, I sigh and stagger onward, still clutching my belly.  I don't get far before I feel two more rounds punch through my midsection.  They enter the small of my back, cut through my entrails, and leave a pair of exit wounds, each the size of a quarter, on either side of my navel.  Blood spurts from the exit wounds as if I have gallons to spare, splashing and steaming in the snow before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwooning, I gather every ounce of my not inconsiderable will power and keep my legs stiff, refusing to fall.  If I fall now, it's all over.  I don't look back.  If I look back and see the man behind me I can no longer pretend he's not there.  Instead I shuffle ahead, still hoping to escape.  It's crazy, I know, but what else can I do?  My lower lip is trembling, my hands splayed across my belly, attempting to cover all three gun shot wounds simultaneously.  My toes are numb, my body temperature dropping, but I must continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA popping sound emanates from behind me, and I've heard that sound before; when I was high on THC and running for my life through the halls of the El Paso Times.  It's the sound a bullet makes as it passes through a silencer, of course.  I collapse, face first in the snow.  The bastard shot me in my legs; I can feel the burning in my thighs.  Blood fills my mouth and sloshes over my chin.  <i>Jesus, God, am I really dying?</i>  I shimmy through the snow on my elbows, but I need to move faster.  I manage to get to my knees, but standing is out of the question now.  In my peripheral vision I can see a figure, what appears to be a man, but I refuse to look at him.  I refuse to even acknowledge his existence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScuffling through the snow on my knees, it finally begins to sink in.  The figure to my left is not lagging behind, not losing ground, but just following casually along.  Escape is impossible.  By exerting energy I'm only increasing my heart rate, thus increasing my rate of blood loss.  Coming to terms with this is no easy feat, but when I reach another tree, I turn my back to it, and plop down on my butt in the snow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last I look up at my shooter, a middle aged man with dark, tassled hair and cold, lifeless eyes.  He might have once been handsome, but a life of hardship has made him ugly and haggard.  A jagged scar runs along his jaw line, and a bushy, graying mustache covers most of his upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me,\" I tell him, hardly believing my own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, \"I did.\"  His expression is empty, distant.  There's no sympathy in him.  No feeling.  Behind his eyes he is a hollow shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I dying?\" I ask him, desperately seeking consolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis expression remains unchanged.  He nods, and says nothing more.  That cold, heartless face, that simple nod, delivers the most devastating news I've ever had to endure.  When Chucky died, it was heartbreaking, but I was still alive.  I could still laugh, still love, still feel, still remember.  It might be egotistical and selfish, but the truth is this is much worse.  This is my own death, and it's too terrible to comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I really don't want to die,\" I say.  It sounds pathetic, even to my own ears.  \"Maybe you could let me go, and I promise I won't tell anyone about any of this.\"  I'm babbling, and I know it, but I can't think of anything else to do.  \"I never saw nothing, I swear.\"  A ridiculous thing to say, but I say it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the man almost looks sorry.  He reaches slowly for my face, and oh so gently brushes the hair out of my eyes.  He carresses my cheek, and I realize what I had mistaken for concern was only lust, masquerading as affection.  \"Sorry sweetheart,\" he says, \"but it's far too late for that.  Your cousin abandoned you, and you're bleeding all over the place.\"  His accent is thick, and his voice is harsh.  \"Even if I left right now you would bleed to death inside half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know he's right, I know it's hopeless, and my breath begins to quicken in my chest.  Overwhelmed with terror, I can no longer speak.  My tongue is frozen like a lump on a log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" he continues, \"the contract on you is out.  I can't let you go now.\"  He raises his pistol, pointing it at the center of my chest, and I feel all my emotions flooding over, like I'm going to explode.  Fear, grief, despair, mind-numbing panic.  I know what comes next, and I'm powerless to stop it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I raise my hands, palms out, and manage to utter the word, \"wait,\" just before the gun kicks in his hand.  I feel a deep pressure in my chest, and looking down I see the smoking hole right between my breasts.  My fate is sealed, and no miracle from the heavens can save me now.  It's the final nail in the coffin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds pass, me drawing ever nearer to my final tick on the clock, and blood begins to bubble out from the hole in my chest.  My mind is gone, all my higher thoughts devolving into the ramblings of a lunatic, and all I can say is, \"Fuck.\"  It's an apt word, summing everything up quite nicely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look back up at my killer, wondering if he truly understands what he's doing.  I wonder if he grasps the gravity of what he's taken from me.  I guess he probably doesn't, he's probably not capable of understanding, and the gun in his hands kicks one last time.  The bullet destroys what remains of my fledging heart, and my breath stills in my throat.  I have time for just one final thought before I'm gone - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why me?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm nearing 50, approaching the twilight of my life, and I've been on 23 of these missions in my time, but this one was different.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI killed a boy once, nineteen years old, but not as young as this one.  I killed a bitch once too, crazy fuckin' broad who was into all kinds of shit, attracting a lot of attention to herself.  My bosses don't like attention.  I've silenced witnesses, people who did nothing other than end up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I'm not one to get all sentimental over that type of shit.  Young, female, and innocent, none of that mattered to me.  No, what set this girl apart was her stone cold, drop dead gorgeous looks.

A little teeny bopping bimbo had seen something she wasn't supposed to see, and she was out there on the loose.  In my business loose ends weren't tolerated, and either the teen or Carlos had to go.  As I probably don't need to explain to you, Carlos was more valuable to my bosses than this silly little girl, so it was up to me to make sure she stayed quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had her phone tapped for nearly two weeks, and I awaited my opportunity.  On Saturday, December 14th, my opportunity came.  My target would be spending some time at a cabin up in Cloudcroft.  It was a perfect setup - a quiet, secluded area, surrounded by woods and wilderness.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit of research in the public records provided me with an address for Aunt Margie's cabin, and I was on my way.  I arrived early so I could scout the place out, and I had one of our people grant me access to a snow mobile.  I found a nifty little spot up on a ridge overlooking the cabin, hunkered down with my sniper rifle, and waited.  The family wasn't far behind me, eight of them in all.  Aunt Margie and her four children pulled in first, piling out of a red minivan.  Soon after the Huertas arrived in a white Corrola, and when I spotted Julie through my scope my jaw literally hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had seen pictures of my target, and I knew she was pretty, but photographs failed to capture the entire spectrum of her beauty.  Looking at the live version of the girl, in full technicolor, was nothing short of shocking.  Her pubescent skin seemed to glow with a life all its own, a color that transcended the two dimensional portrait.  Her sparkling smile, her thriving vivacity, her body language, perceptions I could not have gained from looking at photos, were all things which drove me mad with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn overwhelming urge to see this girl, not through the scope of my rifle but up close and personal, filled my very soul.  I had to be near her, to witness such other worldly beauty.  I needed to be able to touch her perfect skin, to feel the curves of her spectacular body.  I bided my time, again waiting for the right opportunity.  And in time, the right opportunity once again presented itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been said patience is a virtue.  In my line of work that cliche rings especially true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie emerged from the front door, dressed in a gray zip up sweatshirt, unzipped and open in the front, revealing her plain white tee shirt, and faded blue jeans.  She wore battered white tennis shoes, not ideal for trudging through snow, but probably the only foot wear a lower class city girl like her owned.  All in all, it was a rather ordinary outfit, but Julie made it look good.  Julie made it look damn good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing close behind came Julie's cousin, Claudia.  I know her name, as I know all of Julie's family members' names.  It is the nature of my business to know such things.  Claudia was a bit more portly than Julie, and two years younger.  Claudia's outfit was less memorable, as was her appearance on the whole, but I do recall that she wore a hot pink coat.  As it turned out, this coat ended up playing a vital role in Julie's demise, as you'll soon see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls made their way into the woods, where visibility was low, and for a time they vanished completely.  I scanned the trees frantically, but could see no sign of my target.  I was beginning to think I might be prevented from capitalizing on this otherwise perfect opportunity, when at last I caught sight of that bright pink coat.  Were it not for that coat, I might never have found them until they returned to the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying low, I traversed the ridge, keeping my eye on Claudia's brilliant winter wear.  It would disappear in the woods for a time, then emerge in a clearing just long enough for me to spot them.  Tracing their movements, I could see where they were headed, and moved into a position to intercept them.  When the time came, I had an excellent shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, I would see to it that Julie's sledding days were behind her, if in fact she had ever done any sledding at all.  As Claudia stepped out from behind her, Julie put her hands behind her head and wrapped a band around her silky locks, forming a loose pony tail.  With her breasts thrust at the front of her sweater, pulling it and the T-shirt beneath it out and up, a thin section of her creamy midriff was exposed, and my sights zeroed in on her navel.  A thin little coin slot belly button marked the center of her perfect midsection, and I'll be damned if drool didn't fall from my mouth at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiming for her center, allowing myself room for error, I squeezed the trigger.  My instrument of death chirped softly, and a .762 millimeter round, encased in a full metal jacket, made its way from the chamber of my rifle, through a sound suppressor and 5000 feet of cold air, to Julie's belly.  It punched a neat little hole right through the middle of her, and through my scope I caught a glimpse of the girl's lively blue eyes widening.  I had to get a closer look at those sparkling blue eyes, at that enchanting figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly lowered her hands to her midriff, clutched herself, then looked at the blood spurting all over her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focused in for another shot, but as I squeezed the trigger she sank to her knees, and my shot caught her in the meat of her chest, up near her right shoulder.  I saw the bright red blood spill as she fell, and I could see the terrible distress painted on her lovely face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her knees, bleeding out into the soft snow, Julie twisted around to call for Claudia, but her cousin had fled at the first sign of trouble, leaving Julie to fend for herself.  Satisfied that my prey was disabled, I slung my rifle over my shoulder, resolving myself to go down and finish the job.  In my shoulder holster I carried a silenced .40 caliber Berretta, and it would do nicely for this work.  After climbing aboard my snowmobile however, I noticed something amazing.  Julie was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pesky little slut had apparently scampered off into the woods, but it was little bother.  Tracking her in the snow would be a cinch, especially with blood gushing from her belly.  In little more than a minute, I had reached the clearing where she had taken on two rounds, and as I had suspected she left deep tracks and spots of blood behind her as she trekked into the forest.  I followed on foot, pistol out and ready.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I gave chase I found patches where the snow was caved in, where Julie had collapsed on her knees before rising up again.  In these areas dark blotches of snow had been stained a sinister red, and I wondered how long the girl could keep up this charade.  She was bleeding quite profusely, and judging by the gradually more frequent knee prints her strength was fleeting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bounded over a particularly steep bank, and there I saw her.  She was slumped against a pine tree, holding her stomach with her left hand, her right arm loosely gripping the tree trunk.  Her back was to me, and although I thought I was making plenty of racket in my pursuit, she appeared not to hear me as I trampled down the slope I had just breasted.  I could see the exit wounds in her lower back and beneath her right shoulder blade where my bullets had penetrated her, and her jeans were soaked with blood, causing them to cling nicely to her perfectly round buttocks.  I raised my pistol and squeezed off a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl made a noise that wasn't quite human, arched her back, then stumbled onward, not even bothering to look in my direction.  Her face remained hidden.  Determined to bring her down without killing her, so that I might gaze upon her unfathomable beauty while it was still animated by life, I pumped two more rounds into her lower back, watching her body jerk with the impact.  Somehow she stayed on her feet, twisting as the rounds punched through her midsection, but refusing to go down.  Lowering my aim, I put a round through each of her thick, powerful thighs, and when at last her legs gave out, she took a terrible spill, but the snow provided a forgiving landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill determined to escape her fate, Julie struggled to rise up yet again.  This time, however, she settled just for rising to her knees.  She shuffled forward a few yards, but I managed to close the gap between her and I, and at last I got a closer look at that fresh, 16 year old face.  That enchanting face, which was, surprisingly, even more beautiful up close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy breath caught in my chest as I forgot how to breathe, knocked flat by the most astounding beauty nature ever concocted.  Her eyes were wide and haunted, her lips shiny with blood, her chin dripping with gore, her color fading, but she was still a spectacular sight to behold.  The girl's pale, waxy, skin glistened with sweat as a result of her massive blood loss, while red the color of roses bloomed high on her cheeks.  In her sensuous blue eyes I could see so much expression and life, even now, as she knocked on death's door.  Facial features flawless beyond description colluded to create an image of both sexuality and innocence that boggled the imagination.  Her body, although ravaged by gun shot wounds, was extraordinary.  Firm, perky breasts peaked upward, and a full form with scintillating curves filled in her figure.  A couple of fresh exit wounds in her abdomen had joined her original gut shot, and were conspiring against her to spill all her life blood into the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie ignored me, and, as if I wasn't there, persisted in her desperate and futile attempt to flee.  I watched, amused and intrigued, as she made her way to the base of another pine, then fell down beside it.  She lifted herself into a sitting position, her back resting against the trunk, and finally looked at me.  As I stared into her eyes, the girl spoke, and her voice was like honey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded coldly.  I always got my target.  \"I did,\" I told her.  But my arrogance was misplaced.  While it was true, I was successful in my mission, I should not have been there, exposing myself.  It was a foolish risk, but one I felt compelled to take.  When would I ever again be in the presence of such astronomical beauty?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I dying?\" she asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded again, cold and uncaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I really don't wanna die,\" she told me quite earnestly.  \"Maybe you could let me go, and I promise I won't tell anyone about any of this.  I never saw nothing, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brushed a lock of bangs, soft as silk, from her face, and caressed her cheek, smooth as velvet.  \"Sorry sweetheart,\" I told her, \"but it's far too late for that.  Your cousin abandoned you, and you're bleeding all over the place.  Even if I left right now you would bleed to death inside half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie just looked at me with hopeless desolation in her eyes, unsure how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, the contract on you is out.  I can't let you go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed my pistol at her chest, and Julie's eyes widened as she realized what I meant to do next.  She raised her hands and squawked, \"wait,\" right before I shot her through the heart.  Then her hands dropped weakly by her sides, her mouth opened and closed as if she was trying to speak, and her eyes squinted as she grappled with her now unavoidable fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the hole between her breasts, with some effort Julie managed to say, \"Fuck.\"  I watched her come to terms with the unthinkable, and when she looked back up at me I could see terrible understanding in her face.  I shot her again through the heart, and she sighed, leaned back against the tree, and blood flowed from the corner of her mouth.  Her eyes lost their focus and stared emptily off into the woods, and I knew she was gone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her heart was jack hammering in her chest, but as the end of the corridor drew near escape seemed inevitable.  One more loop around the corner and she'd be so far gone a blood hound couldn't follow her trail.  She began to relax, and a crazy laugh escaped her lips.  Then everything went horribly wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen feet from safety that ominous popping sound came from somewhere far behind her.  Her crazed laughter was interrupted by painful gasps as her right hip exploded in bright, blinding pain.  Her peripherals picked up something red spraying across the lower quadrant of her vision, and her feet began to betray her.  Another popping sound succinctly followed the first, and the muscles in her left thigh began to clinch up and burn.  More of that bright red substance flashed across her lower peripherals, and Julie had just enough time to register <i>Shot.  I've been shot.</i> before a rapid succession of bullets began to rip apart her torso.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gunfire was swift and deadly accurate.  Seething hot lead found the small of her back, punched through her midriff, rearranging her intestines in the process, and buckets of blood sprayed across the floor in front of her as a trio of slugs exited her belly.  Julie didn't even have time to slink to her knees before three more shots entered her upper back.  One laid waste to her left ventricle and glanced off her breast plate before exiting on the inside of her left breast.  Another punctured her left lung and chipped a rib before it exited above her left nipple, and the third missed her vital organs and exited just beneath her right collar bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShot eight times and swooning on her knees, Julie hugged herself and gawked at the numerous exit wounds in her body, then unceremoniously collapsed face first on the floor.  <i>I\u2019m done for,</i> she thought as she clawed at the ground, still trying to drag her bleeding body to the end of the corridor.  It was hopeless and she knew it, but she still struggled forward, gasping for breath, blood dribbling down her chin, her stunning blue eyes bulging in inexpressible horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t get far before her death throes kicked in.  Kicking at the floor, choking on her own blood, Julie jerked and rattled on the ground, a few feet from the end of the corridor.  Just a few measly feet from potential escape.  A few feet from 60 or 70 years of life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe THC in her system added paranoia to the already unfathomable fear of her own rapidly approaching mortality, and I can\u2019t even begin to describe how horrible those final moments of life were for Julie Huerta.</span></div></div>",

The natives didn't speak her language, and they didn't take prisoners.  The first of the arrows took her square in the gut, and two more quickly followed.  Julie grunted and clutched at two of the shafts buried in her belly, and three more thudded into her back.  This brought her to her knees, and the next two arrows struck pay dirt in her chest.  She slumped to the ground and began writhing in the soil, and everything began to fade as she heard an eagle cawing in the distance.  [i]I'm sorry, mom,[/I] she thought, as she lay dying, and she listened to the eagle's cries.  The sound of the majestic bird washed everything else away, until the dream was gone and the cawing became her beeping alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie yawned and stretched, and remembering her dream she ran a finger gently across her clitorus, moaning softly.  She often dreamed of her bloody demise, and it typically left her hot and bothered, yet it was always such a huge relief to wake up.  <i>Peculiar, that,</i> she thought to herself as she climbed out of bed.  Death was a subject she pondered often, particularly since her brother's premature end, and it scared her.  She found it difficult to believe in a benevolent god when her brother had met such a horrible and unjust fate, and the thought of eternal non-existence was bone-chilling.  Still, it fueled her libido in strange ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlinging open her closet, Julie paused to admire her reflection as she did each morning.  She knew she was beautiful - everybody told her so - and she saw no shame in taking pleasure in that.  Her dark brown hair lie tussled around her shoulders, her blue eyes sparkled amid her round, creamy cheeks, her pink lush lips played at half a smile, and her soft, young, full-figured body gave definition to her pajamas in all the right places.  It was a good day to be alive.</span></div></div>",

They were discussing the Shakespearian classic, Romeo and Juliet, which always got a rise out of Julie as her namesake met her bitter demise at the end, and Julie sat next to Vicky, who was sharp with her wit and never failed to keep Julie in stitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you'd like to live back in those times?\" Vicky asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had been flying by, and there was now less than ten minutes before the bell would sound and class would end.  Mrs. Jean had finished her lecture and allowed them that time to finish their classwork.  Julie wrinkled her nose.  \"No way.

She couldn't stay in a classroom with three mad gunmen, she just couldn't.  She'd go out of her head with terror.  So instead she bolted for the door, hoping to catch the bastards off guard and escape before they knew what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt a was poorly thought out plan, doomed from the start.  Julie was quick, but the gunmen were prepared and possibly even anticipating just such a move.  Julie was only a few steps away from her desk when she caught the first round.  It struck her below her right breast and she felt a tightening in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple steps later she was met with two more rounds, so close together they struck her nearly simultaneously.  One pierced her right nipple and the second burned into her abdomen.  Julie barely slowed and in no time she slipped past the first of the gunmen.  <i>Halfway there,</i> she told herself, but a voice inside her was screaming that she was dying.  <i>Never mind that, just keep running.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo bullets punched into her back, courtesy of the bastard she had passed, and she caught a couple more in her left breast and left shoulder.  Her legs felt like they were made of rubber, but still they carried her past the second gunman.  The third was off to her right and the exit was straight ahead, a mere ten feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bullet entered the right side of her stomach, and another smashed through the right side of her rib cage.  Julie stumbled and felt herself going down, but caught her balance at the last possible moment and staggered on.  The exit was right in front of her, almost close enough to touch, when four more shots struck her in the back, two low and two high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie fell forward against the door and her fingers fumbled at the handle, but she found she lacked the strength and coordination to open it.  Instead she pushed herself off and turned around to face her killers.  An onslaught of bullets came then, fast and furious, with round after round punching through her torso until she had been riddled with a total of twenty-six shots. Still on her feet, her back to the door, Julie slowly slid down to a sitting position.  <i>Well this was dumb.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard some of the horrified screams of her classmates, and saw the thunderstruck look on Vicky's face, but none of them knew what horror was.  Until they had been shot twenty-six times and sat dying in a pool of their own blood, they had no idea.  Julie had another twenty seconds with her thoughts before she passed away into nothingness, and she found nothing to console her.</span></div></div>",

Julie resisted an impulse to bolt for the door, and saw that Billy, one of the more popular boys in school, was not so disciplined.  He was up almost before the silver-haired man finished his sentence, and a cascade of gunfire from all three men stopped him cold.  There were gasps and screams as the boy fell, and Julie was reminded of her brother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There is no God,</i> she thought to herself as she watched Billy spasm and bleed out on the floor.  Even with a plethora of bullet wounds, including what appeared to be a head wound, he did not go easily.  Dying was hard, and not something you did quietly.  At least that had been Julie's experience.  It was the same with her brother, lying broken and bleeding in the street all those years ago, crushed by a suburban for no reason at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky turned her head and puked, and so did Sam.  Not long after, Jessica tossed her cookies.  Meanwhile Billy was still in his death throes.  The men were speaking, telling everyone to calm down and as long as nobody else tried anything, there was no need for anymore bloodshed, but Julie wondered how many of her peers were hearing them.  Looking around, most of them appeared to be in a daze.  <i>This is madness.</i>  Feeling helpless, Julie offered up a prayer to a deity in which she didn't really believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, if you're real, please, just help me get through this.  Don't let me die here today, and I promise, I'll do some real soul searching.  I'll go to church more often.  I'll pray more often.  I'll try to find the faith I lost.  Just don't let me die.</i>  It occurred to her that if God was real she would have nothing to fear anyway, and He was unlikely to grant half-assed prayers, but still it helped her to calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm going to live,</i> she thought, deciding to stay calm and wait patiently in her seat.  If an opportunity presented itself, she'd be ready.</span></div></div>",

The girls on the court battled for position, scarcely hearing the roaring chants of 'defense', and 'let's go Cardinals' cascading from the crowd.  The air in the stadium seemed to pulse with a life all its own, an electricity flowing between the spectators and the participants locked in grim competition.  The district championship was on the line, and a conclusion to the contest was fast approaching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her dribble, Erika was trapped by a double team.  Julie broke to the top of the key, cutting at such an angle that Erika was able to slip the ball past the harassing defense, into her awaiting and very capable hands.  The double team followed, almost instantly smothering her with suffocating defense, but Julie threw a head fake, suckering the opposing two guard into leaving her feet.  She launched herself at the leaping defender, creating contact, then hung in the air long enough to regain her balance and released a perfect shot.  The ball bounced off the back of the rim on its downward arc, dropping through the net with a sweeter sound than the most practiced orchestra could ever hope to produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whistle blew and the ref signaled for a defensive foul.  Julie pumped her fist, gave a few high fives to her teammates, and strode to the free throw line with an air of confidence that was chilling.  Drawing a deep breath, Julie's steely, cool blue eyes focused on the rim, blotting out all her surroundings.  In her mind, she was back in her driveway knocking down free throws, easy as shooting fish in a barrel.  Countless hours of practice paid dividends as she raised the ball and stroked it flawlessly through the net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><div align=\"center\">13:44<br>\r\nHome 57             <br>\r\nVisitor 58</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither team had any timeouts remaining, so Julie galloped down the court to D up.  Number twenty-five, the lightning quick small-forward she was saddled with guarding, caught a pass mid court and dribbled towards her, weaving ever so slightly left to right, then left again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offense spread out, running an isolation attack, leaving the lane open.  The only thing between number twenty-five and the basket was Julie.  A fake to the left, where Julie was leaning, followed by a dazzling cross over dribble, left Julie in her opponent's wake.  Turning on her heels and hustling like hell, Julie struggled to make up ground, but it was hopeless.  She was beat.  As she gave chase, number twenty-five went up for a layup and Julie leapt with everything she had, knowing it was too late, knowing just as well that she had to try.  Swatting at the ball, certain she would miss, she surprised even herself as the tips of her fingers made contact with rubber, and the altered shot bounced harmlessly off the backboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came back down to earth she spun around, trying to locate the ball, and saw that Teresa had already claimed the rebound.  Her 6'2\" teammate hunched over, protectively wrapping both arms around the rock, and the buzzer sounded.  Stunned, the crowd fell silent, and Julie felt a surge of triumph coursing through her body, blotting out rational thought.  In that moment, she was a rock star, the biggest sensation since the Beatles.  Her team mauled her, whooping and hollering.  It was pandemonium, and every Parker girl felt a high that is nearly impossible to articulate with any words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was over; the Parker Bulldogs were district champs, and Julie couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mariah Carrey belted out hit after hit from the confines of Erika's boom box, helped along by Julie's badly out of tune but enthusiastic Soprano voice.  Her pitchy lyrics were masked amid a myriad of other equally unharmonious voices.  The atmosphere was euphoric, everyone laughing and in good cheer.  Julie had thought the elation would subside, but on the contrary it only seemed to intensify.  This was the best she'd ever felt in her life, even better than when her parents built a basketball court in the backyard for Christmas, better than being kissed by Omar Sifuentes in the schoolyard back in seventh grade, better than the first time she discovered her sexual organ and the orgasms it could produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had only been on the road for less than an hour, and that evening's events had replayed in her mind countless times.  Her break to the top of the key, her foul drawing jumper sinking like a dagger, her cool as ice free throw, her game saving block.  All this on top of seventeen total points, eight assists, two steals, and five rebounds.  It was a heroic tale of triumph with which she would undoubtedly regale her children, her children's children, and, God willing, her children's children's children for seventy or eighty years to come.  Her heart swelled with pride as she anticipated how her parents would receive the news, and how she would share the story with just the right amount of humility when the subject presented itself at school.  All this passed through her head as she belted out the chorus to Always Be My Baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the third and final set of do do doop do do doop do doop da dum's when the evening took a turn for the south. A God awful noise rose from the floor of the bus, and the entire vehicle shook as though the smooth blacktop upon which they were travelling had suddenly turned to rubble. Mariah missed her line as the CD skipped, but no one noticed. There were some screams, some horrified faces, but no more gleeful singing. The bus fishtailed, then entered into a skid. While girls around her panicked, Julie braced herself for the impact of the bus tipping onto its side, which judging by the inertia tugging at the roof was now unavoidable. The sounds from below, first of rubber shredding as the tires came apart, then of metal grinding against pavement, assaulted Julie's ear drums, drowning out the panicked shrieks of her teammates. Just when it seemed they would roll, somehow the vehicle righted itself and the driver, a square little man named Mario with greasy black hair, a walrus mustache, and a raspy voice that was the product of twenty six years of heavy smoking, was able to grind to a halt on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fucking shit,\" Erika breathed. \"What the fuck was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked at her friend and busted up laughing. \"Oh my God, you almost shit your pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did fucking shit my pants,\u201d Erika shot back, which sent Julie into a fit of hysteria that neared delirium.  Chuckling mildly in comparison, Erika asked, \u201cweren\u2019t you scared?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling too hard to respond, Julie only shook her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit, you lying bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting herself under control, Julie answered earnestly, \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t scared, I was more worried about someone getting hurt so they couldn\u2019t play in State.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fuck dude, that would fucking suck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround that time Coach Lopez started making her way down the aisle, and when she asked Julie and Erika if they were alright they told her they were.  A lot of the girls were a little shell shocked, but no one seemed to be harmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so listen up,\" Coach called to them.  \"We blew out our tires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them?\" Teresa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario's checking it out, but it looks like we're going to have to wait here for another bus to come pick us up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" Lori, the back up point guard, chimed in sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need for you all to just relax, take it easy, and stay on the bus.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some unenthusiastic replies of, \"okay,\" but Julie wasn't too put off by the whole ordeal.  She was among friends, and they could laugh, tell jokes, gossip, and just be teenagers.  It would be like a big slumber party.  The only problem she could see was that her bladder chose this particular time to act up, and there wasn't a bathroom around for at least forty miles.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before finding a bush at which she could conceal herself from the freeway traffic, Julie paused to examine the front passenger tires.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, those fuckers are shredded.\"  Squatting down, she peered beneath the undercarriage and immediately saw that all the tires had suffered a similar fate.  She let out a small whistle and rose up from her haunches.  It was hard to imagine what could have done such damage.  Some broken glass would leave small punctures and a slow leak, a dead animal or tire tread might cause one blow out, but those things could not account for what she saw here.  It was no wonder Mario was on edge.  These were the thoughts that weighed on her mind as a black Chevrolet cargo van rolled to a stop behind the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that puzzlement and slight unease gave way to genuine apprehensiveness.  A knot churned in her stomach as her imagination played with infinite scenarios of doom and gloom involving road side trouble and a menacing black van.  The sun had set more than twenty minutes ago and the world was cast in a gray dye, so Julie slipped in front of the bus with the hope that she had not been spotted.  From relative cover she watched as the doors opened and masked men armed with assault rifles filed out of the vehicle.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Fuck, this can't be happening!</i> Julie thought as she turned on her heels and pounded down the highway.  The blood was pumping vigorously through her veins, and the fear and the rush of adrenaline made her feel fantastically alive, more so than ever before.  The irony of unprecedented liveliness while so dangerously close to death struck her funny bone, and she chortled as her feet carried her across the pavement as wings carry a bird.  It occurred to her that at some point she would need to venture off the shoulder, scramble through the brush that bordered the highway, and make her way into the surrounding desert, which was guarded by a three foot high barbed-wire fence, but for now she chose to stick to the road and put as much distance as possible between herself and the armed men.  This also gave her the hope of encountering a passing vehicle and possibly flagging down help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Julie estimated the bus was seventy or eighty yards behind her, she made the decision to change her angle, and it was at this time that she heard the sound of an approaching engine.  Her gut reaction was that it was them, the assault-rifle-toting-thugs chasing her down, but she had been listening closely for the closing of car doors, and had heard nothing.  It would defy logic for them to be driving after her with all the vehicle's doors wide open, but this entire scenario defied logic.  Things like this just weren't supposed to happen.  She looked over her shoulder for the first time since she started running, half expecting to see half a dozen barrels baring down on her, but instead what she saw inspired hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA '93 Nissan Altima slowed as it drew near, and Julie could spot the family inside.  Two kids in the back, a horrified young woman in the passenger seat, and a concerned young man piloting the vehicle.  Thrilled by this incredible stroke of luck, Julie cried out and waved both hands excitedly above her head.  The driver continued to brake as he pulled up alongside her, and the woman popped open her door and motioned for Julie to climb aboard.  Overcome with relief, Julie seized the invitation, placing her hand on the open car door to steady herself as she prepared to leap into the woman's lap.  Neither Julie nor the Nissan slowed to a complete halt, perhaps because both she and this man, who selflessly chose to put his family at risk to secure her safety, saw prudence in remaining on the move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of their tactfulness, disaster struck before Julie could make the final leap into this strange man's car.  Gun fire erupted behind her, and a trio of rounds punched through her left thigh.  A fourth found her left buttock and exited the front of her shapely hip.  Julie squawked and stumbled, her hand slipping off the door to clutch at her wounds.  Bullets continued to pepper the air around her, whining aimlessly off the pavement, crimping metal and busting glass in the good Samaritan\u2019s car.  It became evident that this was more excitement than the helpful stranger had bargained for, and she saw his tail light explode in a shower of glass and plastic as he accelerated, leaving her behind to fend for herself against this violent barrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d she cried, futilely struggling to keep pace as the car sped away.  It was incredibly disheartening, almost maddening, to come so close to safety whilst watching it slip away at the last possible second.  Perhaps screaming in excitement had been a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparing a second glance over her shoulder, Julie saw that five men gave chase, all with their guns blazing, and now that the Nissan was no longer present to draw their fire the fusillade focused entirely on her vulnerable teenage body.  With her torso twisted to see what she was up against, a bullet punched into the lower left side of her back, traversed her body laterally while tearing  mercilessly through her intestines, and popped out the right side of her lower abdomen.  Meanwhile another bullet slashed through her left bicep, down near her elbow.  Julie turned her back to the gunmen and resumed her attempt to flee, albeit with much less vigor than previously endowed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first step was accompanied by a bullet slicing through the far right side of her midsection, her second by a pair of bullets striking her, one up near her left shoulder and the second sliding under her left collar bone. Undeterred, Julie pressed onward. She managed only a couple more steps before a burst of four rounds caught her in the small of her back, all four shots leaving exit wounds within an inch and a half of her navel. Her back arched with the impact, then she dropped to her knees. Immediately she searched for the strength to rise to her feet and continue her flight, but she was on her knees for less than a second before another burst of three rounds ripped through the right side of her chest, two exiting from her perky breast and the third exiting just above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the extensive damage she had sustained, Julie thought <i>I'm not gonna be able to play in state,</i> and on the heels of that, <i>so much for outrunning these guys</i>.  As she examined her exit wounds she saw a pair of bullets punch their way out of the left side of her chest, one through her nipple and one below her breast, and a third shot slipped into her back just above her right buttock and exited her groin.  Overwhelmed by her wounds, she collapsed face first in the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to accept the inevitable, Julie pulled herself stubbornly forward on her elbows.  It wasn't long before one of the masked men caught up to her, and upon doing so he callously nudged her in the side with his boot, turning her onto her back.  It was a treatment better suited for an unruly dog, but Julie hardly noticed.  What was a little kick in the ribs when you had been shot nineteen times?  The man peered down at her from behind his mask while Julie spit up blood, struggling to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her,\" he called out, and Julie watched as a second masked man joined him, pulled a photograph from his pocket, and compared her to the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, it's her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we can save her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you shitting me?  Look at her, she's shot to pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, I can't believe we fucking fragged the fucking cow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not... a cow,\" Julie told them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men turned away from her and left her to die.  A minute or two passed with Julie writhing in agony, but she heard no more shots fired, and as she lay in a growing pool of her own blood, she saw the black van drive past her and speed off down the highway.  After another minute or so, Coach came running over to her, Erika following close behind.  They were both speechless as they kneeled down beside her, Erika on one side and Coach on the other.  Julie could read their faces like a teleprompter, and there were no disillusions among any of them.  Julie was toast, and everybody knew it.  \"Hi,\" she said, doing her best to sound upbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jules,\" Erika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie lifted her head to look at herself, and appalled by what she saw, she laid back down and rolled her eyes.  \"They got me, Erika.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sshhhh, just relax, Jules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not... gon... play in state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika chuckled softly.  \"Yeah, you're gonna be in the hospital for a while, but don't worry about that.  We'll win the championship for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lying b... bitch.  I'm go... I'ma... goner.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... fffff... <i>fucking</i> shot to shit.  Oh God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just hang in there, Julie.  You fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... scared, Erika.  I... wa... wannnn... wanna go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna go home.  You're gonna be okay.  It's gonna be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGouts of blood began to pour from Julie's nose and mouth, and it became nearly impossible for her to breathe.  Her body tensed in one final rebellion against the mortality that threatened it, before at last succumbing to death.  Her eyes stared emptily up into the night, and she was gone.</span></div></div>",

Masked men with guns were running alongside the bus, and Julie watched as two of them met at the door and rushed on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill standing in the aisle next to Mario, Julie met these two armed men at the head of the vehicle, and to her astonishment, they called her by name, \"Are you Julie Huerta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, how do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to come with us.\"</span></div></div>",

Her parents weren't rich.  Nothing could be gained from kidnapping her.  Her thoughts went instantly to rape and murder, but they knew her name.  They had come specifically for her, and this had the air of a professional operation.  It was all too elaborate for a gang of rapists or backwoods yokel serial killers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll be a team player.\"  Summoning every ounce of courage she had, Julie smiled nervously at her teammates, then stepped off the bus in the company of these masked thugs.  \"You're not gonna kill me, are you?\" she asked once she was out of the confines of the vehicle, where her friends could not hear the fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you cooperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do anything you say,\" she assured them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey led her back down the highway, to a black van parked behind the bus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie climbed into the back of the van as instructed, where a man was waiting for her with a rag doused in chloroform.  Despite her earlier promise of cooperation, Julie struggled, but she was easily overpowered and quickly succumbed to the drug's anesthetic properties.  <i>Oh God, what's happening to me?</i> she thought just before blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her consciousness returned, the first thing Julie saw was a lovely girl kneeling over her.  Her head was throbbing, it was impossible to tell how much time had elapsed, and her surroundings were completely unfamiliar, but this girl beamed at her and Julie felt strangely reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake,\" the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I am,\" Julie answered, unable to resist a shy smile of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the fuck are we, Lola?\" Julie rubbed her head, and looking around she could see they were in a cell.  Several more girls stood behind Lola, each more <br>\r\nbeautiful than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guess is as good as mine, but my money's on Montana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Montana?  Why the fuck would we be in Montana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicki there says they're going to hunt us.  Says she heard them talking about it.\"  Lola looked to a hard-bodied blonde, who couldn't have been a day over sixteen.  Acne littered her cheeks, but rather than detract from her beauty it seemed to add to it, giving her face color and character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunt us?\" Julie asked, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right, like we're a bunch of fucking wild animals or something.\" Vicki said miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense.  Who's going to hunt us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guys holding us here, who else?\" Lola said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're a bunch of sick fucks.\"  A fresh-faced brunette spoke up, and then identified herself, \"My name's Alicia.\"  Alicia had an angelic countenance, muscular legs and a relatively flat chest, and she appeared slightly older than her companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not really gonna hunt us with guns,\" a raven-haired beauty with a body full of curves chimed in.  Her voice was light and care-free, as if she was untouched by the precariousness of their situation.  \"It's probably just some sick joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no joke, but they might not use guns.  They might use bows.  They talked about how many arrows a girl took before going down.  One of the girls they hunted before.\"  Vicki again, adding her insights to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" the black-haired beauty retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna be first, Isamar.  They're gonna gut you like a fish.\"  Vicki catted back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsamar, the girl with the black hair, looked down at her bare belly and cringed, as if considering the idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off,\" Alicia told Vicki, and although Vicki grinned without contrition, she said nothing further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know who\u2019s holding us here?\u201d Julie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few of them have visited us a couple times, but they don\u2019t say much,\u201d Lola said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia chuckled humorlessly.  \u201cYeah, they just sit there and pull their meat,\u201d she remarked as she gestured towards the room on the other side of the bars.  There were a few cushy chairs, a fridge, a sofa, and little else.  Still, it was well furnished in comparison to the cell the girls occupied.  They had a toilet in one corner and a shower head with a drain beneath it in another.  There was a small shelf with a bar of soap near the shower, but neither installment had walls to provide privacy.  That was the extent of their furnishings - no beds, no chairs, no cots, not even a ledge upon which to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been here?\" Julie inquired, wondering if they slept on the floor, and how intimately acquainted they had become given their facilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicki's been here a week now.  I was brought in five days ago, Alicia three days ago, and Izzy got here yesterday,\" Lola informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They knew my name,\" Julie told them.  \"They popped the tires on our bus, a bunch of guys with machine guns.  They said they just wanted me, and they let everyone else go.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could see why,\" Lola said.  Julie looked at her with a quizzical expression, and Lola clarified, \"you're beautiful.  I mean, I'm not gay, but if I was I would totally fuck you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie grinned sheepishly.  \"Thanks.  I've really gotta take a piss.  You're not gonna watch me or anything weird like that, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola laughed.  \"Be my guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie only spent one night in the cell.  The next morning she got a good look at her captors, and she learned more about their intentions.  Her sleep had been restless and unfulfilling, plagued by anxious nightmares and the poor cushioning of the stone floor, and she awoke to see a group of five men, none of them younger than thirty, escorting another beautiful young woman to their humble cell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up bitches,\u201d a stocky man with thin gray hair and a salt and pepper mustache called jovially.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl they brought with them was conscious and crying, and Julie thought hers was a subtle beauty.  She was not the kind of girl that made jaws drop, but her face was soft and fair, her eyes a deep hazel brown and behind her tears was a glimmer of sweetness, and her body was feminine and shapely, while not overtly voluptuous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hunt Day!\u201d Salt and Pepper informed them.  \u201cFive of you will be turned loose in the wilderness, and you will have a full day\u2019s head start to run for your lives.  But as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve  noticed, we\u2019ve brought in Jessica, which makes six does.  One of you will have to be slaughtered\u2026 pre-hunt.  So, to see who the lucky winner is, we\u2019re going to draw straws.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up,\" Isamar told him, apparently still in denial of her dire predicament.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be happy to forego the straw drawing if you'd like to volunteer, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As much as she disliked the idea of drawing straws for a chance at being butchered, she was torn.  With the possible exception of Lola, this girl Isamar was the sweetest of the bunch - so far as Julie could tell she didn't have a single mean bone in her body.  Standing aside while she volunteered for whatever cruel fate these bastards intended was more than she could bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isamar, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie,\" Vicki whispered harshly, but Julie ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't wanna do this.

She knew even before Salt and Pepper opened his hand to show her the remaining straws that she had chosen poorly.  \"No fucking way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.

There was a door not thirty yards away, and she could only hope it was unlocked.  She was nearly halfway there when she felt the shaft of an arrow slide through her guts.  She stumbled slightly, but hardly faltered.  Her resolve was strong, and she continued running at a steady clip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had closed the gap to ten feet when a second arrow pierced her left thigh.  This brought her gait to an abrupt halt, as she hobbled and reached for her wounded leg.  Glancing back, Julie saw the hulking bastard nocking a third arrow, so she squealed and limped onward.  A few feet from the door the arrow caught up with her, punching through the middle of her back until the tip protruded from her upper abdomen.  She arched her back but remained on her feet, staggering the final few steps to the door she had fought so desperately to reach.  Of course now it was pointless.  Even if it was unlocked, how far would she get with a couple of arrows though her tummy and another through her thigh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she grasped the door handle and pulled down, there was a click and a blast of fresh air as the hinges swung outward.  It was more a kick in the teeth than anything, knowing that it had been open the whole time.  If only she had made it here sooner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stepped outside and into a clearing of about fifty feet.  Beyond that, trees.  </span></div></div>",

She weaved to the left to remove herself from the line of fire, at least until the archer made it outside, and again she was nearly halfway to her goal when she was shot with another arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the projectile entered her body above the left buttock and poked through the lower left side of her midsection.  Julie grunted but didn't waver.  She moved doggedly forward, much the same as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter came from behind her, and she heard someone say,\"Tough little bitch, ain't she?\"  Julie took a sick sense of pride in that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice said, \"Take out her legs, Darren,\"and ten steps later Darren obliged with an arrow through Julie's left calf.  That leg now stiff and sore, putting any sort of pressure on it was far too painful, so Julie hopped along on her one good leg.  Before long an arrow punctured her right thigh, and Julie sunk to her knees.  The forest-line was a mere eight feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, this can't be happening,\" she murmured to herself.  After a valiant attempt to get her feet back underneath herself was unsuccessful, Julie settled for shuffling forward on her knees.  Part of her knew her continued flight was madness; her death was inescapable at this point, but a larger part of her refused to give up.  Dying was just not an option.  She was able to reach out and touch the first of the beech woods when the tip of an arrow emerged from her pert right breast, dripping with her blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie sighed and collapsed against the tree, blood now bubbling over her lips from her punctured lung.  She looked up to see that only two of her captors had bothered to pursue her.  The rest apparently waited by the cell.  \"I should have let you kill Isamar,\" she told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to go back inside now, or do you want another arrow in you?\" the big man asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens when we get back inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll open up your belly and show you your insides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie grimaced, \"I think I'd rather have another arrow in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the brute told her, drawing another arrow from his quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie whimpered and crawled beyond the tree line, but only managed to cover a few feet before an arrow slipped into her right buttock.  She rared up and felt steely fingers lock under her armpits.  \"No,\" she whispered, knowing that the gig was up.  There would not be another chance to escape.  She was carried back to the complex by the tandem that had pursued her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was back in front of the cell, where the rest of the girls were still being held, the man with the salt and pepper hair began speaking.  She didn't know what he was saying - all she could think about was the over-sized archer telling her they were going to open up her belly and show her her insides.  When Salt-and-Pepper stopped talking, that's just what they did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll call your bluff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie bit her tongue and watched as Isamar was escorted out of their cell, one man gripping each of her arms.  It was then that they noticed one of the men, a stout, bulking thing, had a bow slung over his broad back and a quiver of arrows on his hip.  He readied the bow and nocked an arrow as Salt and Pepper explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, Brandon is going to demonstrate how we will bring you down.  We use target tips on our arrows, so they do minimal damage as they pierce your tender young bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men restraining Isamar let her go, and she gave them each a sour look before straightening out her shirt.  \"Shoot me then, asshole,\" she said defiantly, and Brandon did just that.  The arrow passed neatly through her midsection, the tip jutting from the small of her back, and Izzy looked at it with a quizzical expression.  \"Oh shit.\"  She glanced at her comrades in their cell.  \"They really shot me.\"  Belatedly, she turned to run, and she made it nearly ten yards before a second arrow pierced her left thigh.  She stumbled and fell to her knees, clutching at her wounded leg, and a third arrow slipped into her back and poked through the front of her right tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men who had held her by the arms earlier went to her and drug her back to the front of the cell, where Julie and her fellow prisoners could get a good look at her.  \"As you can see,\" explained Salt and Pepper, \"our prey is mortally wounded, but still has her faculties about her.  The arrows have not spilled much of her blood.\"  Blood trickled from each of Isamar's wounds, standing out brightly against her white crop top and white jeans, and a bit more spilled over her lush lips, but it wasn't as messy as Julie might have expected.  \"It's not uncommon for some girls to take upwards of ten arrows before finally falling.  Given a chance, Isamar here would likely have continued her flight.  Alas, for this demonstration we will have to move on.  Once our prey is captured, we disembowel them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy's big brown eyes widened, and she pleaded, \"No, wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnmoved, the big man with the bow unsheathed a hunting knife from his belt and slid it into the wounded girl's midriff.  With some effort he worked the blade through her belly, from right to left, until he had left a sizeable curved slit below her navel.  Then he reached inside her and pulled out a steaming pile of guts.  Izzy watched this all unfold with stunned disbelief, and Jessi, the newcomer, turned her head and puked.  \"She can survive for a surprising amount of time with her intestines on the outside of her body, if she doesn't succumb to shock.  Most of the time our prey bleeds out within fifteen to twenty minutes, but some last longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they all watched the spectacle of Isamar dying, with some of the men jerking off in front of her.  She begged and pleaded with them all, assuring them that she just needed a doctor and everything would be fine, but it was all for naught.  In the end Salt and Pepper told them she held on for thirty-two minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that you all know what's in store for you, you're free to go.  The exit's at the end of that hall, and the door is unlocked.\"  Salt and Pepper gestured down the hallway through which Isamar had fled.  He opened the cell and told them they had a two hour head start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her soft hair lie fanned out beneath her interlocked hands and her swelling breasts heaved softly beneath her blouse.  Tom lay next to her, admiring her perfection, and wrestled with battling emotions.  Part of him wanted to jump on top of her and fuck her brains out - Julie had a way of doing that to you - and part of him was drowning in love for her.  But it wasn't like the love he felt for Debbie, which was more of a romantic breed.  It was a familiarity and kinship that he felt all the way to the core of his being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most people are just bastards, Julie,\" Tom said quietly.  \"Everything they do is a lie.\"  Julie could see the understanding and the love in his eyes, and she loved him back.  She considered herself very lucky to have a friend like him, in whom she could confide her deepest, darkest secrets without any fear of judgemental reprisals.  Without any fear of gossip.  One thing at which Tom excelled was keeping his mouth shut.  Gossip held no interest for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled at him.  \"Why are you so bad ass, Tom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people are just bad ass, Julie.  Everything they do drips of bad assery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie giggled and planted a kiss on Tom's forehead.  Tom had to steel himself against the raging fire burning in his loins.  He took a drag on his blunt and a swig of his beer to ease the pain.  \"You really shouldn't flirt with me like that, Jules.  One of these days I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it motherfucker and I'll rip your fucking balls off and feed them to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinky.

Julie, not missing a beat, reached out and twisted Tom's nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" Tom cried, slapping Julie's hand away.  \"Goddammit Julie, learn anatomy and shit.  Those aren't my balls.\"  He hopped off her as she giggled at him.

Behind the counter, bucking the stereotype of the scrawny kid with bad acne who asks if you \"want fries with that\", was a rather handsome, muscular young man, clean cut and shaven, with cool, steely eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, bored and uninterested, but his deep brown eyes glimmered with life when Julie approached. Julie was used to eliciting this type of response from boys. She tried to be humble, but she was constantly reminded how beautiful she was every time she went out in public. Guys were always thinking with their peckers, the poor bastards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How may I help you?\" he asked, smiling warmly at Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom ordered a double quarter pounder with cheese value meal, and Julie ordered the McChicken, all the while pretending not to notice the attractive cashier's ogling stare. Most girls her age would be drooling all over themselves if this hunk of a guy was eye fucking them, but most girls her age were clueless. Julie wasn't so easily impressed. It took more than a handsome face and rippling muscles to woo her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking her order the guy tried his hand at small talk. \"Do you go to Mesa?\" he asked her, pretending to be aloof. Julie played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I go to Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker? Do you know Erika Calvillo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's good.</i>  \"Yeah,\" she said, ignoring the vibes the guy was sending her, encouraging her to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on the basketball team, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's really good.</i> Still refusing to take the bait, again Julie's only reply was \"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing onward in the face of adversity, the cashier continued, \"That Erika chick's crazy. You guys hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We used to, but not so much anymore.\" Julie realized she was shutting down all his avenues of conversation, but she didn't care. The discussion wasn't going anywhere that piqued her interests.  \"Don't you have work to do, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunky guy seemed to get the hint, and she could almost hear his ego deflating as he accepted defeat. \"You guys have a good team,\" he told her lamely, and then moved on to the heat lamps that separated the front counter from the grilling area. It was late, and there were no other customers waiting for service, so to avoid the awkward situation Julie created the cashier struck up a conversation with one of the cooks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch, that was harsh,\" Tom said, stifling a bit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled at him, \"Well, fuck it. I don't know him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier turned to face them and called to Julie, \"It's gonna be like five minutes for your McChicken, 'cause he has to make 'em. Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's fine,\" Julie answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're gonna fuck with your food, you know that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, they better not. I'll get their fucking asses fired,\" Julie retorted, hoping her voice was loud enough to carry to the Casanova cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom just smiled at her.  He had no doubt Julie would make a scene if it came down to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair sat down at a table near the counter to wait for their food. On the way to his chair Tom grabbed a newspaper from the condiments stand, and on the front page, in large bold letters, was the headline: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">SERIAL KILLER STRIKES AGAIN, STILL AT LARGE</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom browsed through the article, then pointed it out to Julie. \"This shit is fucking crazy,\" he told her.  \"Motherfucker got another one.  Maybe you're next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie kicked him in the shin.  \"That's not funny, asshole.\"  Julie had spent more time than she'd like to admit contemplating that very possibility.  The psychopath was going around slaughtering attractive young women all across El Paso, and the murders were always bloody, and always brutal. The killer had been evading the police for over a year now, and it seemed everyone had a theory about his identity, but each was just as good as the next. The thought of Julie's name showing up in one of those articles made her shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I'm sorry.  The good news is, you have better odds of winning the lotto than getting murdered by a serial killer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think happens when you die?\" Julie asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked at her and raised an eyebrow. \"You're quite the philosophizer tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie giggled, but Tom could see she wanted a real response. He sighed before beginning, \"I think deep down people know what happens, they just don't want to accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Julie asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean we've all been dead before. Remember what it was like before you were born?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't exist before I was born, how could I remember that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, my point exactly. You weren't alive, and you won't be alive after you die, so that's what it'll be like... Except you won't have life to look forward to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie didn't like the thought of that, being erased from existence, it was perhaps even more terrifying than spending an eternity in Hell. \"So you don't believe in Heaven and Hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom scoffed at her. \"There's so many things wrong with that idea, I don't even know where to begin. But let me ask you this. All your thoughts, your memories, your hopes, your dreams, your feelings, your fears and emotions, all of it, is just information stored and processed in your brain. How do you propose to go on thinking and remembering and dreaming once your brain shuts down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie shrugged. \"Maybe we have a soul that lives on, even after our brain dies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if your life force moves on, it won't really be you. All your memories and knowledge will be gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran down Julie's spine as she considered what Tom was telling her.  \"That's pretty terrifying, but I guess maybe you're right.  I just... I'd really like to see Chuckie again, you know?  I miss him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom reached out and took her hand.  \"I know.  I miss him too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's never die, Tom.  Let's just live forever, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not how long you live that counts, it's how much fun you have while doing it.  Besides, forever?  Might get boring.\"  Beeping emitted from amidst the sounds of boiling grease and rising steam in the kitchen, and Tom pointed his harsh blue eyes in that direction. \"I think your chicken's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie watched the cook pull a basket of breaded chicken patties out of a vat of boiling hot grease. She kept a keen eye on him as he threw some mayo, lettuce, and tomato on a bun, then slapped one of the patties on it and wrapped it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he hold the spit?\" Tom asked her, amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Julie answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom picked up the tray of food from the counter and sat down. There wasn't much chatter between them as they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need another beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of neglected bites of chicken and a few straggling fries were resting unattended on Julie's tray. She was slurping the last bit of coke through her straw, and she nodded at Tom. \"Sure. Let's bounce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling adventurous, Julie wasn't quite ready to call it a night. \"You wanna try getting into a club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm down. The bouncer over at Felini's is a customer of mine. He'll let us in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA towering man of at least six and a half feet and weighing no less than two hundred and fifty pounds smiled at Tom as he approached. \"Tomas, my little nigga, how the fuck are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom slapped the giant's hand, palms sliding back until their knuckles gripped, then banged fists, the hip version of the hand shake. \"How's it hangin' bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down around my ankles.\" They smiled knowingly at each other, and the giant stepped aside, raising his right arm toward the entrance in a welcoming gesture. \"Go on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tiny. I'ma get fucked up tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it to it, white boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie followed Tom into a swarming mob of twenty something's, most of them standing around trying to talk over the thumping beats of Sublime's <i>What I Got</i>, others bobbing their heads and moving to the music, while still others were brushing past each other, on their way to their table, to the dance floor, to the bar, or to the restroom. Different colored lights flashed brightly overhead, but the club still managed to look dim and seedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom pushed his way to the bar, Julie close in tow behind him, and slapped a twenty down on the counter. In no time at all a tall, serious looking fellow leaned over to take Tom's order. After handing him a tall bottle of Budweiser and a cup filled to the brim with a colorful concoction of liquor and sweetening, of which Julie was certain she would soon be indulging, the bartender snatched up the twenty, thanked Tom, and turned his attention to one of the other dozens of patrons patiently awaiting his services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get a table,\" Tom shouted above the roar of the crowd and music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded, and again followed Tom through the horde of party-goers. The bar and the restrooms were on the eastern side of the club, the tables and booths on the west, and in between them was the dance floor. Plowing through bodies while trying to remain cordial, Tom and Julie made their way through the club. Circling the center stage, where drunkards and dance fiends alike shook what Mother Nature gave them, Tom apparently caught sight of an acquaintance of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy!\" Tom began to bull his way in a new direction, calling to his friend. \"Sam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching for recognition on a guy's face, Julie scanned the crowd, but as it turned out, Sammy was a woman. A blonde who appeared to be in her early twenties smiled at Tom and raised a hand, waving emphatically. Tom smiled back, raised a hand in return, and continued in her direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two embraced, smiling and exchanging salutations. Then Tom intoduced Julie to his friend, and Julie blushed a bit as the bouncy blonde took her in her arms and hugged her warmly. \"We're gonna get a table. Come sit with us,\" Tom shouted to Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here with Liz and Adan, follow me.\" Now Sam led the way as they once again parted through the crowd. Back in a booth sat a tubby, unattractive young woman with her arms around a slender, unattractive young man. They both smiled politely and shook hands with Julie and Tom as they were introduced, but they seemed to be lost in each other's charms, barely aware of the world around them. Julie thought it must be a wonderful feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's Jacob?\" Tom asked Sammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He started shit and took off with his friends, so fuck 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I stay single.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rolled her eyes. \"You wanna dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shook his head; he wasn't a dancer. \"I'm here to drink,\" he answered, raising his glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's</i> why you stay single,\" Sammy told him. Then she shifted her dark, hazel eyes to Julie. \"How 'bout you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie raised her eye brows in surprise. \"You wanna dance?\"</span></div></div>",

He's the man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded, not quite satisfied with Sammy's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to sense this, Sammy confided, \"He sells weed to my boyfriend.\"  She paused before adding, \"And sometimes we go skiing.\"  Familiar with the lingo, Julie knew this wasn't the type of skiing that involved strapping long, wooden planks to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't go out with him much, usually we just talk on the phone or I stop by his pad for a while,\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy Jacob you were talking about, he's your boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, but he sounds like a real asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy laughed.  \"Sometimes he is, on nights like tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because other times he can be so sweet.\"  Sammy smiled and Julie felt her heart melting.  \"It's those times when he makes me feel like the most beautiful, most special girl in the whole world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of guys can make you feel special...\"  Julie smiled shyly.  \"Maybe even some girls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy giggled and winked.  \"Let me guess, girls like you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTupac was singing his rendition of <i>How Do You Want It</i>, and Julie began to twist and grind against the sexy blonde girl, her inhibitions fading into the musky air.</span></div></div>",

She ran her hands down Sammy's body, feeling the young woman's firm muscles flexing, as Sammy twisted her torso to the rhythm of the music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved about each other, sauntering boldly in a rhythmic ritual as ancient as the cavemen, and the girls locked eyes.  Julie's impossibly blue gaze transfixed by Sammy's sultrous stare, a primal, unspoken energy passed between them.  Something unseen and inexpressible, but just as real as a bolt of lightning.  In that moment Julie knew Sammy wanted her just as badly as she wanted Sammy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dance ended, and the girls returned to their table, both of them crazy with lust.  They made small talk and sipped their drinks, but their eyes kept returning to each other, sizing each other up.  Tom made a joke and they all laughed, but Julie didn't even catch the punchline.  All she could think about was Samantha.  Samantha, with her smooth, mountainous breasts bare and thrust upward as she lay on her back, her hands tied to her bed posts, awaiting Julie's touch.  Samantha, dancing and twisting around a pole, her every move designed for Julie's pleasure, tight latex hugging her voluptuous curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFantasy after fantasy rolled through Julie's mind, and the night wore on, the girls' thinly veiled passion for each other becoming more and more apparent.  When Quad City DJ's hit, <i>Come On 'N' Ride It</i> came blasting through the club's speakers, Julie couldn't stop her body from moving.  She got up and tugged on Samantha's hand.  \"Come on, we gotta dance to this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha laughed and followed Julie back to the dance floor, both girls light of heart and fairly intoxicated.  This time their dancing was slightly less erotic and a bit more playful, but the attraction between them was unquestionable.  As the song faded out Julie placed her hands on Sammy's shoulders, and without thinking, pulled Sammy's body against her own and pressed her lips against the older girl's.  Sammy responded with eager receptiveness, their lips parting and tongues darting into one another's mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally separated, Sammy looked at Julie with burning hunger.  \"Let's get out of here.  Go back to my place.\"  </span></div></div>",

It was crazy, she had just met this woman, she shouldn't be going home with her.  Especially if Sam had a boy friend.  Still, Julie said yes with hardly a second thought.  The burning desire in the pit of her stomach was too overwhelming to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha rented a house in a run down neighborhood south of I-10, where the buildings were all dark and forboding.  Chipped paint, crumbling roofs, and shoddily kept yards were the predominant traits of the area.  Although her home was slightly better maintained than those surrounding it, Sam's pad was no prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeterioration could be detected on some of the corners of the outer walls, but most of the exterior appeared to be in tact.  The front door was a rotting piece of oak with peeling white paint, and inside the floor was composed of wooden planks which creaked when you walked on them, covered in places by cheap white rugs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was tidy enough, the type of order one would expect to find in a single female's residence.  Things were in their proper places, the floor and furniture relatively dust free.  While there were no precious trinkets or pricey knick knacks to be found, the place was well furnished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time with these trivial observations, Julie and Sam made a bee line for the bedroom, sucking face and tearing at each other's clothes.  By the time the pining tandem had breached the boudoir, Julie was topless and hitching her fingers into her jeans, sliding them down her legs.  Her wonderful tits peaked upward, as if her nipples were asking Sam to suck them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's blouse was open in front, her bra removed, and her lovely round breasts bounced gently on her chest, perky and firm despite their considerable size.  Her flat, firm belly trembled with excitement, and she dropped her skirt at the foot of the bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stepped out of her jeans and moved towards her, putting her hands on those magnificent jiggling globes.  Her fingers squeezed and caressed, playing with the nipples, feeling them stiffen under her touch.  A soft moan passed over Julie's lips as Sam slipped her fingers into Julie's warm, moist womanhood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fell on the bed together, Julie's thick, curvy body covering Sam's slightly firmer, trimmer, figure.  Brown hair dangling over her brow, Julie's sparkling, vibrant blue eyes gazed longingly at the girl below her, perky breasts hanging from her chest, sashaying gently between them.  She gasped as she felt Sam's teeth biting into her left nipple, gnawing gently at the skin.  Her hand went to that breast, clamping down on the base, pushing the fat towards its tip, creating pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Julie sighed, rolling on the bed, clutching herself in rhapsody, while Sam's fingers rubbed all the right nerves in her clitoris.  After a while Sam went down on her, doing things with her skillful tongue that Julie never dreamt possible.  Pleasure continued to build in her nether regions, gaining momentum like a snow ball tumbling down a hill, until Julie thought she would burst with ecstasy.  Her cries of delectation grew in volume and frequency, her hands clawing frantically at her soft, firm bosom.  When at last Sam was finished Julie was weak in the knees, completely out of breath, and indescribably satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreamy, euphoric blue eyes gazed at Sam from behind her tousled bangs, and Sam smiled at her.  Sam had all the experience in this department, it seemed, and Julie was a little embarassed she could not aptly return the favor.  She opened her mouth as if to say something to this effect, but Sam stopped her with a finger to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you did fine.\"  Sam winked at her.  \"I've got my trusty vibrator and a freshly filled spank bank.  Just sit back and watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Julie sat on the bed while Sam dug a pink, plastic device, an inch and a half in diameter and perhaps ten inches long, out of her underwear drawer.  Big, perfect white teeth glimmered in the dimly lit room as Julie grinned sheepishly.  A switch was flipped and the little device sprang to life, buzzing robustly in Sam's palm.  Sam laid down on the bed next to Julie, looking up at her with ravished eyes, and inserted the toy in her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredibly stimulating to watch, and as Sam worked Julie began fingering herself and pinching her nipples with renewed zest.  Before long both girls were moaning, climbing the summit of human elation, Julie for the second time that night.  Their business concluded at roughly the same time, and for a while after they only stared into each other's eyes, both of them spent and out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna stay the night?\" Sam finally asked, smiling gently at her newfound lover.</span></div></div>",

To make matters worse, she was compounding that sin by fucking a girl who was already in a relationship.  <i>Fuck that.  If there is a Heaven, this is what it would feel like,</i> Julie told herself.  She didn't want to leave, and that was all the truth she needed.  If that wasn't good enough for God, then God could take a flying fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if that's okay,\" Julie answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I can give you a ride home in the morning.  I've got some shorts you can wear, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy tossed Julie a worn pair of blue cotton shorts, which Julie slipped into.  They barely covered her upper thighs, but Julie thought they fit just fine.  Deciding to sleep topless, she didn't bother with her shirt or bra.  She received no arguments from Sam on that count.  They climbed into bed and Sam switched off the bedside lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Julie.\"  Sam was smiling as she closed her eyes.  For some time Julie just lie awake, watching Sam doze off, remembering how wonderful this woman had made her feel.  Life was a beautiful thing.  Her head was still spinning from the alcohol, she had just experienced her first sexual encounter, and she was lying in bed next to a drop dead sexy woman.  Who would have thought her night would end with such bliss?  As her eyes finally closed, she focused on Sam's steady breathing, and tried to stop smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's conscious thoughts were just beginning to trail off when there came a noise at the door.  Her eyes popped open, reality cruising back, washing away the dream world where she had been telling Tom something nonsensical, something she could no longer put her finger on, and she distinctly heard the sound of a key turning in a lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam,\" Julie whispered as she heard the front door swing open.  Sam rolled over in the bed they shared and began rubbing her eyes.  \"Someone's here.\"  The floorboards creaked as someone, someone heavy, walked over them, on his way to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's eyes opened wide in fear.  \"Jacob?\" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He lives here?\" Julie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily getting out of bed, Sam whispered back, \"No, but he has a key.\"  She was pulling on a pair of warm ups and running a hand through her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck,</i> Julie thought.  <i>What did I get myself into?</i>  While Sam rushed to meet her boyfriend at the door, Julie searched for her blouse.  It was a white, button down thing, all the buttons currently undone, and just as Julie located it and slipped it around her arms she heard shouting outside the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's here with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one.  Jacob, please, you're drunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crashing sound, followed by a timid cry from Sam, and in her mind's eye Julie saw Sammy trying to stop some drunken brute from entering her bedroom, the drunken brute tossing her aside like a ragdoll.  Julie didn't realize how painfully accurate this mental picture actually was.  She glanced at the window and considered trying to escape that way.  Would there be enough time to fumble open the locks, wherever they might be, raise the window, and scamper out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck, what did I get myself into?</i></span></div></div>",

A mountain of a man blocked her escape, and the fucker was pissed.  His face was red as a cherry, his eyes bloodshot from the booze but brimming with rage, and a plump purple vein throbbed on his forehead.  If he was a cartoon there would be steam rising from his head.  Frozen in fear, Julie looked at the behemoth towering in the doorway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know,\" she lied, \"I thought she was single.\"  It immediately occurred to her that she might be making things worse for Sam, but it was the only defense she could think of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy, you slut,\" Jacob roared.  \"This is what you do when I'm not here?  You fuck ditzy little high school chicks?\"  He moved towards Julie, and Julie held up the phone, waving it in front of her like it was a magic relic that would ward off evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call the cops,\" she threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob roared with laughter.  \"You can try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the bastard would be on her before should even dial nine, Julie chunked the handset at him, but he ducked and the phone sailed over his head, smashing into the wall behind him.  Rising back up, he smiled menacingly at Julie, and a chill raced down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God, this is bad.</i>  Attacking the beastly man head on without any sort of weapon was madness, so Julie leaped over the bed, scrambling for the closet.  Despite his size and apparent inebriation, Jacob moved with surprising nimbleness.  He met her at the closet door, took hold of her shoulders, and pinned her against the wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy!\" Julie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's had a little accident,\" Jacob told her, almost regrettfully.  \"But now you and I are gonna have some fun.\"  A gorilla sized fist slammed into her stomach, knocking the wind out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucker,\" Julie grunted.  Refusing to be a victim, she siezed Jacob's crotch in her right hand, squeezing with everything she had.  His jaw dropped and his facial muscles tightened.  The grip on Julie's shoulders was relinquished as his hands went to his groin, hoping to liberate his privates from her ironclad grasp.  She pushed him back, letting go of him as he crumbled to his knees.  Seeing an opening between Jacob and the bed, she made a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie darted around the bastard and headed for the door, no longer concerned with her purse or her bra or even Sam's safety, but it was not to be.  Jacob, with one hand on his johnson, fell to the floor and stretched out a long, thick arm.  His reaching fingers found purchase on Julie's right ankle, and she went sprawling.  She clawed frantically at the floor boards as Jacob hauled her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Keep fighting him.  Don't give up.</i>  Kicking and screaming, Julie's left foot connected with Jacob's jaw, and she broke free.  Jacob reeled back from the blow, but he was quick to recover.  As Julie scrambled to her feet so did he.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy,\" Julie shouted again as she reached the doorway.  Then she was yanked back by her blouse, twirled around, and slung into the bookcase against the eastern wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost her footing and went tumbling head first, but managed to raise her right arm to protect her face as she crashed into the shelves.  Sixty pounds of polished wood and an army of hard cover books came toppling down on top of her, crushing her with its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Jacob shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's me,</i> Julie thought, dazed.  She struggled against the toppled shelf, but with little success.  Just as she prepared to double her efforts, Jacob lifted the book case off her with surprising ease, then pulled her from the clutter.  Julie's feet barely touched the floor as she was lifted into the air, then went hurtling into the doorway.  Her back smacked against the hard wooden frame, and a line of flesh seemed to raise up where she made impact.  Groaning in agony, before Julie could recover Jacob was on top of her, this time lifting her by her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if her scalp would be ripped off her head, but somehow it remained attached.  She was hoisted off the ground until she was eye level with Goliath, then the titan unleashed a whistling left handed roundhouse, smashing Julie's right cheek and knocking her senseless.  Bright light replaced her vision for an indefinite period of time, and when she regained her senses she was on her hands and knees, hair hanging in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose up, not sure where she was or how she got there, and felt a foot plant itself in the center of her back.  She stumbled forward, out of control, until her left thigh collided with a small cabinet and she went tumbling.  Julie rolled onto her side, feeling the hard wood floor beneath her, and as she looked at her surroundings she recognized Sam's living room.  There was a couch near the cabinet that had tripped her up, a TV on the far side of the room, a recliner beyond the couch, a few potted plants here and there, a coffee table, and in a corner lie Sam, her head twisted at an impossible angle and her eyes blank and glossy and staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam!\" Julie cried.  <i>Sam's dead,</i> she told herself.  It didn't seem possible.  Not thirty minutes ago she'd had Sam's talented tongue in her snatch, awakening nerves Julie never even knew she had.  An hour ago they had been grinding against each other on the dance floor, the blonde woman's lithe body so vibrant and alive it was easy to believe she'd never die.  But there she was, crumpled and lifeless in the corner, dead as a doornail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to grieve, however, as a foot came blurring into view, and Julie just caught sight of it before it connected with her jaw, snapping her head back and bloodying her lip.  She raised her hands to shield her face from further blows, and her savage assailant delivered several bone crushing kicks to her body instead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two of her ribs cracked, Julie rolled away from the impact and got to her knees.  <i>I've got to get away.  I can't let him kill me like he did Sam.  Can't.</i>  Her mind was racing as she scuttled to her feet, turning to flee.  Her roll had carried her into the kitchen, and she now faced an island with a kitchen block stocked full of knives.  Suspended above the island was a rack from which at least a dozen shiny pots and pans dangled before her like giant wind chimes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No sooner than Julie's fingers brushed against the handle of a butcher knife, did a pair of hands snag her from behind, one lifting her up from her buttocks and the other tugging on the collar of her blouse.  Before she could react she was flung forward over the island, crashing through the pots and pans and smacking against the cabinets beneath the kitchen sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprawled on the kitchen floor, she felt the scattered cooking ware poking her in the back.  She hauled herself back to her feet and brought the heaviest skillet she could get her hands on with her as she rose to meet her attacker, aiming to slam it into the side of the bastard's head.  Jacob was ready for her, however, and caught her wrist before she could brain him.  Her left hand, which was empty, reached for the bastard's face, hoping to put out an eye, but she stopped short when she felt the butcher knife slide into her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooooooo,\" Julie gulped, her blue eyes wide with disbelief.  \"Aaahhhhhhkkk.\"  Jacob pulled and twisted the knife, carving up the poor teen's tummy before he retracted the blade from her flesh.  Jettisons of bright scarlett splashed Jacob, and Julie grimaced.  Something warm and slippery began to slither out of the hole in her belly, so she dropped the skillet and pressed a hand to the gash, trying to hold in her bulging guts, but ropes of slimy entrails squirmed through her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie staggered back, her right hand clutching her belly in an effort to keep the whole steaming mess from sliding out onto the floor, and held herself up with her left hand on the kitchen counter.  \"Holy shit,\" Jacob murmured, staring in awe at the loop of viscera dangling between her legs.  \"I really carved you up good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie didn't answer him, she just smiled nervously.  The pain was extraordinary, but she held onto her composure.  She'd need to keep her wits if she hoped to make it out of here alive.  <i>Just stay cool.  I'll be fine, I just need to get to the hospital.</i>  Taking deep breaths, Julie tried to relax.  When she was sure she could speak without blathering, she said calmly, \"I think I need a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right, I think you need an undertaker.\"  Jacob stepped forward and slipped the giant knife into Julie's belly again, to the left of her navel.  Julie's jaw dropped and her stunning blue eyes bulged in their sockets.  <i>Jesus, he's really killing me.</i>  She wrapped her left hand around Jacob's wrist, hoping to prevent him from slicing her up any further, and brought her knee into his groin with all the force she could muster.  It was a solid shot.  She felt something soft and squishy mashed between her thigh and the bastard's pelvis, and Jacob bent over in pain.  Unrelenting, she head butted him, slamming the top of her head into the bridge of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob fell back into the island, leaving the butcher knife buried in Julie's belly.  One hand still clung to his injured groin, the other held his broken nose, blood pumping through his fingers.  It was a start, but it wasn't enough.  Julie bit down on her lower lip and pulled the blade from her body, then leaned forward and jammed it into Jacob's neck.  The damned thing was so big, it had to have hit his jugular, or at least some other major artery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie then turned her attention to her gushing belly.  More slick, glistening ropes had slid through the hole in her stomach, so she scooped up some of her guts and began trying to stuff the fallen entrails back into her body.  <i>I need to get some help, and fast.</i></span></div></div>",

There was no traffic at this hour, the only car in the street was Jacob's parked at the curb outside Sam's house, and all the windows lining the decadent homes on the opposing side of the street were dark.  Julie turned to look at the homes on Sammy's side of the street, and it was no more promising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared she would just have to go door to door, and with nothing more than a whim to go on, Julie started with Sammy's next door neighbor, on the west side of the house.  At least there was a car in the driveway, a sign that someone was potentially home.  A tired old Buick that had seen better days, and as she waddled up the driveway a loop of her intestines caught on the passenger side mirror.  She winced at the brutal agony, and after carefully untangling her small intestines from the automobile's appendage, she staggered up to the front door. There was no doorbell, so she rapped as loudly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blouse was still unbuttoned, her perky breasts jiggling freely on her chest, and her intestines spilling out of her belly.  She imagined she was quite a sight.  No matter.  Buttoning up at this point would be a monumental waste of effort, so she waited, swaying slightly on legs that had once been as stout as oak, but received no answer.  She rapped again, waited some more, and her patience was rewarded with silence.  The only sound was that of her blood spattering the concrete slab beneath her feet.  It occurred to her that while she waited for help that wasn't coming, she might very well bleed to death on a stranger's doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, next house.</i>  Exhaustion was setting in.  Blood loss coupled with sleep deprevity had sapped her strength, and delirium was beginning to cloud her judgment.  Still, Julie stumbled back down the driveway, preparing to continue her search for a good samaritan, but instead she got herself shot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the slug punch into the right side of her lower back, and she went down.  A tired groan rattled through her lips as she glanced back at Sam's front yard.  This was just not her night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hideous beast with crimson staining the front of his shirt was stumbling down the walkway, and Julie could see the knife handle jutting from his neck.  It was Jacob, his skin the color of the chalk teachers used in school, his eyes wild and bulging.  The horrible bastard hadn't died as Julie had expected, at least not yet, and now he had armed himself with a pistol.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" Julie muttered under her breath.  As she struggled to her feet Jacob blasted her in the shoulder.  She twisted with the shot, and fell forward onto the trunk of Jacob's Oldsmobile.  Her hands went out in front of her, bracing against the impact, her juicy round butt sticking up in the air, and Jacob plugged her in her finely shaped right buttock.  The bullet chewed through her soft flesh with ease, then lodged itself firmly against her tailbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie squawked and shambled around the rear bumper, dragging her right leg behind her, then threw herself against the pavement on the opposing side of the Oldsmobile, temporarily removing herself from Jacob's line of fire.  <i>Christ, I've been shot.  The fucking bastard shot me.</i> </span></div></div>",

Jacob was still coming for her, severed jugular and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stumbled out into the middle of the street, hoping to escape, but Jacob followed close behind her.  He opened fire, shooting her repeatedly, pumping round after round into her back.  Still, Julie didn't go down.  Even after five, six, seven, eight shots.  Several slugs went right through her, exiting her chest and stomach, and Julie just kept staggering along.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't stop,</i> she told herself.  He'll get you if you stop.  The ninth shot dropped her, but Julie was quick to pick herself up, and she continued down the road as if nothing had happened.  She took the tenth and eleventh shots in stride, unconsciously gripping the exit wounds under her right breast and the upper left side of her abdomen.  <i>Someone will hear the shots and come outside.  Someone has to come outside to help me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourteen, fifteen, sixteen rounds, all found their mark in Julie's tender young flesh.  There were now over half a dozen exit wounds in her belly, and the gaping holes spilled more guts than she could catch.  Long, ropy loops of intestines drooped and sagged between her legs.  The seventeenth shot finally brought her to her knees, leaving her slumping in the street.  Jacob caught up to her and popped another round through the side of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, shot eighteen times, including once in the head, Julie didn't die.  Her heart, as of yet unscathed, continued to beat, and the final bullet had managed to miss all the vital sections of her brain.  She leaned to the side, placing her left palm against the street to prop herself up.  Amazing blue eyes peered up at Jacob, always so expressive.  In them her confusion was plainly visible.  Unsure what had happened to her, or why her motor functions seemed to be failing her, Julie finally collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob stood towering over her and shot her again.  And again.  And again.  The last few shots punched through her chest, destroying her young heart, ending her vitality, but Jacob continued to pull the trigger, dry firing.  The pistol had a twenty round clip, and he always kept one in the hole.  All twenty one rounds had been discharged into Julie's perfect young body, and her bright blue eyes were staring up into the night sky, the life fading out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer perfect cheeks were spattered with blood, her lips parted in one final breath, and her world came to an end.  </span></div></div>",

Jacob would gun her down in no time.  But the cocksucker was hurt bad, maybe worse than Julie.  If she could get close enough to grapple with him, maybe she could somehow gain the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the Oldsmobile as a barricade, Julie peered over the trunk to get a look at her attacker.  He was coming straight towards her, which was fortunate.  If he angled out into the street, he could shoot at her from a distance, but following his current course he would end up at the trunk of the car, no more than an arm's length away, before he got a clear shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLUNK!  A bullet ripped through the trunk and a tiny piece of metal slashed across Julie's forehead, above her left eye.  She ducked, narrowly avoiding a potentially fatal shot, and wiped the blood out of her eye.  <i>Stay down.  You'll get your freakin' head blown off.</i>  Remaining crouched behind the rear passenger tire, Julie peaked under the truck and watched Jacob's staggering feet approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jacob came careening around the vehicle, Julie sprang to her feet.  Jacob got a shot off before she could reach him, however, and the bullet struck her below her left collar bone.  Still, Julie came straight at him.  She grabbed his gun with both hands, pulling it down, and Jacob fired again.  This round went through her belly, exiting just above the curve of her left buttock, and Julie gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't give up, goddammit.  Fight him.</i>  She continued working on Jacob's right arm, pushing down with everything she had, lowering the barrel.  Another shot rang out and she felt the burning hot lead burrow through her left thigh.  <i>I've got to get that gun away from him.</i>  She dug her fingernails into the soft pad of flesh between his right thumb and forefinger, and his grip on the pistol was finally foiled.  The gun rattled harmlessly on the street.</span></div></div>",

Her diaphragm jerked up and forced the air out of her lungs, causing her to grunt, and a splash of blood flew from her lips.  Looking down, Julie saw Jacob's entire fist buried in her belly, and she could feel his fingers probing around in her insides.  A look of astonishment lit her stunning facial features, but her grip on the knife handle held firm.  She tugged and Jacob tugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife came out, grudgingly at first, then, when it became dislodged from whatever bone or gristle held it, with surprising ease.  A fountain of blood erupted from the asshole's neck, and Julie knew she had killed him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jacob simultaneously ripped his fist from Julie's abdomen, he brought a slopping tangle of coiled guts with it.  For an endless moment the two of them stood facing each other, neither of them moving, Julie holding the butcher knife and Jacob holding her bowels.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the initial shock of having her guts ripped out passed, Julie considered driving the blade through the bastard's chest and finishing the job, but when Jacob relinquished her ropy intestines in favor of his spurting throat, she let the knife slip through her fingers and settled for dropping to her knees and scavenging on the ground, trying to pick up her spilled entrails.  The damned things were too slippery and her fingers were not responding to her motor commands, so all she succeeded in doing was strewing them about.  She sighed and looked at the mess she was making, then just sank back against the side of Jacob's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's two lovers stared at each other, Julie's eyes filled with pain and fear and desolation, Jacob's filled with murder and insanity and rage, but Julie could see the focus leaving them.  She thought it a wonder the bastard was still alive, but then considering her own condition the same could be said for herself.  The real question, she supposed, was who would go first into the great beyond?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if he shared this thought, Jacob smiled sickly, then bent down to retrieve the pistol, but his motor skills seemed to be leaving him too, and he went sprawling face first in the street.  Down but not out, he rolled onto his side, and Julie saw the patch of raw flesh on his cheek where the pavement had torn away the skin.  Perhaps Sam had once found him handsome, but in this moment Julie thought he was hideous, the ugliest thing to ever live.  His fingers sought out the pistol, gripped it, and slowly raised it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why won't you fucking die already?</i> Julie thought.  The trigger was squeezed, and she caught the bullet under her left breast.  She blinked, her body twitched, and she choked on some blood, but otherwise remained mostly indifferent.  The gun went off again, and half of Julie's left nipple disappeared.  Jacob was fading fast now, and the barrel of the gun drooped, but he managed one final shot, and Julie took it in the belly, right above her navel.  Then the terrible bastard went limp and the light went out of his eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's own eyes were distant and dreamy as she grappled with the finality of death.  She would never see her parents again, never see Tom again, never be able to laugh or cry or feel the warmth of the sun.  It was these thoughts that chased her as she slowly passed away into oblivion.</span></div></div>",

His eyes were too alert, for one thing.  His back was too straight, his posture not as relaxed as she was accustomed to seeing.  But more than all of that, it was just a vibe he was sending out, more unseen than seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, there was no use trying to pry it out of him.

One thing of which she could be sure, was that Tom was one of the people involved in the dispute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA \"fuck you\" that could only have come from Tom's voice stood out in the midst of the chaos, and the first thought to cross Julie's mind was that perhaps her food had been fucked with after all, and Tom hadn't wanted to address the issue in front of her.  Julie wondered how plausible this theory might be as she hurriedly tore off a few sheets of toilet paper, and after a quick wipe down of her private areas she hiked up her pants and rushed for the door, not bothering to wash her hands.  She was hoping to get into the mix and fire off a few curse words of her own, before things cooled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Julie could shoulder the door open and burst into the lobby, gunfire erupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once he shook the cobwebs from his skull he might over power her, and that could be the end for Julie.  Engaging in further hand to hand combat might be ill advised.  Jamming her knee into his crotch as a parting gift, Julie turned around and started to make her way back to the pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shooting hadn't stopped when she clobbered this fuck, so Julie understood there were other participants involved in this gun fight, but as of yet she hadn't spotted any of them.  Now, on her hands and knees, trying to reach the untended pistol, Julie came face to face with one of these previously undetected combatants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was maybe 15 feet away, cowering behind a fixation upon which a tree had been planted, firing at what Julie guessed must have been Tom's position, when they saw each other.  Julie out in the open, with no weapon and no protection, and this rotten bastard taking cover and blasting away like it was the OK Corral.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe checkout counter and a small section of the lobby was to her left, where Tom must have been, and to her right was the vast majority of the restaurant's dining area, the newly discovered shooter, and beyond that the playground.  The gun she was trying to reach was lying directly in the line of fire, but tauntingly close, no more than a few feet away, when her newfound foe turned his weapon on her and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nine millimeter slug punched into her right shoulder and lodged itself in her lung, knocking her on her side.  A stunned Julie blinked, coughed up a mouthful of blood, and marvelled at this turn of events.  <i>Really?  Did he just shoot me?</i>  The reality of the situation suddenly hit home with surprising clarity, and for the first time Julie understood her life might actually be at stake here.  Fear so palpable you could cut it with a knife crashed in on her, and panic threatened to destroy her nerves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, remembering her task, Julie regained focus.  <i>The gun.  I have to reach the gun.</i>  She had a goal, and with that her panic subsided, but before she could pick herself up a second round struck her in the abdomen and ripped through her guts.  \"Uhhnn!\" Julie grunted.  Feeling the fires of hell blazing in her belly, Julie blocked out the pain and rolled back onto her stomach.  <i>Almost there.  Just a little farther.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began shimmying forward, now less than a foot from her objective, when a third shot bit into her right buttock.  \"Ahhh, are you fucking serious?!\" Julie screamed with dismay.  Shot repeatedly, she was discouraged, but didn't stop.  <i>I'll be okay, just keeping moving,</i> she told herself.  As she reached for the pistol another bullet ricocheted off the floor next to her.  Pieces of tile stung her side, but left her basically unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow effectively armed for this fight, Julie raised up on her knees and took aim at her shooter.  <i>I've got you now, you fucker.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only five shots discharged, however, before the firing pin began to fall on an empty chamber, and Julie was suddenly a sitting duck.  None of her rounds had found her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bastard leaned out of hiding and Julie watched with wide eyes as he plugged her three times in the chest.  She rocked back on her knees, and the next thing she knew she was staring up at the ceiling, struggling to breathe.  <i>I'm done for.</i>  She lifted her head to take one last look at herself, and to confirm that she did in fact have two holes in her left breast and another on the inside slope of her right breast, before lying flat.  <i>I'm really done for.</i>  She could feel her damaged heart begin to sputter, and her lungs were filling up with blood.  <i>This is so stupid.</i>  The gunfight raged on around her, and she thought she heard someone shout, \"got 'em!\" before she slipped away into oblivion.</span></div></div>",

Now with both her lungs ruined, the simple task of drawing a breath became extremely laborious.  Still, Julie gasped for air and kept the pistol leveled at her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last Julie returned fire, she used her ammo sparingly.  There was no telling how many, if any, live rounds remained in the magazine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first shot was the first she had ever fired in her life, and in her diminished condition it was a miracle she didn't blow her own foot off, but, surprisingly, it was remarkably accurate, shattering a tile on the side of the fixture behind which her target was hiding.  Encouraged, Julie bit down on her lower lip, steadied herself, and stared down the sights.  When the bastard showed his face again she put a bullet under his eye, demonstrating a natural talent with a firearm that defied reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was agonizing to do so, and although blood spewed from her mouth and stained her pink lip gloss red as she did it, Julie laughed.  <i>Take that, you bitch,</i> her mind cried in triumph.  But her victory was short lived.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang banger she had laid up moments earlier was back on his feet, and had evidently brought more than one gun to this fight.  Julie caught a glint of steel in her peripheral vision, but before she could turn the muzzle flashed and hot lead ripped through her neck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awk!\" she squawked, and slapped her left hand against her throat. <i> I hope that didn't sever my jugular.</i>  She rotated her shoulders to try to get a bead on the new threat, but a second round smashed into her below her right collar bone.  Leaning back, Julie's white button-down blouse was pulled high on her breasts, exposing quite a bit of her belly, and the thug put two more bullet holes in her bare midriff.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand still clutching her neck, Julie finally managed to return fire, and she put a slug right between her second shooter's eyes.  Gun shots still rang out from behind the counter, and Julie wondered how many more of these asshole there were.</span></div></div>",

Every inch of progress took a monumental effort, and it felt like her insides were filled with molten lava, but she pressed on.  When she finally reached the doors, Julie pulled herself to her feet using the handles for support.  An errant round found its way into her right hamstring before she could leave the gunfight behind her, and an exit wound opened in the front of her beige khakis.  Shot nine times, Julie simply sighed and staggered out of the restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cool night air felt good on her face, and she began to think she might actually make it.  The hole in her neck hadn't caused her to bleed out, which had to be a good sign, and with the help of a skilled trauma surgeon maybe she could still be stitched up.  With two punctured lungs, however, she needed a paramedic, and fast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, there were several people waiting outside, and they all had their eyes on her as she hobbled towards them.  <i>I must be quite a sight.</i>  \"Help me,\" she croaked, and she wondered why she wasn't eliciting a more urgent reaction from the spectators.  Too late, she realized her mistake.  These were teenagers, maybe a couple of guys in their early twenties, and they dressed like hoods.

She got the first shot off, hitting a thin cholo with knee-high socks, saggy denim shorts, and a wife-beater square in the chest.  A plaid-wearing vato to his right popped her in the left shoulder, and she retaliated by shooting him in the gut.  Two more shots hit her then, in rapid succession, one below her sternum and one in her right nipple.  Julie dropped to her knees and tried to find her next target, but the gun seemed to weigh a ton.  When she managed to fire a shot, the bullet skirted harmlessly off the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore slugs ripped into her, one in her left hip, one just to the left of her navel, one below her left tit.  Barely able to keep the barrel of the pistol upright, Julie squeezed the trigger one last time, but her magazine was empty.  In return for her efforts she caught two more rounds, one in the right side of her chest and another just below the left side of her rib cage.  Out of bullets and shot seventeen times, Julie sat down on her heels and sighed, \"You got me,\" and she was shot once more in the stomach in reply.  <i>Just to make sure, I guess.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surveyed her remaining foes, six in total counting the two she had shot, both of whom were nursing their wounds but still on their feet, and thought that it wasn't fair.  These assholes would probably go on to live full lives, with so much to look forward to, but she was going to die here in this parking lot, just a month before her eighteenth birthday.  A bullet for each year of her life, and one to grow on.  She decided Tom had it right.  There was no God.

Another slug chased her as she retreated, striking her in her left should blade, and then another punched through the right side of her rib cage, exiting below her right breast.  As Julie threw open the doors and stepped back into Mickey D's, one more round punched into the center of her back, scraped against her spine, and left a gaping hole in her upper abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Julie turned her attention back to the grill area, hoping Tom had fared better than her.  \"Tom,\" she called out, leaning on the counter, where not half an hour ago she had been care-free and ordering a sandwich, and waited for an answer.  \"Tom, I'm bleeding to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen no one replied, Julie made her way behind the counter and into the grill area.

Tom wasn't part of a gang, he had always likened joining a gang to joining the military - you were signing your life away, but he had enemies that were.  How many were out there?  How many could he possibly fend off?

Only thirty seconds had passed since the battle had ceased, but to Julie it was decades.  She cracked the door open and peeked out, and much to her dismay she found herself staring one of the gangsters dead in the face.

Five boys filed into the restroom, all toting pistols and submachine guns, and all their weapons were trained on her. \"Okay, look, I didn't sss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was interrupted by the rattle of gunfire. All five boys opened up on her, spraying her mercilessly with bullets. Rounds of multiple calibers riddled her torso from her hips to her shoulders, while a few shots punched through her biceps, her forearms, and her thighs.

Amazingly, she was still on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled forward a couple steps as her shooters all just watched her in silence. An extravagantly stunning girl had just been reduced to a desperate dying animal right before their eyes, and a sort of awe-struck wonder came over them at the destruction of this beautiful creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzzzzsssttt, sssfffflll,\" Julie muttered through clinched teeth and a mouthful of blood. She stretched out her hands towards her attackers, her eyes bulged wide in their sockets, and she collapsed to her knees.

At first it appeared she would try to get up; she lifted her chin a couple inches above the bathroom tile, but then her head dropped back down and the life ebbed slowly from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, that chick was fuckin' hot,\" one of the gunman said breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, she's fuckin' dead now.

Had she just murdered her buddy?  Was she going to spend the rest of her life in prison?  Or worse, death row?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a commotion from the hallway, and Debbie's father called out for her.  \"Fuck,\" she murmured.  What was she going to tell Mr. Garza?

She didn't want to shoot Mr. Garza too, but she would if she had to, so she leveled the gun at the doorway and waited.  When Mr. Garza appeared, he had a shotgun raised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man saw his dead daughter straight away, and Julie watched the conflicting emotions of pain and rage and grief battling it out behind his eyes.  In the end rage won out, and she knew he was going to shoot even before he did.  She threw herself to the side, like Bruce Willis in a Die Hard movie, and a blast of buckshot filled the air she had occupied a split second earlier.  It wasn't a completely successful dodge, however, as a few pellets bit into her left shoulder and another stung her in the base of her neck, but landing on her side, mostly out of harm's way, Julie returned fire.  Two carefully calculated shots punched into Mr. Garza's chest, and he dropped his shotgun and disappeared into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking herself up off the floor, Julie took time to assess the damage.  She wore a denim vest that left her shoulders and belly bare, so she had a good view of the wounds, which appeared small and not terribly serious.  She couldn't get a look at the hole in her neck, but she touched her fingers to it to gauge the flow of blood, and it didn't seem much worse than the others.  \"I'll be okay,\" she whispered to herself, then looked back at Debbie.  She wished Debbie would be okay too.  \"I'm sorry, friend, you didn't deserve this.\"  On the heels of that, \"I didn't deserve this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie cautiously made her way to the hallway, her gun still up and out in front of her, expecting to see Mr. Garza sprawled out dead, but preparing herself for anything.  What she discovered was Mr. Garza wasn't there at all.  A few spatters of blood left a trail down the hall and to the master bedroom on the left.  Farther down and to the right was the kitchen, and straight ahead was the living room.  The living room connected to the foyer, and beyond that was the driveway and her yellow VW buggy, but it wouldn't do to get ambushed en route, so she crept along the hallway exhibiting the same level of caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the bedroom doorway she swung into view, her pistol sweeping the area in front her, emulating the motions of every cop she had ever seen on TV.  Mr. Garza was still nowhere in sight.  Julie stepped through the door and swept left, then right, clearing the room and seeing nothing of note.  It wasn't until she retreated a step and turned to leave that Mr. Garza made his presence known.  She didn't see him pop up from behind the bed, as her back was to him, but she heard his .357 magnum explode like thunder, and she felt the slug catch her in the lower back and barrel through her intestines until it erupted from her abdomen.  Julie squealed with surprise, but her reaction was swift and measured.  She spun around fast as a top and put a bullet through Mr. Garza's right eye.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the threat eliminated, Julie had time to examine the exit wound in her belly.  As before, her revealing choice of attire gave her a clear view, and the gaping hole was a gruesome and messy thing, about the size of a fifty-cent piece, a little off to the right of her navel, and in between spurts of blood Julie thought she could see her entrails trying to squirm through the opening.  She pressed her palm against it in hopes of stemming her blood loss and keeping her guts where they belonged, and she stowed her Beretta in the front pocket of her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was down to three rounds, and since she was going on the lam she figured she'd need more firepower, so she walked over and plucked Mr. Garza' Smith and Wesson magnum from his cold dead fingers and stuffed it through the waist band of her jeans.  \"Fuck, why'd you hafta do that, Mr. Garza?\"</span></div></div>",

This was the part of basketball practice Julie lived for.  It was a release from everything else in the world, when she could forget about all the bullshit, her homework, her Algebra test, her C in Spanish class, the four hundred horny guys in her school that were constantly fantasizing about fucking her.  Out here on the court, when she was jacking up a three, banging in the post against Monica, or driving the lane, nothing else mattered.  It was just her, the ball, and the net.  Even the girls defending her seemed to disappear, fading into some inconsequential plane of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they split into teams and prepared to do battle, Julie glanced at the stands and suddenly there was a crack in her nirvana.  Jon, the dorky kid that wrote her the note, was sitting there, alone, watching her with a creepy smile on his face.  <i>Jesus, that's creepy</i>.  She wanted to just shrug it off.  The last thing she needed was to make a big scene with the new self-appointed president of her fan club - the heckling from her team mates would be unending - but she didn't think she could focus on practice with him up there, watching her like that.</span></div></div>",

If she ignored him long enough he'd lose interest, just like all the other guys she had ignored through the years.  There was no need to overreact just because Jon was a first rate loser.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls split up into their respective squads and faced off.  Julie played the 2 guard position, and as usual Monica played the same position on the opposing squad.  Julie held Monica's athleticism and exquisite grace in high esteem, but she did not let her respect for her opponent stifle her competitive juices.  She attacked her relentlessly, backing her down in the post, hammering her with physical defense, and driving the lane with ferocious determination.  Julie had a magnificent scrimmage, showcasing all of her more than adequate basketball skills.  Jon never so much as crossed her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the locker room Julie and the other girls stripped down and stepped into the showers.  Although she'd never admit it, this was one of the reasons Julie loved sports.  The camaraderie was certainly a part of it, but the scenery before her was extraordinary.  She was careful not to stare, but she cast several glances from the corner of her eye at Monica's young but already quite supple chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Jules, you were hot today!\" Erika told her.  \"It was like you were possessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit bitch, that's how I roll,\" Julie responded smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika laughed, \"Shut the fuck up bitch.

As she patted down her perfectly sculpted body, it occured to her that life was great.  Her ego had been stroked by another outstanding performance on the basketball court, and she was a remarkably beautiful girl in the prime of her life.

Conscious of her perfection, showing off under the guise of stretching, Julie held her pose.  Just then Monica made her exit from the showers, her darkly tanned body glistening with moisture, and Julie was taken aback for a moment by the sight.  Julie's own body still stretched in a dazzling display of beauty, she called to Monica, \"Good scrimmage out there today, Mon.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Jules.  You were awesome.  I couldn't keep up.\"  Monica returned her smile and Julie felt a rush go through her body.  Yes, life was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to her locker, Julie started getting dressed.  After slipping on her panties, with an extra little jiggle in case any one was looking, she stepped into her tight fitting, faded blue jeans.  She casually pulled up the left pant leg, going out of her way not to hurry - she would take her time and soak up as much atmosphere as possible.  As Julie pulled up the other pant leg and fastened the button on her jeans, her peripheral vision detected an expression of sick horror printed on Erika's face.  She followed her friend's gaze to the entrance of the locker room, and saw Jon, her new stalker, standing there.  But that wasn't the worst part.  The worst part was what was in Jon's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crazy fucker was holding a huge revolver, and pointing it in Julie's direction.</span></div></div>",

Lucy slipped past him and escaped the locker room, and soon the rest of the girls followed.  Jon let them go.

She had to get out of there, away from this psychopathic fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up straight yet again, Julie took a moment to examine her damaged midsection.  Blood spurted from her body and splashed on the locker room floor, while more of it ran down the front of her, staining her blue jeans a grotesque, maroonish color.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fucking crazy,\" Jon told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie flashed him an expression that said, <i>What the fuck did you do to me?</i>, then clasped her hands over two of the three holes in her belly and started lumbering towards him.

But that all changed this morning, when she ripped his heart out of his chest and wiped her ass with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now Julie was shot, and there was so much blood.  Christ, there was so much fucking blood.  Who would have known that she'd have so much fucking blood in her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched this atrocity of his own creation, Julie staggered over to him, bleeding like a stuck pig.  Standing close enough to touch, Julie and Jon looked at each other, each of them rendered speechless by shock, Julie clutching herself and Jon clutching his father's .45 magnum.  Instead of speaking, a trembling, bloody hand reached out and clamped down on Jon's shoulder, and terrified and accusing eyes bore into his cold, dark brown ones.  Julie's grip was frighteningly powerful, and for a moment Jon was intimidated by the taller, desperate and dying girl.  Then he snapped out of his trance, and into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have to die, you bitch,</i> he said to himself.  It was only right that she should die, as Jon's life was now over, thanks to this heartless cunt.  If she survived it would mean she got the best of him, and for once in his life Jon was not going to be the butt of someone's joke.  He would not be left holding the short end of this stick.  Julie would pay, and her toll would be far dearer than Jon's, of that he would be certain.  He pressed the barrel of the gun to the side of her midsection and fired.  He saw the spray of blood and gore as the round punched through her body and made it's way out her other end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmph,\" Julie grunted primly.  Her grip weakened; her strength was failing.  Jon repositioned the gun, again pressing the barrel into her soft belly, and fired a fifth shot.  With that Julie's grip loosened significantly, her jaw dropped, and her eyes grew as big as saucers.  She looked once again at her ruined midsection, then back at Jon, and smiled wryly.  It was the smile of a lunatic, pushed past the breaking point.  Jon recognized his own madness in that smile, and grinned right back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Julie's smile faded as quickly as it appeared, and she looked past Jon to the stairs leading out of the locker room.  Brushing past him, as if he no longer existed, Julie stumbled to the stairs, and very slowly, very methodically, began to climb them.  Jon watched her for a bit, but she was of little concern now.  He had laid waste to both her kidneys and done irreparable damage to her liver.  She would not be long for this world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing left for Jon to do.  He wrapped his lips around the business end of his father's .45 revolver, and blew his brains out the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie emerged on the basketball court, the same court she had owned for most of her high school career, a bloody mess.  She looked around and saw some girls gawking at her, as though she was some sort of abomination in a Wes Craven horror flick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who are these people?</i> Julie wondered.  <i>Do they know me?</i>  Then she recognized Monica's pretty face, and realized they were her teammates.  \"Monica,\" she said, \"I've been shot,\" as if the gushing holes in her bare midriff didn't already give that away.  \"I think I'm dying.\"  <i>Am I dying?</i> she wondered.  <i>Can I really be dying?  Is it possible?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of her team had fled the building, but Erika, Monica, and a few others had lingered, along with Coach Martinez.  Monica just looked at her, dumbfounded, but Erika and Coach Martinez rushed to her side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled at Erika with heart-breaking sadness.  \"He shot me, Boobers.\"  Erika had earned the nickname due to her 37 D chest, which developed well ahead of the rest of her class.  \"Look what he did to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling back at her friend, Erika said softly, \"I know, Jules.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's smile turned into a grimace as she puked up a mouthful of blood.  \"Do you think I'm dying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Julie, you'll be fine, just hang on.  Fight it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie swiped blood from her lips with the back of her hand.  \"Right, okay.  I'll be fine.\"  She certainly didn't feel fine.  She felt weak, woozy, light headed, and incredibly nervous.  A metallic taste filled her mouth, and her legs became wobbly.  \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you motherfucker, just hang on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel so good.\"  Julie fell to her knees, nearly pulling Erika and her coach down with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie!\"  Erika screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked at Erika with wide, confused eyes, as she slowly fell back on her shoulders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, stay with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooo, fuck, it fucking burns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Julie, just fight it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be okay.  I just need to catch my breath.\"  Julie's respiration was becoming increasingly erratic, and beads of sweat broke out all over her flesh.  \"Can you get my mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom's not here right now, Jules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's okay.  I'm gonna be fine.\"  Julie was panting audibly, and a terrible knot of anxiety was building inside of her.  \"I'll be okay.  I'm...  Ima be okay.\"  Julie rolled back and forth on her back, clutching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Jules, you just keep fighting.  Help is on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the thought had just now occured to her, Coach Martinez looked at the few girls still lingering in the gym, and asked if any of them had called 9-1-1.  Their blank expressions indicated no one had, and Coach shouted at them to get on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrrrr, fuck!\" Julie grunted, trying to sit up as her breath came in loud pants.  She was fighting, but she felt like she was losing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Jules, try to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I... Ima\"  <i>I'm dying,</i> she told herself.  <i>No!</i>, her mind fired back.  She couldn't die, she just couldn't.  Julie grabbed Erika's blouse, and pulled her close.  She tried to talk, but her mouth filled up with blood and red streams spilled from the corners of her lips.  Julie turned her head and spat crimson, then tried again.  \"I'm not gonna make it, Boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fucking say that shit, goddamit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie released her friend's shirt and fell back to the floor.  Erika didn't get it.  How could she?  Julie was alone on this.  She would die alone and the rest of the world would go on without her, as unfathomable as that might seem.  That knot in her guts gave way to sheer, outright panic, and Julie's mind slipped a little.  Her bladder let go, spewing urine down her thighs, but that didn't matter.  Her jeans were already soaked with blood anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thirsty.  I'm thirsty, Erika.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jules, just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a glass of water.  I'll be okay, I just need a glass of water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll get you some water, just hang on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obviously a lie, but Julie didn't notice.  She had already forgotten about the glass of water.  She was once again wondering how the world could continue without her.  Was it even possible?  She needed her mom.  Her mom would make everything alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh, I wanna go home.  I want my mommy.\"  Julie hadn't referred to her maternal relation as 'mommy' for over eight years, but lying on the floor of the gymnasium in a pool of her own blood, the term came back to her like an old friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom's coming, Jules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika was crying now.  <i>That's odd,</i> Julie thought to herself.  <i>She's not the one dying.</i>  Her fingers and toes felt like ice, and her vision was getting spotty.  <i>This is it,</i> she thought.  <i>No, not yet, goddammit!</i> the survivor in her argued back.  Her survival instinct was strong, but she knew the score.  Her mommy wasn't coming, her glass of water wasn't coming, nobody was coming.  She was dying, and nothing could stop that now.  <i>Maybe I should have been a bit more sincere in my apology.</i> Julie thought.  <i>No, better yet, maybe I should have just called the fucker.</i>  Could have, should have, would have.  There would be no second chances for poor Julie.  There was no reset button, no extra lives like in Mario.  Her game was over, forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breaths were jagged and thin, her heart winding down, thumping sporadically, and Julie's eyes bulged in their sockets.  These were her final few seconds of life.  This was it, and there was nothing more.  The survivor in her made one final plea.  \"Ohmuhgawd... Erika... help....  mmmm...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie laid back, her beautiful blue eyes staring blankly at the ceiling, her mouth agape with indescribable terror, and she was no more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julie guessed the weapon to be a .357 magnum.  It looked a lot like the one Tom kept under his pillow, the one Tom had told her packed a nasty punch.  <i>A nine millimeter, you might need 9 or 10 shots to stop somebody, but with this mothefucker one round will do the trick,</i> he had said, beaming with pride, as if he had designed the thing himself.  Getting shot with that thing could spell disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing her fear, Julie remained calm and cool.  Jon had a crush on her, so her body and her sexuality was her weapon, whereas panic could prove fatal.  Still topless, Julie reached behind her head and fluffed her wet hair, again stretching her stomach flat and pushing out her bare breasts.  \"Nice gun,\" she said seductively.  \"You wanna shoot me with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Julie's surprise, Jon replied by squeezing the trigger.  A deafening boom filled the locker room.  Julie jerked slightly with the force as she felt a slug punch a hole through her midsection.  The noise was shocking, and the ringing in Julie's ears almost drowned out the screams of her teammates.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down in awe at the bloody hole an inch to the right of and slightly above her navel.  She tentatively pressed her hand against the wound, and examined the bright red blood dripping from it.  She knew the bullet had passed right through her and she would have an even nastier hole in the small of her back.  She looked up just in time to see flames erupt from the barrel of the gun a second time, and she felt the impact from another slug as it ripped through the middle of her.  This one struck lower in her belly, a couple inches to the left of her coin slot belly button.  She grunted and staggered back against her open locker, grabbing the swinging locker door with her left hand to steady herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked up at Jon with questioning eyes.  She was baffled as to what would cause Jon to write her a love letter in the morning, asking her out on a date, and then blow her guts all over the locker room in the afternoon.  Julie pushed off from her locker and took a couple steps forward.  She was clutching at both of the wounds in her belly, but it did little to slow the bleeding.  She could feel the warm sticky stuff streaming down her legs, soaking through her jeans.  She could feel more of the stuff bubbling up in the back of her throat.  She spat a mouthful of crimson, grimaced, and then asked Jon, \"Is this how you always pick up chicks?\"  She swiped the blood from her lips and grinned wryly just before Jon plugged her a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Julie cried as she caught the slug high in her midriff, slightly to the left of her center.   Julie remembered enough from anatomy class to know that her liver, stomach, pancreas, and kidney were all located in that general vicinity.  She felt unimaginable pain as the round slammed through her and wreaked havoc on her internal organs.  Julie stumbled back onto one of the benches running along the lockers.  A fine red mist formed from her lips as she sighed, and she looked apprehensively from the holes in her body to Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon stepped forward across the threshold, lowering his pistol for the time being, and Julie's teammates all took the opportunity to flee.  Jon made no attempt to stop them.  His attention was held captive by the lovely girl bleeding to death on the locker room bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her companions had all made their escape, leaving her alone with Jon, Julie lowered her head and closed her eyes.  Her thoughts circled in on her death, and how if this was truly the end then nothing she did or said mattered.  That way lie madness.  Teetering on the brink of delirium, Julie struggled to maintain her composure.  She searched herself and found a steely resolve that had been with her since Chuckie's death.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Jon, when I asked if you wanted to shoot me... that was just... like... a sexual inuendo or something.\"  Julie said, sounding remarkably calm for someone whose life blood was quickly spilling all over the floor.  She could hear it spattering the tiles below her as it fell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon looked back at her with tears streaming down his cheeks.  \"It's not fair, Julie,\" he sobbed.  \"IT'S FUCKED!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're telling me,</i> Julie thought, but didn't say.  Choosing her words carefully, Julie took a deep breath and said, \"Relax Jon...\"  After coughing up more blood, Julie continued \"Tell me what's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you do this to me?\" Jon asked her.  \"Why?\"</span></div></div>",

Her emotions welled up inside her and for just a moment she forgot about maintaining her composure.  \"Do this to you?!\"  Julie cried out, blood flying from her lips.  \"You fucking <i>shot</i> me!  I'm fucking dying!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLAM!  Jon cut off her rant by firing another round into her naked torso.  The bullet slammed into her perky right breast, knocking her backwards.  She slapped her arms out against the lockers, preventing herseslf from toppling completely off the bench.  \"Uurrrp!\" she cried, looking nervously at her latest gun shot wound.  She pushed herself back into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always all about you, isn't it Julie?!\" Jon shouted at her.  \"You fucking cunt!  You don't care about anyone but yourself.  Nobody does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon please,\" but that was as far as she got.  Jon shot her again, punching a hole in her just under her right rib cage.  The hot lead pummeled what was left of her liver and tore its way out her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie groaned, struggling to remain upright, but her strength was leaving her and she slipped off the bench and fell to the floor.  It didn't appear she would be talking her way out of this one.  She began to drag her wounded body across the locker room floor, away from Jon, and when she reached the edge of the showers she grasped the end of the wall bordering them and slowly pulled herself up to a standing position.  Leaning against the wall, struggling to breathe with one punctured lung and massive blood loss, Julie was shot for the sixth time that day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slug went in the right side of her rib cage, near the back, and exited the left side near the front.  Its path of destruction lie just beneath her heart, sparing her at least a few more minutes of tormented life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squawked in pain and fell to the shower floor.  She pulled herself up against the far wall and examined her multiple gun shot wounds.  She looked at the streaks of blood leading back to her locker, the splatters on the wall, the blood still squirting out of her body, the pools of it on the shower floor.  Then she looked at Jon, who had followed her into the shower, and wondered how much time she had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shot six times with a .357 magnum, when one shot was supposed to do the trick.</i>  \"Jesus Jon,\" she said.  \"You really got me good.\"  She tried to remain light-hearted and calm, ignoring the fact that her impending doom was creeping ever closer with each passing second.  \"You still wanna go on that date with me?\"  Julie forced a sad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you tear up that note, Julie?\" Jon asked, choking back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So that's what this is all about,</i> Julie thought to herself.  <i>He saw me rip up his stupid fucking note.  Oh God, why did I tear up that note?  Why did he give me that note in the first place?  Fuck, it was all just so fucked up.</i>  \"I don't know,\" she said. It was the truth. She wasn't really sure of anything any more.  \"What do you think happens when you die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon shrugged, beginning to cry now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA violent coughing spell brought splatters of blood from Julie\u2019s perfect lips, but she didn\u2019t care.  She simply wiped absent-mindedly at her mouth with the back of her hand, and continued to ponder the only mystery that held any meaning for her anymore.  \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she said plainly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Julie,\u201d Jon said.  Tears were streaming freely down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled, \u201cCheer up, you\u2019re not the one dying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll go to heaven,\u201d Jon told her, rather unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Julie agreed, \u201cbut I\u2019m pretty nervous.  What if heaven\u2019s not real?  Or worse, what if I go to hell?  I did tear up your note.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that wasn\u2019t such a big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie grimaced at this.  \u201cThen why\u2019d you shoot me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Julie.  I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, Jon,\" was all she said. Those were her last words. She took one final breath and died, her beautiful blue eyes staring emptily off into eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He needed to know she wasn't interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon was sitting in the third row of the stands, leaning forward and propping his head up on his hands.  He looked like he was in another world, his eyes distant and dreamy behind his thick, shiny glasses.  Short and goofy, Jon was often picked on, and sometimes Julie did feel for him.  Maybe she only pitied him, but she would try to be gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she jogged over to where he sat she could hear her teammates cawing at her behind her back.  <i>Fuck 'em, I'm doing the right thing.</i>  They could all go to hell for all she cared.

It was his smile.  That creepy fucking smile.  She supposed she'd have to face up to him sooner or later, but she just wasn't ready.  Maybe she could bump into him in the hallway sometime.  It might be easier to break his heart in a crowded setting as she hurried on her way to class.  As she jogged back onto the floor, Julie could see that something was up.  Erika and a few of the other girls were gaping at her with slack jawed horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wr...\"  Julie was interrupted mid sentence by the report of a gun shot.  She had stopped running, now frozen in a stiff position, her face contorted with confused disbelief.  Looking down at herself, Julie saw a black hole in her white T shirt just above her right breast.  As she watched, blood began to pump out of her body and course down her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked at her teammates with wide, questioning eyes, as if to say, <i>what's this?</i>  Of course, Julie knew what had happened, but her mind refused to accept it.  <i>Maybe I'm dreaming,</i> she thought.  There was another gun shot, and Julie felt the bullet tear through her chest, exiting from her right breast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's body jerked with the impact, and a splash of blood stained the hardwood floor a dark, sinister red.  Blinking prettily, Julie flinched as she was shot a third time.  This bullet left a hole in the left side of her shirt, under her left breast, spilling more of her blood as it ripped through her perfect young body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expressive blue eyes were panicked and pain stricken, desperate for help, and Julie opened her mouth as if to speak, but no words came.  Instead, crimson spewed from her parted lips.  Her lungs were filling up with blood, and she was drowning.  Her facial expression gave the impression that she wasn't sure whether to laugh or to cry.  Her once sturdy legs were suddenly flimsy as straws, and Julie sank to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more gun shots crashed through the gym, and Julie's back arched as the two slugs struck her in the lower dorsal.  A pair of exit wounds opened up in her belly, one on each side of her navel, and blood spouted from her abdomen, soaking her gym shorts and streaming down her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pressed her hands to her mid section, Julie was shot for the sixth time that fateful day.  The bullet entered her upper back, narrowly missing her spine, travelled downward through her body at a thirty degree angle, punched through the most vital muscle in her body, and exited between her breasts.   Jon had delivered the coupe de grace, shooting her through the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's astounding blue eyes bulged in their sockets, her perfect mouth yawning in shock, and she collapsed face first on the gym floor.  She raised her head slightly, tried to pick herself back up, then fell still.  Julie Huerta was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never learned why Jon shot her.  She never knew he had been spying on her in the hallway, and that he had watched her tear up his letter.</span></div></div>",

Typical, she was so caught up in her own world, why would she pay any attention to little old Jon?  Why would anybody pay him any attention, except to kick him in the balls, for that matter?  Nobody gave a shit about him.  He was worthless.  He was a loser.  A perverted loser, according to Julie.  He had been listening to her in the hallway when she read his note.  She hadn't seen him, as usual, but he had heard every word she said.  He saw what she had done.  He had spent weeks laboring over that note, deciding what to put in it, deciding whether or not he should give it to her.  He had stressed over it so, and she had simply balled it up and torn it to shreds.  Well, he was through being ignored.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his cock harden as he watched Julie walk over to the stands.  She was so beautiful it almost hurt just to look at her.  Her cheeks were flushed with color, bright red from the hustling and bustling on the court.  Her soft, chocolate colored hair was pulled back in a pony tail, revealing her toned neck and her bare shoulders.  She had tucked her sleeves inside and cut off the bottom of her T-shirt so her smooth, flat stomach was exposed.  Her blue eyes sparkled, her stunning face alight with vibrant beauty.  It was a shame she had to die.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon had rushed home as soon as school let out and had returned with his trusty hunting knife and his father's .45.  It was payback time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled radiantly at Jon as he walked up to meet her.  \"Jon, your note was really sweet and all, but I-uhhh\".  At first Julie thought she had just been socked in the stomach, but as she looked down she saw the knife handle protruding from her soft belly.  She could see where the blade had punctured the skin of her bare midriff, and she could see her blood spurting from her body around the edges of the blade, splashing Jon's shirt and hands.  Julie looked back up at Jon with stunned amazement.  She had certainly not been expecting this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've been stabbed in the stomach.  I can't believe this fucker really stabbed me in the stomach!</i>  </span></div></div>",

Jon stumbled backwards, holding his ruined nose with both hands, and after a few jagged steps back he plopped down on his ass. Blood was streaming from his nostrils, running through his hands, and he looked up at Julie with accusing eyes.  The irony in that expression was not lost on Julie, as she had received much worse than she had dished out, but it pleased her to see the surprise and pain on Jon's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting her attention to the metal buried in her guts, she saw an alarming amount of blood spurting from her belly. <i>Is this fatal?</i> she wondered. She tried to imagine dying here on the basketball court, the same court she had just been sprinting up and down, dribbling, slicing through the lane, knocking down jumpers, having the time of her life, and she couldn't do it. It was just too much to wrap her mind around. Unthinkable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes were wide, and she was beginning to feel a bit light headed and woozy.  Her shorts were pretty well soaked, and spatters of blood were falling at her feet.  A heavy tapestry of crimson wove its way down her thighs, to her thick, hearty calves.  She kept expecting them to come rushing to her aid, but as she staggered towards them a few girls actually took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might need some help here,\" she said, trying to laugh.  She didn't want to sound like a pussy, but she did have a fucking knife sticking out of her stomach for Christ's sakes.  Not even the coach made a move to help her, which she found peculiar.  Adults were supposed to be in control, always.  If her coach wouldn't even help her, who would?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she heard the first gun shot, and she understood.  Even as the bullet struck her in the small of her back, even as her blood sprayed from the exit wound under her sternum, she understood.  No one had tried to help her because the fucking psychopath behind her was now wielding a gun.  She understood that she was doomed, and there would be no tomorrow for poor Julie.  There would be no next week, no next hour, probably no next five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stood still for a moment, looking at the ghastly exit wound that had just opened in her stomach, above the knife handle that still jutted from her body like some warped tumor.  \"Oh,\" she said, and once again tried to wrap her head around her own mortality.  <i>Fuck, this is really it.</i>  It still just didn't seem possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie took another step forward, towards her retreating team mates, and she was shot again.  Her right thigh went numb, and she saw a hole open up in the meat of her leg, just below her hip.  Julie cried out, and as she began to stumble to her knees another shot quickly followed, the round punching through her right buttocks and exiting through the front of her right hip.  She was going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than her knees touched the gymnasium floor did a fourth bullet tear through her body, destroying one of her kidneys and exiting just beneath her left rib cage.  Julie wailed, voicing her distress, but the cry she emitted was more animal than human.  It was this haunting sound that sent most of her team mates fleeing the gym, screaming at the top of their lungs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill struggling to escape her fate, Julie shuffled forward on her knees.  Three more shots were fired in rapid succession behind her, stopping her in her tracks.  She now had exit wounds in the right side of her chest, below her collar bone, in her right nipple, and just inside the curve of her right breast.  It had been a close cluster of shots.  Her right lung was ruined and her aorta artery severed.  Blood now filled the back of her throat.  Spilling over her lush lower lip, it covered her chin with gore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie arched her back, but despite the massive damage she had sustained she managed to keep upright, on her knees.  She was young and up until two minutes ago had been in excellent health, and she had stamina.  Her mind still locked in the natural instinct of flight, Julie fell forward onto her elbows and began to crawl across the floor.  Occasionally the butt of the knife caught on the hardwood and dug into her belly, but Julie kept moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't made it more than five feet before Jon was standing behind her, all five feet and two inches of him towering over her, and he shot her for the eighth time that day.  The bullet bit into the back of her left thigh, causing Julie to cry out again.  He was targeting her non vital parts, intent on making her suffer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLAM!  Her left buttocks.  BLAM!  Her lower back, creating another exit wound in her belly.  BLAM! Her left shoulder.  Julie rolled onto her back, no longer able to crawl away but not willing to collapse onto her stomach and drive the blade further into her guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood spewed from her mouth, spattering her cheeks and turning her lips the color of roses.  Julie looked up at Jon with wild, breath-taking blue eyes, and pleaded with him.  \"Stop.  Please stop,\" she croaked.  Jon knelt beside her, his eyes cold, and in his face Julie could see hate and rage that could not be reasoned with.  Jon had gone mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boke my mose,\" Jon told her in a stuffy voice.  He pressed the barrel of his pistol against her midsection and fired another round into her guts.  Julie rolled her eyes in disgust and choked on a mouthful of blood.  \"You like bat, you bitch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm really dying.</i>  Julie couldn't understand it.  Why was she dying at the hands of her self-professed lover?  The feeling left her fingers and toes, then the rest of her body.  White light blotted out her vision, and she went deaf.  <i>Why?</i>  This was her final thought before her life was extinguished, here one moment and gone the next.  She died with this question lingering in her head, unanswered.</span></div></div>",

Outraged by this absurd injustice, Julie dropped down on her knees, straddling the bastard, and began to rain down punches on him.  The pain in her stomach became secondary to the satisfaction she felt as she pulverized her foe, but when Jon took hold of the knife handle and pulled the blade in loop down below her navel, then up through her belly until it nearly reached her ribs, Julie's brow furrowed and her assault reached a stand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lowered to see the mess Jon had made of her, and to her horror she saw a tangle of her intestines falling out onto Jon's chest and spilling over to the gymnasium floor.  Julie closed both hands around Jon's on the handle jutting out of her belly and managed to overpower him, forcing the steel from her flesh.  Despite being disemboweled, Julie was stronger than her diminutive admirer.  Perhaps the desperation of her situation granted her even greater strength, and she wrenched the knife from Jon's hands.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately Jon was ready, and he caught her wrists as she tried to lower the blade.  Still, her strength gave her the edge, and the tip of the weapon gradually descended towards the boy's throat.  Before she could open his jugular, however, Julie's eyes opened wide and her strength faltered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon had shoved a hand through the gaping hole in her belly and was groping around in her innards.  Her mouth gaped and she emitted low, guttural noises as Jon took hold of something inside of her and yanked it from her body.  Decimated, Julie fell back on her ass and clutched herself.  Something had ruptured in her abdominal cavity and massive amounts of blood was spurting and gushing from her tummy.  She looked at the organ Jon held in his hands and felt certain it was something vital, maybe her pancreas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it back,\" she told him, numb from shock.  \"I need that to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon laughed at her.  \"Do you eben know what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's my pancreas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon laughed again and placed the organ on the floor of the gym, then smashed it with his fist.  \"Let's see ib you can libe without it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" Julie muttered grimly.  <i>Doesn't matter.  I'm bleeding to death anyway.</i>  She looked at the scarlet fountain that had sprung from her midriff and wondered how much longer she'd last.  It turned out to be less than five minutes, and Julie faded into oblivion before the first paramedics arrived on the scene.</span></div></div>",

Julie could feel the cold steel slicing up her insides, but was powerless to stop it.  \"Jon, please.\"  Suddenly Jon yanked the blade from her flesh.  A fresh spurt of blood jettisoned from her body as the blade no longer plugged the hole in her belly, and Jon plunged the blade back into her guts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon,\" Julie stammered uselessly.  Jon pulled the blade from her belly and thrust it back into her a third time.  Then a fourth time and a fifth time.  Again and again the blade slipped in and out of Julie's tender belly, slicing her to ribbons.  Her blood spurted and splashed down her thighs, on her tennis shoes, all over the court.  Jon was soaked with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jesus Christ, he's killing me.  He's fucking killing me right here in front of everyone.</i>  Julie managed to turn around and face her teammates.  By now she had been stabbed fifteen times in the stomach.  Her hands were pressed to her midsection and a look of grim horror marked her stunning facial features.  Jon just went on stabbing her, now focusing his thrusts on the small of her back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flaaalllp,\" Julie gasped, blood spraying from her mouth as she spoke.  She grunted and sighed tiredly as Jon continued to ventilate her lower back, punching his nasty hunting knife into her body repeatedly.  Her back arched and she felt her legs go weak as her strength slowly left her.  Most of her teammates only stood gawking, watching as Julie was butchered like a pig.  The rest of them fled the gym with their hands over their mouths, stifling their screams.  <i>Why won't they help me?  Can't they see I'm dying?</i> Julie wondered.  Even the coach stood idly by, watching in horror as Julie's blood flooded the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelpless against the onslaught of stab wounds, Julie sunk to her knees.  The knife continued to poke holes in her body, now piercing her upper torso.  She felt the steel scraping against her ribs as it slipped into her side, under her breasts, into her upper back, through her breasts.  Her internal organs were in ruins.  She feebly tried to shield herself from further damage, but received a few stab wounds in her upper arms for her troubles.  Finally, after sustaining sixty-seven stab wounds, Julie collapsed on the floor, gasping for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes rolled wildly in their sockets, blood gushed freely from dozens of punctures, and horrible guttural noises escaped her throat.  More blood poured from her mouth and nose, streaming down her silky cheeks.  Jon took one last look at her before dropping the knife and running out the back door.  With Jon out of the way, Coach Munoz and some of the girls hurried to Julie's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked around at them all with a level of panic that bordered on madness.  If she could only be one of the girls standing around with shocked looks on their faces, not the one lying here in a pool of her own blood.  God, what she wouldn't give to trade places with any one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm fucking dying because some stupid fucking kid had a crush on me.  This is so unfair.</i>  The world was fading.  The faces hovering over her were hidden behind spots of gray.  Julie stammered and spat blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, Julie.  Stay with us.\"  It was Coach Munoz.  The stupid, cowardly bitch who had just stood by and watched Julie get slaughtered.  Who was she to tell Julie to hang on?  What did she know about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I n-n-nee-need.  I need m-my...\"  Julie choked on a mouthful of blood, then started over.  \"I n-n-n-nnnn...  I...\"  <i>What am I trying to say?  I need what?  And where's Chuckie?</i>  Julie's brain began to shut down, and delirium settled in as her final thoughts rambled through her head.  <i>Is this what it's like, Chuckie?  Is this really the end?  What will mom think when she finds out I'm gone?</i>  There was no one to answer these questions, of course.  For Julie there would be no more answers at all.  For her it was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie died right there on the gym floor, her promising young life cut violently short.</span></div></div>",
