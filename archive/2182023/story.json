It was Reiuji Utsuho, an Yamagarasu who have the ability to manipulate the atoms. She was doing her job looking out the hell until she spotted something strange. She saw an small island that had metal gate on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cInyu? What\u2019s that?\u201d Utsuho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She flew down to the island and looked at the seal, and it had the paperus that wrote Hakurei seal on it. She didn\u2019t know why or how it came here until one of the person came to her. It was kaenbyo Orin, the hell cat who gets the souls from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHiya okuu, say..what\u2019s with this place?\u201d Orin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOrin..I don\u2019t know, i just came across with it.\u201d Okuu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, they both felt an dark power from the sealment. They quivered little from the power until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n GYAAAA!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both okuu and Orin flicked and flew back as the seal bursted in black flames, the seal faded away and the wall suddenly got cut in four ways. As it went down, okuu and Orin gotten ready to fight as deep in the cave, a man with chained shackles on both his arms and his stomach were so thin they could see the ribs, came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m free..at last!!\u201d Man shouted, \u201cafter 300 years of sealment, i am free!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey, who\u2019re you!?\u201d Orin shouted.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The man looked at the two and just grinned, engulfing in black flames and came infront of Orin and grabbed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUntil my body and soul regenerates, I\u2019ll use you as my vessel.\u201d Man Said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c\u201dNot if I can help it.\u201d Okuu shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She shot many bullets but he dodged it still grabbing Orin. She tried to escape but he summoned a tornado made from lava and darkness. Okuu shoutes her name as Orin shouted, the tornado went away, revealing Orin herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOrin?\u201d Okuu spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then saw her with red/purple eyes at her and she just smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI shall exact revenge...but first, you must disappear.\u201d Orin spoke in different tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOrin!?\u201d Okuu spoke in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She summoned a Tant\u014d knife and slit her wrist, and the blood ran, making a chains and spikes, and attacked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHave fun dear.\u201d Orin spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then disappeared in darkness while Okuu fought the blood chains. 4 minutes later Orin was at the house in the forest. She went in and noticed nobody was home. She went upstairs and got to the bed room and laid down as it was night time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c300 years...since master have named me Mu, the nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man was none other then Mu himself.

He clearly remembers the day when the Hakurei Miko and the others sealed him in the former hell. It Was a nightmare for him as he never ate or drank, he withered as he was about to die. The only reason he was alive is because he achieved the dark magehood that prolonged his lifespan and conserved his energy to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat should I do now...maybe I should see my old friend.\u201d Mu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He got his dark robe and got outside. He felt the rain on his skin, feeling nostalgic for many years and then he walked toward the mountain.

He had thoughts on what he shall do and pretended to be Orin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHalt! Why are you, a hell cat being in this area?\u201d Tengu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhy, I was just strolling around, that\u2019s all.\u201d Mu spoke in cutesy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBullshit!

How laugha-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n STAB STAB STAB!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Tengu felt horrible pain as she looked, the chains soaked in blood hit her shoulders and her heart, piercing her heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDark chains.\u201d Mu spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Tengu coughed blood, said nothing and fell to her death. The chains came back and dropped into a puddle of blood. He healed himself with dark heal and made an fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHm, still intact and good.\u201d Mu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt sure was master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mu turned and saw the little oni.

The villagers bid farewell to Kagero as he left with his bag full of food, water, cloth and a sword in case of defense.

He wondered what the paper were and touched it until it sparked at his hand, flinched by it and backed off as he saw the paper floated up In midair, it unfolded itself and a hologram appeared. The hologram revealed as a man with mid long black hair, light purple skin and a horn sticking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGreetings, visitor. If you are seeing this, then you are listening to my voice from past.\u201d Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Who\u2019s  this man?) Kagero thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me introduce myself. I am Beta Bluesteel, one of the member of blue-bell clan and the teacher of omega arts, the dark arts of magic combat.\u201d He stated, \u201cI am immortal, and have lived for over thousand years until I was exiled from my clan for marrying a mortal woman and having an half immortal daughter. My clan have died 10 years after my exile and my younger brothers have scattered elsewhere. After I have taught my daughter the art of omega, she was kidnapped and forcefully became an killing machine by being the strong dark mage. I knew she would be dangerous so I have sealed myself so she would be sealed in the book of dark magic and obituary. If you desire to live in this house, then I shall grant you my permission to live here. With that, I bid you farewell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that\u2019s, the paper swirled and caught on blue fire. It was on fire for moment and then it crumpled down in ashes. Kagero were little skeptical about what this beta person was talking about. He never heard of blue belle clan or any dark mages in the past. But this was Gensokyo, and he thought that maybe it might have existed back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, I should unpack my stuff and look around this house.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then picked up his bag and looked around. He looked deeper and noticed the bathroom, room with toilet, kitchen and dining room. He then noticed the stares that leads to upstairs and once he got up he noticed two rooms. He went to the first room and it was normal room that had bed, desk and a window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI should take this room for myself.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then put the bag down and unpacked his cloth and put it in the closet near him. Once he did he got out and went to other room, revealing a room that were little girlish side on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis might have been that mans daughters room.\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then went downstairs to living room and sat down on the chair to wait until the rain stops. </span></div></div>",

It took an hour, and he finally made it to the manor as the place were red like crimson flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He went forward and got to the gate.

She turns and came before him and punched his stomach, making him cough blood. He knelt before her and the red haired female were before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou cannot beat me, now scram before-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI think you should stop meiling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Someone stopped the red headed lady and Kagero looked up, seeing a blue haired girl with light red dress on and a bat wings on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut lady remilia, he\u2019s an intruder.\u201d Meiling said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, an intruder with good intentions...now mortal, why did you come to my domain?\u201d Remilia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (So that\u2019s the vampire I hear at village) Kagero thought, still bleeding, \u201c...I have heard an artifact that grants the wielder an unlimited power hidden in this place. Do you have it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Remilia thought for moment and then chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf I had that, I would be invincible. But no, I don\u2019t have it so why don\u2019t you leave now?\u201d Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut...I know it exists, please tell me!\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI said I don\u2019t know. Now go or I\u2019ll deal with you.\u201d Remilia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kagero were disappointed and knew he couldn\u2019t fight against the vampire so he was about to leave but he was injured and he wobbled as he got up. Remilia noticed this and sighs and turns to meiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMeiling, take him to one of the room so he could get some rest until he gets better.\u201d Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut my lady..\u201d Meiling spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo buts. Take him in.\u201d Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meiling sighed and helped him get inside to get some rest. Meanwhile at the mansions library, a purple haired female in purple/white gowns sat reading some book while an red headed female in suit and four wings stood putting some books away. They were patchouli knowladge, the witch and Koakuma, her assistant. She was putting some books away until she noticed an unfamiliar book at the end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that...? Did master knowledge forgot to put it away?\u201d Koakuma mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She came to the book and picked it up. It was a book leathered in pure black and had a crest of ruby that were so red it looked bathed in blood. She then looked at the title and it wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Omega secrecy of dark magic and obituary<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI didn\u2019t know master knowledge had this.\u201d Koakuma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then opens the book and saw many texts that it was horrific to her, even the gods would quiver in fear. She turns the pages and noticed pictures of mages with red liquid around itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat is this..?\u201d Koakuma spoke.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Then suddenly..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *sob* don\u2019t kill me..<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Koakuma turned and didn\u2019t see anyone standing then the voice continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Please don\u2019t kill me..*sob*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWho are you!?\u201d Koakuma spoke in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Don\u2019t kill me, please no...!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She shivered down her spine and just knelt down in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n DON\u2019T KILL ME, NO, NO,NO!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Koakuma heart began to beat fast as fear came before her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n DONT KILL ME, FATHER HELP ME!! IYAAAA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Koakuma then heard some sort of noise and looked up, and saw an shadow came down and gotten hanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n GUGE!!??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIyaaa!!\u201d Koakuma screamed in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was shivering in fear as she heard an heartbeat coming from the book. Moment later patchouli came to her and saw her on the floor. She came to her picking her up as Koakuma we\u2019re shaking with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKoakuma! What\u2019s wrong!?

How laughable.\u201d Tengu laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou\u2019ll be laughing now, but you have underestimated me.\u201d Kagero replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then dashed toward and swung the sword, hitting one of the Tengu. He bled and Kooni were astonished for him to defend her. She smiled as the Tengu youkais began to attack him, she rose her hand at them. Kagero and the youkais began to feel heaviness and the youkais dropped to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHave you youkais forgot that I have power to manipulate gravity. Now die, fools.\u201d Kooni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She pushed the youkais down, squashing them with then spewing blood. Kagero were astonished to see this and turned to Kooni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKooni, you..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDo t worry Kagero, it\u2019s my fault they tried to attack us. I just did what I should do.\u201d Kooni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, more reinforcements came and the fight began as Kagero swings his katana, Kooni punched and kicked the youkais face and body. After 20 mi utes of fighting, the remaining tengu youkais were in bad shape and got the living ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDamn you human and oni, we will not forget this!\u201d Youkais spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They then left the scene, leaving many dead youkais on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat should we do about these dead one?\u201dKooni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe should at least bury them.\u201d Kagero replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as he was about to get some item to dig a hole, Kooni felt an dark presence and told him to stop. He asked what\u2019s wrong until he noticed a black hole appearing and from it, a book materialized and fell on the ground. Kagero and Kooni didn\u2019t know how the book appears before them and as Kagero was about to pick it up, the book floated, and it opened itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat the..!\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The book then made a mage circle and summoned a black flames, incinerating the dead bodies. Both Kagero and Kooni defended themselves as the flames were so black it could turn the day to night. Kagero lowers his arm and came closer to the book and stood before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKagero? What are you doing?\u201d Kooni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI think..I found the thing I heared back at the village.\u201d Kagero said, \u201cSo this is the artifact...it was a book after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The book then closed itself and Kagero took the book. He read the books title as it was a dark book of obituary. The crested ruby made him wonder if this book could help him get stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKooni, I\u2019m taking this book for my future training.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut Kagero, I feel disturbed by this book. Are you sure it\u2019s ok?\u201d Kooni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt will be fine, trust me.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She felt skeptical but agrees to let him hold on to it. They went back in and had some dinner, took bath and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

It had many text that he couldn\u2019t since it was an unknown language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDamn, how can I train when I don\u2019t understand what this book is written?\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, he saw the texts move, and it transformed into a text that he could understand. He was surprised by this and started to read the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLets see...the great mage war ended in stagnation between alpha and omega tribes, fusioned by one master to become the clan of chosened one...huh, I wonder..\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He flipped few more pages until he noticed the pages on how to use the omega style magic and combats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAh, there it is...let\u2019s see. This is called..the \u2018dark chains\u2019...it feeds upon the casters blood and it turns into a bloody chains, piercing at the enemy\u2019s and on...so I need to bleed myself?\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then took out a Tant\u014d and looked at his wrist. He breathed in and slit his wrist. Pain flowed him as he blood fell, he spoke the chant from the book. The black book made an dark aura, and the blood then took form of chains and surrounded him. He felt astonished by this and looked at one of the tree and gotten ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cChains, attack!\u201d Kagero shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bloody chains then struck the tree, making a huge hole on it and it fell down. Kageros eyes were wide as he looked at his arm now strapped with bloody chains, and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis power, this is what I seemed. I can now become more powerful so I can protect the village from harm!!\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then laughed lightly and continued to study the book until he noticed Kooni standing, rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKooni, did I wake you up?\u201d Kagero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI felt some dark presence while I was asleep..was it you?\u201d Kooni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kagero was quiet for moment and then smiled as the dark chains surrounded him, Koonis sleepiness faded away and opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKooni, I can now train more thanks to this book. With this, I can now defend the one I care about by destroying the enemy from anywhere!\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKagero..\u201d Kooni spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I wouldn\u2019t dare harm you. You are my allies you see? I\u2019ll never put my hands on you.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kooni came closer to him as she saw his iris turn slit for moment and then turns back to normal. She felt little uncomfortable by this but it was him that saved her life from loneliness and hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf you choose to go to that road, then I will accompany you.\u201d Kooni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThank you Kooni. I am truly grateful to have you on my side.\u201d Kagero replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He looked back at the book and read some texts and he spoke few words and his wounds were healed. Kooni were amazed to see this and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKagero, you were injured?\u201d Kooni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man nodded, \u201cthe omega arts needs blood in order to harness the power and ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, the ruby glowed and Kagero sheathed the wakizashi and slit his belly area. As it bled, Kagero turns some pages and saw the page on how to wield sword related omega style Magic\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLets see..concentrate the blood into the sword and it becomes more deadly..also known as \u2018dark sword\u2019..I should use my katana and wakizashi for this.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He unsheathes his katana as he remembers the word, he put the book down and chanted, making the blood trail go to the sword. It surrounded the blade and it made an dark aura on it, making Kagero grin and looked at other trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLets see if my sword became stronger.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He swiped both his sword, making a blood blade to run at the tree and it cut it clean. As the tree fell, kageros grin become little sinister and Kooni noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis for the brighter future, for the safety of my village.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The books ruby shines redder and the blood that Kagero spilled suddenly went toward the book. The two noticed it and when the blood covered the book and touched the ruby, it opened itself. Both Kagero and Kooni came close and noticed a picture of young girl with black hair and some sort of tribal cloth on its book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d Kooni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kagero picked it up and read the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSakura, Master mage of omega style...this is intriguing.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, the book floated and backed off, covered itself in blood and black smog. They didn\u2019t know what was going on until someone came out of the smog. It was the same girl, but with black coat on her.

The girl, with blackhair with brown/purple Heterochromian eyes with slit pupil looking at them. Kooni didn\u2019t know what to say then Kagero came forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI am. My name is Kagero Onitsuka, a mortal who seek power to defend the one I care.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was a silence and then the girl spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI see. I am Sakura Blubelle, daughter of immortal father and mortal mother, and a master of omega style dark magic.\u201d She said, \u201cand as for this defending thing...are you sure you are strong enough to use this magic properly?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI think I am.\u201d Kagero answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was an anger vein on her forehead and then she suddenly disappeared, only to reappearing infront of Kagero. Kooni used her power but Sakura immediately summoned two swords from darkness and cut her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGyaa!!\u201d Kooni screeched in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKooni!!\u201d Kagero responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, Sakura puts two swords on his throat. He felt terrified by her presence as she looked down at him and Kooni were in pain, the blood of oni swirled around Sakura and made an braided chains and pointed at Kagero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t take any users of my book lightly. If you can use it, you must have the power to use it.\u201d Sakura said, \u201cno ifs or buts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou....I...I can use it!\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh? Then hit me your best shot boy.\u201d Sakura said, \u201cbut before that..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then turns to Kooni and casted a spell. The arm that were chopped away came back to Kooni and healed itself. Kooni couldnt believe what she was seeing as the dark mage backed off, she told Kagero to fight now. He dashed toward her with his katana and fought her but she easily defended herself by the blood that Kooni spilled and then she used her sword to cover with blood, making a dark sword and pointed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cC\u2019mon boy, is that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d Sakura spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGrraa!!\u201d Kagero shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He too made an dark sword and they both clashed. Kagero were hitting hard as Sakura just smiled and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou are just like the others: weak of heart and easily consumed by the darkness.\u201d Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m going to show you the proper way of using magic.\u201d Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, a gust of dark wind hit him and blew him to the back. As he did, Sakura summoned two lances from darkness and blood, stabbing him hard and finally when hime hit on the tree, Sakura stabbed his stomach with the dark sword. Kagero coughed blood as he was bleeding badly, the blood was only going toward the lances and the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis is the way me and my ancestors have fought against the light mages long time ago.\u201d Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLong time....ago?..you mean-\u201c<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cYes, the great mage war that happened over 10,000 years ago.\u201d Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then took off the sword and the lances away, dropping him down to the ground. The weapons faded away as he was dying from bleeding, Sakura looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cEven if your that weak, do you still want to become like me, a dark mage?\u201d Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were silence, and she just sighed and was about to leave until she heard him getting up. He was bleeding, but he was still determined to be stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPlease...teach me everything...you know, so I can...*cough* defend the one I care...the most..\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then fell again on the ground. She thought for moment and then turned and came to him, healing his wounds with dark recovery. When he was recovered, Sakura just looking at him and then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYour training shall start tomorrow.\u201d Sakura said, \u201cfor now, get some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She helped get him up by floating and went back to the house. Kooni were there and hugged Kagero as they arrived, he petted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKagero, Kagero!! I thought you were dead!\u201d Kooni said with some tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDo not worry, little oni. I will become stronger as for today, Sakura becomes my master.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kooni looked at her and bowed to her for not killing him.

He was thinking about becoming the dark mage itself and then he heard a door open. It was Sakura and she came to him with a sake gourd on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cCan\u2019t sleep, my apprentice?\u201d Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes...say, about your history. I want to know little bout it.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMy history? You mean the history of mages?\u201d Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He nodded and she thought for moment and told him to go to the other side of the house. He didn\u2019t know why but he went as she followed, they got to the area. She spoke in ancient tongue, and a portal was opened, revealing a beautiful land with grassy land and some tree sprouting. She told him to go in and as they got in, Sakura started to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou see, 10,000 years ago, there was a war between the alpha mages and omega mages, that would be known as the great mage war. Nobody knows what caused the war, but the death toll were magnificently high to the point they almost went extinct. Fortunately, one hero who became the master of both alpha and omega arts ended the war, making them the pact that they will fuse to become a the clan that later be known as bluebell clan.\u201d Sakura started to speak, \u201cthe clan had issues, but lived together for over many millenniums. They had one thing in mind: never let a mortal live in the land.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhy is that master?\u201d Kagero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThey believed that mortals blood were impure, and it would stain the purity of the clans bloodline. My father broke that law by marrying my mother, a mortal. For that he and my mother were exiled from the village. I don\u2019t know why, but the clan then were destroyed with in decade later.\u201d Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They then got to the tall tree with gravestone infront of the tree. On the gravestone it wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Here lies Sakurako, wife of immortal and mother of half blooded daughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n May your soul be free in this garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMaster, this is..\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis is my mothers grave. She died from giving birth to me.\u201d Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kagero were little saddened by this and he lightly bowed to the grave. Sakura looked at him and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou know, your the first human to set foot in this sacred grove.\u201d Sakura said, \u201cyou should be honored.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnd I am.\u201d He replied, \u201cSay, why were you in the book?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI was deemed too dangerous, so my father sealed me into the book by using his soul and his body as the catalyst. I managed to break free for moment after I took some sip of your blood.\u201d Sakura replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He nodded and they went back outside and sakura closed the portal. He then went to the bed room to sleep as Sakura looked at the sky, she drank some sake and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis might be an opportunity to train him properly.\u201d Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then went back in to go to sleep...</span></div></div>",

After the training, Sakura clapped her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood, you are doing great job my apprentice.\u201d Sakura said, \u201cyou might have became even with me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThank you master.

Kagero were saddened and as he picked up the book, he held the book tightly and turned to Kooni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKooni, I am going back to my village. I want you to stay here to watch over the house.\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut Master, I cant just see you go alone.\u201d Kooni spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m doing this for your own good Kooni. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt by my fellow humans.\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then handed the book to Kooni, telling her to defend the book as long as she lives.

It took him 30 minutes to reach the destination and once he arrived, he saw the guards standing at the gate. As he walked, they stopped him with spears across the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHalt, who goes through the gate?\u201d Guard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI am Kagero Onizuka, one of the person who worked as a guard here.\u201d Kagero responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKagero? You mean..the one who searched for the artifact?\u201d Guard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d Kagero responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe must tell the elder he\u2019s back, follow me.\u201d One guard spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kagero nodded and went in. The village never changed and once he got to the elders house, the guard told him to wait and went inside. 5 mi utes later, he came back with elder coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh Kagero, it have been 15 years. Where were you all along?\u201d Elder asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the delay, I have found the artifact that I seeked and trained in isolated area.\u201d Kagero answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPlease, come in. We must discuss over this matter.\u201d Elder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He nodded and went inside as the silhouette of a female stood not too far. Back at the house, Kooni were worried about Kagero, but trusted his words that he\u2019ll be back and held the book tight. Back in the village, Kagero told everything he knew to the elder and how he became stronger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI see, so the artifact was a book that had many variations of magic.\u201d Elder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, and because of that I have became a mage who wields weapons as well.\u201d Kagero replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then summoned a small black fireball infront of the elder. He was astonished to see this and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI see, I see..well then, I shall approve your-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHold on a second!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The voice stopped elders approval for Kagero and they turned to see a long blue haired female with light blue dress and a weird blue hat on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMs.Kamishirasawa, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Elder asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was Keine Kamishirasawa, a were-hakutaku Youkai who teaches at the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI sense a darkness from that man. I do not approve him at all!\u201d Keine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut ms.kamishirasawa, he came back to defend us.\u201d Elder spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo, I sense bloodlust from him. Do not fall for it Elder.\u201d Keine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSame as mine, sir.\u201d Voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n From behind a short purple haired girl in kimono walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMs.Hieda.\u201d Elder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was Hieda No Akyuu, one of the humans who have ability to never forget once remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI do not trust one bit from him, so I would reconsider your decision.\u201d Akyuu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kagero became annoyed and stood up as both Keine and Akyuu looked at him with stern eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHow dare you say such things. I came back to defend this village, not destroy it. You two are just saying without logic.\u201d Kagero said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe have logic, mr.onizuka, and we shall not let you be free any further.\u201d Keine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Elder was worried but then Kagero smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cFine, I\u2019ll deal with you right now!\u201d Kagero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He u sheathed the swords and tackled Keine. They fought as Akyuu and the elder saw the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The fight lasted.</span></div></div>",

Keine rushes toward him but he stabbed her with the chains. Keine screamed in pain as she panted, she saw his eye color turned into red/purple Heterochromia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou are a fool, Kamishirasawa, for standing up against me.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGrr...haah...is this the power hidden in his..blood?\u201d  Keine spoke in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kagero then crossed his sword and built some power. Keine realized he was about to deliver the final blow on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow die, you worm! Dark..cross!!!\u201d Kagero shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He slashed and the x-shaped blade ran toward her. She closed her eyes, believing she\u2019ll die, but something stopped the attack. She opened her eyes and saw a Miko standing with a talesman guarding the attack. Once it went away, the Miko came forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI had bad feeling about it..so it was you, huh?\u201d Miko spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou..you\u2019re that Hakurei Miko, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI am.\u201d Miko said, \u201cand I\u2019m here to put end to your actions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kagero grinned and laughed, then he put the wakizashi away, only his katana open, ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLet\u2019s dance, my enemy. I\u2019m the one who\u2019ll defend this land.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLets see about that.\u201d Miko replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They then started to fight. Back at the house, Kooni could no longer wait for Kagero to come back so she out to find him at the human village. Back at the village, the fight was on as the Hakurei Miko used her fist and the spirit stick to fight against Kagero. As the fight intensified, kagero was about to attack her until two gaps opened and a hands grabbed his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat the!?\u201d Kagero spoke in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Miko then used her fist and punched his stomach hard. He coughed blood as it spilled it to the ground, he noticed a female in purple dress coming out next to Hakurei Miko. It was Yukari Yakumo, the gap Youkai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou...you did this did didn\u2019t you!?\u201d Kagero spoke in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI cannot tolerate such vile man like you being free. Now you will perish here right now.\u201d Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kagero..then laughed. They didn\u2019t know why he was laughing then he stood up lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou fool. I have people behind me. As long as they trust me, I\u2019ll never be defeated.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He turned around, then he noticed the civilians backing off, even the elder himself. He didn\u2019t know why they were backing off then the elder spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKagero..I think I have changed my mind...please leave this village.\u201d Elder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut..Elder! I came to protect you all!! Why do you say such thing!?\u201d Kagero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYour not what you used to be. You were humble and modest...now you are nothing more than a beast lusting for blood..guards, help the Miko.\u201d Elder spole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The guards came to Miko and Yukari and gotten ready to fight. Kagero were dumbfounded by this and were speechless for moment, then he cackled in laughter and looked at the two females with hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cFine, If you all will betray me, then I shall kill you all!!\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The dark chains surrounded then hit the puddle of blood, than exploaded, shooting an blood needles. Many humans died, even the guards got hit and died from it. The Miko and Yukari got scraped and used their powers and put barriers around him, and using the special power to seal him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201carrgg!!let..me..go!!\u201d Kagero shouted in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou shall be sealed in the powerful seal for very long time. So you should say good bye now.\u201d Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNooo!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The voice came from back and it came out. It was Kooni herself and she was in tears as Kagero realized he couldn\u2019t do anything anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cKooni....my dear friend...I will leave now, but we\u2019ll meet again.\u201d Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then turned to the humans and others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAs for everybody, you all shall remember the day when I, Mu, shall come back with vengeance!!\u201d Kagero shouted in anger.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The light the engulfed him and he was sealed in hell. Kooni cried as both Miko and Yukari came to her, Yukari looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShe\u2019ll be dangerous, so I shall banish her myself.\u201d Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before she could open the gap, lol I jumped and punched her face. She wobnled as Miko tried to stop her, Kooni used her gravity ability and slammed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou will see him again, you worms, I garentee he will return!\u201d Kooni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then fled the scene, using the power of darkness she learned from Kagero. Miko stood up little as Yukari helped her up and then came to Keine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe shall have this peace for while.\u201d Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, we should have it.\u201d Keine replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And thus the human village returns to peace.</span></div></div>",
