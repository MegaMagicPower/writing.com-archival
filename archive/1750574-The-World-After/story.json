The first is a man that goes by the very generic name of Bob, his real name is Robert Willians, but he\u2019s said he\u2019d prefer Bob, Bob\u2019s an average looking 20 something guy, an average build, a tough looking face, that sort of thing, the second, a man, well, boy more than man really,is you, by the name of William, William Gonfree, you are only about 17 or so by your looks.

You two belong to Group Omega 32, a very run-down Group at that, not more than maybe half the walls can actually hold any kind of weight other than the pressure from the wind that buffets them nearly every day. The world went downhill a few years back, ten, twenty? No one really remembers, but it happened, some kind of infestation rushed all over the world, North, South, East, West, it didn\u2019t matter where you were, the infestation got you. Some called it a disease, some an infection, the threat has died down a lot since the first time someone found a way to ward off whatever it was, but it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you notice something on the ground that could prove valuable, do you...</span></div></div>",

What is it! I\u2019m busy over here!\u201d Bob called back, \u201cwhatever it is, it can wait, I think I found a car battery over here, gonna see if it still has any juice!\u201d Shaking your head at Bob, you bend down and pick up an old hand-held T.V. set, small 5 or so inch screen, long, but twisted, antennae, and a few knobs for changing channel. \u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019cha got little guy.\u201d you whisper, as you flip the power switch and turn a knob or two, \u201cHm, nothing, huh? Well I didn\u2019t really expect much, I mean, almost nothing works around here nowadays anyway.\u201d You're about to toss it when it\u2019s screen slowly starts to glow white, the screen a bit fuzzy, and filled with static, so most of whatever\u2019s showing isn\u2019t clear, but there is something showing all right. \u201cH-hey Bob! Come here man! I got a working television!\u201d you exclaim, watching the screen while trying to get some discernable sound from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBob, who was busy hooking the car Battery up to a special machine that he\u2019d made at the Group, Drops the attachment wires and runs over to you. \u201cNo way! You found a WORKING T.V.?! that\u2019d fetch a huge price at the trade in post! Well, come on! Let\u2019s see it!\u201d he says, while trying to get around all the junk between him and his partner. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not 100% working, the picture\u2019s a bit fuzzy, and it\u2019s a hand-held one, really old too, so it\u2019s only black and white, but it seems to have picture at least.\u201d you respond, showing Bob the hand-held. \u201cHm, well, let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d Bob mumbles, as he checks the knobs and switches. \u201cAh, here we go! The volume is right here! And this...\u201d Bob pulls out what seems to be an old pair of headphones, \u201cthis should fix the static a bit, hopefully.\u201d Bob checks for a head-phone jack. \u201cWhat is this?! There\u2019s no where for these to plug in!\u201d, \u201cwell, Bob, that\u2019s \u2018cause this is an OLD set, so it was a little before the time of head-phones.\u201d you joke, making fun of Bob, who in turn glares at you. \u201cOk, ok, I was just joking, don\u2019t get so mad, but it\u2019s true, we\u2019ll need to find some other way to clear up the sound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround this time, the sound from the machine cleared up a bit, maybe the wind blew something blocking the signal out of the way, or sun spots were acting up, even though sun spots usually work the other way, anything\u2019s possible ya know, and they could hear what sounded like a plea for help, not the kind you\u2019d usually hear in anticlimactic action shows or movies, where it\u2019s a girl screaming \u201cHelp! Help! Please help me!\u201d no, this was a man, and he somehow sounded calm, and panicked at the same time. \u201c-ease, if you- -ting this you must s\u2014d for help, it----- they\u2019re everywhere! Please! If you- ge-ing this, these\u2026THINGS, must be s---ped. If they get out i---  all over again! The-\u201c the message ends abruptly there as some kind of furry ropes, or tentacles, maybe hands, grab the man and drag him beyond the view of the Fuzzy picture. A few seconds later, some kind of head, almost seeming human, and yet animal somehow, poked into view, then the screen lost all picture and was just static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two are watching, amazed, \u201cHow do you suppose they did it?\u201d Bob asks, \u201cDid what?\u201d William replies, \u201c Broad casted that movie of course, smart guy, I mean it was really well made, better than anything we could make now, must have found a way to play and broadcast an old movie or somethin\u2019.\u201d Bob answers, going into a dream world of thoughts. You, seeing that Bob isn\u2019t paying attention anymore, turn back to the hand-held, only to see it is completely black. \u201cGreat, batteries had enough time to play that before they died, but couldn\u2019t last \u2018till I turned the darn thing off? Well that\u2019s fine, \u2018least we know it works now.\u201d He complains as he flips it over to check the batteries.</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ve finally done it!\u201d Mark Sinto yelled as he looked over the results on the computer\u2019s monitor. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it! Our 8 years of research and work has finally paid off! We have our first successful human test! He\u2019s adapting to the infusions better than I\u2019d ever hoped he would!\u201d Rushing past the many terminals and beakers that lined the tables around him, Sinto worked his way to the tank that held a single young boy, not more than maybe 5 months old. \u201cThis boy, he shall be our crowning achievement!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSinto is a Scientist, working for a lab that calls itself the STE, or Scientific Terrestrial Experimentation, lab, it\u2019s whole purpose is to help bring mankind further into the path of perfection. It\u2019s latest attempt, was an experiment meant to combine humans with the abilities of animals, in a way that would only transfer the good parts, such as strength, or speed, while keeping out the parts that might damage the human mind, such as the Instincts of a cat to chase almost anything smaller than itself that moves, or a bird\u2019s need to go south for the winter. Of course they don\u2019t head straight into human testing until they know it might be possible in a human, in other words, a few animal tests are needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEight years ago, the lab had started with a over 200 thousand mice, today, of those they started with, only 10 remained, but those 10 were ten times stronger than normal mice, almost as smart as an average cat, and around twice as big as the average mouse, those were successes. They did many tests, always wondering why some would fail, then they figured it out, all of the mice that survived where less than 3 days old during the infusion of animal DNA! It appeared that the animals were more acceptable of the DNA the younger they were, so it was decided that only newborn animals would be used, and the adults used to breed in case of more being needed. After mice it was rats, cats, dogs, and so on and so forth until finally, they came to the monkeys, the closest they could get to humans without illegal testing. Their first few were failures, no one could figure it out, what was the difference? Sinto was the one that figured it out, the bodies of the monkeys were maturing too much inside the parent, they had to have the Infusion happen before the immune system was finished in the body so the animal\u2019s body wouldn\u2019t fight it in such a way that it turned into a violent internal fight for survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen came the news of success, thousands of people, wanting to be \u2018improved\u2019 came and offered themselves as testers, they were all willing to get a chance at being \u2018Super human\u2019 even if only for a while. Many were set off by the news that the subjects had to be unborn kids, and that they might die, but many people who wanted a way of either getting an amazing child, or an abortion actually came, they lost most of the kids, only a handful made it through the rest of their time in the womb, some even lived a while after that, showing signs of amazing feats such as: strength, speed, and dexterity.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This brings us to the shouting Sinto, after many months, they had a baby that, although weak and barely alive, was still alive after a month of being out of it\u2019s mother\u2019s body. \u201cYes, this one is coming along nicely, hopefully it will last, maybe even be able to live outside of this tube. What was it again?\u201d Sinto asks himself as he checks his clipboard, \u201cAh yes, raven and dragon, interesting combination, the cunning and dexterity of a fox, with the power and majesty of a dragon, I do hope he makes it through, I\u2019d like to see what comes of it. I\u2019m so glad we found those dragon remains\u2026everyone thought they were dinosaurs, but after cloning, what do we get? A dragon! It\u2019s simply astounding.\u201d After he\u2019s done taking the measurements on the tank, Sinto walks away and leaves to give his announcement and findings to the rest of the scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter Sinto leaves, a strange sound can be heard coming from the tank with the child in it, it was almost a whirring noise, but also a little like the grinding of something on the wall or glass, if anyone was to hear it it\u2019d make their skin crawl. All of a sudden, the glass around the tank cracks, an alarm sounds, and about twenty people rush in, the crack grows, and the child inside the tank squirms, as if writhing in pain. \u201cNo! Wha-What\u2019s going on here!?\u201d Sinto yells, as he rushes towards the tank, and starts hitting keys on the terminal control for it. \u201cSinto! Watch out!\u201d A woman, Rebecca Tresdon, Yells, right as some kind of creature jumps off a table next to him. \u201cWhat is that?!\u201d yells a nearby scientist. \u201cThat\u2026that\u2019s one of our mice! It\u2019s mutated!\u201d another scientist said, \u201chow\u2019d it get free?!\u201d, \u201c I don\u2019t know, nor do I care, kill it! It\u2019s attacking Sinto!\u201d Rebecca screams, as she grabs a nearby Scalpel and grabs the mouse preceding to stab it and cut off it\u2019s head so that it was sure to be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSinto, scratched up and bleeding, walks back over to the terminal and attempts to diagnose the tank\u2019s problem. A few minutes later, the tank is stabilized, and the child inside is floating in the liquid oxygen like it\u2019s supposed to. \u201cWell, it seems the problem\u2019s under control for now. Get a mechanical team up here to replace the glass on the tank as soon as possible, understood?\u201d He says into a walky-talky, \u201cAnd see if you can figure out how the mouse got out of it\u2019s cage.\u201d \u201cYes Professor Sinto!\u201d the radio answers back. Turning to Rebecca, Sinto says, \u201cThank you, I might have been seriously hurt if you hadn\u2019t killed that thing, but didn\u2019t it seem odd?\u201d, \u201cOdd? How so?\u201d Rebecca asked, \u201cWell, all the mice we have left, are supposed to be pretty docile, the rats too, but that one just jumped at me, it was like it was insane with rage or something.\u201d Sinto answers, \u201cYes, I suppose it is a bit strange, that one of our animals would attack you without provocation, but-\u201c before Rebecca could finish the sentence, the PA shrieks on, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a situation in Lab 4! The animals have all escaped! Repeat, be on the look out for any experiments! We have reason to beli-\u201c there\u2019s a loud sound in the background before the system goes completely quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor a while the room was as silent as the PA as everyone tried to understand what the announcement meant, then, all at once, almost everyone in the room jumped up and started running for the door, screaming something about evacuation, escape, hiding, or some other such survival tactic. Meanwhile, Sinto and Rebecca have been too shocked to really do anything, until someone bumps into Sinto, snapping him out of his shock, \u201cWe need to go too! If all the animals are as violent as the mouse, we\u2019re in danger here!\u201d He says, grabbing Rebecca and pulling her towards the door. \u201cBut, how do we get out? Lab 4 is between us and the entrance, and the back door is way too far to try and run to! Besides, even if we did make it out, how would we out run the animals that are bound to chase us?!\u201d Rebecca asks, panic easily showing on her face, \u201cIf we can make it to the weapons in the security station, we may stand a chance, I mean, that mouse was bigger, but not much harder to kill than a regular one, there\u2019s a good chance a gun can take out any of the animals we have here, we can eliminate all of them if we have to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStill in a little shock, Rebecca follows Sinto out the door and into the hall, heading for the Security Station, and relative safety. Five minutes later, and numerous close calls with animals, a cat, rat, and about ten more mice to be exact, they make it to the security station. \u201cSo, now what? Just make a break for it?\u201d Rebecca asks, eyeing her pistol, \u201cI\u2019ve never used a gun before, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make a good partner in this plan.\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, if it comes to shooting, I\u2019ve had a few lessons, hopefully we can just get out and run, but if not, I\u2019m also setting this place to lockdown and self-destruct, to ensure these things don\u2019t get out.\u201d Sinto assures her, and then, taking her hand and pressing a button on the underside of the Security terminal, makes a run for the doors, about 20 feet away, as the gates are closing<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If one were to look at it they\u2019d see a big, bulky looking building, with what seemed to be metal sheets for walls, a really tall watch tower-like structure rising up from the middle, a big stone wall surrounding the whole thing. The gate, looking like it\u2019s about to fall over in it\u2019s trains, slowly opened for you, screeching as it went.

A teone can come in many different forms, they are usually mutated versions of a mammal, reptile, bird, or other form of life, and a few plants have even been reported. The teone, according to some rumors, where created by the radiation after a few places where nuked, to stop whatever it was that was destroying the world and killing millions, no one knows why there were nukes launched if it was a disease that was the cause of death, but there was even a rumor that they were alive before the nukes where ever launched, that they were the cause of all the death, but that is only speculation, no one really knows if nukes were actually used or whether all the destruction was due to the creatures or disease that spread around the world all those years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs you two ride in, a few people come out to welcome you back, and to check out your haul.

But I\u2019d say a good five-twenty, at least, lots more after we check the hand-held to see how it works.\u201d you laugh, seeing the shocked expression on Bob\u2019s face, \u201cI was only jokin\u2019 Bob, it won\u2019t make near that much, the hand-held might come close if we can get it to run without batteries like it did, but \u2018till then, I\u2019d say two-ten, maybe.\u201d Bob gives him a little shove, \u201cMan, come on, don\u2019t get my hopes up like that, I mean, five-twenty would pay us a lot of weeks of rations. So don\u2019t do that to me, it might make me do somethin\u2019 rash if you do that at the wrong time.\u201d, \u201cRash? You mean like go kill a random teone to get a piece of trash I call really valuable? Like you did that one time?\u201d you jokes, remembering the scene well, Bob rushing off towards a well known teone hotspot, to get a transceiver Will had called valuable, and coming back, bloody and almost out of energy, clutching the near worthless transceiver. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny, I nearly died out there, and all \u2018cause you had to lie to me!\u201d Bob yelled, Grabbing you with his free hand. \u201cDude, come on, I didn\u2019t lie, I said it\u2019d be very valuable, IF we had the rest of the machine, if we had a working machine for that to attach to, we\u2019d be able to contact the other Groups and form a strategy, and maybe even a working society, not this worthless system, I mean, sure, it works, but we aren\u2019t organized, and we barely survive teone assaults, and then there\u2019s the fact that to contact other groups, we need tons of fuel for our vehicles, and run the risk of becoming teone food.\u201d you say as you pry Bob\u2019s hand off of your shirt a lot easier than someone your size should be able to. \u201cBoy, Will, I\u2019m always surprised at your strength. Still a bit blurry on that past of yours, huh?  \u2018Cause I\u2019d sure like to know how you\u2019re so much stronger than me.\u201d Bob says, looking at the 5 bags William is carrying, \u201cYeah, still got nothin\u2019, can\u2019t remember anything since before ya found me. But anyway, enough about that, we gonna go get the pay for this week or not?\u201d Will says as he walks off towards the inner area of the bunker, Bob trying to keep up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We aren\u2019t sure how it happened, but I\u2019m starting to think that perhaps the Japanese could have been right about a fox having supernatural powers.\u201d Mark looks ahead, and notices a city, \u201cWell, perhaps there\u2019ll be survivors here that can help us, and if not, we have enough fuel to last a while.\u201d He says, motioning to the seven ten-gallon tanks sitting in the bed of the truck.</span></div></div>",

Looking more beast than man, the creature makes it\u2019s way towards Mark, sending anything in it\u2019s path flying out of the way, with a mere glance, the way it was moving would have made it look almost majestic, if it weren\u2019t for the misshapen body it had, a result of the early testing they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne step and the creature was closer, Mark noticing an odd feeling in his chest. Another step, Mark could feel the strange sensation getting stronger, as if a hand was wrapped around his heart, ready to squeeze. A third step, Mark\u2019s heart is racing, trying to push against this feeling of pressure covering it. One last step, the creature now close enough to reach out and cut him open, Mark closed his eyes and waited for the end, he knew it was almost over, he couldn\u2019t move, he could barely breath, he was in horrible pain, and this demon-like creature, this, mass of species rolled into one creature, was going to kill him, he was so sure, until he heard a thump, felt a breeze, and heard another soft set of thumps. No sooner did those thumps sound, than Mark felt something amazing, his limb were healing! He was feeling better and better, almost as if months were passing in the blink of an eye, and that feeling of pressure on his heart, it was gone! Then hands, he could feel hands picking him up, lifting him into the air, carrying him away, and then, the sound of wings, the sensation of lifting even higher, and a breeze on his face. Not once did he open his eyes during this whole time, so amazed by what had happened, that he was still alive, that he was flying, or perhaps he was dead, maybe this was an angel, come to take this dead man to his final resting place for eternity. A thought entered his head, a thought he hadn\u2019t had in a while, since leaving his home to escape the creature he had just had a showdown with, rest, he was tired and his body knew it, his mind telling him to sleep. So, he did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A sense of danger arose in your mind, something didn\u2019t feel right, no breathing, no footsteps, no noises whatsoever, it was quiet, and you was thinking what most people in a situation like this are thinking, that it was too quiet. Perhaps the creature was still unconscious after all, or it had woken up and run off while you had taken Mark to a safe place, or perhaps- your thoughts are cut off, your guessing cut short as you turn a corner, only to find the creature floating in mid-air, it\u2019s back to you, the blood from the wound you had given it flowing, but not in the direction one would expect, it was re-entering the wound, all sand, dust, and other contaminants separating from the blood. The wound itself had opened up a bit more, to allow the blood to enter easier, the creature giving grunts of displeasure, so low, that you almost couldn't hear it, even from this distance. You, wanting to get closer so as to get a better chance for a fatal blow on the first strike, snuck forward, not a sound to be heard in your silent steps, you was at least 20 feet away, closer, 10 feet, almost within striking distance, you take one more step, raise your knife, and swing! The creature isn\u2019t fazed as the knife pierces it\u2019s back, piercing right where a heart should be, the creature gives a grunt, and the knife disappears, sucked into the creatures body, the wound sealing, and another grunt from the creature, the knife popping out of it\u2019s mouth, and dropping to the ground. Turning around, the creature stares at you, even as the blood finishes returning to where it had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the creature stares at you, you can feel the odd sensation of pressure, on your heart, your lungs, even some on your brain, as if someone was starting to squeeze, having a tough time breathing, thinking, and now convulsing a bit, as the pressure on your body intensifies, you start to back up, trying to get away, trying to tell your wings to take you into the sky, to get away, but you can\u2019t, your body barely registering the command to move, the pressure starting to make you feel faint. The world, starting to rock a bit as your eyes fight to stay open, starts to fade, grey and black replacing the colors, the world all but becoming a bleak, desolate, and colorless world around the creature, as if the creature was absorbing all the color, as if it wanted nothing else to have any color. Your heart starting to beat faster and faster, your brain starting to hurt, your lungs having a hard time sucking in air, an image flashes, an image of a laboratory, of some tubes, of a woman, crying as she stares from behind glass, then another woman, hand on the glass tube a few down, crying, mouth moving in wordless questions, a doctor standing behind her, or maybe a scientist, resting a hand on her shoulder, probably attempting to reassure her that everything will be all right. Then that scene shifted, to the same glass, only this time, there was no woman crying in front of you, only scientists and doctors, laughing and chatting wordlessly, apparently happy about something, the door in the back opening, a man walking in, pointing towards you while discussing something with the others. Once more the scene has changed, this time, you're once again behind glass, but this time the room is different, only one man in it, walking around, looking at an instrument or two, before a huge smile crosses his face, as he stares at the screen, he yells once, then again, standing up straight, he rushes toward you, all the while, shouting wordlessly, as if he had just won the world\u2019s most valuable treasure. He comes to the glass, looks at you for a second, then looks at the monitor that you just noticed at the bottom of the glass, before laughing soundlessly again and rushing out of the room, almost as soon as he leaves, a crack appears on the glass in front of you. For a third time the images moving through your head change, becoming that of something you recognized, of the bunker, broken, burned, all but destroyed, something lying on the ground in front of you, a body, no, more than a body, a family, a man, a woman, a child. It was the Sintos! The ones you had been trying to protect, lying there, lifelessly, as if they had been dead for a while now, but what had happened? you was sure that Mark was no where near this place, and that his family was even farther away, then something caught his attention, like in all his visions since the world went grey, there was no sound accompanying this something, yet you could tell, there was a fight, a scuffle, a lot of noise, if only you were able to hear, moving in the direction you could feel the commotion coming from, you rounded the corner of an almost undamaged wall, only to see something that burned you more than anything before. It was Bob, Held by his throat above the creature that had attacked you, Bob, who was barely alive by the looks of it, lifted a gun to the beasts head, and with a silent flash, the beast dropped him and fell to the ground. Hoping it was over, that the grey you was seeing would fade back into color, that you would be able to help your friend, you began to move toward Bob, toward the only friend you\u2019d ever had, only to freeze, as a long furry tentacle shot through his chest, the creature rising behind Bob, another tentacle, one of it\u2019s many tails, shooting through his chest again, before it, along with the other, tore Bob in two.</span></div></div>",

The thought made your blood run cold, your mind telling you, through all this pain, you had to kill it, to defeat the undefeatable, to somehow kill something that seemed almost immortal. your fear for what might happen to your friends began to solidify into determination, the determination began to become energy, and the energy became strength. The pounding of your heart began to lessen, your mind began to calm, your lungs began to bring in more air, the feeling of pressure, the pain, the fear, it was disappearing, as if it had never been there, as if, you were on equal terms with this creature, as if, as if you had just ascended to a whole knew playing field in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world, though no longer shaking, was still as grey as ever, only the creature had any color left, looking around, you saw a shape, a little blob on a wall, there was color there! you looked around again, seeing little splotches of color everywhere, then the colors began to move, they moved left, right, up, and down, in every possible direction, and they started to grow, become more than just dots, or splotches on the wall, they began to take shape. It was then that you realized, these splotches and dots weren\u2019t on the walls at all, they were past them, you were seeing something that was no where near you, that was possibly hundreds of miles away, you were seeing the creatures known as Teones, and people, and you even saw a few things you didn\u2019t know , but what you were seeing wasn\u2019t just them moving around, doing whatever it is they usually do, they were coming, everything you could see was coming, to help either you or the creature, who hadn\u2019t made a move since you had woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. Even though the vision was gone, you still heard nothing, were you deaf now? Or was it just that quiet here? You soon got your answer, as , to your amazement, the creature in front of you spoke, in a clear, human tone, as if it was human, as if he wasn\u2019t a giant mess of man and beast, \u201cI commend you, William, for surviving that experience, and for being so calm in the face of this dire situation, I am Nayo, I was born in a test tube, just like you, but, I have many abilities that make me far superior to you and all the rest of the creatures that roam the earth. I wish you to join me, for you can not hope to defeat me, and though you are young, and inexperienced with your strengths, I can use something like you, a spy perhaps, to gather information and help me put an end to the humans who think they can overthrow me. Now choose, you shall bow before me, one way or the other!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I remember now, I remember your voice, it was what woke me up back then, it was you that caused all this destruction, why?! Just to wipe them out for being weaker than you?! I won\u2019t let that happen! I will stop you!\u201d you scream, the area near you bursting into flames, your feet leaving the ground, your eyes going blank, starting to glow a faint white, then a little blue, before finally returning to normal, \u201cYou may have those powers, to grip at peoples minds, hearts, souls, with their fears, and their weaknesses, but what happens when there is no fear? When there is no weakness? What then? You become weak, pathetic, a being so low that even an ant can topple you!\u201d A burst of heat shoots from you, Nayo backing up, his attitude of superiority, the look of being so sure of victory, replaced by that of uncertainty, not quite fear, \u201cI will not let you harm this world!\u201d Another blast. The flames around you changing from red to blue. Snarling, Nayo charges, in hopes of ending it as quickly as possible, and it did end, in a bright flash\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the world, all time seemed to have stopped, Bob, just driving back towards the bunker to help, was stuck in mid air, having gunned his truck up and over a hill, getting air born. The Teones that were flying, some of the only non-threatening ones, mainly used as spies to find the humans, were stuck, mid flap, over the road. But time hadn\u2019t stopped for you or Nayo, no, though your bodies didn\u2019t move so much as an inch, you were having a very intense fight. For you, the world was not colored, but not the grey and black that you saw, no, this time, everything was white, white sky, white ground, white everything, to the point that it looked like you were running on nothing. you clashed like two mystical creatures, a Minotaur, or in other words, a beast-man, against a gryphon, half bird, half beast, the fight was more evenly matched than you had hoped it would be, even with your newfound determination, you had a few doubts for victory, just because of the size of you opponent, but for every hit Nayo landed on you, you landed the same, if not more, because your size meant more dexterity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight went on, for what felt like days, but weren\u2019t even minutes, because of the force that had frozen the world in that moment of time, but this fight wasn\u2019t a fight of physical strength and endurance, no, it was a fight of mental strength, and the determination to defeat the other, and both had plenty of that. This fight was your Fire, the creation of your determination to protect the ones you called friends, against Nayo\u2019s supernatural force, his mental ability to send anything near him in any direction he pleased. Brute force against brute force, supernatural against supernatural, the fight waned on, to the point where you were both covered in scars, cuts, and almost every other kind of injury known, a few that were unknown, but even with all this, the fight went on, as if you didn\u2019t feel so much as a pinprick of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around you, felt like an open space and a small white box all at once, there were walls, and at the same time there weren\u2019t walls, sometimes you would hit a wall, and other times you wouldn\u2019t, it was all so white, neither of you could see any of these walls, if they were even really there, you wish that you could, you\u2019d be able to fight better, if you knew where not to move. A flame shooting from the circle of continuous flame that surrounds you, you directs it straight at Nayo, but a wall blocks it, Nayo giving a laugh, and races towards you, intent on skewering you with his claws, maybe his tails. Nayo started laughing, \u201cHa-ha! And you said you\u2019d never let me hurt them! What a joke! You aren\u2019t even worthy of fighting me like this! Coward, stop running away whenever I get near! Just give up, and let me rip you to pieces already!\u201d almost as soon as he finishes, Nayo is hit, squarely in the face, by a fist, you standing there, an intense look on your face, Nayo flying off, missing any invisible walls that might be there, \u201cYes, I did say I\u2019d stop you, but I\u2019m not a stupid brute like you, I don\u2019t just rush in with no regard to safety, I plan, I think, and because of that, I will win.\u201d you state, as if it\u2019s a fact, believing it so hard in your heart that, to you, it was a fact, and this fact was starting to impact Nayo\u2019s view of the world, he was starting to feel something he\u2019d never felt before, fear. Fear that he might lose, that he might die, but most importantly, a fear that he was going to lose his power, the power to manipulate the Teones, his ability to tell them what to do, and they\u2019d do it. \u2018No!\u2019 He thought, \u2018I can\u2019t lose! I am the King! I am the most powerful being on this planet, I can not be beaten!\u2019 having re-found his resolve, Nayo feels something strange a feeling he\u2019s had before, a new tail, a new ability, and more importantly, another step towards being a god of this world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill.\u201d Nayo says calmly, catching you off guard, \u201cHave you ever heard the legends of the foxes in Japanese folk lore?\u201d you're stunned, that this killer, this brute of a creature, would actually stop fighting and ask a question, \u201cOnly a little, I heard that foxes are believed to have supernatural powers.\u201d you answer, \u201cYes, and no, there is a difference between a fox with powers, and one without, and what, you might ask, is the difference? Well, Will, it\u2019s the amount of tails they have!\u201d Nayo explains, showing his tails, \u201cThe more tails a fox has, the more powerful it becomes, a one tailed fox, is the everyday fox, though, those no longer exist, seeing as they became Teones a long time ago, or just plain died, a two tail is stronger, able to use maybe a small illusion power or something, but if it obtains a new tail, it gets more power, possibly transformation, or levitation, nothing big, but as the tails increase, the power gets stronger and stronger, imagine an eight tail, that, my prey, is what you\u2019ve been fighting, but it gets better, according to their belief, a fox can have as many tails as it wants, but ten is the highest so far, you see, to them, a ten tail is a god, or goddess, depending on gender, and a nine tail? It\u2019s not quite there, it\u2019s what they would call a demi-god. Will, I have just gotten a ninth tail, you face not a mere supernatural being anymore, you face a being that is so close to becoming a god, that it\u2019s power rivals theirs!\u201d as if to prove his point, you're picked up by an invisible force, slammed into the ground, and held there, \u201cAnd you want to know another belief they have? If a kitsune,  that is what they call us \u2018magical\u2019 foxes, eats a power source, a really strong one, if they devour it, they gain it\u2019s power, and often gain a new tail! I think you\u2019d make a fine tail, you were able to stand on almost equal ground with me when I had eight tails, perhaps you are strong enough to give me ten tails if I were to devour your power!\u201d Nayo starts floating closer to you, tails moving towards you, to rip you up, and allow Nayo to feast.</span></div></div>",

But even with that news, the way it was stated so surely, that it was a fact, and there was nothing you could do about it, you kept trying, you pushed and pushed and pushed, then, you moved, you lifted, you rose, as if you didn\u2019t have any weight at all on your back anymore, looking at Nayo, you see he\u2019s not moving, his eyes still staring at where he was, as if he was still there, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you asks yourself, \u201cOh well, better not waste this opportunity!\u201d and with that you rushes at Nayo, hitting his face as hard as you can, leaving an impact crater on his face, another punch, another impact crater, but still nothing happened, it was as if Nayo didn\u2019t feel anything, or couldn\u2019t, continuing for a while, you have left a lot of marks on Nayo\u2019s body, but still nothing happened, all of a sudden, you found yourself laying on the ground again, held down by an intense force, back in you original spot, then the weight just stops, looking over, you see Nayo, getting hit by invisible punches, in every spot you had punched!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Nayo lay on the ground in a bloody heap, barley able to move, not able to focus enough to begin the regeneration process like he had before, you walk up, and look down, \u201cDemi-god, yeah, sure you are, and I am a human without wings or supernatural abilities. I win.\u201d you claim, breathing heavily, as a sword appears in your hand, and you cleaves Nayo\u2019s head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you cleaves Nayo\u2019s head off, the world around you changes and becomes normal once more, Nayo\u2019s body standing in front of you, looking ready to pounce, before falling to the ground, breathing, but unmoving, as if he was alive, but too tired to do anything at all. Your mind racing, wondering how long he\u2019d stay down, you rushed around, gathering objects, and un-destroyed tech, and getting your tool set from your miraculously undamaged cabin, you set to work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know I\u2019m not one for hugs.\u201d you complain, but don\u2019t try to pry him off, letting him do what he wants, knowing he wanted to make sure his friend was actually there. \u201cOh, and Bob, I\u2019d like you to meet my new pet! Here boy!\u201d You call, giving a little whistle, and a clap of your hands. A sound was heard, loud and fast, like the beating of something heavy on the ground, before Nayo appeared around the corner, panting, and acting every bit like a pet, \u201cHe\u2019s called Nayo, he was the creature destroying everything, I made a collar for him, it sends his human mind into a state of sleep and therefore makes him a little less violent.\u201d As you finished saying this, Nayo growls and leaps at Bob, pinning him to the ground, \u201cNo! Nayo, bad, bad Nayo!\u201d you shout, getting up, Nayo, whimpers a bit, like a dog that was just hit, but gets off of Bob, \u201cI told you not to do that Nayo, you\u2019re a bad Nayo! Now say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Bob was about to protest that, if the human part was asleep, he shouldn\u2019t be able to speak, but then Nayo spoke, \u201cSorry, I thought you were going to hurt master.\u201d Nayo says, looking sad. Bob stood there speechless for a bit, before asking, \u201cHow did you manage to make that collar? I mean, tech like that didn\u2019t even exist in the time before the big disaster, how could you, a kid born after the disaster, possibly make something like this?!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure, actually, I had just finished my fight, when I got worried that he might get up, and then the design for the collar just sorta popped into my head, by the way, you remember that transceiver you almost died getting? Well, turns out, that was the most important part of the collar! You, Bob, my friend, helped save the world.\u201d you say, before jerking up and looking worried, \u201cOh no\u2026I forgot Mark! I\u2019ll be right back, Nayo, no hurting Bob, you protect him, got it?\u201d Before Nayo could answer, you fly off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on the edge of the cliff, you look around, searching for Mark, not seeing him where you left him, you start walking towards the spot, you listens for movement, or any sound at all, and finally hear breathing, and a heartbeat, both quick, and hard, making it sound scared, moving towards the sound, you turns the corner around a big rock, and find Mark sitting there, wide-eyed, scared out of his mind, \u201cWill?! Will is that really you?!\u201d Mark says, sounding relieved before getting up and moving towards you, \u201cI thought that the creature was coming for me, I don\u2019t know how I got up here, but-\u201c he stops short, noticing your wings, \u201cOh, so you\u2019re one of ours too? Well, at least you aren\u2019t violent, so, what happened? Where is the creature?\u201d \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you, but we have to fly, and believe me, that\u2019s no easy task, me carrying someone while I fly, I haven\u2019t had much practice.\u201d you answer, grabbing Mark, and turning around, \u201cUh, can\u2019t we just find a way down, maybe climbing? Something\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026safer, perhaps?\u201d Mark says, seeing just how high you really were, and getting a bit scared. \u201cHa-ha, of course not, I got you up here didn\u2019t I? I can get you down, I just need to be careful.\u201d you says, grabbing Mark and jumping into the air.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Speaking of Nayo, He was living a peaceful life, as a guard for your house. You had become world famous, for your collar, you had made many more for some of the more aggressive Teones still out there, so they could be made more docile, the collar was mainly used as a way to keep teones as a pet, it blocked off the part of the mind that made the creature it was attached to aggressive. You had gotten a wife, many had come asking to marry you, not one had gotten a yes, there were many beautiful ones out there, but all of them only wanted to marry him for his wealth, and fame, but there was one woman, you knew she was the one, she wasn\u2019t the best looking, or the richest or most amazing of the girls, by any standard, but to you, she was perfect, her name was Michelle Landsen, and you married her. Robert, or Bob, as almost everyone still called him, was now the leading trainer in the new military that was forming, he taught everything from how to use guns and blades, to how to take a bullet and keep right on moving. Because of his job, he never had a chance to find a girl he liked, so he is still single. Mark,  Rebecca, and their son, went on to continue their research, hoping to recreate the way you had turned out right, making sure not to use fox DNA in their experiments, for obvious reasons. All in all, the world had gotten back on it\u2019s feet, after so many years of having to fight their hardest for survival, the people of the earth, got to relax, until the next time Mark and Rebecca make a mistake.</span></div></div>",

Here, in this quaint little town, sits a house, as ordinary as any, and in the house, a man, once called hero, now considered on the verge of madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Man sits at his desk, scribbling note after note, one after another, after another, in a seemingly endless stream of movement, the desk surrendering some of it's load to the floor, which happily accepts. These notes, the piles and piles of thoughts, are not being written willingly, for it was as if the words themselves forced their way from his mind and out of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor hours he writes, hand cramping, but still moving, fatigue attempting to overtake him, and yet his hand keeps moving. finally, after what seemed like days, his hand slows to a stop, the last piece of paper slipping to the floor, as his front door opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!

As a result he stands at 7' 9\" tall, his body is very bulky and stout. His head looks like that of an elephant, with tusks, ears and a trunk he can control easily. He has grey, leathery skin that is extremely thick and resistant to bullets and blunt trauma<br>\r\n<b>Back Story: </b>Doc Castle is one of the older surviving experiments. He was forced to survive in this harsh world from a young age, which made him develop a serious and stern demeanor, along with a very strong sense of honor. Those traits coupled with his high natural strength pushed him to become a lawman in the city of Junktown, one of the few civilized settlements in this ruined world. He can usually be found breaking up bar brawls, punishing outlaws or repelling raiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Marty Winger<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 16<br>\r\n<b>Powers: </b> has a pair of black wings on his back which grant him flight<br>\r\n<b>Appearance:</b> Marty Winger's DNA has been fused with that of a Raven. He has black, messy feathers over his entire body, thin bird like legs and a beaked head resembling that of a raven. He has a pair of wings on his back, that he normally keeps tucked in.<br>\r\n<b>Back Story: </b> Marty's parents abandoned him to fend for himself at a very young age. He became a scavenger and street urchin, and he developed a cowardly and shy personality, often flying away at the slightest sign of danger. He eventually ended up in Junktown, where he met jack Castle. Jack decided to take the young raven boy under his wing, even making him his deputy. Thanks to Jack, Marty has become more confident, but he is still rather cowardly and shy, and likely to fly away in the event of a confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur main setting:<br>\r\n<b>Junktown</b><br>\r\nJunktown started out as a small trading post where travelers, merchants and nomads could exchange scavenged goods for water or food. More and more people elected to stay in Junktown, and it quickly grew into a small city, with around 400 inhabitants. Tall walls made out of scrap and old cars and trucks protect the city from raiders, but the only two lawmen, Jack Castle and Marty Winger struggle to keep the peace inside the walls.</span></div></div>",

The experiments were harsh, only 3 of every 7 or so made it through alive, and even less lived longer than a few days after. The experiments were done on unborn children, since if they were too old, the immune systems would fight off the DNA of the creature used in such a way as to actually leave visible damage, and none that were infused after they were born were able to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nOnly 8, so listen up.<br>\r\n1) At least 4-5 sentences unless it's a choice chapter, and not too many of those (a choice chapter is only to follow a chapter with too many choices for one page, no stopping a story and making one just because you can.), and make it readable, please? <br>\r\n2) This isn't for kids, but it's not strictly for adults either, there can be violence, and death, and even a little blood, but nothing too extreme.<br>\r\n3) At the start, you must describe the main character(s) of your story, if you only have one main, he/she can't die, or else the story is over, no \"continue as...\" option, but if you have more than one, you can switch to the one still alive, however, there is no introducing a new main mid-story, you can introduce secondary/side-characters, but they are not usable for switching if your main/s die.<br>\r\n4) Side characters can be left out of the 'background' explanations, but are to be talked about at least a bit eventually.(people can gain powers, if there's a logical reason. Ha! logic, in a work of fantasy, that's a novel idea xP)<br>\r\n5) You can have characters that have powers, but nothing so over the top that it's impossible for them to lose in every fight. example: \" 'generic name' has the ability to insta-kill simply by wanting too.\"<br>\r\n6) All skills have to be something that's gained from an animal, even if that power is from a myth/legend, like the kitsune of Japan, or fox spirits, a person infused with a fox can have multiple tails and gain supernatural powers from said tails.<br>\r\n7) Leave an 'Other' option on all chapters so others can add as they like.<br>\r\n8) On the character introduction pages, you can only choose from the main characters on who you want to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's it, enjoy the world that we all create together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. I will check on the grammar every now and then, if it's really bad, I'll re-write/delete depending on how bad it is, like if I can't read it at all, I'll likely delete it, but if I can understand what's going on, even if only barely, I'll attempt to make it readable for others.(I won't change the plot or anything, promise)</td>",
