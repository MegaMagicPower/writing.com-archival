They transformed as they came to the ground to reveal themselves to be Alucard and Sibella, the son and daughter of Count Dracula. \"Hello everyone, it's fangstastic to see you all again\" said Sibella. \"Always gotta throw that pun out there don't ya big sis\" said to Alucard to himself sarcastically, as he face palmed. Everyone got introductions out of the way and Alucard introduced himself to Major Allen. \"Hi, nice to meet you guys, my sister's told me all about you guys. I can't wait to work with you guys\". \"Nice to meet you to\" they say. \"Alucard\"! Shouted Phanty as she flung herself over to him, causing the both of them to flop onto the ground. \"Heh heh\" he chuckled. \"It's good to see you too Phunnybun\". \"Phunnybun\"? said Jason and Winnie. Major Allen just chuckled to themselves at the nickname. Al and Phanty share a quick kiss earning a shicked expression from Jason and Winnie. \"Good grief\" said Sibella. \"Do you two have to do stuff like that in front of everyone\". \"Aw c'mon sis, it was just a kiss\" said Al. \"Yeah, whatever\" she replied, folding her arms. \"Uh, you two? Since when\"? Asked Winnie. \"Since after we left Crystal Lake\" said Phanty. \"My dad had to go to Tranylvania to settle some business with Mr. Dracula so Al and I had a lot of time to get to know each other\" she said, stroking a finger on his chest. \"Yeah\" said Al. \"And as they say. The rest is history\". \"Not that I'm not glad to see you but what are you doing here\"? Asked Jason. \"This is a girl only school, I'm an acception due to the circumstances. Just seeing your sister off\"? \"No, I'm not here as a student, nor am I here to see Sibella off\" said Alucard. \"Then what ARE you here for\"? Asked Winnie. \"I was kidding when I told Major Allen I was going to be working with them. I'm going to be teaching here, just like them\" he stated. \"WHAT\"!? Exclaimed Jason and Winnie in unison. \"Yay\" shouted Phanty. \"You're going to be our music teacher too? You don't know anything about it\" said Jason. \"Who said I was going to be teaching music. I'll leave that to Major and the guys. I'm going to be teaching you guys the art of self defense\". said Alucard. \"Oh wow really\"?! said Phanty. \"That's so cool\". \"You bet hun\" Al replied. \"But how\" asked Winnie. \"I got to talking with Miss Grimwood, and seeing how you guys encounter some form of bad guy or something almost every year, she and I both thought it was a good idea\" said Al. \"That's right children\" said Miss Grimwood. \"Alucard has shown me that he is fully qualified to teach you in this field. Holds black belts in several different types of martial arts and is a certified teacher, and also, I thought you might find it fun\" she said. \"Thanks for the bode of confidence Miss G\" said Al. \"I won't let you down\".

He gasped as he turned and saw the very man his dreams had constantly been about. He quickly <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntransformed and took a fighting stance, readying himself. \u201cBat bastard\u201d! Shouted <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe blind warrior. \u201cHuh\u201d said Al with a confused look on his face. \u201cYou heard me! Shouted the blind man again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhy are you attacking me\u201d replied Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI'm just testing you smartass. If I WANTED to kill you, you'd be dead already\u201d said the blind <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwarrior narcissistically. \u201cAlright then\u201d replied Al. \u201cWhat is it you want with me\u201d? \u201cI know who you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nare, what you want, AND what you're planning\u201d retorted the swordsman, catching Al's attention. \u201cOh <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreally\u201d? said Al not entirely convinced. \u201cThat's right lil' boy, and I've got to say, mutiny, rebellion, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanarchy......I'm intrigued. You got ballsack kid\u201d continued the blind man. \u201cAnd what's your point\u201d said Al, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlosing his patience. \u201cThe point is that I'm gonna help you get what you want more than <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanything. The thing that clouds the darkest recesses of your mind and heart\u201d said the blind man. \u201cI'm <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngonna help you fulfill your revenge\u201d. There was a short pause as Al took in what the man had said. He <br>\r\n<br>\r\nconsidered his options and spoke. \u201cAnd how would you do that\u201d? Asked Al. This caused the blind man <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto smile a crooked smile. \u201cI'm gonna train you dumbass, what else? I saw how you got your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nass laid out by that Guitar guy. I was laughing my ass off\u201d This caused Al to well up with feelings of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanger and shame once again. \u201cIf you can't beat some punk rocker, how the hell do you think you're <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngonna stand a chance against HIM\u201d? Al just stood there silently, like a statue. \u201cBut that's why I'm here\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid the blind man. \u201cI'm gonna train you, and you should be grateful cause I'm the baddest mothafucker in the world. Ain't nobody <br>\r\n<br>\r\nable to touch these skills son\u201d. \u201cBut why\u201d Al finally spoke up. \u201cWhy would you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwant to help me\u201d? \u201cI'm a spirit of vengeance. Part of the Samurai Code you dumbass. Somebody <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfucks you over, you get revenge, simple\u201d. Al was still very skeptical about all this, but considering his <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncurrent skill level and the situation, he was willing to go along with it for now. \u201cAlright, so when do I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbegin training\u201d? Al asked. \u201cOh trust me bitch, you'll know\u201d said the blind swordsman as he faded away <br>\r\n<br>\r\n, his cackling laughter echoing through the woods.</span></div></div>",

It was a fairly wamr and sunny day, and everyone was preparing for Al's self defense class. \u201cHey everybody\u201d Al announced. \u201cConsidering it's such a beautiful day outside, were having class out back. Let's go\u201d Al motioned, sounding particularly chipper today. \u201cBoy, Al sure sounds like he's in a good mood today\u201d said J.J. \u201cYeah, I wonder what's wrong with him\u201d said Winnie sarcastically. Everyone made their way outside and began stretching and warming up for class. \u201cAlright guys and gals\u201d said Al, as he began to hand everyone protective equipment such as padded gloves, shin guards, and helmets. \u201cToday were going to see you put together everything I've taught you in the past couple of months\u201d. \u201cI'm going to go out on a limb here and say were sparring each other\u201d? Said Phanty questioningly. \u201cNot quite\u201d said Alucard with a grin. \u201cEveryone circle around me\u201d he said as everyone did so. \u201cYou're sparring against me\u201d Al stated. \u201cThe best way to get better yourself is to fight someone who is better\u201d he paused for a moment as he looked up at Spades window. \u201cTrust me\u201d. Everyone nodded in agreement as they understood what he meant. \u201cMr. Al\u201d? Asked Tannis. \u201cI don't see any sparring gear for me\u201d she said. \u201cI know\u201d said Al. \u201cI want you to watch and take note okay. You're not quite old enough for this portion of the training yet\u201d. Tannis looked disappointed but knew Al was right. \u201cBesides\u201d Al added. \u201cYour dad would kill me if anything happened to you on my watch\u201d he said jokingly. Tannis took a seat and watched with great interest. \u201cSo who's sparring first dear\u201d? Asked Phanty. \u201cAll of you\u201d Al replied with a smile. Needless to say they were all a little surprised. \u201cTake your stances and when I say begin, come at me with all you've got. Understand\u201d? Said Al. Everyone took their fighting stances and prepared themselves. Al did the same as they all circled around him. \u201cBegin\u201d! He shouted. Everyone charged in at him at once, and just as Al had expected, their skills had greatly improved. Though still not on par with him, he could tell that they had gotten much better. Spade just so happened to be in his room tuning his guitar at the time and took a look out the window to see what the commotion was about. He looked to see Al's class in progress and saw he Al and everyone having quite a fun time. \u201cHey old man\u201d said Spade in his head. \u201cWhaddya say we head outside for a little 'exercise'.\u201d \u201cYou read my mind bitch, let's roll\u201d said an old groggy voice in Spade's head. No one had still landed a single blow on Al as they continued to try when Phanty got an idea. She flew in behind him. Al saw this of course and guarded himself, ready for her attack. To his surprise however, she laid a big wet kiss right on his cheek. This caused Al to drop his guard. J.J. Capitalized on this and landed a blow right in the back of Al's head, causing him to stagger to a knee. Everyone stopped, thinking Al would be pretty angry after being duped like that. When he got up however, still rubbing the back of his head, he started laughing. \u201cWow, you guys totally got me by surprise\u201d Al said still chuckling. \u201cWay to think on your feet. You exploited the enemies weakness and didn't hesitate to strike. Good job.\u201d They were all taken slightly aback by Al's reaction but quickly joined him in the laughter and began to relax. \u201cAnd as for you\u201d Al said grabbing Phanty and pulling her in close. He gave her a long kiss on the cheek as well, just as she did to him. \u201cNow were even\u201d Al stated. \u201cNow that's cute\u201d said Spade walking out back. \u201cHey Spade' what's up\u201d? Asked Tannis. \u201cHey squirt, nothing much\u201d he said turning his attention to Al. \u201cJust wanted to see if the teacher had time for one more match\u201d. Does Al accept?</span></div></div>",

Everyone stood back as the two of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthem took fighting stances. Spade seemed to convulse a little bit and the expression on his face <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndrastically changed. \u201cWhat's up, are you okay\u201d! Asked Al. \u201cI'm good\u201d said a voice that wasn't <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpades. Al instantly recognized the voice. \u201cWell this is a surprise. Come to test my new abilities old <br>\r\n<br>\r\nman\u201d? Asked Al. \u201cOh YEAH\u201d! Shouted the voice as the skin seemed to melt off Spade's body as he reformed into a skeletal version of the swordsman as he pulled two katanas from thin air <br>\r\n\"Taste the Steel, MOTHERFUCKEEEERRRR!!!\" The swordsman yelled. Both Spade and Al began exchanging blows. They <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwere matching each others every move. 'This is crazy' thought Spade. 'Several weeks ago he couldn't <br>\r\n<br>\r\neven touch me and now he's matching me blow for blow'. The old samurai in Spade's head began <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlaughing hysterically as two voices were debating amongst them selves in the same body. 'You had something to do with this didn't you' said Spade to the old man in his <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhead. \u201cOh yeah baby. I couldn't let you have ALL the fun bitch. HAHA\u201d! Sneered the old man. As the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntwo them continued Winnie caught a whiff of something foul in the air. \u201cWhat in the world is that <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsme-\u201d FWOOM! A huge rush of air filled the landscape as a few familiar faces made their presence <br>\r\n<br>\r\nknown. Al and Spade stopped fighting to see the commotion. \u201cIt can't be\u201d said Winnie. \u201cOh yes, you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfurry little bitch, it can, and it IS\u201d said a gritty voice. \u201cIt's FREDDY\u201d! Shouted Sibella. That's right <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbaby\u201d said Freddy in a cocky tone of voice. To his left and right were his cronies as well. Leatherface, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael Myers and Ghostface. \u201cHow is this possible\u201d? Asked Jason Jr. before pausing to think for a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmoment. \u201cNever mind, dumb question\u201d he stated. \u201cYeah, isn't it though\u201d replied Freddy. He and his <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngoons began to close in on the girls and J.J. As Freddy continued to speak. \u201cYa see, me and the boys <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthought it was time to give you all a little pay ba-\u201d BOOM! A loud thud was heard another figure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nappeared. It was a robot-like being as he reformed into Major. Major had just delivered a deafening right punch to Freddy, right <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin the face, sending him soaring back hundreds of feet. \u201cGeez\u201d said Major. \u201cIt's getting to where a guy <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncan't even take a nap around here\u201d.  \u201cSorry we woke ya\u201d said the swordsman said as Spades personality took over the body. \u201cBut I think we have more pressing <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmatters than your beauty sleep\u201d as he pointed his katana to the other members of Freddy's crew. \u201cJust relax, I got <br>\r\n<br>\r\neverything under control. By the way, here\u201d said Major, tossing Al a set of fangs. \u201cHuh? B-but how\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid Al. \u201cI noticed that fedora wearing doofus had 'em in his pocket when I decked him, so I grabbed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'em. I figured they were yours\u201d. \u201cThanks\u201d replied Al, sticking them back in his mouth, feeling the bulk <br>\r\n<br>\r\nof his vampiric strength return. \u201cOh yeah, I'm back in the saddle baby\u201d he said taking a stance. \u201cSo <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat's the plan Major\u201d? Asked Spade. \u201cYou and Spider stay here to help Al and J.J. Take care of these <br>\r\n<br>\r\nclowns. Steven, Scarab, and I are gonna keep the girls protected\u201d. Spider shifted into his leather form and Steven shifted into a tiger/wolf hybrid and Scarab turned into a stone creature At the sight of this Leatherface shouted <br>\r\n<br>\r\nunaudible gibbirish starting his chainsaw as he started lunging for the girls. However, as quick as a flash, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpider gave him a solid side kick to the chest sending him tumbling backward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever your problems are with the students of this school, you can take them up with us, their teachers\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n said Spider matter of factly with a smirk. At this time Freddy came stagering back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That bastard caught me by surprise' he thought. \u201cHey boss\u201d said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGhostface. \u201cThings are getting a bit more complicated than we thought.

We're gonna do what we came here to do\u201d said Freddy raising his bladed gloved hand. \u201cWe're gonna kill these miserable bastards. Al they've managed to do is raise the head count\u201d. Freddy and his goons prepared to attack, as did Alucard, J.J., Spade, and Spider. They all charged in at once and what can only be described as pure chaos ensued. A mad flurry of punches, strikes, kicks, swipes, slashes, and tears flew all over the place. Al turned to face off against Leatherface as J.J. Turned to face Freddy. Spade and Spider themselves were busy fighting Michael Myers and Ghostface. Both Spade and Spider seemed to have no complications on their end as it turned out they were both fairly strong themselves to Ghostface and Myers surprise. Al and J.J. Were not as fortunate however. J.J. Was constantly busy dodging Freddy's swiping claw bearing gloved hand and Al, no matter how much he pummeled and beat Leatherface, kept getting back up for more. 'Damn' thought Al. 'What good is pounding this guy into the dirt if he's just gonna hop back up again like nothing happened'? Al noticed Leatherface's chainsaw coming straight at him and easily dodged. However, he did't see the kick that came afterward, sending him tumbling back. Quickly losing focus on his target, Leatherface headed towards J.J. And Freddy. As Al's vision came back into focus, he saw just out of the corner of his eye where Leatherface was heading. He shouted to Winnie In desperation, knowing there was no way to make it to the wolf princess in time. \u201cWinnie! LOOK OUT\u201d!!! \u201cWha-GWAH\u201d!!! But it was too late, As J.J. Turned to see what Al was talking about. Leatherface had snuck up behind her, giving him the opening he needed \"NO!!\" Jason yelled running in the way block Leatherface from his lover as Leatherface raised his chainsaw and  swung it sliced J.J. Clear in half. GASP! Al's mouth hung open as he looked in horror at the fate that had befallen his newly found friend. Loud shrieks were heard as the girls saw what transpired. \u201cJASON NNNOOOO\u201d!!! Shouted Winnie in a tear filled stupor, in shock at what had happened to he beloved fiance. She then fainted from the trauma of the experience as everyone else continued to look on in horror at the two halves of the once lively, happy go lucky J.J. Al was shaking all over they split apart, Jason's blood oozeing on the grass, flashbacks of what happened to his mother recurring in his head. 'Again' he thought 'It can't be happening again' He felt as if he were in a dark black void of nothingness within himself 'I couldn't protect him' he continued 'I couldn't save him'. He snapped out of his as he saw the others still fighting of Freddy and his goons. Then turned to see something that truly sent him over the edge. Al saw Leatherface rip off and throw J.J's mask to the side and began taking out a knife running it across Jason's neck putting his hand in the wound peeling off his face putting it in his apron. As Leatherface did this, Alucard snapped completely. An unfamiliar dark power seemed to overwhelm him. \u201cRRRAAAAAAAGGGHHHH\u201d He shouted as a dark red aura enveloped him. His pupils rolled into the back of his head as his eyes began to glow red. Everyone, including Freddy and his cronies stopped to see what was happening. They all looked in to see Al being consumed by some kind of darkness. Al seemed to be growing in muscle mass as his fangs and claws grew as well. His skin became a dark greyish tone, his ears bacame pointed and he sprouted bat like wings on his back. Then with a deafining loud BOOM, the transformation was complete. \u201cHey Sibella\u201d! Shouted Major so he could be heard. \u201cYour his sister, what the hell is happening to him\u201d?! \u201cFrom what I can tell he was so overcome with negative emotion he took on his full vampiric form through sheer will power! It's unprecedented! Vampires shouldn't be able to do that until there at least eighteen! This is CRAZY\u201d! \u201cWhat the hell got into him\u201d? Asked Freddy with a look of surprise. \u201cThis power\u201d said Spade. \u201cIt's so dark and cold\u201d. \u201cI know\u201d replied Spider, \u201cit's the kind of thing that could give you chills\u201d Alucard stood there, the red aura still enveloping him, eyes glowing a blood red. \u201cWhat are you idiots waiting for\u201d? Said Freddy, \u201cKill him\u201d! Myers was the first to act on this command and charged at Al. All this warranted from him was a loud ROAR. Al, quicker than Freddy or his goons could see, clotheslined Myers right across the neck. Decapitating him with one hit. Causing his lifeless body to collapse to the ground with a THUD. Myers then evaporated into a black mist and disappeared. Al then turned to face the rest of Freddy's Crew. \u201cHey Boss\u201d said Ghostface. \u201cI think it's time we made our leave\u201d. \u201cFor once I think you're right. Besides, we accomplished our main objective\u201d Freddy replied, looking over at the lifeless corpse of Jason Voorhees JR. \"I'll see you in hell voorhees, tell his father I said hi\"Freddy laughed as Red flames consumed Freddy and his two remaining guys as they too disappeared. Everyone fell silent as they all came to the realization of what transpired. And as the action died down, so did Al's emotions as he collapsed unconscious to the ground, reverting back to his original state. What happens to J.J.? What happens to Al? What happens to Winnie? What happens to the rest of the Ghouls School Gang?
