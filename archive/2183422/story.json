She bent over the table slightly to talk to Morgan, and he noticed her absolute titanic breasts. They were huge! They were bigger than any woman he'd seen in the Shepherds, and that was against some <i>stiff</i> competition. And Tiki just so happened to be wearing an outfit that revealed a generous amount of cleavage. Morgan blushed as he attempted to avert his eyes. He didn't want her to catch him staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Morgan. My name is Tiki. I will be your guardian until Robin returns.\" She said sweetly. She had an...odd aura about her.

An explosion from a Bolganone spell caused him to fall over. It didn't shake the room much, but at his size, it felt like an earthquake. Tiki chuckled as she helped him up, and pat his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked at the door in worry. He didn't like it when his mother had to go into battle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, Robin will be alright. She's done this many a time before.\" Tiki said.

Now you might be asking what the heck is going on here. Let me explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral weeks ago Morgan's bed and blankets were destroyed in an accident that involved cats, an arcfire tome and a dragonstone and did not involve Morgan himself. Morgan was given a replacement bed, blankets and pillows. However they were absolutely terrible, Morgan had suffered through many sleepless nights due to not having a cozy place to sleep and from being extremely cold. Morgan believed that asking for proper bedding would be a waste of money for the shepherds so he turned to magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan found a spell that would shrink him to an inch in height and would make him invincible and unable to feel pain. Morgan than devised a plan to snuggle up with different female shepherds as a way to have a proper place to sleep without them knowing. He also found a teleportation spell to use in the event the shepherd was about to wake up (Unknown to Morgan this spell had a 50% success rate).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Morgan was standing in front of a tent for his first night using his shrink spell but who is he going to sleep with and with what part?</span></div></div>",

While Cordelia was self-conscious about the size of her chest, she really didn't need one with an ass that big. She had the biggest butt in the Shepherds by FAR, and Morgan wanted to see what it was like up close and personal. Severa would often complain about not inheriting her mother's body, although she it seems she forgets that she has bigger breasts than her mother. Nevertheless, Cordelia's round domes would make the <i>perfect</i> sleep aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan began to walk through the camp, preferably without being seen to avoid suspicion. After dodging several Shepherds keeping watch, and a near bust from Nowi, he finally made it to Cordelia's tent. He quietly entered her tent, and noticed that Cordelia was sleeping on her side, giving him a nice view of her godly rear end. Not wanting to waste ANY time, Morgan cast the shrinking spell on himself, and quickly made his way over to Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...\" Morgan said, unable to finish. He looked up at the absolute PLANETS that were Cordelia's ass cheeks. These things are huge at normal size, so seeing them shrunken down like this, they were <i>GARGANTUAN</i>! Morgan walked closer to her ass and started to climb it. Her ass was soft too, and he could feel his hands sinking right into her flesh. When he reached the top, he decided to lay down and find a comfortable position between Cordelia's ass cheeks. He felt like he was going to get the best sleep of his life tonight. As he laid his head down on her soft rear end, he started to drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Well this was a predicimant wasn't it? He was inside Cordelia's rear end. With how she was positioned on the bed, he couldn't even leave, since her butt was planted against the bed. Morgan's eyes began to fail him as he remembered just how tired he really was. He paced around slightly to think, which he had trouble doing, but he was trying to think of what he should do. Should he just sleep here for the night and leave in the morning? Or try to get out of here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for him, it seemed that Cordelia was awake as well, and her turning threw him off balance. For a moment he simply laid still until he was sure Cordelia would not move around too much anymore, and to his surprise he saw her anus open up wider, giving him a chance to get out. Right before he could, though, he heard Cordelia grunting and before he knew it he was blown onto his back by a short-lived but potent fart.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ooog\u2026 I've really got to hit the can soon; maybe I shouldn't have eaten so much before bed\u2026\" Morgan was terrified upon hearing this\u2014as if the pungent fart Cordelia had ripped just then wasn't enough of an indicator of what was coming next. Regretting his decision to bunk in the pegasus knight's trunk for the night, Morgan was frantically struggling to get out before things started going south for him, but when he felt Cordelia clenching herself to hold the incoming waste in, thus trapping him. Still, Morgan knew that he could try and force his way out if he really wanted to, or maybe he was better off trying his luck and waiting until the timing was better than now.<br>\r\n</span></font></span></div></div></span></div></div>",

Second, Sumia was the least likely to get super angry at him if he so happened to be caught, which would never happen, since he had his teleportation spell (Which he doesn't know has a 50% chance to fail). And Third, he wanted to see what her rather large boobs were like up close, and if they'd make good sleep aids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking only a few tents down, he was outside Sumia's tent. He very quietly entered and activated the shrinking spell, shrinking down to an inch in height. After several minutes of simply trying to climb Sumia's giant body, he was able to get on top of her, and was currently on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Morgan whispered to himself. He had looked in front of him, and noticed he couldn't even see Sumia's face! It was covered by her huge boobs! Odd, in her pegasus knight outfit, no one would think that she's that busty. Did she have trouble getting her armor on? He began to walk towards her mountains, and soon enough, walked between them. He made his way across her chest, before lifting her shirt and slipping inside. Inside Sumia's shirt, his jaw dropped as he saw Sumia's chest up close. Holy shit. She could rival Tharja! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on his face, he walked between Sumia's absolute mountains and wedged himself between them. They were <i><b>sooooooooft</b></i>.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After considering his options, Morgan decided that he'd spend the night with Maribelle, more specifically her big belly. What she tried to keep hidden from the rest of the Shepherds was her slightly bloated potbelly. She had been eating quite a bit lately, and her belly bulged out a little bit as proof. She tried to keep it hidden from everyone, but anyone with a keen eye could tell she had a little bit of chub to her. Although if you'd point it out to her, it'd most likely end up with a slap across the face and some insults. And although she was rather snobbish and rude some of the time, Morgan couldn't pass up an opportunity to rest on that big potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked through the camp, trying to stay hidden from patrol and other late-night Shepherds, and finally made his way to Maribelle's tent after almost being caught by Inigo on the way over. He quietly entered her tent, and...oh boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was...a sleeping position? He wasn't quite sure if she was being tortured in her sleep, or if that's ACTUALLY the way she tries to rest. Her arms were thrown out, her pillows were thrown all over the place, it was...a mess to put it lightly, but that's not the reason Morgan came over. The real reason Morgan came over, was for her belly. She wasn't wearing anything to conceal it at the moment, so it was there it all it's glory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan cast the shrinking spell on himself, and shrunk down to an inch in height. After several minutes of simply trying to get onto her body, he was finally able to climb onto her, and was met with a huge squishy gut as his reward. It...wow. It was bigger than he thought. Apparently she cant learn to keep her mouth shut in several ways, but that was all the better to him. Wanting to get a good nights sleep, he fell over and embraced Maribelle's potbelly. It was the softest thing he'd ever felt, even better than his old pillows! He spent a couple minutes rubbing it while he got into a comfortable position (something he wasn't sure Maribelle knew the definition of), he rested his head on her squishy gut and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She shook her head and pulled herself up, holding her body up with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?!\" She said again. Morgan remained completely still, as he didn't want to know what would happen if Maribelle noticed him down there. Her groggy eyes looked around the room. After a minute of not finding anything, she turned her attention to her gut. She began to look down at her potbelly and placed a hand on it, patting it twice. She rubbed her own belly slightly and giggled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" she moaned. \"So full...\" She said sleepily, not realizing Morgan was there. He realizes that he probably should hide, in case Maribelle actually DOES notice him. With her staring right at her gut, it was only a matter of time until she saw him!

He brought his hand to his forehead and swiped away sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...\" He said to himself. He couldn't believe he was almost caught! And this early...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least he knew that Maribelle was a light sleeper, so Morgan couldn't really cuddle her belly very much due to the real risk of waking her up again. However, he looked out at Maribelle's sleeping body. She was oddly...cute. Aside from her big potbelly, she had average breasts that rested on her large gut, and Morgan couldn't evaluate the rear end since it was on the floor. She wasn't the tallest person in the Shepherds, but having such a big potbelly on such a smaller person was oddly...adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sat down on Maribelle's belly debating on what he should do next. He was tired too, and his lack of sleep was starting to mess with his head. He wasn't sure he could think clearly, but he tried his best to make a logical decision on what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Morgan do? </span></div></div>",

Even his old bedding didn't provide him with this level of comfort and rest.

All she would have to do is glance at her stomach <i>once</i> to notice him. However, by this point, Morgan and Maribelle both were fast asleep, and no further disruptions interrupted their slumber.

She rubbed her eyes again for good measure to make sure she wasn't hallucinating. \"Morgan...? What the heck? How'd he get so small?\" She wondered out loud before her eyes widened. \"And what is he doing on my belly?!\" She said, rather upset. She shifted her body upwards slightly so she was more sitting, rather than laying down. The sudden shift in Maribelle's position stirred Morgan from his own sleep, and he began to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nggh...Hmm? Morning already? Damn...\" He said to himself, getting up. He rubbed his eyes before being able to see outward. What he didn't expect to see was Maribelle staring back at him! Her hand was holding her head up as her elbow was resting on her body. Morgan couldn't quite read her face. Was she angry? Was she happy? He couldn't really tell, but his \"discovery\" shocked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha?!\" Morgan exclaimed. He must have overslept!

He got on all fours and kissed her belly once, causing her to moan again in pleasure. His rubs continued to bring pleasure to Maribelle...until she felt a tightness in her chest. She opened her eyes and looked down at her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was this shirt always this tight...?\" Maribelle said to herself. Immediately after finishing, two buttons flew off of her shirt, and her shirt burst open slightly. Maribelle gasped, and Morgan stopped his rubs to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My...breasts...?\" Maribelle said. In reality, one of the side effects of Morgan's shrinking spell, was that he would transfer his size over to whatever other person he happened to touch. And while it wasn't very noticeable from when he was sleeping on her belly, since he was rubbing and kissing her affectionately, it started to show. Maribelle's breasts went from average sized to rivaling Tharja's in size, and her poor shirt didn't stand a chance. It burst open completely, leaving Maribelle in her bra which was struggling to contain them, as it wasn't meant for this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've...gotten so much bigger! They're huge!\" Morgan said, enticing a very hard blush from Maribelle. Before she could respond, a sharp pleasure in her rear end caused her to moan loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm....! W-What was tha-...\" Maribelle said, looking over to her rear end. She noticed it was double it's original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?! My butt too!?\" Maribelle said, getting increasingly flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...your butt is all huge too!\" Morgan said. \"With your big boobs and big belly, you've got everything!\" He said innocently. Maribelle looked at him in utter embarrassment, her face redder than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could have caused this?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I dunno.\" He said, shrugging. Maribelle didn't know what was going on...but she felt an increasing feeling of desire.

I...I can't stay small like this!\" Morgan said, trying to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...well, if we want to know how to fix this, we have to know what caused it.\" Maribelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, except that we don't know what caused this, and have no clues or anything...\" Morgan said, showing an uncharacteristic pessimism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Maribelle said, pondering the situation along with Morgan. In reality, the real reason the spell did not work, is because of it's side effect. When Morgan rubbed Maribelle's belly, he had transferred his original size to her. Maribelle hasn't expanded <i>fully</i> based on Morgan's original size, but his size now belongs to her, even if it isn't visible. The spell that Morgan cast simply returned the user to normal size. However...technically, this IS Morgan's original size. Unless they could find a way to figure out, and then transfer some of Maribelle's size to Morgan, he's stuck like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She had a point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps there is! Hmm...let me see here.\" Morgan said, flipping through the pages in the tome. What sucked about this tome is that half of it was written in a different language. Half of it was readable to Morgan, and the other half wasn't. The half Morgan was able to read had no spells that would fit what he and Maribelle needed at the moment. He flipped over to the second half of the book, and thankfully there were some images to coincide with the illegible text. He saw an image with a normal sized person and a shrunken person next to it. He couldn't tell what the spell did EXACTLY, but he thought this one was the one they needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think this one may be able to help us.\" Morgan said, showing the tome to Maribelle.

Oddly enough, no blast, orb, or anything really came out of Morgan's hand. A small flash of light-blue light shone from Morgan's hand for a brief second, but no spell projectile was cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so, nothing seems to have happened. Morgan began to adopt a look of worry onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Morgan? Did you cast the spell?\" Maribelle asked, showing concern for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did. Did it seriously not do anything? Come on...\" Morgan said, looking back at his tome again. Maribelle wished she could do something to help, but she couldn't do anything while he was this small...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat neither of the two realize is that the spell's effects were yet to take said effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the spell end up doing?</span></div></div>",

I need to lead the team into battle. Are there any heroes that can look after him?\" Kiran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...a lot of our heroes are out battling at the moment...but we have a few heroes setting up for the Spring Festival. Hold on, I'll ask one of them. I'll message you back, start walking back to the castle.\" Anna said, before the communications were interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going to happen to me?\" Morgan asked. Kiran started to walk back with him in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have someone watch you and protect you until we can figure out a way to send you home. I promise we won't give you to someone too menacing or rough.\" Kiran assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back at the castle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran and Morgan finally returned to the Askran castle, and saw Anna running up to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You're back! Excellent! Sorry for not messaging back, been a real hectic day.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Anna, now, who did you find to protect Morgan?\" Kiran said. When he finished saying that, Kagero in a tight bunny outfit was seen walking up towards Anna. That outfit did NOT protect her modesty. Her already large breasts only looked bigger because of how small the outfit was, and they looked ready to burst out at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be more than willing to watch over the little one.\" Kagero said with her usual sense of duty. Kiran handed over Morgan to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Kagero. It is greatly appreciated.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for thanks summoner. It is my duty.\" She said back. Kiran looked towards the other end of the hall, a team of five heroes was waiting at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to lead the raiding team, I'll be back soon.\" Kiran said to both Anna and Kagero before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to finish setting up for the Spring Festival too! Gotta be ready to make the big bucks!\" Anna said cheerfully. She walked off, leaving Kagero and Morgan alone in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings little one, what's your name?\" Kagero said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan. What's yours miss?\" He politely asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Kagero. As you know I'll be watching you until we're able to send you back home.\" She said, before suddenly shifting to move somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will stay in my living quarters while we wait for the commander or the summoner to return.\" She said. Morgan looked up at his giant protector. She was...actually really pretty. Her face glowed with maturity, even though he could only see half of it. He looked at the outfit she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite a weird outfit..\" He said to himself, Kagero not hearing. His eyes landed on her breasts. They were HUGE at his size, and probably if he was the same size as her too. Kiran and Anna had truly picked a beauty to look after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they reached Kagero's living quarters, she opened the door and shut it behind her. Morgan looked around and saw several carrots and pairs of bunny ears scattered about, along with some scrolls with unfinished art on them. Some of the carrots looked sharp enough to be used as a weapon. Morgan shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero softly placed him onto a table, and quickly placed a small plate of food and water in front of him. She sighed and sat down at the table. She wouldn't tell anyone, but helping set up the Spring Festival was exhausting. She looked at Morgan with an odd expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so tiny Morgan?\" She asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was born like this. I'm used to seeing and talking to people several hundred times bigger than me!\" He said cheerfully, taking a sip of the water she put in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...interesting...\" Kagero said with an intrigued look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may take some time before the commander or summoner return...\" Kagero began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to do in the meantime?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....\" Morgan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Morgan looked up to Kiran with worry, and he simply looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I can't get through to Anna.\" Kiran said, putting the communication device back into his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean? I'm not going to be able to go home?\" Morgan asked, pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...right now at least.\" Kiran said honestly before sighing. \"Look, I really wish I could help you more right now, but I have to lead my team into battle in 10 minutes. I'm going to leave you with someone so you're not alone here in Askr.\" He said, looking down at Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Morgan said sadly. He really wanted to go home and see his family again, but it seems like that wouldn't be happening at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, we'll find someone to look after you. I promise it won't be anyone rough or menacing.\" Kiran said, Morgan on his hand. They began walking towards the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*At the castle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran was walking around rather quickly, trying to find someone who could make Morgan's problem a little more hospitable and tolerable. Pickings were slim, since most of the heroes were out battling in the Grand Conquests, but he spotted someone walking towards him. It was Tiki! She was half naked with the outfit she had on, a red-bikini with a couple accessories, but it suited her really well. She walked over to Kiran with a regretful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiran...I hate to ask, but could I perhaps get another Melon Crusher? I accidentally keep breaking them...\" She said, carrying what seemed like a metal pole snapped in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one huh? Well, we have plenty more so don't worry about it.\" Kiran assured. Suddenly, he had a lightbulb moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiki?\" Kiran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kiran?\" She asked calmly. Her voice soothed Morgan, and he felt a little calmer simply by her being in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a bit of a...predicament. Could you help me with it and I'll get you a new Melon Crusher?\" Kiran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. What is this issue?\" Tiki asked. Kiran extended his arm and showed Morgan to Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" Tiki said. \"What happened to him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. He was summoned like this. And I can't send him back home either...\" Kiran said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go lead an Aether Raid right now, could I leave him with you until I get back?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'll take good care of him.\" Tiki said with a serene smile on her face. She softly picked Morgan up and placed him on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I won't be too long, I promise!\" Kiran said, running off in the opposite direction. Tiki picked Morgan up from her shoulder and brought him closer to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" Tiki asked cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Morgan! What's yours?\" Morgan responded just as cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Tiki, daughter of the Divine Dragon Naga. However...I'm currently enjoying a quite exquisite summer.\" Tiki said, using her free hand to gesture to her outfit. \"Hence why I'm not as...covered as I usually am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh. Okay!\" Morgan said. He liked her! She seemed really calm and nice! Maybe being stranded here wouldn't be so bad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..\" Tiki said, pondering something. \"I cannot return to the beach at this point, so let us return to my quarters. I promise I'll crush a watermelon for food and give you some water. You must be so hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's stomach growled. \"Kind of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go.\" Tiki said, placing Morgan on her shoulder once again. She started walking down the halls of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Morgan was riding with Tiki, he shot a glance down at her chest. Her breasts were extremely large, and it seemed her bikini had a slight issue trying to keep it all contained. He also looked behind him and checked out Tiki's rear end. It hypnotically swayed back and forth with each step, and he could tell that it was just as big as her breasts were. He couldn't get a good look at her belly, since her breasts were in the way, but he could tell that she had a slight belly. If she eats the watermelons after she crushed them, her belly would be huge! So Morgan concluded that while she ate a lot of it, she didn't stuff her belly with it. Overall, Tiki was extremely attractive and nice too. Morgan started to like her more and more on the way to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they entered, Tiki set Morgan down gently on a table, and threw the destroyed Melon Crusher into the corner of the room, where a dozen other broken Melon Crushers lay. \"Wait here.\" She said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki walked over to the other side of the room and pulled a small container of water out before returning and giving it to Morgan. However, she didn't stay as she walked over to the other side of the room to pull a watermelon seemingly out of nowhere. She brought it in front of the table and set it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have my Melon Crusher, so you'll have to excuse the mess.\" She said. Tiki put one of her fists in the air and slammed it right down onto the watermelon! It caused bits and pieces of watermelon to be thrown everywhere, including on Tiki herself. Morgan blushed as he saw a piece slip in between Tiki's breasts without her noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" She said calmly, before scraping up some watermelon and placing it on a plate for Morgan to eat. She placed a small amount for herself as well as she sat down at the table. \"Enjoy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Tiki!\" Morgan cheerfully responded. The two dug in, and started devouring the watermelon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, Morgan and Tiki looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do? It seems we have some time.\" Tiki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Morgan pondered, bringing a finger to his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

When I was summoned here, I was in the middle of a visit to the beach with Robin and Frederick.\" Tiki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was quite different than Ylisse.\" Tiki said, ripping another large piece of the watermelon off of the broken mess she had created. \"I haven't eaten today, so please excuse me.\" She said, sticking a large piece of the melon in her mouth, chewing, and swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...simply divine. It's a shame watermelons aren't more common in this world. They had always been my favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can find more watermelons! We can look together if you'd like!\" Morgan said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I'd like that.\" Tiki said, giggling. She felt something touching her body, and looked downwards. She saw a small piece of watermelon had fallen in between her breasts. \"Oh? Excuse me...\" Tiki said, grabbing the watermelon from her cleavage. After moving her breasts aside to make sure no more watermelon was stuck in her tits, she held the piece in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it'd be a shame for you to go to waste...\" Tiki said absently. She opened her mouth and ate the piece in one swift gulp. She patted her stomach happily. \"In fact....\" Tiki said, staring at the rest of the destroyed melon. \"It'd be a shame for the rest of it to go to waste...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was staring at the watermelon, one step away from drooling, and decided to indulge. Effectively jumping on it, she picked up the rest of the destroyed melon and quickly started devouring the rest of it. Bite by bite the watermelon slowly disappeared. Morgan started up at the girl in shock, and the slightest bit of awe. He noticed that with every bite, her belly bulged out more and more. He was surprised that she could eat this much! Although...it wasn't like he didn't <i>like</i> watching her belly bulge out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of pure ingestion, Tiki finally finished the entire melon, leaving almost nothing behind. Her belly was severely bloated, due to being filled almost to the brim with watermelon. She rubbed her belly with a smile on her face, and some watermelon dripping down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...delicious...\" Tiki cooed. She looked over at Morgan with a slightly guilty expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm sorry, did you want another piece?\" She asked with a guilty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. That was cool!\" Morgan said, gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me. I just couldn't control myself.\" Tiki said, slightly embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it! I think it was amazing! Your belly got so...big!\" He said, pointing at her stomach. Tiki pat her belly several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...yes. I have gotten quite big haven't I?\" Tiki said, smiling. She looked over at Morgan. \"Now that my little...eating rampage is over, what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her being half-naked didn't hurt either. She laid on her bed and brought Morgan close to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun Morgan. My belly is yours.\" She said, before placing Morgan on top of her stomach. It was the softest thing Morgan had ever felt. It was soft, squishy, and amazing! He wanted to cuddle it so badly! He dropped to the \"floor\" and began rubbing and kissing Tiki's belly, this caused her to slightly moan in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh..! So <b><i>this</i></b> is your idea of <i>playing</i>!\" She said. She...liked it. Tiki reallly liked it. This feeling she got from Morgan's touch made her oddly...aroused, but she didn't say anything. She simply laid back and allowed Morgan to essentially worship her belly. She brought one of her hands and started to rub it along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....\" Tiki cooed. Morgan rubbed Tiki's belly harder, and he heard a gurgling sound from within her. She let out a small burp, and instantly brought her hand to her mouth in embarrassment. She heavily blushed and her eyes went wide in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me! I...I didn't expect that to happen!\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! It's alright!\" Morgan said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I'll try for it not to happen again.\" Tiki said, still blushing. Morgan went back to worshiping Tiki's gut, and spent a solid 10 minutes rubbing and massaging her furiously.  If Tiki's soft moans were anything to go by, he believed he was doing a good job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She triumphantly pulled out a rather large melon and showed it to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" Morgan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki walked back over to the bed and placed the melon on the bed. She chucked and looked at Morgan with a sly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" She cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Morgan exclaimed. With that, Tiki ripped a large chunk of the melon off and shoved it into her mouth. How strong was this girl?! She moaned in delight as she picked up another piece and took a large bite. The juices from the melon dripped onto her body. Her breasts and belly were soaked in the melon's juices. With each bite she took, her belly bulged outwards and outwards. More and more of the melon found it's way into Tiki's mouth, as she absolutely DESTROYED the poor thing. Morgan watched in awe as Tiki's gut got bigger with every bite. Soon enough, Tiki finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...!\" She moaned. \"So delicious...\" She placed a hand on her gut. \"So...big...\" She said in euphoria. Tiki's gut extended far past stuffed range, into obscene territory. Her belly was larger than the melon she just ate!  Her belly let out a soft growl. \"So full...\" She looked at Morgan with desire in her eyes. She wanted him to play on her again. She was extremely turned on by this entire situation, and grabbed Morgan as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAaahh?!\" Morgan exclaimed, not expecting this to happen. He could swear he saw stars in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...rub it...play with it...! I'm all yours...!\" Tiki said. Her sudden change in demeanor threw Morgan off, but he obeyed. He was dropped onto Tiki's MASSIVE gut, and started rubbing it and kissing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMmmmm!\" Tiki moaned, clearly loving this. She slapped her belly softly and began rubbing with Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was the perfect thing to cuddle with. And Tiki seemed to love it too, every rub and kiss he would put onto her belly caused another moan of pleasure to escape Tiki's mouth. Her belly was even more sensitive than ever! S-She wanted more. She wanted to be bigger! Morgan's touches felt like they came straight from the gods, and if she was even bigger...it would be even better! She knew Morgan wouldn't mind if she got any bigger, so after she held herself back from a near orgasm, she grabbed Morgan suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaa?!\" He exclaimed. Tiki brought him closer to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan...I have an idea.\" Tiki cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What is it?\" Morgan asked innocently. Tiki had a smile of arousal on her face. \"Do you want me to get bigger?\" Tiki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger?! Of course! I love how big you are!\" Morgan exclaimed, enticing a chuckle from Tiki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't have anymore melons in my room...\" Tiki began. \"But what if we were to find where the Order of Heroes keeps their food supply? We could find even more melons and make my belly even bigger!\" Tiki exclaimed, grabbing her immense gut. Morgan's face lit up in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Yes! Come on! Let's do it!\" Morgan said, essentially pleading. Tiki let out another giggle of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Tiki said. She placed Morgan in her rather large cleavage and after a failed attempt at getting up, was able to get onto her feet and walk out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral heroes stared at her as she walked through the halls, but neither Morgan nor Tiki cared. They only cared about making Tiki's belly even bigger. After about half an hour of searching, they found it! They found where the Order of Heroes kept their food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Jackpot!\" Morgan exclaimed. Tiki opened the door to the food reserve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many melons do they find?</span></div></div>",

From wall to wall there was at least 50 melons scattered around the room among other foods, but none of the other foods were of any concern to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Morgan said. \"There's so many of them!\" He exclaimed happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite...\" Tiki said in awe. Her stomach growled softly. She was getting hungry again. She wanted to eat them all, and she was practically drooling. Morgan pat her breasts to grab her attention. Tiki turned her head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiki, what are we going to do? I don't think we're supposed to be in here?\" Morgan asked. Tiki wasn't phased.

Her bloated gut squished against the rest of her body when she bent over, and Morgan had to hang onto Tiki's body to not fall off. She picked up around 5 melons and began her return to her room.

When Tiki got back to her room, she ever so slightly <i><b>slammed</b></i> the melons on the floor before taking Morgan out of her cleavage. She placed him on the same table as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay here, I'll be back with more melons!\" Tiki said happily before speeding out of the room. About a minute later, she returns with another 5 melons. Then another 5. Then another 5! Before long, the entire living quarters was filled with them! Tiki cleaned the entire reserve completely of the watermelons! She ran back with the last shipment and slammed the door shut. She had a wicked smile on her face, and Morgan concluded that Tiki's completely lost it by now. The pleasure and desire to grow might have driven her a little mad. She rubbed her hands together in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh...\" Tiki chuckled. \"I'm going to enjoy this!\" She said, looking at Morgan. \"And I think you will too!

Morgan was used to seeing Tiki eat like this at this point, but it still surprised him. This girl was something else. Soon enough she finished an entire melon...then 2. Then 3. Then 4! Melon after melon disappeared into Tiki's gut as she didn't show any signs of stopping. Her belly was beyond human at this point, it stretched outwards several feet now due to all the concentrated melons, and groaned rather loudly. Bite after bite, melon after melon, she continued eating. She finished about half of the melons in the room before she took a short break to breath. Her stomach literally spanned the entire room at this point, and Tiki couldn't move too well due to being pressed up against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" Tiki moaned. \"I can't get enough of this...\" She whispered. She looked at Morgan and gave a seductive wink. Morgan instantly felt a wave of embarrassment and affection wash over his body, and he started to blush. W-Was she doing all of this for him? Tiki continued to rub her absolutely gargantuan gut until it started groaning loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...Ngh...\" Tiki groaned. Her stomach felt like it could burst at any moment, but instead of that, she felt her gut...shrinking? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tiki? What's happening?\" Morgan asked, pointing to her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not sure?\" Tiki said, being able to see and feel her gut shrinking. Her gut shrank from room size, to overly stuffed, then to pregnant. Until finally her gut completely disappeared, and she was left with the same beautiful figure as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww....\" Morgan said. \"Is it over?\" He asked sadly. Tiki continued to feel odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No I don't think it is...\" Tiki said groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Morgan replied. Without answering, Tiki let out a massive moan. A large wave of pleasure was enveloping her body and was getting stronger by the second. A large pressure began to build in her chest however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Tiki moaned as she grabbed her breasts. Her breasts actually pushed back! Morgan's jaw dropped as he saw that Tiki's breasts were growing! They were already quite large, but they were getting even bigger! Her red swimsuit could barely contain Tiki's growing tits, and she felt it. They were already larger than her head at this point, and she looked over at Morgan with a seductive smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this sweetie.\" She said. She arched her body backwards, putting even more strain on her swimsuit. The poor outfit couldn't handle it and snapped right off, exposing Tiki's perfect growing breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...better.\" She said with some level of arousal. She cupped her breasts and began softly kneading them to add to the pleasure. They got slightly bigger before they stopped growing completely, around twice the size of her head each. She turned to Morgan seductively and bent over slightly, allowing her tits to dangle in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See something you like~?\" She cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh...\" Morgan stuttered. He wasn't able to comprehend this. Less than a minute ago, we we're trying to make Tiki's gut bigger, and now Tiki's breasts were the largest he'd ever seen! And he'd come from a world with a ton of huge girls. Tiki giggled, as the feeling had returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...I don't think I'm done yet.\" Tiki said. Almost on cue, she grabbed her ass and moaned loudly. Her butt started to rapidly swell like her breasts just did! Tiki's ass was already impressive, but she was breaking records at this point. It grew...and grew...before a loud <b><i>SNAP</i></b> was heard. It brought Tiki and Morgan back to reality, as Tiki's poor bottom of her swimsuit gave out and fell to the floor, leaving Tiki one-hundred percent naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh....\" She moaned, rubbing her ass. It continued to swell for about another minute before stopping. It wasn't quite as big as her breasts were, but it didn't even matter. None of the girls Morgan had seen in his world or this world in the short time he's been here could even compare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm big down there too? This is just lovely!\" Tiki exclaimed happily. Morgan could only stare at this...Goddess in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like what you see Morgan? Heehee...\" She chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiki...you're huge!\" Morgan said obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed! I love it!\" Tiki responded. She clutched her stomach again and groaned extremely loudly. The feeling turned to pain for a brief moment before turning back into pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Morgan asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not...done...yet!\" Tiki moaned. And she was right. What Morgan saw made him stumble backwards in shock. Tiki...was growing! Taller! Bigger! Tiki began to grow in height while rubbing her new assets. Now not only was Tiki the biggest girl Morgan had ever seen when it came to her assets, she was now the biggest girl Morgan had ever seen PERIOD! Tiki's height soon doubled from her original height, as her head hit the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! It seems I'm running out of room...\" Tiki said, before attempting to position herself laying down. She continued to grow...and grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tiki took up about half the total space in the room, her growth ended. She looked at her godly body and smiled in delight. To think this could come from simply eating watermelons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange feeling went away completely within Tiki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm done. I think I'm not going to get any bigger.\" She said, looking at Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....\" Morgan stared in shock. Tiki was the definition of a Goddess to him. She was HUGE! Bigger than every living girl in virtually every way! Morgan felt himself getting picked up by the Mega-Tiki and brought close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what are we going to do now?\" Tiki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It just cant be me. I have to lead an Aether Raid in 15 minutes. So let's see if we can't find someone to look after you.\" Kiran said, placing Morgan in one of his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around ten minutes of looking for someone appropriate to look after Morgan, Kiran got desperate. Many of the heroes were out battling at the moment and wouldn't be back until later. Grand Conquests and Tempest Trails demanded a lot of manpower to keep running for a prolonged period of time. None of the heroes off duty at the castle would be a good fit. I mean, Kiran COULD have left Morgan in the hands of Surtr, Grima, Gharnef, or Garon, but he had a feeling that wouldn't end too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...isn't there anyone here that can help me? I need to head out!\" Kiran said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called sweetie?\" A voice said behind him. Kiran instantly knew who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Loki I-....\" Kiran began, being cut off. \"Woah...\" Kiran's jaw dropped to the floor as he looked at the woman behind him. She had a belly that stuck out further than anything else, being several feet long. Both Morgan and Kiran could tell that that belly was big for a reason. Her gut wasn't even covered by anything. In typical Loki fashion, she liked to show off. A LOT. Her belly was proudly shown for everyone to see, and her extremely large breasts rested on top of it. They were covered, but not very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Loki? What happened to you?\" Kiran asked. Loki chuckled and flashed a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I was passing by the Mess Hall and smelled just the most <b><i>delicious</i></b> aroma coming from inside, I just <i><b>had</b></i> to help my self to a few sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That gut tells me you ate more than a few.\" Kiran said, staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh maaaybe~\" She smiled. \"Why? Do you like it?\" She shook her massive belly slightly while smiling with deviousness, and it's jiggle captivated Morgan and Kiran alike. Kiran soon snapped out of his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whether I like it or not is irrelevant Loki. We don't <b><i>do</i></b>....<i>this </i>at the Order of Heroes.\" Kiran said firmly. Loki approached Kiran and placed a hand around his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been around Alfonse too much. He's rubbing off on you dearie.\" Loki whispered into his ear. Kiran fought against her wills, and broke away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not important. Anyway...\" Kiran began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiran!\" A voice called. He looked behind him to see Anna at the other end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're supposed to raid the enemy Aether Camp NOW! Get over here and lead us into battle!\" Anna commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...Loki, I need a favor from you.\" He said quickly, turning back to Loki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you my dear~.\" Loki replied. Kiran took out Morgan and showed him to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Morgan. I summoned him here not too long ago. I can't quite send him back right now, and I'm about to head into battle. Could you watch over him until I get back?\" He asked. Loki looked at Morgan with a mischievous smile on her face. Morgan couldn't tell what she was thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little cutie? Of course dear~.\" Loki replied, all but snatching Morgan out of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Loki, I owe you one! I'll be back soon!\" Kiran said, running off across the hallway. Slightly after, Veronica and Fjorm were seen running alongside Kiran to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki continued to stare at Morgan with a sly, evil smile on her face. She had this new...playmate. A little pet who was infinitely smaller than she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my lucky day! Hello Morgan~.\" She said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello.\" Morgan said reluctantly. He was still trying to process if she was friend or foe. Just because Kiran gave him to her, doesn't mean he was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you're a cute one aren't you~?\" She said seductively, patting Morgan's head with her finger. Morgan blushed, but said nothing. He looked down at Loki's massive belly in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, see something you like sweetie?\" Loki said deviously. She was going to have <b><i>FUN</i></b> with him. Looks like today was an <i>excellent</i> day to have binged those sweets. Morgan looked up to see a devious smile on Loki's face. They both knew she was in control. The question was....what was she going to do to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Loki want to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morgan and Loki continued to stare at each other, saying nothing. Loki's expression was still one of deviousness and slight evil. Suddenly, the look on her face changed. She knew what she wanted to do to him. She carried him close and began to walk off. Her large gut made turning some of the corners a challenge, but not impossible. She was starting to get used to her new belly. Morgan looked up at her with a worried expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where are we going?\" Morgan asked. Loki chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Loki said. She finally got to her destination, and opened the door. It seemed to be a living quarters of some sort. Hers if he had to guess. She attempted to walk in, but her bloated gut bounced back. She squeezed her gut in through, and Morgan suddenly felt bad for that poor doorway. She all but slammed the door as hard as she can and walked over to a small table. She placed Morgan onto it and sat on her bed. She giggled seductively and looked at Morgan with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you get a little more comfortable sweetie?\" Loki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....okay?\" Morgan said, sitting down on the table and crossing his legs. Loki giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweetie, I said, why don't you get a little more <i>comfortable</i>?\" Loki repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know what you're talking about.\" Morgan said. Loki chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes. Take them off.\" Loki said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-What?!\" Morgan said. \"No way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki chuckled deviously and got up from her bed. She walked over to the table Morgan was on and stood up tall, showing the difference of size between them. Her gut alone was several hundred times bigger than he was after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufu...I don't think you understand dearie. You're under <i>my</i> protection now. In fact...I'm your new Goddess. I'll make you do whatever I want. Or else I might <i><b>accidentally...</b></i>\"  She squashed her hands together menacingly.  \"Now, take it off.\" She reiterated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No..!\" Morgan resisted, looking Loki straight in the eyes. She sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do we have to do this the hard way?\" Loki said sadly. She picked Morgan up and used her other hand to start taking Morgan's clothes off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are yo-STOP!\" Morgan commanded. She ignored him. Soon enough, Morgan was completely naked. He covered his privates and looked up at Loki with a furious expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE THOSE BACK!\" Morgan yelled, pointing at his clothes in Loki's other hand. She chuckled deviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I don't think so sweetie~.\" She said seductively, she tossed the clothes behind her carelessly, but kept her gaze on Morgan. Morgan didn't break his look of anger for a second, but all she did was chuckle at the futility of his anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...you must be a little self-conscious, being naked all by yourself~.\" Loki said affectionately, placing Morgan on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why not let me join you?\" Loki said smiling. Morgan's eyes widened at what he saw next. With one swift motion, Loki removed her outfit and threw it aside. Her naked body stood in front of him with all it's glory. Her breasts were absolutely massive, but PALED in comparison to her gut. But both of them were bigger than anything Morgan had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muuuuch better~. Like what you see sweetie?\" Loki asked with a smile on her face. Morgan stood silent, but began to blush at Loki's sheer size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...you must be flustered. Here, why not get a <b><i>closer look</i></b>?\" She said, picking Morgan up. She laid on her bed and placed Morgan on top of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your lucky day Morgan, not many people have seen my true beauty~.\" Loki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um...\" Morgan stuttered, still trying to process what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufufu...rub me.\" She commanded. \"Rub my big glorious belly, and maaaaybe you'll get a reward~\" She said seductively. Morgan had no choice but to comply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm....\" Loki moaned. \"That feels niiice....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blushed, mainly a mix of being flustered and being angry. He continued to rub her faster and faster, and Loki moaned louder and louder over time. She grabbed her massive breasts and started to knead them softly, adding to her pleasure. Before long, she uttered a simple 2 word command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss it.\" She commanded. Morgan rolled his eyes, but complied, kissing her massive belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMmmmhhh! More...!\" She pleaded. Morgan had a worried expression on his face, but he had no other option than to comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...AAhh...!\" Loki yelled. W-Was she about to..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAHHHH!\" Loki exclaimed. Her juices flew out of her as she came, and HARD. Morgan had to grab onto her massive gut to avoid being flown off by her body. Soon enough however, she calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...that was...spectacular..\" She panted. She picked up the naked Morgan and brought her closer to her face. She chuckled deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You pleased me, so now it's my turn to please you!\" She said, chuckling. She attempted to get up from her laying down position, but it wasn't exactly the easiest thing due to her large gut. Eventually however, she was able to lift herself up and walk over to another small table effectively hidden from sight. She had left Morgan back on the other table. She took out a small book and walked back to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tome contains a...a rather unique spell sweetie.\" Loki began. \"This spell is used to increase the size of food, so that the Order of Heroes doesn't need to plant as many crops.\" Morgan turned his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But unknown to them...it also works on <i>people</i>.

If you keep being such a good boy, I may give you more~\". She said seductively. Morgan blushed slightly, and he began pondering which part of Loki to grow. He mentally slapped himself. Was he really thinking about doing this? She's essentially just using him for her own personal pleasure! But....if she's <i>giving</i> him the opportunity, why not take it? He always had a thing for huge girls after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sweetie?

She turned around and bent over as far as she could to show her ass to Morgan. \"Here it is~.\" She said seductively. Morgan stared at her butt with wide eyes. While Loki's butt wasn't the largest thing ever, and hell, unknown to Morgan, it wasn't even the largest rear in the Order of Heroes, but at his size, it was enormous. Loki noticed his lack of a reply and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what's wrong sweetie? It's just my butt.\" She asked teasingly. \"You wanted to make it bigger right? Well, It's here waiting for you sweetie~.\" She said, jiggling her ass slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! I'm gonna make your butt bigger!\" Morgan said, remembering what this was all about. He opened the tome on the table, and luckily the spell was on the first page. He chanted the spell and sent a small blast of energy toward's Loki's rear end. When the blast collided with her, she let out a sharp inhalation of pleasure. After getting up from her bent over position, she placed a hand on her ass and smiled. It was growing all right! It started to swell at a rapid pace, and with nothing holding it back, Morgan got to see the expansion in all it's glory. Loki's butt soon outgrew her large chest, and she moaned as she grabbed her ass with both hands. Her hands sunk into the flesh of her rear, and she quickly began rubbing it unconsciously, unknowingly giving Morgan a show. Her butt grew and grew...until suddenly, it completely stopped, snapping Loki back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt stopped about a little more than one and a half times the size of her tits. Ironically making her large breasts the smallest asset she had. Her butt cheeks looked like two planets at Morgan's size, and he couldn't take his eyes off of it. Loki giggled and turned her head back at Morgan. They were going to have even more fun together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Loki do?</span></div></div>",

The two spheres jiggled uncontrollably, and  Morgan watched as she swayed back and forth, trying to hypnotize Morgan with her ass, and succeeding.

To further tease Morgan, she began slapping her ass several times, and in the process, let out several moans of pleasure. Her ass jiggled even more due to her slaps, and Morgan couldn't look away.

She wasn't exactly the most loving, kind person he'd met in this world, or his home world for that matter. And in his home world he knew Severa.

She was rather hard to read due to her constantly changing demeanor. With one swift motion, Loki placed Morgan in-between her massive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try to sit back and enjoy yourself~.\" She said seductively. Morgan looked around at the absolute mountains of flesh before him. They weren't as big as her belly, but her breasts were still absolutely enormous. Unbeknownst to Morgan, her breasts had also swelled slightly when she binged the sweets that gave her her godly gut. Less than a second later, Loki grabbed her mountains and slammed them together, completely squishing and smothering Morgan in her tit flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...I can feel you down there. How does it feel to be the first boy to be <i>smothered</i> by my chest?\" Loki teased. Morgan couldn't respond, since there was boob all around him, and she wasn't exactly gentle. She chuckled at the lack of response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No answer? My, are we <i>that</i> entranced by my breasts? They're not even the biggest part of me dear~.\" She said deviously. For several minutes, Loki slammed her breasts together over and over, squishing Morgan between her soft domes of flesh many, MANY times. With every slam, she let out a soft moan of pleasure, clearly enjoying every second of this. Every time she pulled her breasts away to slam them again, Morgan had a split second to breathe, since being smothered didn't exactly provide him oxygen. This reward went on for another five or so minutes, and Morgan was starting to falter. Although he liked giant breasts and being able to touch them, he was more of the cuddling type than the smothered type. He'd rather cuddle and hug a girl's boobs than have her literally crush him with them. His vision started to blur due to the lack of being able to breathe, and soon started to stumble about between slams. He wasn't going to last much longer under her \"reward\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Morgan pass out from Loki's abuse?</span></div></div>",

So how and why am I here?\" Morgan asks as he was still really confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summoned you, though if I'm being honest it was as much a test to determine if Minizora actually existed as anything else\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I exists, hello. Can you send me back now?\" Raven chews her lip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I can't. At least not to your home dimension\" she holds up a hand to stop his yell \"The spell I used was a blind summon, I don't know where it pulled you and until I can figure that out trying to send you anywhere could be dangerous\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan frowns, forcing back the tears with a tiny bit of hope that still remained in his heart \"But you can send me back eventually, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I can locate your homeworld, I'll hand deliver you back to your place of residence. Until then, you'll be staying with me, it's only fair as it's my fault you're here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Morgan can respond there was a knocking on her door, followed by the voice of the person outside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \"Mom, Garfield's being an asshole again, make him leave me alone\" Raven has a daughter? This could be interesting<br>\r\n2) \"Friend Raven, it is time to commence with the earth tradition of the Slumber Party where we braid each others hair, talk about the boys and have battles with the pillows while half nude\" Starfire walks in moments after saying this, seeing Morgan before Raven has a chance to hide him<br>\r\n3) \"Raven, emergency in town, we need to move it\" Cyborg doesn't enter the room, but Raven picks up Morgan and takes him with her, feeling it would be safer this way, or at least less likely to get killed where Star's pet worm thing isn't.</span></div></div>",

Explain to that insect I never want to see him outside of critical missions\" the girl explains through gritted teeth, something Morgan now saw were pointed and sharper than a human's, he'd guess it was an 'azarathian' thing, except Raven's teeth were normal, so must be another thing she got from her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serpentime Roth, we do not use our powers on our teammates, not those of other hero teams\" Raven scolds, standing to her full height, of which Serpentime was about 3/4, being quite tall and bony with a reasonable sized chest for her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about when Damien was being a little shit and BB shot him in the face with his ion cannon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beetle was punished for that, as you should remember\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serpentime shrugs \"I was a little busy laughing my ass off to remember what happened next\" she admits, her smile telling both of them the girl doesn't care 1 iota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven sighs \"Just like your father\" she mumbles, the girl now having a strange expression of looking both happy and like she'd been slapped across the face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Least you acknowledge his existence for a change' she mumbles before her eyes find Morgan \"Who's the little guy, he part of the team? We could use a small guy, after all everyone knows the things Ray and the other ATOM's have done for the League\" Serpentime asks, smirking to herself and bouncing on her toes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven looks at Morgan, levitating him to her hand then turns to the still amused teen \"This is Morgan, he's from another Earth and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \"...he's your new teammate\" Serpentime is happy, and snatches him up, eager to show him off to the other girls in the Teen Titans<br>\r\n2) \"...he's your new teammate\" Serpentime hums, then hovers Morgan to her shoulder, bringing him to the telporter so he can meet the rest of Young Justice<br>\r\n3) \"...I'm trying to help him get home\" Serpentime looks disappointed, but offers to help find a way to send him home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Character notes:<br>\r\nSerpentime is an OC<br>\r\nNora is Nora Allen, daughter of the Flash and a speedster like him and Wally.<br>\r\nMorrigan is like Conner in YJ, except she's the clone/daughter of Kara Zor-El and Lena Luthor, and unlike Clark, neither parent is an asshole to her, so that's fine. Also an OC<br>\r\nThea is the Speedy/Red Arrow before Roy, she's still part of the Hero community even if she isn't kicking as in red leather any more.]</span></div></div>",

Once secure she uses her powers to slip into her own shadow, appearing where the darkest auras were in the city, it worked... but only because Jinx was currently trying to not get killed by Cinderblock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took your time goth Queen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of us charge head first punk princess\" Raven retorts, then side steps an energy blast \"Dr. Light, not afraid of me anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckles \"No, a few years of therapy with the prison doctor and I'm no longer afraid of you... or the dark. But just to be safe, I WILL DESTROY YOU!\" he begins rapid firing his light beams, the demon flickering through her shadow powers and dark light constructs to avoid them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as minizora are mostly a legend in the multiverse not much is known about them ,even to an expert of magical oddities like Raven, because of this she didn't know about their ability to transfer energy as well as augment the body, nor the intensity of the power involved in the transformation. With the level of magic Raven was using, even f it wasn't much for her Morgan began to worry, and in doing so his hidden ability activated, his magic flowing into her and filling her, gaining a few inches in height but more importantly her bust and ass began to swell, more noticeable in her tight costume which was actually how she was able to defeat the supervillain, her suit ripped open at the top, giving him an eyeful of pale cleavage and his staring was long enough he didn't see the punch to the face coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn pervert, oh that feels nice\" Raven purrs as her assets bounce freely, the magic also beginning to mess with her arousal, her demonic side making it worse as Lust began to go berserk, her form increased the most of the emoticlones as she tried to free herself and take control, her domain bleeding through into normal Raven who chews her lip and tries to avoid touching herself in public<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay there Rae?\" the purplette turns and Jinx is standing there looking concerned, well she was until her eyes dropped to her L cup cleavage, her eyebrows disappearing into her pink hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, he's done, where's yours?\" Raven stutters slightly while speaking but the luck breaker didn't seem to react<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dropped a building on him, pretty sure Vic is making sure he's down for the count\" she replies with a slight bored tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The feelings are too strong, Raven teleports back to her room, barricades the door and takes care of business<br>\r\n2) The feelings intensify, her empathic abilities spreading it to the nearest woman to try shift focus, but all it does is make both heroes horny and hot for each other.

She wouldn't shove it all on the girl, the pinkette was quite possibly her best friend, it was going to be just enough to let her think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Raven didn't know, or maybe her lust idled brain didn't consider was her magic was now mingled with Morgan's minizora magic, and by pushing it into Jinx, it began to effect her too. The devil horn, haired girl sighs and then moans, cupping her chest as it inflates to the size of footballs, sashaying in her chucky heels over to the hooded girl and grabs a good handful of her bubble butt. Raven squeaks just before petit fingers cup her chin and turn it to the cat eyed girl, though it quickly becomes a whimper as Jinx kisses her, the luck manipulator dominating the kiss until they part with a thread of saliva joining them for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanted me in bed sweetie, all you had to do was ask\" she purrs, then her hands move up and reach into Raven's cloak \"Though I must say, love the upgrades. Yes, Mama likeie!\" she pinches Raven's nipples and yelps when a shadow wave pins her to the wall, Raven's hand on her neck before she shoves her long, demon tongue in the human's mouth, while the shadows play with her sensitive nips, tease her pussy and even rub against her forbidden entrance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think we will have a lot of fun, with you\" Raven's voice was tinged with something else, making it deep and smoky, setting Jinx's loins aflame, the smaller girl pulled into an embrace, her improved assets completely outclassed by the demon's massive jugs, before the 2 are teleported to Raven's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this Morgan wriggled his way to the edge of Raven's cleavage, peeking out to talk \"Miss Raven, can you maybe cool it with the magic, I'm getting tired\" he whines \"Actually, sleepy sleepy sleepy\" Morgan mumbles before passing out, Jinx staring in shock as Raven pets his head with her pinkie, before teleporting him to a high shelf where he would be in any danger nor in the way of the fun while he recovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Raven takes command, having her way with the pinkette using her shadow powers to form tentacles and anyone who's watched <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">henta</span>i <i>off brand </i>anime will know, this won't end well, or maybe it will<br>\r\n2) Jinx takes command, shoving Raven onto her back and playing with her 'cow tits' while getting her lower lips wet and ready<br>\r\n3) Raven pushes Jinx onto the bed and begins to worship her lithe form, as she was forced into this position, even more than Raven was, the demon thinks she deserves to be pleasured first</span></div></div>",

Morgan falling onto the ground with a light bounce<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow\" Morgan groans, sitting up and blinking as the shadows writhe and coalesce \"What the Hell?\" he wonders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's do cute!\" Morgan meeps as he gets picked up and cuddled against a pale grey cheek, seeing a little bit of pink in his peripheral vision<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hog the sexy squirt\" a smoky purr sounds behind him, Morgan looking behind him and yelps when he sees a red skinned, 4 eyed demon chick with ash white hair, 7 ft tall and M cup tits, her bust and privates covered with scraps of fabric \"I'm so going to wreck you\" she says with a grin, revealing shark like teeth and a long whip like tongue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-m-m-maybe someone g-gentler should have a turn first?\" attention was turned to the one in a grey cloak, looking like she was trying to be a small as possible, until she's pulled to Lust who just grins wider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or just something bigger\" she hisses tearing grey raven's clothes off and roughly fondles her large chest, her tongue snaking along their surface as the other hand goes lower, though pink blocks the view before Morgan see's anything else<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, who knew Timid would be first to try anal?\" Pink yelps and falls back into another Raven's lap, Morgan seeing a little bit of green over her shoulder, as well as context for the whimpered <i>'That doesn't go there' </i>he heard around Pink's hand. Green runs her tongue along pink's neck, while her hands quickly find and grope the emoticlone's perky tits \"Firm and bouncy, I think I got the best pair\" she sighs into her double's collarbone, the girl giggling nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me\" the 2 Raven's look down at Morgan \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on is you made Rae-Rae horny as all Heck\" Happy answers, giggling as Brave goes from groping to tickling \"Though its not entirely your fault, if she hadn't broken the soul dew mirror you would have just one horny half demon to deal with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather than 4\" Braves chimes, just as they hear Timid's muffled grunts and Lust's growling moans \"Damn she really is going to town on that girl, poor thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sate the beast, all 4 of us must be done in order to reform into Raven Prime or whatever you want to call her, Blue will do in a pinch\" Happy explains<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Lust is bored of Timid, grabs Morgan and uses him, Brave and Happy knowing they can't take her just play with each other<br>\r\n2) Timid is a good enough distraction for now, Happy and Brave have their way with Morgan<br>\r\n3) Lust has had enough of a wimp like Timid so has a go of Brave and Happy, leaving Morgan to comfort and take care of the mopey Raven</span></div></div>",

He was used to how his massages effected women, which was why he was able to hold onto Nami's left ass cheek when she had a shaking orgasm, the woman panting as Morgan slid down her butt back onto the bed, then slowly walks over to her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bliss\" the navigator purrs, eyes half open<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Despite calling Morgan a pervert it's Nami who decides to get lewd, grabbing Morgan as she rolls over and shoving him in the front of her bikini bottoms, telling him to 'massage' her pussy next<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) With Nami practically passed out Morgan's first choice has become available, and when Robin lies on her back it sets a clear message as to where she wants Morgan to begin, her big Oharan titties :D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Nami has a moneymaking scheme, skip to Morgan awaiting his first client in the Straw Hats fairy style traveling massage parlour</span></div></div>",

He giggles himself and gives the orb a kiss then continues to climb and smooch until he reached her right nipple, where he wraps his arms around the nub tightly before pinching and nibbling on the tip, even attempting to suckle like a new born. This got Robin's attention who moans loudly when both hands cup her bosom, Morgan squeaks at the sudden wetness as she blooms mouths on her palms and joins in the fun, sucking on her left tit while the right play with Morgan, rubbing him against her tit while tasting every available inch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are quite the wonder Morgan, you know just what a girl needs, to get off\" Robin moans, panting as she cums, as the aftershocks pass she releases her bosom and Morgan breathes heavily, still clutching her nipple<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Robin smirks and leans forward a little, Morgan falling off her boob, down her flat stomach and ends up between her legs. She asks him to continue his massage with her firm thighs and maybe somewhere else while he's down there... if he behaves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) She decides it's unfair to have Morgan do all the work and picks him off her chest and prepares to give him a massage of her own, though he may end up being reintroduced to her boobs during said session<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Thinking he needs a rest Robin puts him in one of her or Nami's bras and lies back to take a nap herself.

She preferred Luffy's wife, not that he said yes or anything, the Kuja pirate wasn't going to let a minor detail like that stop her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hancock, what brings you to the Sunny this fine morning?\" Robin asks politely, unlike Nami she knew being a cunt to someone like Hancock was a stupid decision, plus she had Morgan to worry about... oh crap where was Morgan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better. I'm here so my beloved Luffy senpai will confess his love to me and aks me to be his pirate Queen\" Hancock coos, the her eyes bulge \"What is this thing, some kind of perverted insect?\" she sneers, gritting her teeth and Robin groans, found him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand quickly blooms from Hancock's immense sideboob, grabbing Morgan and placing him on Robin's head, where he was still in line of sight of the Empress, but also no longer on her person \"This is Morgan, a little person I found on the ship a little while ago\" she explains<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock hums before holding her hand out \"Give him to me\" she demands, shocking both tiny and archiologist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me the tiny male\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy/What now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Hancock knows the best way to get Luffy (in her mind) is to give him a family, and seeing as getting pregnant herself would require sleeping with Luffy, something she can't do right now, Morgan gets her the results with none of the prepwork<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) As the Kuja Queen Hancock only takes the best things, in this case including a tiny boy who she can use as a plaything, as well as something to tease and torment when she has no more access to Luffy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Robin stands her ground, telling Hancock she found him and has already claimed him as her tit toy, Morgan conflicted by this statement, on the one hand Robin seems to be the nicer of the 2 giantess he's met so far, on the other, he's not that happy about being a toy to anyone</span></div></div>",

Especially as blood means practically nothing to Luffy-kun, he adopted Ace and  Sabo as brothers, Dadan as a mother figure and then there's his crew, you're all one messed up family, but you're family none the less\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stared, then she had no choice but to laugh: she knew Hancock was right about everything, she just didn't expect the Kuja to know, about the family he built in Goa, that the only blood he knew was Garp, and his idea of nakama, how he saw a pirate crew as friends and family, not something expendable like other pirate captains. How even if you fought you had each others back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Luffy like?\" Morgan asks, reminding Robin she had a little person on her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bit dim, heart of gold bigger than his body, incredibly strong, hates traitors and backstabbers, treats his crew like family, but kind of a dick to outsiders, a friend to princesses all across the Grand Line, tot he point they're affectionately referred to as Luffy's harem, and would walk through Hell for his crew, his nakama, which is good because we'd do the same for our captain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he sounds nice\" Morgan decides, before screaming as he's plucked from Robin's hair and brought to Hancock's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Yes he is, Luffy-kun will love you very much too. Just think little one, the most beautiful woman in the sea, and the future Pirate King, but you'll know and refer to them as 'mom' and 'dad' doesn't that sound great?\" Hancock purrs and then Morgan's field of vision is once more filled with huge tits, this time being Hancock's and she pushes him into her cleavage, turns on her heels and heads off to find Luffy, who in this case was sleeping in the captain's quarters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my love, I have a present for you\" she whiseprs in his ear huskily, causing him to sit up and look at her, his eyes bleery and unfocused, but his smile still present<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the present? Can I eat it? Is it meat?\" he asks several questions together, causing Hancock to laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no my love\" she assures, then reaches into her cleavage, Luffy watching in confusion \"it's our son, Morgan!\" she announces revealing his with a flourish<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hancock, why'd you call the stork, we're not even engaed yet?\" Luffy asks/whines in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't Robin found him, the poor thing needs parents and we'd be perfect for him\" Hancock explains/lies, pouting cutely as she does<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy hums \"But why did Robin call the stork?\" he wonders aloud before shrugging, Morgan now understanding why Robin said Luffy was kind of dim \"Sure let's keep him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock squeals, even louder when Luffy hugs her, wrapping her arms around him so her legs don't give out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Luffy thinks it's too dangerous on the Sunny for a child Morgan's age, so sends him away with his 'mom' back to Amazon Lily. Given she's the Queen and Morgan's tiny there should be no problems with the 'no men' rule, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Luffy thinks a child should have both parents whenever possible so invites Hancock to join is crew, the woman's response is to hug him so tightly if he wasn't made of rubber his spine would have snapped, and there's really no reason he didn't pass out from her breasts smothering him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Similar to 2, but Hancock says they should get married as pirates, with the captain's blessing, followed by spending the day/night consummating the union. They both think Morgan is too young to see people fucking, so Luffy brings them over to Robin and ask her to babysit the little guy, saying she's 'the most responsible person on the ship', plus he doesn't want Nami to sell him for a bag of gold or jewels</span></div></div>",

Before we go any further, let me explain this...odd situation. In this room lay a little boy. No, really, a LITTLE boy. He was only about an inch or two tall, and slept in a bed faaaaaaar tinier than any of us ever thought possible. This child's name was Morgan. He was only about seven or eight years old, and was a cheerful and bright boy. The voice calling to him was his mother, Severa. She was a woman of average height and build. She had scarlet red hair and slightly larger than average sized breasts. She also had MAJOR self-esteem issues, and she was prone to going on angry rants and being short of patience with people. Deep down however, she was a caring loving soul, that just needed to open herself up to you to consider you a true friend. But to Morgan, she was his loving <b><i>mother</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan. Wake up.\" The voice said, slightly sterner this time. Severa was rocking Morgan's bed to wake him up, but he was still fast asleep. Severa's face had an expression of annoyance on it, Morgan's sleepiness getting on her nerves. Her patience already hit it's end, and the day hadn't even started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORGAN!\" She said, slamming the table next to the bed. The resulting mini-earthquake on the table caused Morgan to snap awake in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaah!\" He exclaimed, falling out of his bed. His covers fell onto him, and he couldn't see.anything. Severa smirked as she saw her son fall, but quickly regretted her actions. She helped Morgan up as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Morgan. You weren't waking up.\" She said bluntly, but with a smile of affection on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Mother. Just...wasn't expecting that.\" He said, getting up and dusting off his pajamas. \"Err...wait. Why did you wake me up? You usually don't wake me up this early.\" He said, curious. Severa's face glistened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to spend the day with you Morgan. It's not like we get to spend much time anymore. You better be grateful!\" She said, her defensive wall of an attitude showing to even her son. Morgan knew not to take her seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, I am. Just let me get dressed and we can spend the day together!\" Morgan said happily. Severa smiled sweetly, something rare for her, as she simply nodded and sat down in a chair meant for her or Robin. Oh right! Robin! He was the gifted tactician for the Shepherds, and has an intellect unlike any other. He and Severa had often gotten into \"arguments\", which is mostly Severa screaming at Robin because she felt inadequate next to his admittedly superior intellect. Severa wasn't stupid in any way. In fact she was quite intelligent, much like her mother Cordelia; However her hot-tempered nature and lack of patience caused her to get frustrated rather quickly, clouding her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan got out of his pajamas and into his casual clothes. He had a mini tactician's outfit much like his fathers, but he felt like he didn't really need it. He brushed his teeth with a small brush and a puddle of water, and presented himself to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready mom! Let's go!\" He exclaimed, jumping into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...finally! Took ya long enough.\" She said sarcastically, before smiling, revealing a bit of playfulness. She walked over to the table and knelt down. She pat Morgan on the head and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna do?\" Morgan asked, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Severa have planned for their day together?</span></div></div>",

Morgan didn't know what she meant by that. Soon after, a rather soft and weak knock was heard at the door. Whoever was knocking clearly didn't want to make themselves known, or they were rather meek. Or both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello? Is anyone in here?\" The voice said weakly. Severa turned to look at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on in Noire, it's open.\" Severa said. After that, the door slowly opened to reveal a rather meek, shy girl on the other side. She was rather average height, black hair, and she was wearing a green archer outfit he's seen several times before. What made her body <i>really</i> stand out was her chest. Her chest was <b><i>enormous</i></b>. To Morgan, they were the biggest ones he'd ever seen, and that was against some stiff competition. She walked forward slowly, her body stance one of weakness and fear as she entered the room to meet Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Severa.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Noire, you ready to hang out with Morgan and I today?\" She asked with a smile on her face. It seemed she was genuinely excited for today, even if she wasn't showing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...! Um...hi Morgan.\" She said, shifting her gaze to the boy. He looked up and smiled sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Noire! Nice to see you!\" He said. Severa shifted her body to get both of their attention as she cleared her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noire's joining us on our day out Morgan! It'll be the three of us, it'll be fun.\" She said with a smile before looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"not that it wouldn't have been fun with just me...\" She said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!

He sat down on his mother's shoulder as Severa turned to Noire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, before we spend the day out on the town, do you wanna grab a bite to eat? I'm starving.\" Severa asked, Noire smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I-I wouldn't mind getting something to eat with you two.\" Noire said. Severa chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright come on, I know a place in town that makes the most delicious sweets you'll ever taste.\" Severa said, beginning to walk towards the door. Morgan had already been used to riding on someone's shoulder due to his size, so he wasn't thrown off or disoriented in the slightest when Severa began to move. Severa made a motion for Noire to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! R-Right behind you.\" Noire said, walking out of the door. Severa locked the door behind them and walked out into the town. After the war, the town blossomed into a bustling city full of people running left and right getting things done. It was quite hectic, but also quite peaceful at the same time. Severa walked with Morgan on her shoulder, Noire following closely behind. They engaged in some small talk on the way over, but nothing quite interesting enough to keep Morgan's attention. Eventually, they reached the sweet shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is. Best sweets in town. I mean, it's not the only thing they serve here but whatever.\" She said bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! I can't wait to see what they have..!\" Noire said. After getting a table and receiving a menu, they sat there and watched the hustle and bustle of the town. Eventually, they had ordered and gotten their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had gotten a large chocolate chip cookie and a glass of water that was comparable to an ocean for him. Severa got a cinnamon frosted roll and a small sandwich, and Noire had gotten a rather large pastry that Morgan wondered if she'd be able to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm..!\" Noire said with a full mouth before swallowing. \"These are delicious! How come I'd never heard of this place before?\" Noire asked. Severa chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's new. This place only opened up about a month ago. Mother was telling me the details of how she came here with Father, so I decided to check it out with both of you.\" Severa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although i could've come up with a place myself...\" Severa said under her breath. Noire noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Noire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Severa snarkily responded, her walls immediately flying up. She turned down to Morgan to change the subject. He was laying on top of the half finished cookie with a tired expression on his face. To a normal person, he had just eaten a bite, but to him, he'd just stuffed his belly with sweet cookie goodness. \"How was the cookie Morgan?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was delicious Mother! Promise me we'll come back here again with Father!\" He said excitedly, Severa chuckled and pet his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be back, I promise.\" Severa said with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaay!\" Morgan exclaimed. Noire let out a light belch, and immediately covered her mouth with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry! Sorry!\" Noire exclaimed. Both Morgan and Severa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to eat their sweets, chat and people watch, just making the most out of their day before they went on to do other things later together. Severa looked at the menu again, just scanning for something else they might want before they left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

While some stayed close with their parents, others either felt it best to not interfere with their soon-to-be born selves, or simply had their own interests that they wanted to pursue. One of these latter children was Morgan, son of Robin and prince of Ylisse. He still loved his parents and his sister, but he was an adult and wanted his own destiny, something new to see, so he set off to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his travels, he came across a strange gate on a southern island, said to lead to other worlds. Morgan's near child-like curiosity kicked in and lead to him entering the gate. On the other side, he found a world almost identical to the one he left behind. The only differences were that this world's Robin was male rather than female like his mother, rather than giving birth to a son named Morgan, this world's Morgan was Robin's daughter, and lastly, while Grima had been defeated here, the Shepards and their children remained together on the march in a military camp to personally clean up any Grimleal stragglers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Morgan had learned all of this, he tried to go back through the gate so as not to interfere with such a similar world, only to find himself unable to go back through the gate home. Whatever power that allowed him to come here was now gone. Seeing little other choice, the young man approached this world's Robin and explained to him the rather... complicated situation of all this. The tactician, while skeptical at first, soon welcomed his alternate reality son with open arms and even adopted him before introducing him to his new mother Lissa, and his adoptive \"siblings\", Owain and... Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say it was awkward when these two first met would be an understatement. How one even begins to explain introducing your gender-bent self from another world was something that escaped Robin. But after the initial confusion, Morgan quickly embraced her new \"brother\" and loved him like any other member of her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a new day now and Morgan had just woken up. Who should he go see first?</span></div></div>",

Next the grimleal were annoying and were a problem for the kingdom, as well as the rule of Plegia was a terrible person (In Robin\u2019s opinion, and most people\u2019s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Robin first moved to Ylisse there were some slight problems but after some time Robin managed to settle down and get married to a man by the name of Chrom, she was a couple of months older than him and a couple of inches taller. They had two children, Lucina and Morgan. Morgan was a minizora a being that originated in Plegia but moved to Ylisse so they could be treated better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlegia started a war with Ylisse. Ylisse didn\u2019t want the war and did offer them food to trade. Plegia declined as they also wanted everyone to worship Grima.. To make things worse Chrom was drafted which broke the hearts of his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive months into the war Morgan was tasked with going to the market to get food and a variety of other things. The reason Morgan is capable of doing this is that Robin taught Morgan a spell that allows him to shrink non-living things allowing Morgan carry money and food. As well Robin gave Morgan enchanted shoes that allow him to move at the same speed he would move if he was a normal size person. The reason why Robin trusted her eleven year old boy to do this was because Ylisse minizora rights were were so well minizoras\u2019 were treated as well as anybody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Morgan was going back home he saw tent in the row of markets he had never seen before.

Severa let out a small sound of pleasure as the microzora hit her breasts, then swiftly proceeded to disappear into her massive cleavage. She put her hands on her breasts with a blush on her face. \"You'll be safe in there...safe with...me...\" She said, oddly affectionate. Unknown to Morgan, Severa had a huge crush on him. Despite him being literally the size of a grain of rice, she really, really liked him. She was relieved when Lucina was able to retrieve Morgan from Tharja's grasp. She would never admit it to him; At least...not unless he liked her back. But what were the odds of that...Severa thought to herself. Her caring smile quickly returning to her angry scowl once again. She crossed her arms, which led to her cleavage being moved significantly, startling Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sev? Is...everything alright?\"  Morgan said, his innocent eyes looking into Severa's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Everything is fine! I told you that already!\" Severa yelled, looking away with her face red. Suddenly, she used her finger to push Morgan further into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And what are you doing out! You could get hurt out here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive shift in weight and boinginess from Lucina's breasts brought Severa back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even try it Tharja!\" Lucina said, angry yet overly protecting. Tharja dryly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't try girl, I'll <i><b>do</b></i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tharja threw herself at Lucina, and Lucina fell to the ground, Severa, frightened, grabbed onto her own breasts as hard as she could, in order to protect Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sev?! What's going on?!\" Morgan asked from deep inside Severa's tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Morgan! I won't let anything happen to you!\" She said, any remnants of previous anger gone from her voice. Tharja delivered a swift punch to Lucina's face, causing her to retaliate with one of her own before headbutting Tharja. W-Were they really fighting over this?! Tharja momentarily removed herself from Lucina to get up, with Lucina doing the same. Lucina adjusted her outfit, which had more than it's fair share of cleavage hanging out before turning her attention to Tharja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's how it's going to be, then SO BE IT!\" Lucina yelled with more fury than either Severa or Morgan had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina and Tharja ran towards each other to start fighting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Tharja and Lucina ran forward, getting ready to attack each other, when Severa ducked her head, and in turn Morgan deep into Lucina's tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeeeev! What's haaaappeniiiiing?!\" Morgan yelled. Severa grabbed her own tits to protect Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! J-Just stay close and hang on!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the big world, Tharja throws a wild punch at Lucina, and she grabs Tharja's fist out of mid-air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" Tharja said, the most shocked of expressions on her face. Lucina's furious scowl hadn't changed in the slightest. Robin's eyes widened. Severa poked her head out of Lucina's tits and noticed what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Robin said in awe. She definitely inherited Chrom's strength, that's for sure. Lucina used her strength to twist Tharja's arm, releasing a scream of pain from the older woman. In extreme pain, Tharja attempted to swing her other arm at Lucina, but she was able to avoid it. Using her massive strength, Lucina lifted Tharja into the air and slammed her down on the opposite side of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaghhhh!\" Tharja yelled, several bones in her body broken. Lucina simply walked over to her with an angry look. She stared down at Tharja as she tried to pull herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know what's good for you, you'll stay down.\" Lucina commanded. Severa looked up at Lucina in awe, and maybe a little twinge of jealousy mixed in. Lucina was so much stronger than she was; Bigger too. In more ways than one....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja let out a pained laugh. \"I may not be able to beat you in physical combat...\" She began, finally being able to stand on her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll fall to my spells! And then the boy will be mine!\" She laughed. Tharja pulled a tome out of her cloak and charged a spell. When she fired it at Lucina, she only barely dodged, having to dive to the floor to not get hit. Her tits hit the floor before she did, and both Severa and Morgan felt the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch...\" Morgan said, grabbing his head. He looked up to see Severa's worried face staring back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Morgan?!\" She said, panicking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay Sev...\" Morgan said, smiling up to his giant friend. His smile of pure innocence couldn't stop her from smiling back, as she pet his head with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just stay close until it's all over.\" Severa told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina started to recover from her dive onto the floor and swiftly looked down into her tits. She saw Severa and Morgan still firmly planted in her chest and turned back to Tharja. She started to charge a wind spell, and Lucina suddenly had an idea. She prepared her plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tharja released the wind spell, Lucina moved upwards so the spell hit behind her. The wind propelled Lucina through the air towards Tharja at top speed! Tharja's eyes widened in shock as Lucina flew towards her. \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!\" Lucina yelled, ramming her fist into Tharja's face one last time. She was sent several dozen feet in the same direction, her unconscious body accidentally ramming into other innocent bystanders as she flew. Robin brought her hands to her face in shock before running off to check on Tharja. Lucina heavily panted as the look of anger ceased to be on her face. She quickly fished Severa and Morgan out of her cleavage and holds them close to her face with a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two okay?\" She said, almost motherlike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Luci, don't worry about me!\" Morgan said, poking his head from Severa's cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excellent...\" Lucina said, a sigh of relief following soon after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine too you know.\" Severa said with her arms crossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm sorry Severa! Are you okay? I was focused on Morgan cause...you know.\" Lucina said, feeling guilty. Severa sighed, she wasn't mad at her, for what it was worth. She actually was still feeling the awe from seeing Lucina completely obliterate Tharja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. So now what do we do?\" Severa asked. Lucina looked around and noticed that many eyes were on her. Mostly due to her having punched Tharja to oblivion. She laughed with a smidge of guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably just head back to my tent.\" Lucina said. \"Come on, hold on now.\" She pushed Severa further into her cleavage and pat her head slightly. Severa blushed heavily. Damn it! What was happening to her?! This whole day has just been nothing but blushing and boobs! Well...at least Morgan was in hers...Lucina walked off to her room, her tits causing Severa and Morgan to bounce with each step, which in turn made Severa's tits bounce Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they returned to the room, she bent over slightly and fished Severa out of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me get us some water.\" Lucina said, walking over to the kitchen. Severa took the time to fish Morgan out of her own cleavage and talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sev?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Severa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for keeping me safe. I know Luci was the one fighting, but you're the one that kept me out of trouble.\" Morgan said sweetly. He dropped onto one of Severa's breasts and hugged it. Her face turned bright red. She couldn't hold it in anymore! This entire time Morgan was with her, she felt something in her chest that only grew stronger with each passing minute! Not to mention Lucina's badass fight just minutes ago! Severa's emotions were whirling in her head. She didn't know if she could take much more of this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The white-haired woman had the deepest of blushes on her face, trying to let her emotions out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan...I...I've been in love with you since the first time we met!\" Severa told him. \"I-I know we haven't known each other that long, but this burning feeling in my chest won't go away!

And when you thanked me for keeping you safe, the fluttering feeling only got worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know you'd probably want to be with any other girl in the world except me...\" Severa said, looking away. Her self-confidence hitting an all-time low. \"But that doesn't change the fact that I love you Morgan!\" Severa exclaimed. Lucina watched and heard Severa, motionless while Severa looked at Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Severa...\" Morgan said, looking into his friend's eyes. \"I love you too.\" Severa's eyes widened as her jaw hit the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha...what did you just say?

I look forward to seeing you every day, and you're someone who can really make me laugh! You're so kind and caring to me...I just love being with you! Cuddling, talking, playing, all of it! I love you Severa!\" Morgan exclaimed. Severa's eyes began to water as she started crying. She held Morgan close to her and refused to let go. Lucina smiled as she let the two have their moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Morgan...I'm so h-happy...!\" She said between her tears. Morgan simply hugged her body. \"I love you Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Severa.\" Morgan responded. She brought him to her face and kissed his body once again. The most genuine and happy smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Severa brought Morgan to her cleavage once again and dropped him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here my love...I want you to be close to me. I'll always keep you safe.\" Severa lovingly said. Morgan hugged them and rested his head on his new girlfriend's breasts. Lucina, with a smile on her face, walked over with small dishes of water. She grabs a nearby chair and sits down with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...look at the little lovebirds.\" She teasingly said. Severa's face flashed bright red as she scowled at Lucina in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Don't tease me!\" Severa yelled. Lucina simply giggled and pet Severa's head with her finger. Severa growled but ultimately said nothing. She...really enjoyed being pet by Lucina...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually...she really enjoyed simply <i>being</i> with Lucina too. She enjoyed riding in her cleavage, with Morgan in hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...why hasn't this feeling gone away yet?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa?\" Lucina asked, snapping her back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha?\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been...staring at me for a while.

Lucina's eyes began to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...\" She began. Severa hit the sides of her head with her palms in frustration. Just do it already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods dammit! I love you too Lucina!\" She exploded. Both Morgan and Lucina's jaw dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're strong, you're kind, you're protective!

I love both of you!\" She yelled, beginning to cry once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera felt a tingle in her chest when she looked down, Morgan was trying to get her attention. She picked him up and brought him close. Morgan began to dry Severa's tears and hug her face, shocking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...don't cry Severa...\" Morgan affectionately said. Severa hugged Morgan harder than she ever had before, and gave him the sweetest smile afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you Morgan...\" She said. Severa and Morgan both slowly look up at Lucina, who is simply staring at Severa with the most neutral of expressions on her face. Both Morgan and Severa couldn't tell what she was thinking. Was she mad? Was she happy? Was she disappointed? Both of them look up to Lucina's blank stare for her response....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Lucina's response?</span></div></div>",

Lucina began to knead her breasts in such a way that it actually smothered and massaged Severa's body. What she said was true, she LOVED Lucina's breasts, and here they were having such an...intimate moment together. Suddenly, a sharp flux of pleasure erupted from deep within Severa, letting out a loud moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Morgan?! Right there! P-Please!\" Severa pleaded, continuously being smothered by Lucina's giant breasts. She was being stimulated on two fronts, and the pleasure was heaven-like, Severa's arousal and horniness only grew while she felt herself being loved by both Morgan inside of her and Lucina's canyon of cleavage outside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina began to get hot as well, and picked up the pace playing with her tits and in turn Severa. While kneading her own breasts Lucina let out a soft moan that only turned Severa on even more. She wanted to hear that again. Severa grabbed onto a massive amount of Lucina's tit flesh and started kissing it and massaging it herself. Lucina let out a godly moan, and kneaded her breasts even harder, practically crushing and smothering Severa with them. Severa loved every second of it, and Lucina's moans, along with her tits and Morgan inside of her brought her to the edge extremely quickly, she felt like she could lose it at any moment. Suddenly, Lucina stopped groping herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed Severa with an extremely horny smile on her face, something that Severa returned. Lucina took off her shirt and unclamped her massive bra and threw it aside, Severa's jaw almost dropped when she saw the sheer size of Lucina's tits, now completely unrestricted and free. If anything, they looked even BIGGER than with the bra on! Her nipples were extremely hard, a testament to how aroused she was, and slowly brought Severa closer. Lucina split open Severa's legs, revealing her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha...\" Severa stuttered. Suddenly, and without warning, Lucina shoved Severa's pussy straight onto her nipple, her nipple penetrating Severa and going excessively deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WWHHAAAA!?\" Severa yelled, not expecting this. This felt....amazing! Lucina's breasts were godlike naturally, but being pleasured in THIS way with just her nipple...she wasn't able to process how to feel at that moment. Morgan also began picking up the pace inside of Severa, rubbing and kissing the very spot that she asked him to. Severa moaned as loud as she can, which made Lucina smile with arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love this don't you?\" Lucina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...!\" Severa said between moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it!\" Lucina commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-...I...\" Severa stuttered, the pleasure was too great to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?!

She extended Severa on her hand to show her her gorgeous body, which only made Severa blush harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see...you're the only one who's gotten...pleasured yet.\" Lucina began, bringing herself closer to Severa's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's time for you to please us...</i>\" Lucina seductively whispered. Severa smiled with a fair degree of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've recovered a bit from my little...burst.\" Severa began. \"You ready for round 2?\" Severa asked. Lucina giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd <i>never</i> ask.\" Lucina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Is it playtime again?\" Morgan asked. Severa brought him closer to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my love. It's our special little playtime again.\" Severa said. \"And since you two made me feel...amazing last time, I guess it's only fair for me to return the favor.\" Severa said, enticing a horny giggle from Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lucina lowered her hands with a sly smile to her vagina, and Severa jumped up and climbed into Lucina's pussy, enticing a moan from her, which turned Severa on further. She climbed slightly deeper into Lucina's pussy and started rubbing her sensitive areas, making Lucina moan louder and louder. Severa could get used to that sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo at the moment, Morgan was inside of Severa, who was in turn inside of Lucina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Severa could continue pleasing Lucina, a sharp wave of pleasure washed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-AHHH!

There!\" She stuttered. While she could spend eternity being pleased by her new boyfriend, she was knee-deep into Lucina at the moment, with the sole purpose to make her orgasm just like she did....even if Morgan made it slightly more difficult to focus. <i>Not that that was a bad thing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She looked around for something big, something to pleasure her to such a degree that she'll never <i>think</i> of touching herself again. She looked around for a brief moment before an idea sprang into her head. She wanted to find IT. She wanted to find Lucina's sensitive spot, and make her moan just like Morgan made her previously. Severa ran her hand down her body to get Morgan's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan?\" Severa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sev?\" He happily responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's that...special spot you always use?

She could feel herself getting hot again, and extremely quickly. Nothing seemed to turn her on more than Morgan's massages and Lucina's moans. However, she pressed on. And...she found this one spot she hadn't tried yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera started rubbing that one new spot, and Lucina's body jerked in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaahh! Yes...!\" Lucina could be heard from the outside. Her fingers started to pick up their pace as Lucina fingered herself quicker and quicker, wanting to compound the pleasure. Severa let out a devious giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like we foooound it!\" She said happily. \"This'll teach you for touching yourself when you have me!\" Severa started rubbing and massaging Lucina's sensitive spot, and could barely hold herself back from kissing it. Morgan decided to join in on the fun and started massaging Severa's spot too, causing her to moan. Her pleasure only increased her drive, and she picked up her pace in pleasuring Lucina. Lucina's moans got higher and higher in pitch, and shorter in length as time went on. Lucina's fingers were penetrating her faster than she ever thought possible, and Severa finally caved in and started kissing Lucina's sensitive spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngghhaaaaaahhh!\" Lucina moaned loudly. \"Sev...er...a...\" She stuttered passionately. \"More....\" She whispered to herself. With a cocky smile on her face, Severa took off her shirt and unhooked her bra. She began rubbing Lucina's sensitive spot with her tits, her nipples long since hard. Lucina's eyes shot open as she moaned as loud as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAghhh....! Can't....take any....more!\" Lucina said. \"I'm...gonna...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Severa heard rumbling deep within Lucina.

Lucina's gonna...!\" Morgan said. \"This is the same thing that happened with you! Hold onto something!\" Morgan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera quickly latched onto Lucina's sensitive spot, her bare tits pressing up against it, as the rumbling only got more intense.

She managed to keep her grip for a second or two, but was ultimately thrown off by the sheer force of Lucina's orgasm. She flew out of her pussy at top speed right into Lucina's drenched hand that was waiting for her. She opened her eyes and started heavily panting, not expecting Lucina's orgasm to be this....intense. She looked up at the massive girl, and saw a loving and pleased smile on her face. Severa knew she did a good job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha...I've never...felt so amazing...\" Lucina said softly before bringing Severa to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're better at this than you think.\" Lucina whispered in her ear. She gave her a quick kiss before setting her down on the table. She was both extremely proud of herself and extremely flustered. She...was never told how good she was at something before, and for her to be praised on something this...lewd, she didn't know how to feel. Suddenly, Morgan's voice snapped Severa out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was an intense ride! Can we do it again?\" Morgan exclaimed from within Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! M-Morgan!\" Severa said.

Severa blushing harder than ever. It was one thing to be pleasured by the one you love, but to actually pleasure them BACK, Severa wasn't sure if she was good enough for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? My turn? Morgan asked. Lucina stared at them with a huge smile on her face. She got to the floor and leaned onto the table, her massive tits being squished against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Severa said nervously. \"I-It's only fair that we please you too! You've...made me feel so...special...\" Severa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to make you feel the same way!\" She yelled. Lucina let out a soft giggle and pet Severa on the head with her finger. Severa used all of her willpower to not cover her face in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...Okay...\" Morgan said. \"I'm sure you'll do amazing Severa. Don't worry!\" Morgan said, finally understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I hope.\" Severa looked at Morgan with loving eyes, the blush on her face a lovely contrast to her white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do you want to do Morgan? <i>We're all yours</i>.\" Lucina said with a sly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Severa picked Morgan up with a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So how do we...\" Severa started. Morgan jumped off of Severa's hands onto her breasts, causing a slight noise to come from Severa, but nothing major. He ran to the edge of her breasts and jumped onto her nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Morgan? What are yo-\" She started. Morgan took as much of Severa's nipple as he could and started sucking on it passionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAAA..!\" Severa exclaimed, she wasn't expecting Morgan to start...sucking on her breasts! A large blush grew on her face as she started rubbing her breasts, Morgan still going to town on her nipple. In a death defying stunt, Morgan jumped from Severa's nipple onto her other one, and somehow STUCK THE LANDING! He wasted no time in putting as much of her nipple as he could into his mouth, releasing a soft moan from Severa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan...you're...so good at this...\" Severa said lovingly. After about a minute, Morgan stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sev? Pick me up?\" Morgan asked. Severa obeyed and picked Morgan up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can I kiss you Sev? But this time, not holding anything back?\" He said nervously. Without saying a word, Severa brought Morgan to her lips and they engaged in the most passionate kiss of their lives. Neither one of them wanted to end, but an \"Awww...\" from Lucina snapped Severa out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't start with that again!\" Severa yelled. Lucina chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just having fun.\" Lucina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera sighed and held Morgan close again. Suddenly, she began to feel weird all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...? What is this...feeling?\" Severa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just enjoy it. It's working!\" Morgan said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Morgan finished saying that, Severa felt a large pressure begin to build in her breasts. Severa grabbed her breasts with both hands...only to feel them pushing back! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh my Gods...\" Severa said, unable to react to what was happening. Her breasts were swelling outwards! Her already admittedly large breasts were getting bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooow! You're growing Sev!\" Morgan said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Morgan...\" She moaned, rubbing her growing tits. Her breasts continued to swell in size, and their size soon doubled from what they used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger...!\" Severa yelled, loving this immensely. Her breasts obeyed, and continued to swell outwards at an alarming rate. Her breasts only stopped growing after they had TRIPLED in size! They were several times the size of her head now, looking more like large pumpkins, at least at Severa's size, and they were THOUSANDS of times bigger than Morgan! The sheer size and weight of her tits made her legs shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too...big...\" Severa said, moaning. She lost her balance and fell forward onto the table, her massive breasts breaking her fall. Morgan fell out of Severa's hand and fell head-first into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Morgan...\" Severa moaned, picking Morgan up from her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm...huge!\" Severa said, her white hair and red face once again contrasting. Her clothes wouldn't fit her anymore, but she didn't care in the slightest. \"So big...I love it...I love my big boobs...\" Severa moaned, rubbing her massive tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not done growing yet Sev!\" Morgan exclaimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Severa said, tilting her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how we kissed? Well...\" Morgan began. As if on cue, Severa began to feel odd once again. This time, the pressure was distributed across her entire body. Severa moaned as...she started growing! Not her tits, not her butt...but HER! She was getting bigger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha?! I'm...getting taller!\" Severa said, the table shrinking further and further away. She grew past one foot...then two...then 3....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stopped growing at 3 and a half feet tall. Slightly more than TEN TIMES her original height! She looked around in shock. Lucina's jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, I didn't know they could make you taller! You've grown so much!\" Lucina said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know!\" I'm...massive...! I...I...\" Severa said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I love it...</i>\" She finished. She struggled to find Morgan on her hand, but she was able to spot him once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da! You're a giant now!\" Morgan said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan...I...Thank you..\" Severa said, blushing harder. She was able to stand on her feet now, as her new height complemented her massive tits. She was still absolutely massive up top, and her new height gave her the strength to walk and stand with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could get used to this.\" Severa said, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you like it Sev!\" Morgan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? I love this!\" Severa said, looking around at the once massive objects in the room look slightly smaller. Severa was nowhere near as tall as Lucina, or the rest of the world was, but compared to her original four inch height, she was a giantess. Suddenly, Lucina cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...believe it's my turn? Right?\" Lucina said, slightly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinued in next chapter.</span></div></div>",

She continued rubbing her large breasts and examining her surroundings at her new height. Lucina chuckled at Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm gonna get all <b>big</b> right?\" Lucina said seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I can't wait!\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there...any place in particular you want to make bigger?\" Lucina asked. Morgan looked behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about your butt? We'll make it the biggest in the world!\" Morgan said. Lucina giggled, liking that idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...let's do it!\" She said. She laid down on the bed and dropped Morgan onto her ass. It was gigantic by normal means, and jiggled with every step she took, and Morgan was going to make it even bigger. He found his way inbetween her mountains of ass flesh and found her asshole. He jumped in and started licking the insides of her ass, making Lucina moan loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaghhh! Morgan...!\" Lucina said. Severa was watching intensely, albeit still turned on by Lucina's moans. He made sure to drench Lucina's ass in his saliva, for maximum effect, and after a minute of eating Lucina's ass, he was taken out by her hand. He was brought close with a desire-filled expression on Lucina's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan! Please, make this bigger too! I want to be huge!\" Lucina said, before dropping Morgan onto her belly. She had a relatively pudgy tummy already, and she wanted MORE. Morgan wasted no time in dropping to his knees and passionately kissing Lucina's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....\" She moaned, rubbing her belly profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Morgan tired out from kissing Lucina's belly, he collapsed onto it. Lucina giggled and picked Morgan up, handing him over to Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...you got tired? Here, I'll cuddle you real nice...\" Severa said with love, hugging him close. Lucina giggled as both Morgan and Severa watched from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you watch real <i>closely</i>.\" Lucina said, before an odd pressure began building in her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhh!\" She moaned as her ass started to swell. Morgan and Severa watched in awe as the legendary Lucina's ass got even BIGGER by the second. Lucina turned around and grabbed her ass, jiggling it teasingly in front of Morgan and Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>See something you like?</i>\" She said seductively. Neither Morgan nor Severa could muster a response. Soon after, her ass stopped growing. Each of her cheeks were more than twice the size of her head, and had doubled from their original size. Lucina giggled with arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the main show...\" She started, before laying on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is!\" She yelled, before a familiar pressure began building in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh!\" Lucina moaned loudly as her belly began to grow. Her pudgy tummy started to swell outwards, and grew bigger and bigger, as she began rubbing it profusely. Morgan and Severa could only watch as her stomach swelled far past the realm of pregnant and bloated into the obscenely stuffed range, and it wouldn't stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngggaaa!\" Lucina moaned. \"Bigger! BIGGER! MAKE MY BELLY BIGGER!\" Lucina yelled passionately, her stomach still swelling outwards. In fact...it seemed to speed up! Lucina let out a godly moan as her belly grew even FASTER! Severa and Morgan could hear creaking as Lucina's bed collapsed with her on it! She didnt care! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BIIIIIGGGEEEEEEEERRRR</b>!\" Lucina yelled. She had orgasmed again, however it went unnoticed by Morgan and Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after her orgasm, Lucina's belly stopped growing. Lucina was miraculously able to stand up, and take a close look at her bloated belly. It was far bigger than anything Morgan and Severa had ever seen! In fact....her belly alone was bigger than both of them combined!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...love it...\" Lucina moaned, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow is right...look at her! She's gargantuan!\" Severa responded. Lucina let out a soft moan as she continued to rub her belly. After several minutes of staring, Lucina was the one to bring them back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...now that we're all nice and <b><i>big</i></b>...\" Lucina began, clutching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do now?\" Lucina asked, giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He also remembered how a bunch of people had a lot of nose bleeds. \"Well you see, Plegian women have a second puberty of sorts where sometime in their twenties they have a growth spurt, I have already had my growth spurt, and since I'm Robin's older sister it bothers me how she's bigger than me.\" Aversa explains with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you want me to do?\" Morgan asked tilting his, Aversa smirks and saunters over to him, invading his personal space. \"You're going to help me get bigger, I've heard about you're magic sweets and how they gave Noire that juicy bum and Severa those breasts she had dreamed of.

He'd wondered for a while what his future child would be like ever since he and Tharja tied the knot, but he never expected this. He had a few guesses sure, but this was something else completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could remember asking the future Shepherds questions about his family, and they would always either dodge the question or mention how he should be patient and see for himself. He could definitely see why now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his eldest daughter Noire, she looked a lot like Tharja in her face and she was a bit on the thinner side. But she did have his hair and eyes. That was something to note. The only major thing that really stood out was her size. All 50ft of it! She was huge! A giant! How!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Tharja was a bit surprised, although she quickly hid it behind her mask of indifference. Even she didn't know what to make of this. She didn't even come up to the girl's knees. If Robin had to guess she was crossed between awed and annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe present Shepherds were even at a loss. They'd never seen a titan before. She literally steamrolled the enemy with extreme prejudice when she joined them in battle and damn it if she didn't make them all feel small. Especially Ricken given he was the youngest and the shortest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say the surprisingly meek girl made one hell of an introduction. Was she bipolar Robin wondered? Well, he'd just have to wait until they stopped and made camp so he could interview her properly. He was more than a little interested to learn all he could from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat... and he wanted Severa to stop chuckling his way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was how he'd led the Shepherds to victory time and time again- by maintaining a cool head and evaluating all elements present on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this wasn't a battlefield, but Robin was just going to ignore that little tidbit. Tharja hadn't bothered to speak up yet, either, and knowing her she was probably waiting on him to move this whole thing along so that she could return to her normal schedule. Unlike the rest of the Shepherds, his deeper understanding of Tharja granted him an understanding of her outwardly blank face and allowed him to see underneath her mask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja knew something about Noire- or more accurately, Tharja knew something about why Noire was a literal giantess despite technically being human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was a conversation for later. Right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey there! Noire, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin cursed internally. Greetings had never been his strong suit, but if nothing else he'd secured his giant daughter's attention. Said giantess was now stooping down to get closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...Hi, Papa......... Surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor such a huge person, Noire was doing a surprisingly good job keeping her voice soft. The purposeful softening of her voice only served to lend a hand towards solidifying the white-haired giantess's reputation as a meek, timid person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Yeah! You could say that. We... I mean, I wasn't expecting you to be so, well, big!\" Robin cut himself off as he saw his giant daughter visibly flinch at his words. Okaaay, steering away from commenting about her unusually large body for now. Guess that conversation would have to wait until they were away from prying eyes and ears. Moving on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noire, I'm so glad you're here! Tharja and I have been just dying to meet you! The rest of the future children have had so much good things to share about you! I've heard them say so many times about how you're a reliable fighter, you're always willing to lend a helping hand, and, and... so much more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Re...really? They have? I thought they would've... no, never mind,\" Noire mumbled, poking her fingers together, creating a look that was both humorous and adorable to look at. Well, she seemed docile... for now. One of the few things he'd got out of the various future children was that Noire was apparently prone to mood swings- violent ones at that. Looking up at his giant blushing daughter, Robin shivered. Mood swings from Tharja were bad, and tended to result on things getting set on fire. Mood swings from Noire would probably flatten whole buildings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Robin did his best to wave away the other Shepherds, save Tharja. This was a time for family to connect, and he and Tharja were going to need some privacy with Noire for the next few minutes at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Robin was already feeling a spirit of fatherly protectiveness rearing its head inside of him. He'd caught the way Virion, Vaike, and Ricken had been eyeing his daughter. Her body may've been mostly slender, but she'd definitely inherited her mother's... ahem, ample bosom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the other Shepherds had cleared out, Tharja sidled up to him. With all three family members present, the words of the next person to speak shocked the others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\nWho spoke next, and what?<br>\r\n1) Tharja: \"Hmmm.... this was not the result I was expecting from that potion I drank while I was pregnant...\"<br>\r\n2) Robin: (at a loss and scrabbling for what to say) \"Hey, Noire, how 'bout a huge for your father?\"<br>\r\n3) Noire: (Personality flip!) \"BWA HA HA! GREETINGS, TINY PARENTS! I HAVE COME FROM THE FUTURE TO FIND YOU!</span></div></div>",

I HAVE COME FROM THE FUTURE TO FIND YOU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was taken aback at the sudden shift in mood by Noire, and even Tharja was a bit caught off guard. Just a few seconds ago she was a soft spoken girl nervously prodding her fingers together, now she was loud and staring at them with such intensity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt this was a direct result of those mood swings the others mentioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Tharja replied, quickly regaining her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan proceeded to remove one of her gloves and began to shake it over her open palm. Both parents were a bit confused by this action but chose not to comment, opting to see where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds the giant lowered her palm to the ground for both her parents to see. Robin walked forward first wondering what Noire was up too, and stopped when he noticed something shining in the center of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to the giant for confirmation and nodded for him to continue. Her reached forward and gripped the item while he wife waited patiently to see what he'd found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin examined the item with carefully and couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. This was a ring, and not just any ring. Like the rest of the future children that had traveled to the past, this was the wedding he'd given to Tharja when he proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he had grown accustomed to sights like this now given the others, it was another thing to have it happen to you. The gold on the ring had been tarnished somewhat, and the diamond inside was cracked. But the engraving inside was still the same... Forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja finally having enough of waiting walked over to her husband and saw the item that had consumed his attention. Taking a good look herself, her eyes widened a fraction in recognition. She'd know that ring anywhere, especially since she was currently wearing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HAVE COME A LONG WAY TO PREVENT YOUR CERTAIN DEMISE! IF THE FELL DRAGON EVEN THINKS OF TRYING TO DRAW BLOOD FROM THE, I WILL DEVOUR HIS SOUL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, that bold declaration made Robin feel a little more at ease. Even Tharja had the faintest makings of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Noire. We won't fail this time around. I'll make sure of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja couldn't help but be drawn into her husband's promise. \"And I'll watch your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in a long time, Noire felt herself smile. Maybe things really would be different this time around?</span></div></div>",

Kana got up and walked over to the window where the giant purple eye was staring at him and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie Camillaaa! I told you not to do that!\" Kana whined. He puts a hand on his butt briefly. \"Now my butt hurts...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...sorry about that sweetie! I just wanted to watch my little nephew wake up~\" Camilla cooed. \"Come here, let me make it all better~\". After saying this, Camilla removed the roof of the doll house he was in, picked Kana up, and gave him a kiss right on his \"boo-boo\" to make it all better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better?\" She asked with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Kana said, face red with embarrassment. Soon after, Camilla gently placed Kana back into the doll house and placed the roof back on. She bent down to see Kana through the window, giving Kana a look at her incredible breasts. He looked away quickly, since his mama told him that it's impolite to stare at a girls chest, but her chest was magnificent. He had no idea how she got that big, since his mama's chest was only around half the size of Camilla, (but utter mountains to him regardless) but he dispelled the thought right before Camilla said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on Kana, get dressed! I have quite the day planned for the two of us! It's not often I get to spend time with my wittle Kana~\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of his daze, he said \"Okay Auntie Camilla, give me a minute!\" before dashing off to the other room. After changing out of his pajama's into an outfit reminiscent of his mama's, Kana rushed downstairs and opened his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Auntie Camilla!\" Kana said, excited for the day ahead. The towering Camilla giggled in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant! Aww...you're so cute!\" Camilla said, using her finger to ruffle Kana's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla put a finger to her chin while she pondered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what to do first....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Corrin had Kana lived in the same room with her for protection reasons, since having a one-inch son in a different room could create all kinds of problems. Compared to Kana's dollhouse, his mama's bed was the size of a castle to him! Nevertheless, Camilla, carefully holding Kana, laid down on Corrin's bed and began to take off parts of her armor. The main part she took off however, was her stomach / chest piece. As soon as she took it off, a bloated belly came rushing out with a slight <b><i>*BOING*</i></b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Camilla moaned, her contained belly finally being set free. Kana looked at Camilla's belly with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Auntie Camilla, your belly is so big! Awesome!\" He said happily.

He got down and started massaging her belly, enticing a moan of pleasure from Camilla, and started kissing it for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Camilla moaned, watching Kana play with her belly. Her stomach was extremely soft, her skin feeling like the softest, squishiest thing he could imagine, and then some.

In front of them stood a rather tall, woman with crimson red hair and a white outfit reminiscent of a custom Pegasus Knight outfit. She was Kana's other aunt, from a different family and kingdom. Corrin had a weird family. Unlike Camilla who was soft, sweet and motherlike, Hinoka was brash, blunt, and rather serious. She was loving to her family of course, but she was definitely the tougher personality of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard this massive burp-like sound coming from this direction, and I wanted to see where it came fro-\" She stopped dead in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Hinoka said, staring at Camilla's bloated gut. \"What happened to you Camilla?

A minute later, she came back out with a large plate of about 20 pastries that looked absolutely delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go! Enjoy!\" Elise said. Hinoka took the pastries from her in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Thank you!\" Hinoka exclaimed, placing a large amount of gold on the counter.

In fact, she was in such bliss, she was drifting off to sleep while Kana pleasured her gut. However, Hinoka kicking Corrin's door open startled both of them immensely.

She brought him close to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready my wittle Kana~.\" She said affectionately. She placed him back onto her soft bloated belly and motioned to Hinoka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit.\" She commanded. Hinoka's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha?!\" She exclaimed in shock. Camilla smiled and rubbed her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kana wants to play with both of us right? Well why not give him what he wants~?\" Camilla said seductively. Hinoka began to blush heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" Hinoka said. She positioned her massive rear end over Camilla's bloated belly and sat her rear down onto it. Camilla's belly and Hinoka's butt squished against each other, and Kana was fortunate enough to be in the middle. The softness of Camilla's belly with the jiggliness and size of Hinoka's butt caused Kana to blush heavily. He was in heaven, and it seemed they were too. Every few seconds either Hinoka or Camilla moaned in pleasure. Camilla grabbed Hinoka's enlarged ass and began to rub it like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kyaaa! C-Camilla!\" Hinoka said, blushing heavier than ever. \"W-What are you...!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sit back and enjoy it dear~.\" Camilla said, giggling. Hinoka began to grind her rear across Camilla's belly, as sort of a...rebuttal? Camilla moaned as well as her gut squished and moved with Hinoka's ass. Kana was being flung around wildly between the two girls, loving every second of this. Camilla squeezed Hinoka's butt as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAAAAH!\" Hinoka exclaimed. She was...starting to like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Waah!\" Kana said, jumping out of his bed. He put a hand to his chest and started breathing heavily, not expecting a jumpscare at the beginning of his day. He walked over to the window of his dollhouse where the giant orange eye was staring at him and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Auntie Hinoka!\" Kana said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kana! Good to see you!\" Hinoka responded, cheerful.\" Hinoka was a rather tall girl (especially to him) with red hair, and an athletic build. Her outfit wasn't nearly as revealing as Auntie Camilla's, with the only skin being shown was her shoulders and pits, along with her rather large thighs thanks to her outfit being ungodly short on the bottom. Due to his stature, Kana often saw Hinoka's white panties due to the nature of her outfit. Something that definitely wasn't planned. \"Corrin wanted me to spend the day with you. She was telling me something about you not being able to talk to many people because of your...well...\" Hinoka motioned her hands to show his height. Kana didn't seem to mind. \"So she wants me to spend the day with you.\" She repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay! I'd love to spend some time with you Auntie Hinoka!\" Kana happily said. Hinoka gave a soft but sweet smile before showing some playful aggression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so hurry up and get dressed so we can do this!\" Hinoka said, clenching one of her hands into a fist in front of Kana as a sign of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana rushed out of his dollhouse bedroom and put on an outfit reminiscent of his mama's before bursting through the front door onto the desk where Hinoka was waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Kana said, hands clenched in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now, let me grab some water and food just in case...\" Hinoka turned around and headed towards the opposite end of the room. Corrin left a hidden stache of sweets baked up in the Mess Hall in the corner on the floor. He'd seen her eat maybe one too many of them, it may actually have developed into an addiction. As Hinoka walked to the other end of the room, Kana's eyes feel upon her rear end. Hinoka may not have been blessed up-top with the same breasts that Camilla or...hell even Sakura had, what she carried downstairs more than made up for it. Hinoka had the biggest butt Kana had ever seen, and that was against some stiff competition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Corrin...you can't keep sneaking these from the Mess Hall...\" Hinoka said. She bent over to pick up several sweets and put them in a small pouch for later. When she bent over, Kana got a full view of her glorious rear, and her gentle white panties struggling to keep it all contained. Kana quickly looked away, since his mama told him that it's impolite to stare at a girls butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll thank me later. Or try to get them back. Why do I feel like it'd be the latter...\" Hinoka said, talking to herself. She shruged and picked up a small pouch of water as well, before walking back to Kana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Kana, you ready?\" She said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Auntie Hinoka! Let's go!\" Kana exclaimed, with just as much excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do Kana and Hinoka do together?</span></div></div>",

Kana climbed onto the girl's massive hand, and held on while she brought him closer to her face. She sweetly smiled and used a finger to softly ruffle his hair. \"I've got something cool planned. Let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinoka tied the food and water pouch to her waist and ran out the door. Kana had to hold on desperately to Hinoka's finger to not get blown off from how fast she was moving, but he soon saw what Hinoka had planned. Her pegasus was waiting not too far from Corrin's house, and making sure Kana was safe, jumped onto her pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might like an air ride. You know, soaring through the air and taking in the sights.\" She said, buckling the food and water pouches to the pegasus instead of keeping them on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I've never been on a pegasus before! What's it like?\" Kana innocently said. Hinoka chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Well, you're about to find out!\" She excitedly said. To keep Kana safe, Hinoka placed him inside of her shirt, but let the collar pin him to her body near her neck so he can see outwards. Kana wouldn't move from there, and that way she could maneuver her mount while still keeping him safe. \"You ready Kana?\" She said, unable to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Auntie Hinoka! Let's do this!\" He responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go! Yah!\" Hinoka said, commanding the pegasus to fly. After a rather intense vertical rise for Kana, him needing to clutch onto her scarf, Hinoka soon stabilized their air height and they were both cruising several hundred feet in the air. Hinoka'd been up much higher before, but for his first time, she thought she shouldn't go THAT far up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooooooow!\" This is so coooooool!\" Kana said, his jaw dropped from how beautiful the world looked from a few hundred feet up. He attempted to wriggle free from Hinoka's collar and jumped out to land on the pegasus before landing on Hinoka's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no Kana! You can't come out of there! You might fall down! If a blast of wind blows through you'll get swept right off!\" She said protectively, a bit of her softer side showing through. \"I don't want you to fall...\" She said. Bringing him closer to her face. She ruffled his hair again before putting him back in her collar. He didn't really mind, but he was kinda disappointed that he couldn't sightsee on his own up in the air, although she seemed to have a point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Hinoka said, grabbing Kana's attention. She didn't want the day to be ruined by a simple refusal from her. \"If you're done sightseeing, we can go back down and do something else. And you know what? We can even do whatever you want!\" Hinoka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Kana asked excitedly, his mind already rushing with things to do with Auntie Hinoka. \"Alright! Let's go!\" He said. Hinoka chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're eager aren't you?\" She said with a smirk on her face. \"Alright, we're going down! Yah!\" She commanded, as the pegasus began travelling downwards at a brisk rate. The angle of the descent was less than ideal, and Kana latched onto Hinoka's scarf, hoping to not be thrown about or lose his grip. The speed that Hinoka was descending could also prove a bit of a problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She looked over the side of her mount and saw a quite familiar wyvern flying away at top speed. The flier herself did not look back at Hinoka, but she didn't need to, Hinoka already clearly knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camilla...\" Hinoka said with slight frustration. She was happy, and immensely relieved that she saved Kana, but now he's being taken from her!  The wyvern was getting smaller and smaller as it got further from her, and only the whinny from her Pegasus brought her back to reality. \"Come back here!\" She yelled, before giving chase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had let quite the distance build up unintentionally between them, and Camilla's wyvern was already landed and she was nowhere to be seen. Hinoka landed her Pegasus not too far away from where her wyvern was and ran through the halls of Corrin's castle. She accidentally took a wrong turn in her hurry and blind panic, but eventually she found herself at Camilla's living quarters. She kicked the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camilla!\" Hinoka yelled. Camilla acted shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My! Hinoka! What's got you all riled up?\" She asked. Hinoka's tone may not have been the best, but she was still in complete panic and adrenaline from Kana's fall. It didn't seem like she was going to calm down for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kana! Where is he? He was falling...and I...you...\" Hinoka said, practically hyperventilating. Not only was she out of breath from her sprint to her room, her heart as previously said was in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope he's okay...I didn't want anything to happen to him...\" Hinoka said. Camilla knew what was wrong with her. After Corrin's kidnapping from Hoshido all of those years ago, Hinoka's guilt and anger for being powerless to help never truly went away, and if anything happened to Kana, not only would Corrin want her head on a silver platter, (she knew how Corrin was with Kana.), Hinoka would never forgive herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Camilla began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She knelled down to get a better look at Kana. \"You okay Kana?\" She asked worriedly. In reality, he was completely fine, but he was a little scared about being this small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine Mama. What happened to me?\" He asked. Corrin rubbed the back of her head with a worried smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. The stone was SUPPOSED to turn you into a dragon like mine does.

Kana looked around on the ground and noticed the shrunken stone a few feet from him. It seems the stone shrunk along with him. He looked at it, and noticed that there was a very pronounced crack in the center. This only worried him further, but he looked up to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have it. There's a big crack in the stone. Is that supposed to be there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A crack? No? Was the stone faulty?\" She asked herself. \"Never mind about that now, let me get you out of here.

The bandit who had apparently been wounded at some point during the battle attempted to dodge the axe attack but he wasn't fast enough.  The bandit fell down  dead at Edelgard's feet.  The blood of the bandit made a graceful arc through the air as the axe buried itself in the midsection of the bandit.  Edelgard was able to back off so that the blood of the bandit wouldn't end up on her.  <br>\r\n           \"Another bandit falls to my blade\" said Edelgard in a quiet voice.  The Heir Apparent of the Adrestrian Empire spent a few moments looking down at the dead bandit until she noticed something poking out of a bag that the bandit was carrying.   Edelgard reached to grab the bag and picked it up.   The something turned out to be some sort of map.  It was a map of the local area.   One area of the map was circled with the words \"forbidden magic?\" written just below it .  <br>\r\n            \"What do you have there, Edie?\" <br>\r\n            Edelgard looked up to see Dorothea walking towards her followed closely by Hubert.  A dozen or so steps behind Hubert was Catherine who had joined the Black Eagles in getting rid of these bandits simply on a whim.    Catherine didn't often join in bandit hunting and instead stayed at the monastery to guard the archbishop.   The voice that had spoken belonged to Dorothea who had a nickname for everyone.  <br>\r\n            \"I don't know\" replied Edelgard.  \" Some kind of map this bandit was carrying \" <br>\r\n              \"No doubt showing the location of the local bandit den\" said Hubert glancing at the map in Edelgard's hand.  <br>\r\n              Dorothea looked at the map.  \"Forbidden magic?   What's that supposed to mean?\" <br>\r\n           \" I don't recall any magics that are forbidden \" said Hubert thoughtfully rubbing his chin.   Indeed, magics of all sorts were taught at the mines be it light magic or black.  <br>\r\n          \"Where's Professor Byleth?\" asked Catherine who had finally caught up.  <br>\r\n         \" I'm not sure\" said Dorothea.  \"He and I were separated like ten minutes ago\" <br>\r\n            Catherine noticed the map that Edelgard was holding and immediately snatched it and looked at it.<br>\r\n             \" You could've at least asked me to hand that over\" said Edelgard.  <br>\r\n                \"Hmm\" said Catherine.  \"Forbidden magic?  Does it mean that there's forbidden magic  at the location...?\"<br>\r\n            \" We can't be sure until we investigate the location the map indicates \" said Hubert.    <br>\r\n            Catherine glanced at the sky.  It was late evening. <br>\r\n           \"It can wait until tomorrow\" said Catherine .  \"If we hurry we'll be back at the monastery before nightfall\" <br>\r\n           \" But what about Professor Byleth? \" asked Dorothea.  \"We just can't leave him out here\" <br>\r\n           As if on cue, Professor Byleth appeared from behind a tree.  <br>\r\n           \"There you are\" said Catherine giving the newest professor at the monastery a grin.  \"You ought to have been closer to your students than you were during the battle\" <br>\r\n              \"Couldn't be helped\" replied Byleth.  \"I was chasing down the chief of these bandits\" <br>\r\n              In short order the other members of the Black Eagles were found and so the group returned to the monastery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

As the woman's soldiers charged to meet this man, his sword lit up, and with it he swung it as a whip to unleash a maelstrom of fell power.

And then, the two clashed in a frenzy of attacks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While the man appeared to have the upper hand, he got too confident and soon found his whip-like blade caught upon that of the woman's, and she readily yanked the blade from him before darting his way, landing fierce unarmed blows to knock him down. He struggled to get up, only to be pinned down by the woman with her dagger drawn.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tell me, Nemesis,\" the woman snarled. \"Do you recall the red canyon?\" His eyes widened as realization dawned upon him, but it was not for long before the woman raised her dagger and brought it down upon him. \"You'll die for that!\" The woman was relentless, screaming as she filling the still man with holes. \"You took\u2026everything that I loved!\" Eventually, he was no more, and as the rain stopped the sun finally shone through, basking the woman in the light of victory at last. Her men cheered for the larger man's demise but she had drowned it out. She reached for the sword wielded by the man she called \"Nemesis\", caressing its blood-stained blade against her face. \"He's gone now, Mother\u2026\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The vision began to blur into darkness, and strange imagery of times and places far removed flashed by, only to be replaced with the dark once more. Then, there was a grand stairway leading up to a throne, and on that throne sat a sleeping young girl. She stirred in her sleep, slowly opening her eyes as she returned to the waking world, and that was when she laid eyes upon you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my,\" she said. \"What could've brought you here?\" You did not know that yourself, but it all felt familiar. \"It is most rude to interrupt a moment of repose. Very rude indeed.\" You had not intended that, not even knowing where you were or why you were here, but you kept silent. \"Now come to me. I wish to have a look at you.\" Doing as you were told, you stepped forward and revealed to this girl that you were\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",
