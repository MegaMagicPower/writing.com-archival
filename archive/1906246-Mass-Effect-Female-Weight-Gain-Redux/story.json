While the crew that consisted of many different species did their part to make sure everything ran smoothly, one particular member was dealing with a personal issue of her own. That person was Commander Shepard, the leader of the ship and a decorated soldier of many years, a regular Alliance hero. She herself had been instrumental in taking down the Reaper vanguard Sovereign years earlier and now she had made it her life's mission to make sure the universe survived the coming war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently however she was facing a different battle: the battle of the bulge. As the commander ran her right hand through her fiery red hair, her green eyes peered down at the button of her pants as the smallest amount of tummy flab was preventing it from being closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'm just going to suck it in and button it. I haven't gotten that big! Not yet at least!\" Shepard rationalized to herself as she felt the soft chub that had replaced her hard abs. It was embarrassing to admit she had packed on a few extra pounds (too many nights of stress eating as she attempted to piece together plans and ideas to stop the Reapers) and it was even more embarrassing that it had been enough to make her pants not fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had struggled to get them to cover her slightly larger rear end when she pulled them up, her panties pinching her cheeks just the tiniest bit, and now she was facing her second worst nemesis in the form of her pants button. Once again sucking in with all her might, Shepard attempted to close the gap and get the button through the hole.</span></div></div>",

She groaned, put on her bath robe, and stealthily ran over to the med bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shepard waked into the med bay, Dr. Chakwas turned her chair around and asked, \"What seems to be the problem commander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard opened her robe, showing the extra 10 pounds  that she had packed on. \"I need help with...\" Shepard paused for a moment, \"this.\" She said motioning to her recently plumped figure. Chakwas got her on the scale, which revealed that she was 156 pounds. \"That's impossible!\" She exclaimed, \"The scale has to be broken, or, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander, calm down, it's just a little bit of fat.\" Chakwas said, \"With a good diet and a strict workout regimen, you'll be back in shape in no time at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're wrong!\" Shepard proclaimed, \"I'm the same weight that I was before, these pants just shrunk or something!\" She stormed out of the room and went to her quarters and cried about what the Doctor had said. Kelly Chambers noticed this and promptly took the elevator up to Shepard's quarters with snacks and a larger pair of pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Kelly said as she entered Shepard's room, \"I brought your favorite candy.\" She sat next to Shepard on her bed and put the bag of candy bars in front of her as well as put the pants on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Shepard said as she put on the pants, still tight in all the right places, but at least they fit. \" You always know how to cheer me up.\" she said before taking one of the candy bars and eating it in three quick bites. The she took another bar, then another, then another, and kept eating. \"Can you believe Chakwas said that I'm fat? She has got some nerve!\" Shepard said as she wolfed down another candy bar, Building on the pugde the doctor had critiqued. Her bust expanded and pushed her shirt to its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was turned on by the commander's curves and bulges. She had to fight the urge not to rub Shepard's full, jiggly belly. \"Jane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you taste some cakes that I baked for my sister's birthday?\" Kelly asked, seeking to make the commander even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had always toyed with the idea of becoming large herself, and knowing that the cakes would make Shepard gain just gave her an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll weigh myself an hour after we finish and see what the damage is, deal?\" Shepard extended her hand towards Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal, but make sure that you eat all of it.\" Kelly grasped Shepard's hand and shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, but remember, not an ounce.\" Shepard said as they went down to the mess hall together, she was dressed in a stretchy zip-up track jacket and the pants that Kelly had brought. When they reached the crew deck, she saw the bountiful feast of baked goods laid out before her. It enticed Shepard to sit at the table and dig in. It took about an hour and a half for Shepard to finish the cakes and about halfway through, her track jacket unzipped from the bottom via her bursting belly. At that moment, Kelly was even more excited to hear the number of pounds she'd be piling on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food was all gone Kelly cleaned up the mess hall and went back to her job as the ship's psychologist. Shepard called Kelly up to the captain's quarters an hour later, right on schedule. When Kelly entered the room, scale in arm, Shepard was slightly less bloated than when her feast was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard told Kelly to place the scale next to her armor locker, and to calibrate it. Kelly asked Shepard, \"How much did you weigh before we started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard knew she had gotten considerably bigger, no question about it, and wanted Kelly to be punished for what she had done to her. Shepard gave a lie for an answer, \"134 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, step on please.\" Kelly said as she bode Shepard toward the scale. The 30 seconds it took to calculate her weight were tense as both Shepard and Kelly were sweating in anticipation. Finally, the scale read, 181 lbs. +47 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard gasped, \"I gained 47 pounds!\" She looked at Kelly with an angry glare, \"That's 141 pounds for you Kelly, better start stuffing!\" Shepard said. She then gave Kelly's belly a small pat and stormed out ,cleavage bouncing with every step. \"And get me some plus-size clothes on the double!\" She called back. Coming out of the elevator, she ran into Miranda, who had been out on assignment the past week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard?\" She asked, not believing the sight of her commander, \"What happened to you?\" She was in awe seeing Shepard's bust had tripled, her belly was the size of a basketball, and her butt was like a pair of melons, round and perky. She knew this was bad, both for their mission and their public image, yet she couldn't help but feel slightly happy about it. Maybe even inspired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard responded...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought to herself, <i>how could she have gotten so big in just a week? Perhaps EDI saw what happened, after all she saw what that engineer and I did together last month.</i> She hated how perfect she was and the high expectations from those around her often made her stressed. Perhaps a bit of extra weight would lower them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard opened up her private terminal and saw that she had a message from her friend, Councilor Anderson. It read, <i>Shepard, I need you to meet me on the Citadel in Ambassador Udina's office on the Presidium. It's concerning a job the council needs you to take care of. - Councilor David Anderson</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly!\" Shepard yelled, \"Bring me my armor and tell Garrus and Kasumi to suit up!\" She took in another deep breath, \"Joker, set a course for The Citadel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, Aye Commander.\" He replied, afterwords cursing her under his breath for yelling orders at him in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly came running out of the mess hall, into the elevator, and to her station in the CIC. It took her a while to catch her breath, since she didn't want Shepard to get any more angry at her than she already was. She immediately called for Garrus and Kasumi to get their weapons and armor, just to the commander's satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shepard saw Kelly dashing out of the elevator, Chamber's new small potbelly and her slightly plumped-up cleavage bounced up and down. If this wasn't enough to make Shepard happy, then her new thunder-thighs did, jiggling as she sprinted the distance from the elevator to her computer. It was a small gain, but enough to make Shepard curious as to how she gained so much, so quickly. She said to Kelly, \"Meet me in me quarters in five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe obeyed the order and met her XO five minutes later, making sure that her clothes showed off her new-found pudginess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kelly entered the room, Shepard was waiting for her next to the scale. \"What was your weight before you started gaining?\" She asked Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"143 pounds.\" She said, not lying like her commander did. Shepard punched the number in and told Kelly to strip down, revealing her bare belly with a small layer of fat on it. She stepped on to the scale and it took the same 30 seconds it took for Shepard. It read 148 lbs. +5 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five pounds is good for your first day.\" she said, sensually feeling her two-time sexual partner's hips and butt while Kelly felt hers. \"How about some fun times as a reward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly peeled off Shepard's track jacket and too-small tank top then went down below to remove the pants she gave her. When she zipped her fly down the button busted  off and struck her in her belly, making it jiggle a little bit. She giggled and pulled the pants to her ankles with her teeth. \"So what do you think of my new curves?\" She asked Shepard in a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard answered...</span></div></div>",

Most of what I have here is word-for-word from the original, but some of the non-essential dialogue was left out. Thank you for your patience and consideration.<br>\r\n-Qedrian</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Shepard approved of her gain, Kelly brought her to the bed and they did as much as they could in the realm of sexual intimacy, what with them being the same gender. A few minutes after they had finished, Joker said over the intercom that they were coming up on the Citadel and awaiting docking permission. Shepard got up and put on the black body suit that was the base layer for her armor. Then it hit her that her armor plating would not fit her new, sexy body. Panic spread throughout her big body. Seeing this, Kelly retrieved the XL armor she had ordered for Shepard when she requisitioned the plus-size clothes. Shepard gave Kelly a big bear hug with many iterations of thank you said. The new armor fit her like a glove, conforming perfectly to her belly, boobs, and butt. She kissed Kelly goodbye and went down to join Garrus and Kasumi, who had concerns of their own about Shepard's gain, but chose not to voice them at this time. They stepped off of the Normandy and into the vast commercial and government hub, the Citadel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they stepped off of the ship, a C-Sec lieutenant was waiting with a car to take them to Anderson which Shepard graciously accepted, for she had no interest in walking long distances. Within ten minutes or so, they arrived at Anderson's office in the Presidium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnderson waited in his office for the car to arrive and when it did, he saw Shepard needing Garrus' help to get out. He knew that Shepard was under a lot of stress over the impending Reaper invasion, so the extra pounds were most likely a side affect of said stress. \"Shepard.\" He says, \"Come have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Council has a job for me?\" Shepard asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we do. There's been a break in a C-Sec investigation of a human and Asari trafficking ring based out of an abandoned red sand mining station in the Artemis Tau cluster.\" The councilor said, \"If you could shut them down and find out who's profiting from this and why, we'd be very grateful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of it,\" Shepard said, \"quietly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Shepard. I knew I could count on you.\" Anderson said graciously, \"And remember, the press is just as dangerous as the Collectors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\" Shepard said as she and her crew walked out the front door and toward the C-Sec headquarters where they'd be able to take an elevator back to the Normandy. That's what would've happened if Shepard hadn't seen an advertisement for judges on a cooking reality show that's broadcasted live on the extranet. She told Garrus and Kasumi to go ahead and that she had some \"business\" to take care of. She immediately called Kelly and told her about the position. Kelly became very excited and said she'd be down in ten minutes with something for Shepard to wear. Shepard then called the number on the flyer, which was that of the executive producer. He said that they'd be delighted to have Shepard and her personal assistant as celebrity judges and that filming started in two and a half hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the Normandy, Kelly dressed in a short, tight dress with sheer leggings and two-inch heels and grabbed a hip-hugging dress for Shepard with stylish flats and put them in her purse. On her way out, she ran into Miranda, inquisitive as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you headed in that dress?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had become a very good liar over the years of learning psychology and Miranda wasn't exactly a tough customer. Telling her the truth would most likely have a negative outcome for her. Kelly had a choice to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly replied...  </span></div></div>",

She read the label to herself, <i>Dietary supplement, one a day provides the healthy amount of fat needed for a Krogan diet.</i> This was the tool she'd use to lower people's expectations of her. Just one pill contained 100g of saturated fat and was 750 calories. She took two and swallowed them with a drink of water. For about a minute, nothing happened. Then she heard a stretching sound akin to rubber. She was expanding, slowly but surely.<i> Let's provide some room to grow,</i> she thought while removing her belt. She looked at herself in her full-length mirror and saw her new body. Her butt and thighs had doubled in size, making the seams of her suit threaten to snap at any moment. Her belly had expanded three inches from the base of her figure and her boobs had caused the top of her suit to bust open and were still quite firm as they rested on her gut. The illegal Krogan pills had definitely done their job and she had planned for this success. She had a bigger version of her black Cerberus suit ready for use that fit her new curves perfectly. She also felt lazier so she put her feet up on her desk and started watching vids. When she'd had enough, she planned how she would reveal this to everyone. She had two ideas:</span></div></div>",

He breathed in a puff of smoke from his cigarette and breathed out heavily. \"Send them in.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chamber door opened up and in walked two Cerberus operatives, both women. One wasn't tall nor short and had some pudge about her. She had blonde hair that was braided down her back, revealing her full cheeks. This one was not a field agent. The other operative was an Asian woman, six foot and slender with breasts to beat the band. her black hair was curled and fell naturally, stopping a little below her shoulders. She definitely had some field experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slender one said, \"You called for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" He said, taking a short pause and standing up from his chair. \"You will have separate tasks, but they will both lead toward the same goal, removing Shepard from the Reaper war non-lethally.\" He exchanged another puff of smoke. \"Operative Massa,\" He said looking at the chubbier one. \"You will get yourself captured by a group of slavers that are running an odd people trafficking ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it odd?\" Operative Massa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They abduct women, both Human and Asari, and force feed them while they are restricted with bindings.

Things had gone even better then expected for Liara and her plan to pamper her beloved Eileen; the former Spectre had stuffed herself to an insane degree for the past month and had blossomed tremendously, turning her creamy belly into a proper gut the size of a tire that wobbled to and fro with every ponderous step Shepard took. In fact, most of her wobbled now, from her thickened thighs that brushed against one another to her breasts that outgrew bra sizes at an alarming rate, to say nothing of the tremendous ass hanging behind her that would have made Miranda Lawson jealous and overflowed every chair she lowered herself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blueberries?\" Shepard asked, the piggy grin on her face making her double chin all the more prominent. \"Mmm...my favorite!\" Waddling over and lowering herself into the chair, Shepard's eyes glowed with barely restrained greed and hunger as Liara tied a napkin around Shepard's thick neck and planted a kiss on her porky cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up, darling,\" Liara cooed, pressing a fork and knife into her lover's hand. \"There's more on the way, just for you!\" This was all the motivation Shepard needed as she stabbed into the stack of pancakes and cut off a large chunk and stuffed it into her greedy mouth. The Asari felt her cheeks grow hot as pancake syrup dribbled down Shepard's chins as she stuffed more and more into her mouth, barely pausing to take a breath. Her overtaxed shirt pushed upwards as her belly filled with delicious blueberry pancakes and bacon, and fast then expected the plate was bare, only a few scraps of bacon and syrup behind. As Shepard licked her sticky fingers clean, Liara leaned over and wiped the syrup from around her lover's mouth with the napkin around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, you're a messy little thing aren't you?\" Liara said seductively, beginning to rub her lover's stuffed belly. Shepard let out a dainty little burp followed by a delighted giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, your food is so good,\" Shepard giggled. \"It's turned me into such a piggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you like it, Shepard,\" Liara said, leaning in and planting a kiss on her lover's sticky lips, which Shepard responded to with as much enthusiasm as she attacked the pancakes with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I...have some more?\" Shepard asked, sounding as sweet as the pancake syrup coating her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my love.\" Shepard jiggled with excitement as Liara turned to head back to the kitchen and reload Shepard's plate of pancakes, her head already swimming with fantasies about what the two of them would get up to afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Liara!\" Shepard interrupted her thoughts. \"I almost forgot, I've been meaning to ask, but...\"</span></div></div>",

Though it was nothing compared to her lover\u2019s enormity, Liara T\u2019Soni was now chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the goddess, I think you may be right\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick estimation rounded off at 30 lbs heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know if you don\u2019t watch yourself, you might end up fat,\u201d Shepard jested as if she were unaware of her own size. Eileen knew she wasn\u2019t as thin as she used to be, but Liara\u2019s constant pampering combined with the mind-altering serum kept her from caring. Gone was the daring commander Liara once looked up to, now reprogrammed to be her fat and happy lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara chuckled at the irony of her predicament and retreated back into the kitchen. The clattering of dishes told Shepard to get ready for seconds. And thirds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a bear in hibernation, the light from the bathroom door did nothing to disturb Shepard\u2019s deep slumber. Liara watched her partner\u2019s breathing from the doorway and smiled. It was slow, peaceful... the rise... and the fall... There was something calming about it, even mesmerizing. She closed the door behind her, careful not to make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing her business, washing her hands, and brushing her teeth, Liara took a closer look at the layer of pudge that\u2019d formed. Her face was certainly much softer, but not yet cherubic. The more she looked, the more of her there was at every angle, especially in her lower half. Out of curiosity she stepped up on the scale, confirming her previous estimation within a pound. It read \u2018153 lbs.\u2019 Eileen was still twice her weight, but it still alarmed her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Shepard grow was one thing, but she didn\u2019t know how to feel about herself getting larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cPerhaps I should remember to watch my own eating as well as hers\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a reluctant sigh, Liara turned to leave the bathroom and returned to bed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liara awoke the next morning in the same position she fell asleep in, wrapped around the enormity of Shepard's belly as it rose and fell with each breath. Quietly slipping out from around her, the Asari crept out of bed and wrapped a nightgown around herself before tiptoeing down to the kitchen. After a particularly saucy dream, Liara got the idea of surprising Shepard with breakfast in bed, and she had the perfect meal for just such an occasion; donuts! Okay so it was a bit of a cop out compared to the handmade breakfasts she stuffed her lover with, but for a nice meal to have in bed an obscene amount of donuts was a good choice nonetheless, and they were still baked with love...and that little extra special something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liara began preparing a heaping tray of the pastries, the scent of glaze caught up to her and she inhaled deeply. It smelled absolutely delectable, and her stomach voiced agreement with a hungry rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose...a sampling would not be a bad idea...\" Liara mused, picking up one of the pastries. \"The drugs won't affect my mind like they do to her, I made sure of that, didn't I?\" Under normal circumstances her trained Shadow Broker side would have been shouting at her \"Don't eat that you fool, a small risk is still a risk!\", but that was drowned out by the sound of her stomach, growling angrily through that layer of pudge on her abs, demanding to be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach won. Liara took a bite from the pastry, and it was like a beautiful song that broke out in her mouth. The delightfully fluffy texture, the pleasant tingling sweetness, the sensation of that delightful flavor filling her mouth and causing a moan to escape her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...so good!\" Liara said, a little short of breath. \"I...another couldn't hurt, could it?\" She picked up another donut and bit into it, this time overwhelmed by the stunningly sugary taste of chocolate filling. The Asari practically shuddered with delight and couldn't stop herself from picking up another one even as she swallowed the second. Strawberry next, the candied fruity taste making her break out in giggles as she continued to sample more and more, each one taking her on a roller coaster of sensational delight, up until the point where her hand brushed against crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...oh, by the goddess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole platter had vanished! Liara paused, wondering if she was really so enthralled that she ate the whole plate without noticing. No no that's not it, she just...didn't finish filling it. Yeah that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a creaking sound from upstairs. Hurriedly, Liara quickly dug into the stockpile of pastries and donuts she prepared ahead of time and refilled the tray. Urgency and a somewhat filled stomach overrode her donut-driven desires and she dashed upstairs, so eager to watch Shepard go to town that she forgot about the whole incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, she caught herself with a mouthful of pasta as she prepared a noodly feast for Shepard, one that would need a lot more noodles she suddenly realized. Not a huge deal, considering she had a very light lunch with what had to be just a <i>few</i> snacks, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while after that she got the massive breakfast taco she made for Shepard and the one she made for herself mixed up for a moment. How romantic, they must enjoy the same flavors in their taco. Or did the mix up happen because they were the same size? Either way, Liara didn't eat the whole thing like Shepard did so no problem, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while after THAT, Liara opened the fridge to find that all the ice cream was missing! Did Shepard finish it off? No wait...she did. Whoops. Well, she got hungry last night and wanted a sweet treat, what was wrong with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what? Liara was going to cook up two steaks for herself today. She was feeling peckish, and besides if Shepard got to indulge as much as she wanted then why not her? What's the worse that could happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't happening. It couldn't happen. She had to be seeing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara opened her eyes again, hoping against hope that what she saw in the mirror was wrong. Rubbing off a spot where the mirror misted over slightly from Shepard's shower, she looked at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smooth angular look of her face was gone now. In its place were plump cheeks and a healthy double chin that made it look far more round then before. Slowly, dreading what was to come, she took a step backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...it can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe layer of pudge from so long ago was an ocean now. A big double-rolled belly spilled into her lap and hung down lazily over her undergarments. Thick meaty shoulders threatened to swallow up her elbows and even her thick neck as she raised her arms to rub her immense gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...did I not notice...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara turned around in the mirror and let out a small gasp at the sight she was dreading the most. Thunderous thighs that no pants could fit over, hips that refused to pass through all but the most generous doorways unaided, and above all...that butt. The Asari was equal parts mesmerized and disturbed by it, as it quaked with gelatinous mass at the slightest touch. Liara didn't think she'd seen anything that big before outside of an Elcor or Krogan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping on the scale was almost a formality at this point. Pushing her gut in to read the numbers on top, she read with mounting dread, that she was a whopping three hundred nine pounds now. There was one undeniable, horrific fact that Liara took from this, a fact that was clearly shown from her blubbery chest all the way down to her fat little toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Goddess...\" she whispered. \"I'm....fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say something, honey?\" Shepard said as the shower-head sputtered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing!\" Liara said hurriedly, rushing to finish her morning routine. \"Just...thinking about breakfast.\" Normally she would have meant thinking about what to make, but now her mighty gut seemed to growl angrily, demanding sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I'm excited to see what you have planned today!\" Shepard said excitedly, stepping out of the shower and wrapping herself in a towel. Liara turned to look at Shepard and...</span></div></div>",

Liara almost thought twice about the absurdity of her logic, but it was as if something from within kept her from caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong Liara?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was pulled back from her thoughts. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing dear I assure you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure hun? You\u2019ve been spacing out a lot more than usual.\u201d Shepard dried herself off and reached for a shirt that was two sizes too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m just trying to plan out the day. A few errands to run, and some meals to cook.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara watched as Eileen struggled to fit into her clothes. Eileen had done away with underwear a few weeks back, opting instead for sweat pants and a tee, both of which barely contained her flab. By the time she was done, Eileen was out of breath. It was hard to believe this was the same woman who saved the galaxy from the Reapers only a few years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that reminds me, do you mind restocking on snacks when you go out? I kinda ate them all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara just sighed and laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll write that down. Now then, how about breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was never supposed to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the idle hours before the Reaper Invasion, Liara often dreamed of what would happen when the war ended. She thought of how the galaxy would rebuild, how the many empires might come together in the aftermath of such an enemy, but mostly she thought of Shepard. She spent nights dreaming of the life they would build afterwords, in a galaxy that didn't need their protection anymore. Her beloved had done so much, given up everything to save the galaxy...to save her...that she deserved every happiness, every luxury she could ever want. Even in the darkest hours, if it wasn't the many friends she made or the importance of her mission that kept her going, it was the dream of one day pampering and protecting her beloved Shepard, bestowing on her the love and affection that she more then earned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the war came to an end, and as the galaxy rebuilt, stronger then ever, Liara saw her deepest desires begin to unfold in front of her. It took a chemical suggestion or two to get the ball rolling, but soon Liara was living out her dreams in earnest, and Shepard was getting everything, anything she wanted, all thanks to Liara. The Asari's heart swelled with happiness as she watched her beloved also swell, descending further and further into her new hedonistic life, always waited on and looked after by the Asari she loved, without a care in the world. Liara saw her dreams come true at last; Shepard was her prize pig, fat and happy, safe and sound from the dangers of the world. It was everything she ever wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that Liara realized, perhaps too late, that eating habits she didn't want were starting to rub off on her. It could have been the drugs, it could have been from Liara being around so much food all the time, or maybe it was just that eating like a pig is contagious, but Liara found herself being dragged kicking and screaming into obesity by her constant pampering and feeding of Shepard. She tried to diet or exercise, but a day's worth of healthy activities were undone by just an hour in Shepard's presence, and Liara spent a lot of hours around her. And so the days went by, with Liara's diets failing one after the other as her fantasies about pampering her beloved Shepard pushed her further and further, up to the point where she reached a new milestone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara glared down at the bathroom scale, a hand mirror in her hand to see around her belly. Swallowing her pride, she took two ponderous, heavy steps, heaving herself onto the measurement device. Sighing, Liara adjusted her mirror to see around herself, but paused at a dreaded sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*creaaaaaaaaaak....grooooan*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's eyes widened as she felt the metal shift underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, please don't, I can't be too big for this, please!\" she pleaded, as though willing herself to be lighter would somehow work. It did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumbering off the ex-scale, she looked down and saw a giant crack right between the indents her bare feet had already worn into it, with various electronic bits spilling out the bottom of the device. Admitting defeat, she shoved the broken scale to the side and looked over towards the other one. The oversized one, meant for heavier species like Krogans, that they had installed for when Shepard got too big for the usual scale. The one that Liara dreaded ever needing to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike an immensely flabby prisoner walking to his execution, Liara slowly waddled up to the new scale, which groaned under her weight as well but held firm, displaying a cheery bright number on the wall in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive. Hundred. Sixty. Three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara didn't scream or complain anymore about how she managed to put on another ten pounds since last weigh-in despite all the dieting she supposedly did. She almost did this time, thanks to outgrowing the \"skinny\" scale, but Liara now faced every increase in her girth first with reassurances that she was doing this for Shepard's sake, then out of grim resignation. Maybe she'd try to diet again, eat healthy for a day then blow it with a massive midnight snack again, or a gorge session alongside Shepard. Just like she always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara tugged down on her sweat pants and t-shirt, the same pair Shepard wore at this size before she outgrew them, and pondered the blob of an Asari she saw in the mirror. It was almost comical to think of how shocked she was at her size over two hundred pounds ago; her face looked almost entirely round with no neck to speak of, with massive cheeks and an array of chins that dominated her features now. She felt around her chins tenderly with fingers twice as thick as before and padded palms attached to her pillowy forearms, long ago having swallowed her elbows and wouldn't let her rest her arms at her sides anymore. The double rolled belly had blossomed into a big blue apron that flowed from a shirt unable to contain it, propping up a pair of melons that could put actual prize winning melons to shame. Why Shepard's species judged foodstuffs for their size rather the merely eating them was beyond her, but that's another story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her hands to her sides as best she could, Liara felt along the expanse of her couch-crushing hips and thighs thick as actual tree trunks at this point. She never had to worry about not fitting through doors before, and now she almost certainly did, if not for her legs then for her absolutely unstoppable rump. It was practically a seat all its own, bouncing and wobbling with every small motion and stopping long after Liara stopped moving it. Even Shepard had trouble growing her own plump rear to this size, and she was still quite heavy compared to her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive. Hundred. Sixty. Three. It still felt so very unreal, and yet here it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her stomach to loose a light belch, Liara reflected on the lifestyle that got her hear, and realized...</span></div></div>",

She <b><i>could</i></b> come clean with Shepard; admit she\u2019d been drugging their food and what not. But what was the point? It wasn\u2019t as if Shepard minded being fat, or at least she\u2019d never voiced any qualms to the growing asari. It was almost as if Eileen just didn\u2019t care, stuffing herself nonstop for half of the day and lazing about the other half. Eileen was content with the way of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatering to her \u201cprized pig\u2019s\u201d every need was always Liara\u2019s top priority, one which had only grown more and more difficult to fulfill over the past few months. Bringing in extra help seemed like the only solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who to ask? There was certainly no shortage of former crewmates and friends willing to help out, but the thought of someone seeing them like this made Liara\u2019s stomach churn\u2014or maybe she was just hungry? The savior of the galaxy and her asari lover had been reduced to apathetic gluttons, pleased to pursue a life of pleasure. It was embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Liara had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiara!! Are those brownies done yet!?\u201d Shepard\u2019s voice sounded through the hallway. Didn\u2019t Liara just gave her a fresh batch? Oh well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne moment dear! I just need to make a few phone calls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was noon once more. The sun shone in through the window and warmed Eileen\u2019s numerous rolls of pale flab. This was the most sun she\u2019d felt in a long while, having not left home in little over a month. She had no reason to leave. She felt loved more and more with each passing day, with Liara always there for her, giving her whatever she wanted. It almost felt sinful to be this happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUURRRRRRPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard leaned back and rubbed her stomach, hearing the tormented couch beneath creak with the shift in mass. She looked over to see her smaller lover spilling over the edges of a smaller loveseat adjacent to her. The asari was polishing off the remnants of her own blueberry swirl cheesecake, moaning in pleasure with each bite. Eileen looked on with a smile, glad to see her lover enjoying herself. When finished, Liara let out a similar belch and looked back at Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what did you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs good as always, even better than the last one somehow.\u201d Shepard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you really think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know so!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara heaved her poorly dressed body out of her small sofa\u2019s depression and lumbered towards Shepard with a washcloth in hand. \u201cYou just keep getting messier every day, don\u2019t you my little piggy?\u201d Liara teased, oblivious to the blue mess surrounding her own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, who are you calling little?\u201d Shepard teased back. Despite how much fatter Liara was now, Eileen still had her beat by over two hundred pounds, give or take. Liara dragged the wet cloth through Eileen\u2019s chasmal cleavage and up to her face, making sure to clean every smudge of cheesecake left behind before planting a blue-stained kiss on her lover\u2019s doughy cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back dear. Any ideas for dinner yet?\u201d Liara said as she waddled towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen idly watched the television before her. Most screen time was filled with ridiculous advertisements for the latest and greatest waste of money; who in their right mind would ever buy a reinforced, deluxe nanofiber, quadruple wide, couch-bed hybrid with heated seats and a working massage system? Especially not for <i>THAT</i> price! She recalled these frivolous advertisements being the norm, even before the Reaper Invasion. Some things never change it seems. It took her a moment, but Liara\u2019s question finally registered with Shepard\u2019s preoccupied brain. \u201cHow about pizza?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPizza again? Liara could practically feel the irresistible mixture of cheese and sauce slide down her throat once more. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d The ass-heavy asari returned from the kitchen with two small mountains of cookies, ready to be devoured. \u201cOh, by the way,\u201d Liara said, waving the cookies in front of Eileen to get her attention. \u201cAn old friend should be stopping by today, might be staying with us for a while.\u201d She gave Shepard her plate of cookies before carefully sitting back down in her own couch. Any sudden movements and the poor thing might finally break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two behemoths started on their \u201clight snacks,\u201d sometimes even pausing to breathe. \u201cShoh, *munch* whoffs *smack* cohmin\u2019 ohfver?\u201d Eileen asked, her mouth stuffed with several cookies at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fate would have it, the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome iiiin~!\u201d Liara sang, courteous enough to swallow before speaking. Not a moment later, the door swung open. Stepping through it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Coming!' Liara yelled as she got up off the couch or tried too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quarter ton of butter blue Asari takes some effort to move. For one thing she was wedged between an arm rest and Shepard's sprawling body and for another the once terrifying shadow broker was pathetically out of shape. Liara's once rather graceful stems pressed down in the simple act of standing, both her dimpled knees popping loudly as her hips raised an inch off of the couch. To say that Liara's exercise hadn't kept up with her eating was an understatement, she got in less than a thousand steps every day and did nothing more strenuous than stirring batter. After a second her legs gave out and she colapsed back onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the door bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Should I get it?' Shepard asked plunging another cookie into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard surely knew she'd gotten fat but Liara had hidden exactly how big the galaxy's savior was. The freckled marshmellow of a woman, who using her vanguard powers had once been able to dash across a battlefield and shoulder check a Krogan through a brick wall, hadn't been able to rise without help for several months now, ever since she was around Liara's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, no I'll manage,' the blubbery Asari asserted, rocking forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms thicker than a linebackers but ludicrously bereft of muscle pressed down on the arm rest poking up past Liara's blue love handle and on Eileen's dimpled knees. Straining, every atrophied muscle fiber screaming, her biotic powers lifting herself up to the maximum and sweat breaking out across her forehead, Liara managed to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, the former archaeologist advanced on the door. As she lumbered across the living room, breathing heavily, she passed a mirror that showed every inch of her rotund, rolly poly body. Liara was both glad that she was wearing panties and a sports bra, both overloaded to the point of breaking, due to often going nude and somewhat horrified that this was as formal a clothing as she could get into. When she got to the door, she had to reach past the adipose loaded barrier fo her gut and she slightly misjudged the distance, the door slapping her in the lower fat fold as it opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, I see I arrived in the nick of time,' Miranda Lawson said with an arc of one perfect eyebrow as she looked down at the door filling tonnage of Liara and saw the elephantine spread of her former commander on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was as far a cry from the morbidly obese pair as could be imagined. Chiseled cheek bones and a sharp chin instead of a swollen round face and dangling jowls, an exposed collarbone and straight athletic shoulders instead of a puffy slouch and a fat hump, big proud and high tear drop breasts instead of swollen saggy dugs that resembled couch pillows, a tapered waist and a washboard belly instead of canyons of fat rolls and bean bag bellies, shapely and girlish hips instead of couch filling flanks, a spectacularly round and amazingly pert booty instead of the crinkly trash bags filled with jello hanging from Liara's overwhelmed backside and slender runners legs that were a fifth of the Asari's near useless stems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Miri!' Eileen cried from the couch through a mouthful of cookies as she tried to get up for a hug, 'what have you been up to?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Helping the Alliance hunt down what's left of Cerberus and a fe modeling jobs to fill time,' the operative said coldly, 'I can see what you two have been doing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the morbidly obese ex-N7 operative even longer to rise than Liara had and in that time the Asari went increasingly red in the face from embarassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Living like love birds!' Shepard laughed a moment later after finally getting up and waddling over, each step punctuated with a horrible slap of thigh fat, 'so good to see you again, what's the occasion!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The occasion is, that your...house mate,' Miranda said politely but coldly as she took in the waves of fat that had swallowed all the hard work she'd had rebuilding Shepard from death, 'has reported that you two have been having some issues lately.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Issues? What issues Liara?' Shepard wheezed, reaching out one pathetically swollen arm to lean on the wall as her knees began to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I've been having some trouble taking care of you lately,' Liara admitted weakly, 'it's been a bit much.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Which is an understatement,' Miranda said with one toss of her Raven locks, 'you two are...in inexcusable shape and I'm going to change that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please Miranda, I know I'm not battle ready but It's not that bad, only fifteen pounds at most,' Eileen said, trying to cross her arms over her bovine chest and getting caught up in her drooping cleavage, 'now, put those bags down and let's have some snacks until dinner.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not that bad? Only a few pounds?' Miranda asked icily, 'and it's only just after local noon yet your'e eating again? You need emergency help.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's all sit down and just um, talk this out,' Liara tried to compromise, the meeting going worse than she'd planned, 'I did ask for some help getting into shape but...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You left out the exact size of the situation,' Miranda said, 'this is inexcusable for both of you. If I didn't know who you were I'd think you were different people you've gotten so fat.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's a bit unfair, you don't come into someone's house uninvited and call them fat!,' Shepard said, lumbering forwards to poke Miranda in the chest for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the once athletic redhead was more than six times her own weight and had no sense of where she began and ended. The gap between Liara and the wall looked plenty wide enough, but Shepard wound up pressing the ample Asari into one wall while her own bunch up side fat knocked over a row of vintage paper books and got stuck. Her protruding gut did bump into Miranda's rock solid waist at least, even though Shepards pastry dough arms got stuck on the wall and Liara. Shepard tried to extricate herself, but her laughable physical strength combined with her immense bulk kept her wedged tight. Liara's reaction didn't help either and the two graceless hulks pushed and shoved weakly and awkwardly at each other as their breathing began to turn into heavy pants and sweat began pouring over their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just a few pounds Eileen?' Miranda asked, gloved hands taking hold of Shepard's lower stomach roll, which had begun to bifurcate in the center, 'Or is it normal to get stuck in the hallway?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay...we...might *huff* have a problem,' Shepard gasped, exhausted by the tiny amount of activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes of Miranda using her biotic powers to move the two back inside, a weigh in and a blood test later saw the former Cerberus operative tut-tutting them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'These results are unbelievable,' she sighed as she looked at her omni-tool's read out, 'I've never seen anything like this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's...not that bad...,' Shepard said through a new mouthful of cookies Liara had thoughtlessly provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shepard, you're the fattest human being in over eighty years. You weigh seven hundred and eighty four pounds,' Miranda snapped, 'more than three hundred pounds more than the next heaviest, whose a professional body builder. you've gained more than six hundred pounds since the war and have blood sugar and cholesterol levels that had been relegated to the history books. If it wasn't for your special forces grade nanites in your blood and mostly augmetic circulatory system you'd have full blown diabetes and high blood pressure as well.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard's mouth hung open in amazement at her obesity being laid bare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's not that bad,' Liara patted her lover's immense thigh only for the genetically engineered perfectionist to turn on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not that you're much better,' Miranda informed her icily, 'Dr. T'soni  here is the fattest Asari in the recorded history of her race.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...the fattest?' The azure tub of lard repeated, unsure whether to be happy, ashamed or shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'By three hundred pounds,' the model esque brunette sighed, 'but I think I got here in time. Girls it's going to take work, but I'm going to get you back to your old selves.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard, back to being hard and lean? Perish the thought, Liara realized, this was the opposite of what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really all I wanted was to get a bit stronger, it has been harder to to do the house work with all this bulk,' she insisted, 'I don't think getting thin again is realistic.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no, I'm not accepting any half measures for you two,' Miranda told her, 'it's time for 1200 calorie a day diets, 12 hours of exercise a day and constant weigh ins. I'm going to whip you two back into shape like my life depends on it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Liara and Shepard cringed, this wasn't what they'd expected...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Liara thought as she looked at the immense bulk of her lover, she'd read that humans who lost some weight could rapidly regain it. And as for Miranda...being around fat people supposedly made others fat...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda's plan was simple and she was sticking to, but she'd run into a bit of a snag. When it came to exercise, Liara and Shepard handled themselves well, surprisingly. Well, as well as two of the fattest, if not the fattest, people in the galaxy would be expected to. <br>\r\nDespite any huffing, puffing or flat out wheezing, the two lovebirds did their exercises. It would seem that in spite of the lazy, hedonistic lifestyle, there was still quite of bit of left of the two women who had all but saved the galaxy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't seem to extend to their want and desire for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda had watched them like a hawk, looking for any hidden stashes of treats that deviated off her strict 1200 limitation. Being the practical woman that she was, after finding Liara attempted to sneak a delectable set of chocolate cookies, began combing the house. The sheer amount of food in home was staggering and the former Cerberus operative felt it wouldn't been out of place for a small vessel with full crew! She'd had never thought to see in a home of two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we won't having that.' Miranda had thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been tempted to throw it away honestly. Just remove the temptation away from Shepard and Liara's environment. Simple and efficient in her opinion. But, Miranda felt...conflicted. For one, she didn't wish to essentially just throw away money, especially money that wasn't her's. So, she thought of donating it to a soup kitchen or homeless shelter. Yet, she found that she couldn't even bring herself to do that. As she had taken stock of all the food, she'd seen quite a few things herself had never had but wanted to try. Even little alien delicacies she'd never knew existed. Honestly, with her now tighter control of the situation and Shepard and Liara's steady efforts, she didn't need to resort to such methods. Besides, as long as she kept them on their 1200 calorie diets, Miranda was sure that she could use the treats as an extra form of  motivation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And maybe, ' She mused, 'have something for myself once in a while. What would be the harm?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Liara's part, she was becoming a little worried. Not for Shepard, as she could always regain any weight lost. Not too mention is was actually rather exciting getting the opportunity to fatten Eileen again. Not for herself, as she didn't mind losing weight. She'd be able to pamper Shepard and operate on her own again. That would never be a bad thing and the strict dieting she was on would help refine better habits to make sure she didn't land in such a situation again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she was worried about was Miranda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara had no idea how Miranda's body would react to the drugs in the food supply of the house and Liara felt rather guilty. She'd contacted Miranda to help get things into a better semblance of order, not fatten the poor woman up. Then again, given Miranda's extensive genetic engineering, the drugs may have little to no effect. Besides, if she said anything, that'd reveal just how far she'd gone to fatten Shepard and Liara didn't want to cross that bridge any time soon. </span></div></div>",

Liara doubled over with her hands on her chubby knees as her lover waddled over to take a seat on the bleachers, the metal groaning but holding firm under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a workout,\" Shepard gasped, cracking open a water bottle and guzzling down so quickly that water dripped down from the sides of her mouth. \"Last time I ran like that I was fighting Husks on Thessia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara chuckled, toweling off sweat from her forehead as she sat down next to her, sighing as she took a load off and started sipping her own water bottle. The asari had been dreading this sort of workout ever since Miranda showed up on her crusade to get them healthy again, but ironically the constant exercise wasn't that bad. In fact, it was even sort of fun. Maybe part of that was because Shepard was doing it with her and doing anything with Shepard was a wonderful experience, but she couldn't deny that a part of her looked forward to the daily workout routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd perhaps most unbelievably, it was working! The pair of them had lost quite a bit of weight since Miranda\u2019s intense crash diet began. Liara had shrunken down to a healthy three hundred or so pounds, and Shepard had reached Liara\u2019s old weight from before they started dieting. Liara was pleased that they hadn\u2019t lost all the weight, since she still loved Shepard at such a large size and frankly, she\u2019d grown attached to her own extra chins and bulging belly by now, but the benefits were undeniable. The two of them could move around a lot easier, they got stuck together less often, and\u2026well, not to be crass, but their evenings were a lot more energetic as well. Don\u2019t get her wrong, \u201cpersonal time\u201d when they were super-sized was fun, but with the excess pounds shed they could go at it a lot longer. It was really the best of both worlds; they were both getting healthier, but nowhere near skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snag was that \u201chealthy but nowhere near skinny\u201d applied not just to the obese couple, but their trainer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, remember to stay hydrated,\u201d Miranda lectured the pair of them as she waddled up, sucking down an extra-large soda. \u201cIt\u2019s important to stay healthy during a workout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara nodded and tried to play off her inability to look Miranda in the eye as exhaustion from the workout. Internally kicking herself for leaving so many of the drugged snack food out before Miranda got involved, the Asari had watched in horror as the snacks and treats she had scattered around the house hit their workout coach like a freight train. They were in workout mode for less then a week when a belly began to pooch out the front of Miranda\u2019s workout wardrobe; now that belly fell down her front in two big meaty rolls, not big enough to hide how her thighs and hips had doubled in size to accommodate a brand new bubble butt that put the old Miranda\u2019s impressive rear utterly to shame. Her eyes following the undulating of Miranda\u2019s fat rolls with mounting dread, Liara couldn\u2019t help but wonder who was bigger at this point, the dieter, or the one giving the diet? It was hard to say when Miranda seemed to be gaining the chins and rolls that Liara was gradually losing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say, I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Miranda suddenly announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-about wh-hat?\u201d Liara stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour dieting is going extremely well,\u201d Miranda clarified. \u201cYou\u2019ve both lost a lot of weight and that\u2019s commendable. You\u2019ll find that your lives are better once you\u2019re fit and healthy like the rest of us.\u201d She laughed at her own humor, her stomach rolls wobbling with mirth. That only made Liara feel worse, since that sort of joking was how Shepard reacted to her own weight gain thanks to the chemicals and Miranda should have been off them by now. Liara\u2019s only horrible conclusion was that somehow the perfectly engineered human\u2019s perfectly engineered genetics made her even more susceptible to the formula, and she wasn\u2019t looking forward to when reality finally kicked in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A vain human being would have recognized themselves putting on a few pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA normal one would have noticed several.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven a dull minded one would have noticed themselves ballooning up from a salivating 135 to a door frame busting 325 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd some how Miranda hadn't noticed a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that the once curvaceous brunette was stupid. The mental profiles of several brilliant scientists had been added into her genetic mix, along side the legs, hips and breasts of earths sexist models and she'd been sharp as she'd been sexy. But despite having the skills to be an expert genetic scientist and a master spy, Miranda was completely oblivious to every extra inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason why the vain ex-spy didn't notice her transformation into a slob was buried deep inside her genetic code: a humiliating contingency created by her father's scientists in case his perfect daughter went rogue. If she tried to escape, exposure to a special compound would begin rapidly altering her body type. Her basal metabolism would plunge, her appetite would sky rocket, her workout ethic would vanish, her halved aging rate would rapidly correct itself and she'd never notice a thing until she hit five hundred pounds and woke up as a massive, middle age ball of slovenly lard. By chance, Miranda had avoided exposure during her escape twenty years ago but the junk food Liara had left lying around happened to be loaded with the stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen MIranda had first bitten into a drugged Ho-Ho, she'd found the collection of sugar and chocolate to be disgusting. But as the retro viruses in it rapidly rewrote her genetic code, she found it okay. And by the second bite delicious and by the third pure nirvana. Miranda hadn't been able to shove treats into her mouth fast enough, going to bed with a painfully stuffed tummy that began to immediately send calories to her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Lawson's customary six pack had lost a third of its normal bulges. A layer of fat had crept up her midsection in the middle of the night, burying her lower abdominal muscles in a soft layer that was starting to roll over her work out spandex. Those same pants were stretched tight over a no longer perfectly round booty, which had its first degree of sag and a sand grain fleck of cellulite on one perfectly smooth cheek, the first of many to come. Miranda had been blissfully unaware at the tightness as she'd run the mammoth Shepard and the elephantine Liara through their first workout, nor how her usually graceful routine hadn't generated any of the customary endorphins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the week, the busty brunette's bosoms were threatening to break out of two cup sizes too small sports bras and starting to show stretch marks. The last vestiges of her abs had turned into a gooey paunch with buttery love handles hanging over the sides of her spandex. Modelesque cheek bones had turned into cherry red apples with new dimples and a second chin showed whenever she smiled. Perfect runners thighs had started to rub when she walked and delicate ankles were puffing up. Her perfect badonka donk was taking on a life of its own, flaring out and sagging down as its firm muscles dwindled away and were replaced with ever deeper layers of fat, even as the mirror smooth skin was now studded with cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why don't you two run through this workout on your own?' the ex-operative had told the pair of swollen former heroes when they'd arrived at the running track, 'Let's see what you two have learned.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, the thoroughly out of shape brunette just hadn't had the energy to break a sweat that morning. She put the two fatties through an hours long workout, while killing a few bags of chips and a couple containers of twinkies and Ho-Hos to put her own soft body into the overweight category. On the hover drive back, she'd stopped to get the two land whales a dressingless salad each and gotten herself an extra large milk shake without thinking. The check out worker had almost had a heart attack seeing Miranda's milk white F cups burst out of her over stretched DD cup bra as she handed over her card. Miranda choked up the wardrobe malfunction to a faulty seam and kept drinking milk shake with one heavy boob hanging out, bouncing on the ride home at every swerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be one of the last times the increasingly plump Miranda would attract someone else's attention. Giant tits or not, the rest of her body was going rapidly to seed, not helped by the thousand plus calories of milkshake she drained in the five minute drive. As she got out of the car, she gave her first ever fat girl grunt as weakening legs pushed up a body that had gained a quarter of its mass in just a week. That night when she'd passed out with a belly full of drugged junk marked the first day Miranda had failed to work out since adolescence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat came faster and faster without any exercise as Miranda became ever more gluttonous and lazy. The household snack budget had actually increased as the once willowy woman was now eating more than Shepard and Liara had at their peak. Fifteen thousand calories of saturated fat and processed sugar a day were pouring into her, yet her now altered genetics meant she was still hungry over the months of her gain. Soon she was unrecognizable, a milk pale ball of lard that had started huffing when she got up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm *huff* really impressed with you two,' Miranda wheezed as Shepard and Liara finished another jiggling lap, 'Keep running and you'll be as skinny as me in no time!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Miranda had twenty pounds on the former Shadow Broker and given her rate of gain and Shepard's rate of decrease, it would be at most months until the ex-operative took the title of fattest person in the world. When she'd stood, a small tidal wave of wrappers had fallen onto the ground and her shorts, stretched transparent by their contents, let doughy sprawls of cellulite laden ass cheeks hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara jogged/waddled by, slowing her pace a bit as she saw that the bench her obese trainer had been sitting on remained bent after she'd stood up. Miranda was barely recognizable anymore as herself. Six months ago she'd been svelte and curvaceous, looking like professional model in her early twenties. Now she was a milky mountain of pudge that looked her actual late thirties age, small irregularities that her engineered genes had protected her from were making their mark: a little dusting of adult acne was on her bulbous cheeks, she had bags under her eyes and the start of crows feet on their sides. Sharply plucked eyebrows had grown bushy and thick, while her lustrous black hair had lost its sheen and hung in a limp pony tail, with a tiny sliver of silver just barely visible in it. Even her shining blue eyes were duller, slowly fading towards brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara felt guilt spill through her heart. Miranda had, out of the goodness of her heart, transformed Liara from a quarter ton pile of blue blubber barely able to get up off the couch, into a a still very overweight but decently in shape Asari on track to keep losing weight and with a near normal blood pressure. She hadn't even had a craving lately, all while Miranda had transformed into the very thing she was trying to help Shepard and Liara lose. Why she was oblivious to her transformation, Liara had no idea, but she had to tell the once perfect woman she'd turned into a parody of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I said keep it up blue berry!' Miranda yelled from the side as Liara slowed, waddling over with the rasp of her cellulite layered thighs joining the blue woman in her jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry,' the shadow broker covered as she watched the once perfect woman wobble, 'just got a little tired...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well that big ass doesn't look tired of being enormous, does it?' the brunette told the alien, punctuating the tease with a slap of Liara's meaty backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've lost two hundred pounds!' Liara interjected, noticing that sweat had begun pouring off Miranda's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you've got a hundred, *huff* a hundred and seventy to go, don't you lard *huff* ass?' the spy panted, already completely out of breath, 'if...if you *puff* want to be as skinny as me...*huff* you'll... *urf* keep *ugh*.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stopped dead in her tracks, hands on her knees and gasping in and out as quick as she could. Lungs burning, heart pounding, joints complaining and vision filling with spots. Liara stood watching, wondering if the brunette was having a heart attack when Miranda locked eyes with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My *ugh* cramp, isn't *ufff* an *ugh* excuse,' the spy wheezed, explaining away her inability to jog a hundred feet, 'to *uff* stop *huff* lard ass!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara turned and kept jogging, thighs slapping together and brow furrowed. Her fat body jogged and wobbled, but the fury of the shadow broker was building inside her. She'd been willing to help Miranda but now...well, leaving her to her own devices was the least revenge she could get. She might even super charge the now porcine Miranda's gain...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Miranda spent the rest of the afternoon stuffing herself, replacing the tides of sweat a hundred feet of running had made pour out of her body with well over a gallon of the caffeinated corn syrup humans called soda, Liara planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the former specter and former shadow broker ate the tiny balsamic salads and carrot sticks for their dinner and Miranda Lawson seamlessly transitioned from eating a bag of potato chips to mowing down a full pound burger (with a quarter pound of blue cheese) that had an order of fries, an order of fried stuffed mushrooms and an order of onion rings both on the burger and the side to eating five scoops of triple fudge ice cream drowned in chocolate sauce, whip cream and walnuts to popping open a new bag of chips before the grease that had dribbled on her sagging udders had even dried, Liara planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Shepard and Liara began a long love making session made easier by the cumulative loss of 500 or so pounds, Liara was planning even as she had her face between Shepard's still pillowy but much stronger thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the freckled heroine had at last passed out, the Asari forced herself to get off their shared king size bed. She stood relatively easily, the lightened fat load and the new strength in her thigh muscles making the task as mundane as it should be, and crept down to the kitchen. Miranda had set up a staggering array of alarms and locks on the fridge, but the while the Shadow Broker had become medically obese she was still a dangerous hacker. She deprogrammed them (and to the credit of Miranda's diet, had no temptation to even look at the smorgashboard of snacks) gathered four sticks of butter and soon had the stove sizzling and the fridge relocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, she crept up the stairs bearing a funnel and a large bowl filled with three thousand plus calories of warm butter. Part of her felt guilty, before Miranda had arrived the stairs were becoming a no go zone for her ludicrously unfit figure, but the slap on her ass burned in the Asari's mind. Miranda called her fat ass? Well, it was time to show that cerberus bitch what a fat ass really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara had no need for stealth, the raccuous snoring and grunts that came from Miranda's open mouth covered up any noise the grumbles from her overloaded stomach didn't.The pale brunette was passed out on her bed, an ice burg of dough surrounded by a sea of empty food wrappers and soda bottles, her mouth a ring of chocolate. She was clad in a lacey black nighty fit for a woman a hundred pounds lighter, it was fraying on every seam and her sensitive white skin was beat red where the bra and panties dug into her body. Seeing the perfect beauty reduced to such a state made Liara feel wet despite the thorough orgasm she'd just had. Miranda was so soft, so bulging, so layered in cellulite across her hips, that Liara's thoroughly chubby chasing libido was thoroughly turned on. It also made her reconsider what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn extra three thousand calories a night wouldn't even be noticed on this lardass. No, Liara would have to do even more. This would just be a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Call me a fat ass?' the feeder Asari whispered as Miranda started sucking down butter, 'well, if I and Eileen have to be thin again, I'm going to make you so fat you won't even be able to get up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda woke up well before dawn, the sole remnant from her previously well regimented life. She found she had a slightly upset stomach, which she wrote off as from a punishing ab work out she'd imagined herself doing the day before. Atrophied muscles struggled a moment against the giant belly and enormous breasts pinning her down, then rolled slowly over with a huff and the rattle of wrappers sliding off the bed, then the slight smack of her strechmark coated double belly hitting her tree trunk thighs. With a grunt and the creak of joints, the pathetically out of shape woman stood up and in her mind she sprang lightly to her feet as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling out of her room on weak swollen legs, in her mind strutting with long, strong stems, the brunette snatched up a box of doughnuts strategically placed by Liara the night before. Half of the custard filled callorie bombs were gone by the time Miranda's slow pace got her to the guest bathroom of Shepard's mansion like home, pausing only to knock on the doors of Liara and Eileen's shared bed room to awaken them for their work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fatties would lay in bed eating all day without me,' the Cerberus operative chuckled, plunging another doughnut into her mouth and waddling on, the divided bulge of her gut pressing open the bathroom door before her slow moving hand could stop shoving pastry down her throat, 'can't believe they let themselves go like that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guest bathroom had a full length mirror opposite the door and Miranda preened in front of it as she polished off the last of the calorie bombs. To her eyes she appeared as he always was:a tall, breathtakingly gorgeous woman in her early twenties, balanced perfectly on the triple edges of curves, slimness and muscle. Lustrous, silky and shiny black locks that looked perfect even on waking up framing a stunningly smooth face of angular cheek bones, a sharp chin, narrow brows and big blue eyes that belonged on a magazine cover. While the round double Ds sitting perfectly in their lace cups, a long hour glass torso with a narrow waist and firm muscles, girlihsly round hips and the long slim thighs of a sprinter belonged on a very different type of magazine. She turned around, inspecting the twin hemispheres of her perfect booty displayed by the thong. Satisfied, she gave the flawless ass a smack and then lifted up her shirt to inspect her equally superb abdominals, flexing the six pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was afraid all their junk food would rub off on me,' she laughed, failing to find even the slightest layer of fat on the firm abs, 'but I really am perfect after all. It almost seems a waste to keep this perfection here on its lonesome, but those two would eat themselves even fat again without me watching them like a hawk.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the Cerberus operative's eternal illusion was a different matter. The real reflection had horrible posture, round shoulders slumped under their load. Her dull, course brown/black hair was a limp mop of greasy split ends, with a dotting of grey at the roots. Slight crows feet at the corners of her at best hazel eyes complimented the heavy bags under the piggish orbs, showing her real age of thirty nine. Red bumps and white heads were spreading up from her cheeks and onto her forehead, an untreated adult acne outbreak growing farther every day. Naturally narrow, arched brows had grown wide and wooly, a thickening spatter of hairs in between them promising a mono brow in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was even before her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer diamond shaped face had become round and slovenly, the cheeks bulging out like a chipmunk even in the scant times they weren't full of food. The sharp chin was buried under a heavy hanging jowl that plunged out further every day and the swan like neck was thick as a line backers. Slim shoulders were soft and puffy, leading into the arms not of a skilled fighter but into the wobbling limbs of a lunch lady, her increasing bingo wings looking soft as bags of frosting and leading down to clumsily plump fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe F cup bra was stupidly too small, mounds of striated fat mushrooming out above, beneath and to the side of its fraying black lace.One bra strap had broken as she'd waddled to bed with arms full of treats the past night and on the front only one snap remained bound. As Miranda took a shallow breath, deep as she could get as her body began to develop asthma per its genetic protocol, the snap popped and her breasts surged free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is with the fabric on this planet?' Miranda sighed, 'this is the third piece of clothes this week!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off what to her mind was a 34 DD bra, her brain refusing to read the letters that said 42 I. The breasts she saw in the mirror looked high, totally symmetrical and tight, the small pink nipples pointing up. In reality the veiny milk mountains hung straight down to rest on her bloated gut, the brown nipples stretched to saucer size. Stretch marks covered their sides and her right breast hung a few inches behind the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping off the size twenty six nighty she would have sworn was a size four, the porcine agent waddled towards the scale as she started the shower, puffing from the slight effort of disrobing. She didn't notice how her elephantine ass cheeks, resembling trashbags eighty percent filled with melted marshmellows, and beef cow hips knocked over a soap dispenser as she squeezed by the sink. And when she stood on the scale, she looked past her pert funbags to see it say '135 lbs'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm, I'm taking it a little too hard working those porkers,' the obese woman said idly patting what she thought were firm breasts, 'I need to put on a few pounds or the girls will start deflating.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, the flabby woman was looking down at where her sagging breasts rested upon her stupendous gut. Permanently bloated with junk food, the more than doubled waist had a clear bifurcating roll that had blocked out view of her bloated feet for a month and a half and cast a shadow over the blue numbers reading '341'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda squeezed into the shower, moving awkward with an extra 200 plus pounds stuck to her body. Before a few minutes under the hot water had passed, her hamhock thighs and bloated cankles had started trembling from keeping her poundage upright for half an hour. She plopped down onto the rest seat Liara had had installed long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can't believe these fatsos need shower seats,' Miranda laughed, while rubbing soap across the many folds of her apron gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a long time to subconsciously clean her bulk and when the porcine brunette waddled out, a robe barely buckled in the front of her clothes, she wheezed down stairs to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'What is this?' Miranda demanded, raising one bushy eyebrow as she saw a large chrome chair replete with cup holders hovering in the living room, Liara's still mammoth booty pressing against a pair of shorts as she programmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, Miri,' the Asari said, 'I didn't hear you coming down.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, unlike you I don't make the stairs creak as I walk down,' the porcine brunette bragged, as she stepped down off the creaking stairs, 'but what is this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, well, its a director's hover chair,' Liara said, drinking in the sagging canyon of cleavage Miranda had thoughtlessly on display, 'you've been...well you've been looking a little thin lately and I'm worried about you injuring yourself. We need to do cardio all day to try and lose all of this fat, but you were already in great shape. Exercising that hard could injure you or make you underweight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly the hallucinating brunette agreed, 'You're right, I've been overdoing it. I'm sore all the time from over exerting myself and I've lost five pounds in the last couple weeks, can you believe it? The scale said I was 135 lbs and at my height I'm almost underweight. If I lose anything it'll be either muscle or curves I don't want to lose.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara would have been surprised if Miranda had any muscle at all beneath that flab, but she merely smiled as the slightly heavier (for now) human waddled up and sank into the hovering chair, bean bag buns hanging over the arm rests fit for a regular human. It dipped dangerously low before its engines recalibrated, on board computer moving it into the Krogan class. Several whirs from the seat sounded as it widened out and shaped itself into Miranda's sprawling ass and waist-thick thighs, becoming perfectly comfortable and beginning to massage her sore back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh this feels great,' the fat woman sighed, 'oooff, I don't want to ever get out of this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, I was thinking though that well...my weight is starting to plateau,' Liara lied, for with the drugs out of her system she'd been shedding weight like water, 'how about some supplements to get my metabolism super charged?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ummm....good idea,' Miranda sighed, half asleep as the the hovering chair began massaging her swollen ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll order them now but...how about anything for you?' Liara pressed, 'I hate to say it but you've gotten a bit...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A bit what?' the hazel eyed woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I hate to say this but your element zero tanks don't look like they're full,' Liara said, nodding towards the veiny stretched out fat bags, 'and your hips and butt...they've gotten a bit boyish. How about some supplements to get you your curves back.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm, I think you're right,' Miranda, her hallucinating mind very suggestible, 'I'd hate to lose my backside.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll get right on that,' Liara promised, waddling off towards the kitchen 'then I better make breakfast.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, I should do that,' the obese spy complained, making her chair spin around, 'you two can't be trusted until youre thin again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you spend so much effort cooking for us,' Liara said, even though she and shepard were usually served raw salad and Miranda either reheated or ordered out for herself, 'so I had another thought...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA skeletal robot whirred out of the kitchen, bearing what looked like two small salads and one medium salad to Miranda and two small salads and a full english breakfast of a half dozen fried eggs, a slab of bacon, a dozen sausage links and patties each, a six egg omelette and a mountain of hashbrowns drowned in barbecue sauce, with a 24 oz cup of hot cocoa drowning in whip cream to Liara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You bought a robot helper?' Miranda asked, 'aren't those for lazy people?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe, but hey, you don't need to be our maid as well as our coach,' Liara lied, 'you focus on getting us thin and let it handle the cooking and cleaning.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great idea,' Miri nodded, digging in greedily, 'hey, sorry I called you a fat ass yesterday.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh?' Liara asked, caught off guard by an apology from the abrasive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've lost a ton of weight and deserve to have that rewarded,' Miranda murmured through a full mouth, 'I've got to be mean to get you going though when your body wants to quit. I'll do anything to get you two back in tip top shape again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, thank you...' Liara said, shame suddenly filling her as she watched her coach continue eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Miri I've got to tell you something...,' she said quietly, too quietly for the brunette to pick up over the whirr of her seats repulsors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you've got to admit its kinda funny,' Miranda laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's funny?' the asari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your ass. I mean, it was almost as nice as mine is,' Miranda continued, shoveling in fried eggs, 'but now its like a big blue bean bag behind you. Even when you've lost all that weight your still just gigantic back there. Did you have to tell me something?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The scale upstairs is a little inaccurate,' Liara seamlessly lied, 'it says your about ten pounds heavier than you are.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That would explain somethings,' Miranda muttered through the bacon, 'I've felt tired all the time lately, like i'm carrying weights around.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Better not workout with us today then,' the Asari said, as if Miranda had done that in the past three months, 'you don't want to get too thin.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen strolled out of the house, locking the doors behind the parade of fatties. Her stomach grumbled with hunger but she shushed it, she couldn't believe how fat she'd gotten in the last year. It almost defied belief that someone could get so fat so fast. That she'd been almost eight hundred pounds at her biggest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jeesh,' she whispered to herself, feeling heat rise between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like one of the ancient stories she'd found buried in the internet, from the fat fetishest sites of the obesity epidemic before its cure with the creation of nanites. She'd been enormous, mammoth and obscene, a pig of a woman like she'd always dreamed of banging. She'd never expected to be the fat one in any relationship, she'd been too ashamed to ever admit her secret fetish to anyone. But with Liara pampering her and then beginning to plump up alongside her, it had been a dream. She'd been having fat sex every night, the best sex she could imagine as pendous breasts and mushroom asses and billuous rolls bounced and surged against each other and never have to admit she liked fat girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, she knew she should do something when she'd gotten too big to get up on her own, but she'd known that when her feet had disappeared and the first time she got stuck in a doorway. Even as she'd wanted to try and take a more dominant role she'd also enjoyed being pampered and plushed into near helplessness. She was happy that she was getting into the more manageable four hundreds now, instead of pressing in on a half ton but she was missing the weight that had been on Liara. Her 'little blue berry' being a mere three hundred pounds, able to easily go up and down stairs and do easy chores, was a bit saddened. Yeah her hip measurements were still about fifty inches and her barely increased E cups sagged crazily, but she wasn't huge anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's why i'm working out,' the quarter ton Shepard thought to herself, 'to get into the best shape of my life so I can get Liara bigger than I ever was and take care of her. I can thank Miri for that at least, even if she is making Liara skinny.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, who put the seat up so far?' Miranda grunted from the front of the hover car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving slid gracelessly from the hover chair, almost falling, the obese ex agent was trying to shove her mountain of a gut into the car. It hit the horn at least three times before the milk-white tide of lard settled in finally and started buckling her seat belt over her gut. As Shepard began sliding her own wobbling mass in on the other side, even with her revitalized muscles it was no easy feat to shove five hundred pounds into a space meant for two hundred at most, she noticed that Miranda was red faced and panting, sweat running down her face and pooling in her straining sports bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cerberus spy began chugging a two liter soda, Shepard reflected that she really didn't want to cheat on Liara. Her little blue berry was kind and caring and sweet as honey. Even if she'd staid a svelte 120 Eileen would have loved her. Miranda on the other hand, was abrasive, cold and aloof. But her heavy breasts and super sized booty had gotten Eileen's mass effect drive running since she'd first laid eyes on the hour glass brunette. Efforts to get into the brunettes pants had been for not, as had half hearted attempts to get the perfect woman to soften up a little back on the Normandy 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo seeing her all day in sports ware was invigorating to Eileen's libido. Especially as Miranda began to obliviously balloon into a butter ball at a blistering pace. Miranda's ass was nearly the equal of Liara's, while her freshly doubled belly was a thick apron even now pressing against the wheel and she had the biggest tits Shepard had ever seen that weren't on herself. Her face had gone from photoshoot ready  at all times to at best plain if you didn't count the pimples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Get your fat rolls off the gear shift,' Miranda chided Liara, as her chubby fingers pried the stick out from between the tiny space left by their joint hip bulges, 'if the car will even lift given how you tilt it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen caught the anger in Liara's eyes and how the sweaty Miranda started drinking yet another soda. Why the vain woman wasn't noticing her own transformation was a mystery to her, but...what if she could speed it up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for Liara...well...three hundred would be a good spot for her friend to rebound up from, wouldn't it?</span></div></div>",

She was angry, yes but the only reason Miranda was even in this situation was because of her...and that guilt was enough to curb her anger but not completely eradicate it. She'd leave Miranda alone, at least for now. She jogged on, determined to put some distance between herself and the large brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Miranda was still pulling herself together. As she huffed and puffed, some buried part of her psyche wailed. Despite the changes to her genetics due to her cruel father's fail safe, that had not overridden every aspect of Miranda's mind, just most it. Her genetically induced ignorance wasn't meant to be complete nor last forever. As such, the parts of her that made up the Miranda Lawson, the perfect woman, the perfect heir of the Lawson dynasty and one of the most beautiful and capable women in the entire galaxy was were still there, even if they had been shunted to the backseat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those parts, <i>cried</i>. In anger and in despair. If said parts could have been given a voice, a way to speak, they'd roared themselves raw in several different languages. They'd bemoan her current pathetic state, berate themselves for allowing this to happen, resolve to herself moving with Shepard and Liara and so very much more. Alas, such thoughts were trapped behind a wall of enforced indulgence and gluttony, crying out to nothing and wouldn't be heard until it was far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Miranda's current state, all she could really think about the next thing she was going to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *uff* really go...*ooh*...for a chili-dog *huff* or five...\" She panted out to herself as she started awkwardly shuffle herself off to her next meal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Genetic tampering is a fickle thing. If Liara remembered that, then she probably would have tried more forcefully to get Miranda to stop before she hit that five hundred pound wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the wall came, late at night after Liara and Shepard had retired following a day's workout, one that helped Shepard dropped down to a comfortably obese four hundred thirteen and her blue lover down to a pudgy two forty-five. While those two lay entwined in each other's arms, Miranda's genetic failsafe had gotten her out of bed and into the kitchen, where she gorged herself on a big chocolate cake without a care in the world. As the food slowly digested and became fat, the nanobots finally reached that golden number and shut the whole system down. Mid-bite, Miranda was hit with the full knowledge of everything that happened, every gorge session and every roll of fat that blossomed on her perfect body as the part of herself that knew what went on finally snapped to attention. Look what you've done, it seemed to scream at her. Look at the hog you've turned into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was too stunned to even speak. She ran to the bathroom, the floor rumbling from her heavy footfalls, especially as she lost her balance, unfamiliar with her new immense weight. Switching on the light, she glanced at herself in the mirror with horror. What was once a slender, lithe figure was a heaping mass of fat, rolls upon rolls of belly poured on top of an ass and thighs that could crush chairs under their girth. Slim muscular arms drowned in a sea of arm fat. Wrists and ankles suffocated by the fat spilling over them. Her face...her perfect, perfect, face...a bloated, flabby mess, swaddled in chins and dominated by a pair of apple-sized cheeks. She..she wanted to scream, but the sound caught in her throat. She couldn't speak, she couldn't breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" she gasped. \"I...I l-look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in that moment, something snapped. Not her belt or her pants, as one would expect, but her personality. The fail-safe implanted by her father to make her want to gorge didn't just suppress the voice upset with her getting fat, it suppressed everything. And when the dam finally burst and her thoughts came flooding back, everything became mixed up in a turbulent slurry of emotion and personality. That was a part of the fail-safe, to make Miranda mentally collapse and thus easier to recapture and \"fix\", but her perfect psyche was too good to be scrambled like that and managed to keep Miranda's mental state together...and it retained a little bit of the fail-safe's coding to amplify what was already there, namely the desire to gorge and grow fat. Essentially, Miranda reached an epiphany thanks to a failing fail-safe, and when she looked at her tremendous form, overflowing with creamy, soft fat, she found the words to finish what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an uncharacteristic giggle, the new Miranda put her arms behind her head, shaking her tremendous belly in front of the mirror with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so big and huge...why did I ever want to go on diets and work out? I look so damn good at this size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhmm...Miranda? Is something up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda spun around, dropping down her arms at once as Liara stepped around the doorframe. Miranda looked at the pudge collecting around her waste with renewed interest, remembering how much of it there was when she started. She had been the fattest Asari in the galaxy, she remembered saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she will be again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling alright?\" Liara asked, suspicious of her perkiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just fine, Liara,\" Miranda said, cheerfully wiping chocolate icing off her lips. \"I'm just excited for the new workout program for tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New program?\" the Asari said suspiciously. \"But what's wrong with the old-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry about it, darling,\" Miranda interrupted, waddling over to place her hands on Liara's shoulders and lead her out of the bathroom. \"With the new program, we'll be getting you into the right shape in no time~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara stared, incredibly suspicious, but her loud yawn convinced her that it was too late to worry about now. And as she left to join Shepard in repose, Miranda immediately doubled back to the fridge and began to plot. She'd done so much damage to their figures already, Miranda thought to herself as she remembered how they filled out the sofa when she arrived. They had a lot of work to do before they got all those succulent rolls and curves back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Liara drifted off to sleep, unaware of Miranda's newfound chubby chasing attitude, she was none the wiser until...</span></div></div>",

Feeling a bit...under the weather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara barely paid any attention to the conversation, too distracted by the suspicious circumstances. For weeks now Miranda had been a rude, sloppy mess hundreds of pounds overweight, but ever since the Asari bumped into her last night, too sleepy to really pay attention, she seemed quite different. She was still hugely fat of course, that couldn't change overnight without a special surgery, but out of the blue she suddenly seemed...nice. She didn't squawk about how out of shape they were compared to her or put them down for not working out hard enough. On the contrary, she almost asked them to come outside and run laps, and only after making sure Shepard and Liara both had a good healthy breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, she even looked better too. As opposed to the stained jumpsuit with holes torn in it that she used to wear, she swapped into a voluminous shirt and short shorts combo with the same hexagon pattern as her old outfit that was big enough to actually fit her girth, hugging her couch-crushing rear end snugly while supporting the triple belly pouring over her waistband. It even looked like she'd had a good long shower since the last time they saw her; the markings and age lines on her face had faded, and her hair was back to being full and luscious, flowing down either side of her face and draping over the nearly flawless skin on her chipmunk cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI supposed that was the silver lining to ruining her waistline, Liara thought guiltily to herself. She got to keep that flawless complexion. Maybe her age-defying nanites finally caught up to her growing girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we have to keep your energy up, ladies!\" Miranda announced, waddling towards them with a pair of drink cups. \"Staying hydrated is key!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara nonchalantly grabbed the drink cup and took a big swig, but nearly gagged at the sudden taste. She thought it was something rancid that caught in her throat before her senses re-tuned and realized that whatever she drank was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sweet!\" Shepard exclaimed, exhaling after taking a swig. \"What's in this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just energy drink stuff,\" Miranda explained, a smile creasing her lips. \"It's sweet and it'll help you keep up your energy for your workouts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, awesome!\" the former Commander exclaimed, taking another big swig. Liara stared at the cup incredulously, wondering what exactly was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong Liara?\" Miranda asked, wobbling towards the now slightly chubby Asari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, nothing Miranda,\" she said, chewing her lower lip to pieces out of guilt. \"I guess that...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm trying to get you guys in the best shape of your lives,\" Miranda explained, her eyes shifting slightly at the idea. \"It's a little unorthodox but I think we'll both enjoy the results you get from this health plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara sighed, taking another sip of the sugary drink. On the second taste, it actually was pretty good, come to think of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whatever you say Miranda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine, Liara!\" Miranda called from the living room. \"Shepard's already starting her workout, hurry up or you'll be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-coming!\" Liara called out, still staring at the bathroom scale, the one Miranda had insisted on before her diet plan changed. At first the Asari thought she was imaging things, and her sluggishness was just due to the change of their workout plan, but after seeing how much of the bed Shepard filled last night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to see past the curve of her belly for the first time in a while, Liara finally caught sight of the numbers; a cheery two hundred twelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I gain fifteen pounds back in a couple of days?\" the Asari murmured under her breath. \"That's....not even possible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liaaaaaara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara speed-walked out of the bathroom to tug on her workout clothes, now starting to stretch uncomfortably across her once again ballooning form. Scenarios all played out in her head, but there was really only one conclusion that Liara could reach based on what had happened the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was fattening her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow or why, she really had no clue. At first Liara assumed that it was karmic revenge and Miranda figured out what happened and wanted revenge, and she would have probably guessed that earlier if her being over the top nice didn't throw her off. If Miranda was secretly getting revenge, she would never have made it so obvious, what with the sudden attitude change and the workout changes Not to mention those damn milkshakes she gave them after jogs, Liara thought, unwilling to admit she may have had a craving for one right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that just begged the question; what the hell was Liara going to do about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the answer would come at breakfast time...</span></div></div>",

The Asari's cheek bones had been visible again, she'd been down to two chins and her waistline had almost existed, no longer fused with her bean bag hips and sausage casing thighs. She'd still been pear shaped but it had been a manageable pear and she'd been in damn good shape, hard, strong muscles having grown in under her fat. In terms of weights she'd never been stronger and if the extra fat layers hadn't been slowing her down, Miranda's training would have made her faster than ever. At last under two hundred pounds, the chubby chasing biotic had been on schedule for getting her old body back within the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the biotic alien squeezed the shorts up her meaty legs, she didn't feel any muscle at all. Instead, the legs felt lardy, stiff and weak, her flexibility seriously hampered by withered muscle. A pinch on her thighs confirmed it, they'd gone thick powerlifter thighs to those of a couch potato again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm out of shape again...how?' Liara asked, beginning to walk down stairs and feeling her thighs slap again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been running...had she? Thinking back, Miranda had blown the whistle earlier and earlier every work out session for the last few days, telling them they were doing it faster and faster. At the time it had seemed that way, the effort seemed the same but now Liara realized she'd been expending the same amount of energy to do less work than before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just that Miranda was fattening her up, successfully, she was doing it faster than possible. Had she found some sort of better drug than Liara had? And what would the Asari do about it? She'd wanted Shepard the size of a house of course, but after the wake up call that she was the fattest asari ever she'd been planning on staying thin her self to take care of her helpless hero lover. All that hard won muscle ton was gone and all those months of gym sessions wasted, she was almost back at square one in terms of physical form although she wasn't as fat...yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara went down the stairs, remembering the time when they'd been dangerous to traverse and knowing that could come again. She prepared to say something but stopped dead once she got to the kitchen, eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard stood naked in the kitchen, six feet of tree trunk thighs, poofy fat rolls and crinkly cellulite ass.Liara's lover had been a beefy, strong three hundred pounds, looking dangerous and tough again but now she was back to being a cream puff with the evaporation of her reclaimed muscle and the regain of at least forty soft pounds. Hearing LIara she turned around, revealing herself to be not naked but wearing a miniscule string bikini her soft body was swallowing, her now sagging breasts pouring out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey blue! Guess what, we're going on vacation!' the replumpening Shepard smiled, showing a chin that had vanished three months ago was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We...we are?' Liara asked, IQ dropping twenty points every second she stared at those soft curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah, on an interplanetary cruise liner,' Miranda smiled, the near six hundred pound operative waddling up in a slingshot bikini that a tidal wave of lard poured out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already sweating from the short waddle, breathing hard through her mouth. Although the age lines had corrected as her overwhelmed nanites decided to focus just on that flaw, she was gaining weight at a lunatic pace still and in horrific shape. Immobility was in her future, she'd gotten so fat she couldn't drive the hover car anymore and now sat in the back. Hell, she'd gotten so fat she'd gotten significantly shorter, dropping from 5'11 to 5'9 due to the pressure on her joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery waddling step of the insanely obese spy's thighs had to fight against a drooping apron of her gut and her head sized hooters looked ready to hit her in the face they bounced so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A cruise? Don't...don't people gain weight on those?' Liara tried asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh not this cruise,' Miranda smiled, the obese spy looking like a cat that had fallen into cream, 'this is for the best of the best, the sexiest models and female athletes on the world, with top of the line spas and work out equipment.

A Geth immediately scurried up and picked it up, offering her the handle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dropped this, Admiral,\" the Geth stated helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...thank you...\" Tali said, quivering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali! It's good to see you again!\" Shepard said happily, straining as she got to her feet and lumbered over, her every step shaking the floor. \"You look great!\" Tali looked ready to run, but before she could move Eileen had pulled her into her mountainous flab and wrapped her meaty arms around her to give a mighty bear hug. Whimpering slightly, Tali glanced at Liara, who guiltily scarfed down a cookie. She could only see the Quarian's eyes through that glass dome, but she could glean that the Quarian wasn't pleased with this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you....too...Shepard...\" Tali said weakly as she broke away from the blob of a woman who just tried to smother her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just HAVE to catch up Tali!\" Shepard insisted. \"Liara stocked the kitchen full of Dextro foods last night, so you can stay for dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...very nice,\" Tali went on, trying to sound delicate. \"Mmm...Liara...kitchen?\" Without waiting for an answer, Tali turned on her heel and strutted out of the room, leaving both obese ladies and the Geth holding the toolbox confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will wait outside,\" the Geth declared, walking back out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...go get dinner started,\" Liara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll polish off these cookies!\" Shepard declared, licking her plump lips and returning to her massive sofa seating. Liara gave her lover a pat on the thick shoulder before waddling into the kitchen, where Tali was pacing back and forth anxiously, muttering in rapid-fire Quarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how's the fleet?\" Liara asked sheepishly. Tali stared blankly, looked like she was about to say something, but just ended up gesticulating wildly for a moment before continuing her pacing and mumbling. \"I...take it you're a little shocked at...well,\" Liara suggested, lifting up her belly roll and letting it flop down. \"This.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is THAT it?\" Tali said, sounding quite manic. \"<i>Keelah</i>, who would have thought she would be stunned to see her friends are the size of <i>tilgraps</i>? That's <b>perfectly</b> normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you we....uh...put on a few,\" Liara tried to explain rather pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A FEW?\" Tali shouted, making Liara worry that Shepard would here. \"A FEW? Do the Asari have different numbers then we do? <i>A FEW?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine I downplayed things!\" the blubbery Asari said soothingly. \"But you don't need to worry, we're both happy like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Eileen...look at her! She's....aaagh!\" Tali ran over to the fridge and smacked her helmet against it, producing the ting of glass ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Tali, we both saw everything she went through to defeat the Reapers,\" Liara said soothingly, placing a fat hand on her friend's shoulder. \"After everything she did, isn't it fair that she gets to keep this little bit of happiness?\" Liara hadn't lost her Shadow Broker charisma as she gained pound after pound, and while threats were more her style, she could weave calming words almost as well. The Quarian took a deep breath, possibly remembering how Eileen had helped to reunite the Geth and the Quarians in peace, and at last relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll help?\" Liara asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...but the scope of the project is going to have to change.\" Tali said, straightening herself out. \"When I said I'd help install this automated system, I wasn't aware that you two were barely mobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah, I should have mentioned that, shouldn't I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you should have,\" Tali said flatly, bringing up her omni-tool. \"In any case, I think I can get this monster set up in...a month's time if I hurry up. That way you can do all the cooking, cleaning, and whatever else you need to do without even leaving your chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't need to rush, Tali...\" Liara said sweetly. \"You can take your time and stick around for a few months. We really missed having you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmph....fine....\" Tali relented. \"But don't think you're going to feed me up like you did with Shepard there.

A timer rang out from the kitchen not a moment later, signalling to the home\u2019s gluttonous residents that it was time for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara heaved her body into motion, leaving the Krogan sized scale behind. After navigating the narrow passages of her own home, she slowly lumbered into the kitchen, eager for her next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the oven she pulled four super-sized pizzas; two for her, two for Shepard. Liara swung open the fridge and pondered over her options, eventually pulling several large bottles of sugary liquid humans called soda, or was it called pop? \u201cWho really cares what it\u2019s called?\u201d the Asari thought aloud as she opened a bottle and took a heavy swig. It tasted good, and that\u2019s all that mattered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room, over seven hundred some odd pounds of pale flab occupied the larger of the two sofas. Shepard\u2019s legs were spread out to accommodate for her enormous gut, now sporting a third roll with a fourth teasing into existence. Her breasts were barely contained by a large shirt instead of a bra, while her lower half wore no clothes to speak of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freckled commander was polishing off her second gallon of ice cream since lunch when a familiar scent caught her attention. Freshly baked dough, sinfully succulent sauce, and delectably greasy cheese. She looked up to see Liara carrying everything out and gave a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungry dear?\u201d the blubbery blue asari asked in a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen aren\u2019t I?\u201d Eileen said back with an ice cream coated smirk. The redheaded mass heaved her bulk forwards as the pizzas were placed on the table before her, ready to dive in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ah ah! Not quite yet!\u201d Liara leaned over with a napkin in hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a little something riiiiiight-\u201d Liara kissed her lover, licking away the melted ice cream from her lips. \u201c-there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two locked eyes for a moment and smiled. Liara tucked a napkin into Shepard\u2019s shirt collar before she leaned in to whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDig in piggy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jolt of excitement ran through the commander\u2019s gelatinous body. Name-calling was something Shepard used to do herself, cracking jokes at her own ridiculous size. Now it was a turn-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara backed away and Shepard spared little time, thrusting her pudgy arms towards the pizzas before her. Slice after slice of greasy perfection was shovelled into Shepard\u2019s greedy maw, occasionally followed by a swig of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara lumbered her way towards her own seat before carefully lowering her rear into the fragile furniture. The sagging loveseat ached and groaned as her ass filled the remaining space, taking the load off her overtaxed knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026 much better,\u201d the Asari uttered before raising a slice of pizza to her mouth. As she bit down, her brain was flooded with hormones. The crunch of the crust, the sweetness of the sauce, the soft gooey succulence of the cheese. She was in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral months ago, if someone were to ask Liara if she\u2019d been gaining weight, she would have panicked, maybe even gone on a diet. If they were to ask the same thing now, Liara\u2019s response would be a simple reply of \u201cprobably,\u201d before chowing down on yet another slice of greasy goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight just didn\u2019t seem so important anymore; the enormous asari was much more concerned with what her next meal would be than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eat some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Shepard and Liara are too engrossed in their meals to hear the furniture creaking beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Liara and Shepard slowly forget their manners and become gluttonous slobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Something else?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Liara was well aware of the immense weight of her and her lover the day she broke the old scale, it easily faded into the background at the first thought of food, glorious food. Liara had no choice but to think solely about food, really; Shepard had finally gone where Liara wanted her to in the first place and fallen into a cycle of obsessive, unrepentant gluttony, and had dragged her Asari mate down with her. It seemed every waking moment was dedicated to asking the question \"what is the tastiest way to fill my belly to the brim\", and the two of them had many answers to that little puzzle. This of course meant that they were on an unstoppable course towards getting bigger and bigger, and in time it was just enough to shock the two girls out of their hedonistic blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's thoughts turned away from the greasy human delicacy of 'Chinese food' when she felt the ground shift slightly beneath her on her way to the usual sofa she occupied. Worried about some sort of seismic event, she took a ponderous step backwards and inspected the floor. It was indeed enough to give Liara pause when she saw the floorboards bent inwards, an impressive crack where her foot came down earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard...\" Liara huffed through cheeks bulging with fat. \"Was the floor always unstable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard grunted as she devoured a salad bowl full of greasy, savory noodles, the sauces running down her chins and between her great sagging breasts. Luckily there wasn't a shirt to stain since the pair of them rarely got dressed up in more then bras and tiny shorts these days; Shepard had long ago outgrown the majority of her wardrobe two hundred pounds ago, which didn't help Liara at all when she cleared Shepard's old weight and needed new things to wear as well. Not that it mattered since they only ever stayed in and ate nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Liara thundered over to her favorite sofa and squeezed her elephantine hips in between the arms of the seat to prepare to devour her own savory meal. There was a \"pop\" from the chair as her love handles were squeezed into place, and she groaned in relief as the knees long ago sucked into her fat legs found relief in her sitting down. Still breathing heavily, Liara reached a thick, padded hand towards some choice noodle bowl when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRASH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room shook as Shepard suddenly dropped, the sofa beneath her enormity finally crying Uncle and cracking so hard it practically fell apart. The arms bounced away as Shepard hit the ground, her obese belly pitching and wobbling like a water balloon from the short sharp stop. The former Commander and scourge of the Reapers flailed her bloated limbs like a turtle stuck on its back as she tried to collect herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Liara!\" she grunted. \"I can't....hufff....get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara quickly got to her feet, or rather got to her feet at a slightly faster then incredibly slow pace. One of the arms of her sofa broke and feebly fell to the side unnoticed as Liara's knees cried out in agony from her taking a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard...huff...I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SNAP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara yelped as the floor suddenly gave way under another misplaced step, snapping underneath her chubby footstep. Seven hundred or so pounds of blue Asari fell on top of a coffee table filled with Chinese food, throwing greasy noodles and spicy chicken around like a bomb had gone off, utterly annihilating the table, and producing a tremendous bang so loud that it may have woken up the neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morbidly obese Asari, taking some time to recover from the shock, found herself propped up on her belly over top of the ruins of the table and their rather impressive takeout dinner, her enormous silk-clad rear end sticking up into the air, dwarfing the size of the table. Her belly was so immense that she could barely touch the floor with her thick fingers, and given her size and position it would be impossible to get footing with her poor, beleaguered legs again. Almost on instinct, Liara strained to reach for a bowl of noodles she could still reach, taking a handful and stuffing it into her greedy little mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara...huff....you okay?\" Shepard said at last, also preoccupied with feeding herself at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph...fine...\" Liara grunted. \"But...huff....I...think....we might be....getting...*grunt*....too big...\"</span></div></div>",

There was a gaping hole where the front door used to be. The old door was far too small for either Liara or Shepard to fit through, and so adjustments had to be made. Surrounding the house was a small army of laborers and worker droids working tirelessly to keep things under wraps. The forklift they used to carry the couple's bulk out of the house drove off for another job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara made quite a few enemies as the Shadow Broker, but more importantly she made many more... \u2018friends.\u2019 The Asari made sure to keep a stockpile of favors owed to her for when she finally retired, and she was willing to make full use of them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery bump in the road caused oceans of pale and blue flab to quiver and quake. It was entertaining enough to keep them distracted for a while, though it didn\u2019t take long for time to slow to a crawl. The two waited in silence and watched the skylines of countless mega-cities slowly fade into the horizon. As distance collected, houses became smaller, and yards much wider. Countryside was something Liara had only ever heard of in passing, usually from bits of media here and there, tales of backwards people and strange music, and now she was smack dab in the middle of it. Rolling hills of grain, herds of cows and sheep; it was all positively beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two oversized passengers watched the landscape crawl by, until they eventually found themselves bored of that too. Some time later, the silence was finally broken. Not by mouth, but the churning gurgle of Eileen\u2019s stomach. And Liara\u2019s soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead\u2019s chubby face turned to Liara\u2019s, chins jiggling from the simple action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... There wouldn\u2019t happen to be any food back here, would there...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara thought for a moment and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew I forgot something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enough time had passed, towering trees sprouted up around the landscape and obscured their vision. They were now in the thick of the forests. Wildlife provided a new form of entertainment for the two for the time being, with all sorts of birds and animals Liara had never seen before prancing around, doing nature things. Another half hour in and they were met with rocky cliff faces and jarring peaks as they winded up a mountainous pass. The truck slowed as they came to a valley between the mountain peaks. A view of the whole countryside could be seen beneath them, with the tips of skyscrapers just barely in view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen\u2019s bottomless gut cried out in agony for food, growling and howling for something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Liara cooed. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, the former commander peered out the window, in awe of what she saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Shepard see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) A Grandiose Mansion: The two are catered to day in and day out, centered around making life as luxuriously lazy as possible. Focus is placed more heavily on being pampered to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) An Industrial Facility: A self-sufficient megacomplex wholly centered on feeding their endless appetites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Something Else!

The path took the truck past perfectly maintained hedges, flowering rosebushes in multicolored bloom, elegant and gold statues that glistened in the setting sun, and past one last, multi-tiered fountain that rained water in shifting bright colors before the real star of the show unfolded before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grand, elegant mansion, gleaming white with bronze window frames, green vines crawling up the sides and blossoming with blue and purple, a patio out front surrounded with classical Roman pillars, the steps leading up to it a magnificent shade of gold. A sight so magnificent, Eileen nearly forgot her ravenous hunger at the sight of it. It was so old-fashioned yet so new, it almost seemed unreal. Like the two of them had stepped back in time a hundred years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how...\" Shepard croaked out at last, unable to comprehend the beauty and splendor before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was left in my possession after the passing of an old business rival,\" Liara said, a spark of that shadow-dealer mischief still evident behind the flabby jowls and porcine features. \"Got a few favors pulled to get it cleaned and spruced up, widened some doorways, reinforcing the furniture, you know the drill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropelled onward by her astonishment, Shepard heaved herself out of the van, landing heavily on the elegant stonework underneath. Waddling up to the mansion, she let her mouth hang open in amazement as Liara waddled after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara...please tell me they have a pool,\" Shepard asked all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pool. Like, a fancy swimming pool!\" Shepard said, with a bit of hope and a bit of pleading. \"With a jacuzzi and everything. I've never gone in one before and...I'd love to try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara smiled. \"What self-respecting elegant mansion doesn't have a fantastic swimming pool?\" The look on her lover's face was enough to make Liara fall in love all over again, and she felt her face flush and a sudden urge to act on that love before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>GUUURGLE</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness!\" Liara said, clutching her noisy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in stereo,\" Shepard giggled as her own belly demanded food at the same time. Turning towards the mansion, she looked at the stairs leading up to the patio with some trepidation. It was a handful at best, but at her size, it might as well be on the top of the nearby mountain. She lifted her foot ponderously to the first step before Liara placed a hand on her shoulder to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no need to exert yourself!\" Liara said excitedly. \"That's why I have these!\" She snapped her fingers, and Shepard gave a small start as a dozen or so of very familiar white robots emerged from the door, two blue circles one on top of the other on their visors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOKI's?\" Shepard asked as the drones she was used to seeing fighting with Cerberus and the Blue Suns lined up at attention in front of them. \"Where did you get these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda tipped me off to a few old Cerberus arsenals,\" Liara explained. \"I figured you would appreciate the irony.\" Turning to the LOKIs, Liara cleared her throat and began in an authoritative tone. \"Could you please help us climb these stairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" the robots all chorused, splitting up and immediately rushing to the sides of the two enormous women. Shepard let the robots take her by the arms, with two behind her pushing on her prodigious back-fat, and let them assist her in getting up the stairs. The task still left her a sweaty mess, but with the help of the mechs she didn't feel like she was going to die afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very helpful, aren't they?\" Liara said, sweat beads rolling down her round cheeks as she led Shepard inside, the robots obediently following them. \"They'll respond to our commands and keep anyone from snooping around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all so...wow...\" Shepard tried to say as the pair walked into a grand foyer. \"I never thought that I would be able to live like this...like I had no more worries, or stresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to make it perfect for you...for us, even,\" Liara said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara...with you, it's always going to be perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe love and affection between the two was practically electric, and sadly like before the demands for food sort of killed the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to get started!\" Shepard said brightly, turning to the LOKI's. \"Can we get some food for me and this adorable blueberry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop it,\" Liara giggled, blushing a deep purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like us to get for you, ma'am?\" the robots chirped happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lardy lovers looked at one another, hunger in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus begun the luxurious, hedonistic lifestyles of Liara and Eileen, pampered to perfection in a sea of lazy luxury.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A delicate song fluttered through the air as songbirds greeted the morning light. The sun peered over the mountain valley and engulfed the land in splendor, granting the grounds of the grandiose mansion her gilded glimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard heard the birds and knew it was morning. Her eyes snuck open to see the beautiful scene unfold in front of her through a grand window that put Versailles to shame. She promptly closed her eyes, shifted her immense weight and buried her head beneath the bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shockwave of movement caused by Shepard\u2019s position shift roused a familiar blue blob awake. Liara rubbed some of the fog from her eyes and looked over to see her lover curled up as best as her body would allow, hiding from the morning\u2019s call. With a soft grunt the asari did her best to match the position, meshing her own flab into the pale sea beside her. Liara draped a lard encased arm over Shepard\u2019s, just managing to reach around the slab of fat coating her partner\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe retired commander hummed in delight at the gesture and poked her head out to see Liara\u2019s loving eyes. A smile as soft and warming as the embrace she now returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning sleepyhead.\u201d Liara\u2019s voice was crisp and sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there blueberry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatch enough sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen blushed as she recalled the previous night. Long after Liara returned to bed, Shepard stayed in the dining hall for an extended dessert. By the time she heaved her bulk into bed, Liara was already in a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few more minutes wouldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Shepard answered. She closed her eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara tightened their doughy embrace and nuzzled the commander\u2019s pillowy bosom. The asari listened to the musical churning of Eileen\u2019s innards going to work. The warm thud of each heartbeat, each heavy gust of breath, and another gurgling roar sound she\u2019d grown accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*GRRROOWWLLLLL*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungry already?\u201d Liara teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmh, must\u2019ve had a light dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA \u201clight\u201d dinner for Shepard was comically large for any regular person, but both knew she\u2019d eaten far beyond her fill last night, plus some for the road. Since first arriving just over a month ago, it felt as if they\u2019d never stopped eating. The dining hall was perpetually filled with feasts of all sorts and a cacophony of belches. When the two weren\u2019t gorging themselves into a coma, they could be found lounging about and digesting their meals, or attempting what little love-making their bodies could manage. Shepard and Liara gave the idea of \u201cliving large\u201d a whole new definition and ran\u2026 err, slowly and laboriously waddled with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas thinking maybe we could go for a swim later?\u201d Shepard thought aloud. It was one of her favorite features of the mansion, dipping in now and again as a way to take pressure off her overtaxed joints. It was one of the few dwindling ways she could stand upright without LOKI assistance. Yet as the days rolled on, time spent eating slowly seeped into her limited time spent swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t want to try out the tennis court?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardy har, very funny.\u201d Shepard smirked and absentmindedly played with her own blubbery rolls. The two held their embrace and lived in the moment, sinking back into the morning fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small army of LOKIs wheeled in a buffet of breakfast foods and sweet treats. Pancakes, waffles, donuts, bacon, danishes, muffins; if it was filled with fats and carbs, there\u2019s a good chance it was there. \u201cBreakfast in bed madams?\u201d one of the bots managed in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two got to work, trying hard to cram in as much food in as little time possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>~ Some Time Later ~</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cUUURRRRRPPP!</i> Woah, try and beat that one!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara gave a chuckle before craning her neck back. <i>\u201cUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRPPP!!!\u201d</i> The two giggled uncontrollably for a few minutes before rubbing their swollen stomachs. It was noon now and the duo had yet to leave bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooof\u2026 I think I might have overdid it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain?\u201d Liara teased. \u201cHere, let me give you a hand.\u201d The asari reached over and rubbed Eileen\u2019s porcelain porcine stomach. The commander gave a sigh of relief and closed her eyes. A few minutes in, the pain melted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen. I really owe you Liara. For everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw come on, this again? Listen dear. Believe me when I say it\u2019s the least I could do. You sacrificed life and limb for the galaxy. None of this would have been possible if it weren\u2019t for my brave\u2026\u201d Liara\u2019s hands moved to Shepard\u2019s love handles.  \u201c...strong\u2026\u201d The hands travelled further up to her fatty arms. \u201c...sexy commander.\u201d The hands ended filled with Shepard\u2019s monstrous mammaries before giving her ass a hearty slap. Liara leaned in for a whisper. <i>\u201cGo on..</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i><b>\u201c...command me.\u201d</b></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>~ A Little Later Than That ~</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost three now. Liara finally decided to take some initiative and get out of bed for a much needed trip to the restroom. With the help of the robot servants, her naked body was lugged out of bed and put on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer swollen cheeks melded down into her second chin, which swallowed the smaller spares into one mass of silky neck fat. Billowing pillows of fat flooded each flank, long ago having swallowed her elbows and consumed what remained of her shoulders. Her breasts had swollen further. Each one drooped down, large enough to rival most basketballs. Her back was a stack of fat rolls folded on top of one another. The gut in front of her hung down to her dimpled knees, retaining the shape of her old double-belly. Love handles jutted out to give off a pleasing transition from the upper half to the lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid lower half was what really took the cake (literally). Her ass billowed out behind her, each cheek large enough to flood an extra wide office chair with some spillage to spare. Her thighs touched from the knee up, thicker than most trees. A sleeve of fat hung from her calves, draping over her pudgy feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara T\u2019Soni was fat. <i>Really</i> fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some much needed effort her bulk was carried to the bathroom door, which still had an extra few feet of clearance for her ridiculously wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue blob did her business, thanking the goddess she remembered to upgrade the toilets a couple weeks ago. Up next was a bath to clean up after her \u201clittle\u201d lovemaking session. The pool-sized depression was filled with her bubbly bath. Liara just sat back and relaxed as robotic arms went to work, making sure to scrub down every last crevice, no matter how deep it was buried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished, curiosity reared its way into her head. \u201cLet\u2019s see how much I weigh.\u201d The LOKIs obeyed her command, brought her to the industrial scale and sat her down. The red numbers on the wall climbed before reaching an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">[1122]</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026\u201d She looked to the side to see the mirror. Her eyes widened as she was hit with the realization of just how much she\u2019d eaten over the past month. It wasn\u2019t a feeling of disgust, nor was it pride. She was just impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from the bathroom, Liara found Shepard waiting for her turn. The redheaded lardball was covered from head to toe in sweat from the simple act of getting out of bed. Surrounding her was her own team of LOKIs working hard to keep her knees from caving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Liara was <i>\u201cReally</i> fat,\u201d then oxford needed a new word to describe Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting from the top, her chipmunk cheeks looked like they were always full, and her extra chins hung far and lo. Her arms could be easily mistaken for king-sized pillows, milky white and void of definition. Her breasts hung down, each one larger than many prize winning melons. From the bottom up, her feet had grown some extra pudge and a cuff of fat was developing from her calves. Her thighs and ass weren\u2019t quite as large as her Liara\u2019s furniture-crushing feature, but were well on their way to rivalry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo finish it all off was her belly. The multi-tiered thing was enormous, hanging down far enough to cover her knees. The feeling of the floor touching her gut was new when she first moved it, but she quickly grew accustomed to it over time. While Liara's gain was a definite pear shape, Shepard seemed to just gain all over. Liara would have to remember to weigh her some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou *pant* uh\u2026 *sigh* done in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, go right ahead dear.\u201d The asari gave a cheeky smirk and pinched her partner as they passed. In the lounge, Liara rested her rear on the extra wide couch, noticing how much space her ass took up. \u201cWon\u2019t be long until I fill the whole thing,\u201d she thought aloud. For now she just leaned back and turned on the TV. A robot was soon by her side with a few boxes of donuts to snack on. This was paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Did she\u2026 hear something?</span></div></div>",

It was Liara's first criteria when trying to find a new place, and she was so insistent on being left alone that the only deliveries they had came in via fleets of drones, all the better to create her and Shepard's little paradise. All of this meant strangers would not come knocking on the door, which in turn meant that whoever was ringing the bell was a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something that Liara had been dreading for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard and Liara were not avoiding their old friends. They kept in regular contact through emails and phone conversations, and they were close enough that most of them had a general idea that the loving couple had decided not to maintain their figures, so to say. Some of them were confused, some perturbed, but for the most part they were happy for them and didn't make a huge fuss out of it. If anything, the savior of the galaxy deserved to be spared judgement for a couple pounds on her waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...tell them I'm on the way,\" Liara ordered one of the LOKI's hesitantly, who tottered off to get the door. \"The rest of you...well, help me get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara didn't want to give whoever was out there a heart attack by seeing her naked, though in all honestly seeing her at over half a ton was a close second in that regard. As the LOKI's lifted her meaty limbs and squeezed her into a pair of shorts closer in size to bed-sheets then regular clothing, the blubbery Asari wondered if she should have been honest with the others about how far the two of them were taking this. She couldn't imagine a lot of them taking this news well, but it would have been better then springing all two thousand pounds of Asari and Human blubber on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, it couldn't be helped now. As something resembling a shirt was slipped over her massive mammaries in an attempt to contain them, or at least block her sensitive area from view, Liara mumbled the order and began the arduous task of waddling towards the front door. In the time it took the sweating, panting Asari whale to come within earshot, whoever was out there had started banging on the door out of impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard! Liara!...</span></div></div>",

You sound funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you guys are shy about your weight, I really don't give a fuck. You could be a three hundred pound whale for all I care, just let me in, I gotta talk to Shepard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith grim resignation, Liara sent one of the drones to open the front door, as she positioned herself as casually as her corpulent form could manage. The robot obediently began the unlocking mechanism, and as soon as it finished Jack burst into the room, looking just as rebellious and punk as ever, if a little pale and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking finally!\" Jack snapped impatiently as she turned to face Liara. \"Now where's Shep....ard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....hello, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyes widened in slow motion as she took in Liara's form, starting with the bare feet the size of plates, travelling up to the billowing thighs smooshed together at the knee, the billowing hips stretching a pale pink set of shorts across a couch-annihilating butt and an equally impressive rack barely constrained by threads of fabric. Liara nervously shifted her feet, and she could see Jack's eyes tracking her voluminous belly as it swayed gently from side to side, pressing gently on her sucked-in knees. Feeling there was no point now that the cat was out of the bag, the Asari didn't bother to stop a pocket of gas from escaping this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>BRAAAAAAAAAP!</i>\" she belched, her jowls wobbling from the force of the burp escaping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara, was that you? Damn, that one was nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara and Jack both turned in slow motion as Shepard herself emerged onto the scene, squeezing out of the doorway Liara barely cleared herself, openly being helped by the robots and with everything...<i>everything</i>...on full display. Feeling like she was strapped into an out of control Mako careening through a hillside, Liara bit her lip as Shepard reached into a massive bag of pretzels and sloppily scarfed down a handful, sending bits and pieces messily across the floor. Jack's eye was twitching as one of the little cleaning robots they had on staff dutifully scurried in from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! I didn't know you were coming!\" Shepard said gleefully. \"How've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was one of the most powerful biotics in the galaxy, and she knew it. Jack could tear apart massive machines of war in her sleep. She could take down a hundred of the toughest Krogan mercs without breaking a sweat. She could even stare down a Reaper and make them blink. She was the baddest bitch in the galaxy, and there wasn't a single goddamned thing that could ever throw her off her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara checked the time. It had been at least ten minutes and Jack was still lying in a fetal position across the sofa her two massive crew mates hadn't filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...do you want anything Jack?\" Shepard asked delicately, now shoved into a black t-shirt that creaked when she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" she whimpered. \"I....I think I'm okay.\" Taking a deep breath, Jack sat up straight and opened her eyes, just as Liara had taken a handful of Shepard's pretzels and shoved them into her cheeks like a chipmunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*urp*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...few more seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack leaned on her side again, staring off into the distance. Liara, her stomach growling angrily at going so long without a properly sized meal, stewed in guilty silence as her skinnier crewmate sat back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so...first of all...\" Jack began. \"<b>What the actual fuck is this?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Liara mumbled. \"We did say we wanted to just...cut loose a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but...I thought you meant like a few pounds, or at least a dozen!\" Jack exclaimed. \"Not...how big even are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thousand three hundred twenty six,\" Shepard reported dutifully. \"I checked just now.\" Liara could feel something stirring in her nether regions, though maybe that was just Jack's incredulous rage throwing her out of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, you said you wanted us to be happy, right?\" Shepard said diplomatically, Liara realizing that she was using her legendary charisma to her advantage for the first time in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're happy like this, Jack,\" Shepard went on, slapping the side of her meaty flanks. \"Honest. It's weird, but we like being like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara could tell by the look on Jack's face that her anger was subsiding. Shepard may have been a war hero better known for her fighting skill, but no one could turn a phrase like she could. Pinching the bridge of her nose, Jack leaned back in the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine, whatever. My friends are elephants now,\" Jack grumbled. \"I'll deal with this later, but right now I got a bigger problem, and I need your help.\" For the first time, Jack actually looked rather nervous, as opposed to shell-shocked or angry. \"I'm...no longer on the market.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't?\" Shepard grinned. \"Who's the lucky guy, or girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oriana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard and Liara paused in confusion, then their jaws dropped almost as much as Jack's did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oriana LAWSON?\" Liara exclaimed. Jack nodded curtly, turning bright red. Shepard tried so hard not to laugh that her blubber split a seam on her shorts, letting more of her thighs stretch towards the arms of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...rather unexpected,\" Liara mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Jack said. \"But we met a while back, and just...everything sort of clicked for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really happy for you, honest, but that is just too funny,\" Shepard huffed, out of breath from the mere act of laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's also a problem,\" Jack continued. \"And it's why I kinda need your help, Shepard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: \"Miranda found out and she's pissed at me! Is there something you can do to distract her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: \"She told me she prefers her girlfriends on the heftier side, and I'm practically skin and bones! Could you do something to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: (Free choice)</span></div></div>",

Are we talking about the same Miranda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShepard makes a good point; Miranda isn\u2019t one to get so easily distracted. But then again...\u201d Liara rubbed her chubby chin as she pondered. Liara\u2019s higher brain functions had slowly gone ignored since starting on her \u2018little project\u2019 just a few months ago, making it rather difficult to rekindle her spark of genius. Come to think of it, the only thing she ever seemed concerned with these days\u2014other than Shepard\u2019s growing shape\u2014was food. Food... \u201cBy the goddess, I think I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Shepard looked on in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEileen?\u201d the Asari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you feel about a new housemate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause in the air allowed her audience to understand just what she meant. Jack\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t fucking dare\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara looked back with a coy smirk and a lilt in her voice. \u201cOh\u2026 I would~. With your permission of course Shepard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whale of a commander leaned back, causing the reinforced steel within the couch to creak. She thought for a moment, not seeming to understand the full implications of Liara\u2019s statement. It\u2019s been some time since she last saw Miranda, so why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea blue. Might as well make use of all those guest rooms. I'll get to work on an invitation\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was lost on Shepard gave Jack a mischievous smile, which eventually erupted into cackling laughter. Fucking brilliant. She couldn\u2019t wait to see that \u2018perfect bitch\u2019 in a few months\u2019 time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was always an incredibly busy woman. Rather than retire like most after the reaper wars, her natural drive kept her going, keeping the genetic masterpiece perpetually occupied in some form of mission. After the dissolution of Cerberus, Miranda kept busy by taking on freelance work, picking up odd jobs from whichever rich asshole paid the most. Recently however, things were taking a bit of a turn for the worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last mission she was on went up in flames quite literally. She always had an idea of what molten steel would do to a person, but she wasn\u2019t ready to see it first hand on a hostage rescue. Needless to say, nobody was rescued that day. To add fuel to the fire, Jack was dating her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought it was an out of season April Fool\u2019s joke when she first heard the rumors. After a bit of digging they turned out to be true. It sent her into a fit of frozen rage. Miranda spent a solid week and a half planning on how to ruin Jack\u2019s pitiful fucking life. She fantasized how sweet it would be to see her cold calculating plans come to fruition. And she would have done it too, if she hadn\u2019t gotten this invite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked the mansion up and down, a soaring whistle escaped her lips. This must be the place. She looked back down at her Omni-tool to double check the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.0;\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cnavy\">RECIPIENT | Miranda Lawson<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVER CODE | JBX-850-217-495<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSENDER | Eileen Shepard | Former Alliance Commander<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeard you were near Sol and decided to shoot you a quick an invitation to stay with us for a week or so. I understand you still keep busy working these days, so if you come, feel free to leave whenever you need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard, but since retiring, Liara and I have gained quite a bit of weight, which is a severe understatement if anything. Aside from that, we\u2019ve also acquired some new real estate, though Liara still has yet to divulge how. You know how she is. So far the place has been a paradise on earth, but I guess you\u2019ll just have to see it for yourself. We have plenty of guest bedrooms on the upstairs wing if you decide to come. Our address is <span class=\"cmaroon\">[REDACTED]</span>, it's about an hour or so away if you drive in from <span class=\"cmaroon\">[REDACTED]</span>. It\u2019s the only house in our little mountain valley.

Definitely the place. The ornate front door looked big enough to fit two elephants side by side.  Strange. Regardless, what mattered right now was seeing her old friends, maybe even enjoy some time to herself for once. Deciding not to think much of it, she stepped towards the doorbell and pressed. The bells rang their ancient song made of deep, droning bongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a few more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the hell were they? As if to answer, she heard a muffled shout from inside. \u201cJust a minute!\u201d Miranda stood idly once more as her patience was tested. Finally with a slow and heavy creaking, the doorway opened. Who was there to greet her?</span></div></div>",

Miss Liara T'Soni is currently in the pool section out back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the process? You make it sound like it's an arduous task for her to get dressed.\" Miranda chuckled as she strode into the house, pausing to admire the admittedly stunning decor. \"You said the pool's out back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, right this way Miss Lawson,\" the robot cheerily replied, leading her through ornate glass doors and passageways, all of them suspiciously wide and spacious, until the mountain breeze brushed against her cheek as she stepped out into the back area. \"Would you perhaps care for a refreshment, Miss Lawson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I am rather parched,\" Miranda admitted. \"Perhaps a hard lemonade?\" The robot tottered off towards the other end of the pool area complete its mission as Liara looked around the pool area. Her father had an expensive mansion of his own and an elaborate pool out back, but this might have given him a run for his money. The pool itself was massive, big enough to hold an entire house on its own, curved and carved into the decorative marbled surface of the pool area. Miranda stepped forward and dipped her hand into the crystal clear water, gently rippling in the breeze; the water was cool and pleasant to the touch, and invited her to take the plunge and relax. Resisting this urge, Miranda looked up to the decorative palm trees lining the edge of the pool area, arranged above comically large deck chairs alongside the pool (were they meant to be seating for three or more people?), leading her gaze towards a small shack where the LOKI was dutifully preparing drinks at a small station bedecked with food and beverage preparation equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda hated to admit it, but she was impressed. This place had everything she expected, except perhaps a Jacuzzi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, wait, there it was, in front of the shack. She didn't see it because of that thing inside of it. What was that anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's eyes widened as she realized the large shape inside the Jacuzzi wasn't a something...it was a someone. A damned big someone. It was clearly an Asari with her back turned, rippling layers of backfat cascading down her sides, flabby cheeks visible from behind her head, and a large beverage clutched in her thick fingers. Her arms were so meaty that they hung down and brushed the surface of the water...or they would have if this woman wasn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell no wonder Miranda couldn't see the Jacuzzi at first; this Asari seemed to be filling it, pushing the water up to the rim of the Jacuzzi where it spilled out when she slightly shifted her very impressive weight. The Jacuzzi was made for a whole group of people, and she filled it so thoroughly that Miranda probably couldn't fit with her comfortably in there! The ex-Cerberus agent had seen some abnormal people in her time, including a few overweight ones...but this one might have just surpassed them all. And she was using Liara's pool! Where WAS Liara anyway? Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...no, impossible. This had to be someone else. She couldn't have...no, it was utterly inconceivable! This was some obese hog trying to mooch off of Shepard and Liara's possessions! That was the only real answer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Miranda demanded, storming up. The immensely obese Asari jumped, or rather wobbled briefly for a moment, turning around and lifting her sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Miranda?\" she said, her voice thick and husky. \"I didn't know you arrived yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stared and stared, looking past the chins arranged in layers below a dainty mouth, past the breasts bigger then her head held in place by a bikini top that could hold a circus underneath it. She...she recognized the eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, er,\" Liara meandered awkwardly. \"Shepard DID say we put on a few, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Define...\" Miranda said, tight-lipped. \"...a FEW.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Few....hundred...\" the Asari said, guiltily sipping her drink. \"Maybe like...ten...hundred?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Liara....<i><b>you're filling the Jacuzzi!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara wondered to herself if there was anyone from the old team that wouldn't shout at her when the discovered how huge she was. The blubbery Asari certainly wasn't ashamed for her size, but after a while the overreactions did get a bit demoralizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, before Miranda could further overreact (or rather react very appropriately considering what was discovered), the pair were joined by...</span></div></div>",

An always cute face swallowed up by an intertube of fat so heavy her eyes had narrowed. Stack after stack after stack of deeply split fat rolls thick enough for Miranda to lose her arm in up to the elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I mean, not a house,' Liara tried to shrug, a stunted gesture that sent ripples through her water bed body, 'a shed maybe...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can you even stand up anymore!?' Miranda demanded, the shapely spy unable to turn away from the lard stuffed blue berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your lemonade Miss Lawson,' the LOKI purred again, louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I can walk if someone helps me up a bit,' Liara admitted bashfully, and Miranda wasn't sure if her former squad mate was horrified of being barely mobile or that she was still able to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is intolerable!

She snatched the lemonade and drank it down in one swift gulp, putting it down on the tray with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't gain a thousand pounds from that!' Miranda yelled at her, shaking her head, 'you just...ughhh...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's head was dizzy. She wasn't really certain what she'd been so angry about....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we started liking the weight we were putting on and wanted to gain more,' the Asari wide load admitted, 'so we started using some supplements...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Supplements?' Miranda wheezed, shivering as she felt colder and colder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A special recipe...,' the Asari almost paled as she realized that the LOKIs made every beverage, snack and meal with a lacing of the stuff, 'actually now that I think of it, are you feeling okay?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm a little cold...,' Miranda admitted, shivering despite her tight body suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why don't you climb in here,' Liara suggested, patting the minimal space her bean bag body didn't take up, 'and warm up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perfect brunette didn't hesitate, unzipping her cat suite and revealing a gloriously pale and slim body, from her hard dancers thighs to her sculpted, bulging pillow buns bulging out of her thong to her chiseled waistline to her full, bouncing DD cup breasts surging in their black lace cups. Her ivory skin was covered in goose pimples and she shivered, lips turning blue as her metabolism faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't have a swim suit,' she shivered, teeth shattering, 'do you mind?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its nothing I haven't seen before,' the Asari said, 'hop on in.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda plopped in, her shivers slowing as the warm water soaked over her. Forgetting any hesitation she leaned into the bulging Asari's fat rolls, hugging her tight for any residual warmth. A long, loud growl came from her hard belly, so violent it vibrated across Liara's mountainous fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you okay?' Liara asked, horribly worried and wondering how'd she break the news to Miranda that her metabolism was now utterly wrecked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's perfect faced looked at her, suddenly utterly serious, 'Give me food.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Miranda I have to tell you, I think you've been drugged with those supplements,' Liara tried to warn her.</span></div></div>",

Even the tone was unlike her, short and clipped but with the human woman gently stroking the side of Liara's massive flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooood morning, my big and beautiful blue sunflower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a particularly cheesy pet name and footsteps that shook the ground, Shepard at last made her appearance outside, dressed in a one-piece of enormous size that held her massive knee-covering belly into a pleasingly round shape. Taking massive, waddling steps towards the Jacuzzi with her improbably thick legs, Shepard reached one of her arms up to her face to lick the pancake syrup still stuck to them from one of her many breakfasts, her bingo wings draping over her engorged chest. Giving a great shuddering gasp of pleasure at the taste, Shepard looked down in surprise at the unexpected guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda! I didn't know you were here!\" Shepard said delightedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard! Hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry!\" Miranda declared, standing up and not caring that she was in her underwear in front of her hosts. \"Give me food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...the LOKI's can bring you anything you want. Just ask,\" Liara interjected. Miranda immediately splashed her way out of the pool and ran over to the nearest robot, rattling off an impressive list of entrees as a pair of robots joined the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, glad to know she's loosened up a bit,\" Shepard laughed, idly running her hands up and down her love handles before making one ponderous turn and heading for the pool, giving Liara just a moment to herself to observe her handiwork. Shepard, transformed from an athletic action hero to a bloated pile of blubber, hopelessly addicted to food and loving every second of it, and Miranda, newly hooked on the same substance and excitedly marching towards the same goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, it was easier when she just fantasized about turning her crushes into the fattest beings in the universe. Not in the sense that it was hard to get them to such a state, but the fact that Liara just couldn't set aside her moral quandaries to do so. It was so nonsensical; she happily sent out orders back in the old days that got people killed, intentionally or not, and she never lost a night's sleep over it, and yet fattening up Shepard and Miranda sent her into an existential crisis? Shepard LIKED getting fat, Liara tried to reason with herself. They made that decision together. And Miranda? Sure, she didn't consent to it, but she wouldn't be upset about it, and this was all to help Jack be together with Ori, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara gave a heavy, melancholy sigh. Maybe a snack would help lift her spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver lining to all of this was that Liara's plan did in fact work. After a month in the mansion, Miranda didn't care about Jack dating her sister anymore. Liara even broached the subject, and the same woman who flew into a rage and threatened bloody murder at the mere idea of Jack and Oriana being a couple merely shrugged and asked when the next serving of dinner was coming. Food was in fact the only thing that seemed to occupy Miranda's thoughts nowadays; the week she meant to spend at the mansion stretched on and on and on, and she didn't seem awfully interested in saying goodbye any time soon. That would have meant missing a meal, after all, and no one was doing that nowadays, least of all Liara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumbering her way into the lounge on bloated feet the size of dinner plates, the Asari finished off the oversized sub sandwich she was devouring and readily took a second from the attending robot that wasn't there to help her move. She hadn't stopped eating since waking this morning, though frankly it felt like she hadn't stopped eating for the past few weeks. Watching what was happening to Miranda made her feel guilty, and that feeling bled over into making her feel guilty about what she did to Shepard, and as her moral justifications and excuses failed one after another, she resorted to stuffing her face to try and drown the feeling of guilt with something pleasurable. It only really succeeded in making her balloon ever faster then she already was, and for what was in all likelihood the fattest Asari in recorded history, that was saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the assistance of the robots and a little biotics on the side, it was miraculous that she could still move. Her face was on the verge of being overwhelmed by her perpetually stuffed cheeks and her mass of neck fat, a mass that since swallowing up her excess double chins has since doubled itself and was the only thing keeping her head from sinking into the mass of blubber that consumed her shoulders and upper arms. Her breasts had long since outgrown letters, held up from collapsing down her front by a custom-made shirt that was more of an incredibly oversized bra by the time it arrived, but even they didn't reach out as far as her belly, blooming out in front of her and reaching within inches of brushing along the ground. And her rear end? Well, she crushed the couch long ago, but you couldn't tell because if she sat on the ground, she was still at the same height from when she still used the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara proved that when she gave a great heaving step towards the former location of the couch and plopped herself down, her mass breaking out in a tremendous wobble. Licking her fingers clean from the sandwich she finished, she was only just able to ignore how thick and heavy they felt, like she was wearing several thick protective gloves at a time, or how the fat on her arms was swallowing them whole. In the back of her head, she wondered if she had finally soared past two thousand pounds at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the....huff...goddess...I'm so....oohhhh....\" Liara moaned. \"Feed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robots sprung into action, arriving with plates upon plates of delicacies to feed to their master. Obediently opening her mouth, Liara let the robots roughly and forcibly stuff her, too lazy to even lift her arms to do the same action anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gorging herself, heavy footfalls and rattling windows told her someone particularly large was approaching, and turning her gaze towards the shadow in the doorway, Liara saw it was...</span></div></div>",

The serum was designed to introduce slight changes over a long period of time. A new neural pathway here, a tweak of metabolism there, and so on.

With an idle hand she rubbed her bloated stomach. The same t-shirt and sweatpants Shepard and Liara once wore at her size clung to her burgeoning form which, now stretched and stained from over-use, did nothing to hide her drooping belly. True to her genetics, the weight was distributed in a notably hourglass trend, though her derriere took authority over her impressive mammaries.

Sure the robots had been programmed to stop at the raise of her hand, but lifting her thick appendages seemed like too much effort right now.

A few more and she forgot Miranda was even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few ponderous steps Miranda made her way towards the sofa Jack once occupied, dropping her rear into the distinct Miranda-shaped slump. \u201cOuf\u2026 Still... Hungry\u2026. Ugh... Food... now.\u201d Her voice was dull and lifeless as ever. At her command the LOKI mechs lept into action, delivering a seemingly endless stream of calorie packed platters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara heard Miranda\u2019s voice and was reminded of her presence. With some effort she raised her fat encased hand and put her feast on pause, taking a moment to chew and swallow before speaking. \u201cMiranda\u2026\u201d Miranda grunted, far too occupied to even look up from her feast. \u201cMiranda?\u201d This time she didn\u2019t even acknowledge her. \u201cMIRANDA!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d the ex-cerberus op shouted, clearly upset to have her meal interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...

Since arriving, Miranda hadn\u2019t said so much as a word to either Liara or Miranda, and while it wasn\u2019t a full on conversation, it was enough to make Liara happy.

She took a few moments to chew and swallow a mouthful of something luxuriously cheesy before pausing to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a clearer mind, she pondered the issue at hand. Just getting out of bed in the morning has become an extensive process taking upwards of half an hour. Sure the most obvious answer would be to lose some weight, but that didn\u2019t seem feasibly possible at this state. Why did fat have to be so damn heavy? Liara wished she could fight against the ever-present shackles of gravity, but alas, you can\u2019t just change something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a moment\u2026 Yes you can. Still driven by her spark of genius, she asked her mechanical servants for a comms pad. The mechs dutifully handed her one of her old communication devices, able to reach even the darkest reaches of the galaxy in a moment\u2019s notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, goddess damn this thing\u2026\u201d Navigating the homescreen was fairly easy for literally anyone other than Liara. Her fat encased fingers felt far more like thickly padded gloves rather than the nimble appendages they once were. Doing something as simple as opening her directory was hopelessly impossible. \u201cDAMMIT!\u201d Her patience was being visibly tested at this point, when a small speech bubble was projected in a hologram form before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018[Would you like to enable voice commands?]\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said with a heavy sigh. \u201cOpen directory SBF 03...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will our story take us next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Rotund Reunion: An old friend from the Normandy swings by to install the gravity mods.

At worst, they fell face first into the hedonistic indulgence alongside them. It was why she got most things done nowadays with a fleet of drones, on top of the obvious limitations of their extreme size. It wasn't shame; Liara was not ashamed of how obscenely massive she was and even found it interesting at times, perhaps even a little...exciting. Maybe it was just that it was exhausting to explain the circumstances of why she and Shepard were hovering around one ton each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, setting up gravity mods is not a task suited for robot hands. Fluctuations in gravity were nothing to sneeze at, and if something went wrong, someone could go sailing through the air or get pulled through the floor, to say nothing of the possibility of collapsing the whole building. This needed an expert's hand, an expert whom Liara would not enjoy dropping a one ton bombshell on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018[Please select a contact.]\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara sighed, ordering the communication device to scroll through the names on the list until she spotted the one she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere we go, she thought to herself...</span></div></div>",

The vague, static holographic shape that resembled Tali seemed to tilt its head curiously. Liara was grateful for this quirk of long-term communication; Tali wouldn't be able to see how huge Liara was. \"We're...uh...having trouble moving around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this something to do with what those tabloids have been saying about you two?\" Tali asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not,\" Liara said dismissively. \"I...wait, what are the tabloids saying exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, I'm sure it's just pointless speculative gossip. You can't really be <i>that</i> much bigger than...hmm, well it doesn't matter. In any case, if you're looking for low-grav generators I have something that may help.\" There was a transmission of data, and Liara poured over the schematics, somehow managing to scroll through these instructions with her overly-sized hands. Odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...have to say, I'm impressed,\" Liara admitted. \"This is more solidly constructed then what I had in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's derived from a new device a lot of us are using in our new homes,\" Tali explained. \"And let me tell you, it's a LOT easier to install artificial gravity gens on a building then on a spaceship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When can you come over to complete the installation with all the specifications I asked for?\" Liara asked, pushing the question of why the Quarians would need gravity generators in their homes to the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can swing by in a few days, we're bringing a few of the old Flotilla ships to an alliance shipyard for some retrofitting into proper vessels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara sighed, letting her exhausted arm flop down onto her side. \"I can't even begin to tell you how grateful I am that you're able to make this for us, Tali. I am in your debt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, make me a nice big dinner when I get there and we'll call it even,\" Tali chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Tali said she'd be here any minute, right?\" Shepard asked, sitting across from her blob of a girlfriend in the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara nodded mutely, unable to speak through the pair of Loki's guiding a never-ending stream of food into her mouth. Still incredibly anxious about Tali seeing her like this, Liara had done little over the last few days besides eat and sleep, rarely leaving the cushion in the foyer that replaced the old sofa. Not that she needed it, considering how her jelly belly spread across the floor and her thick legs pooled beneath her, to say nothing of the two massive \"cushions\" in the back she had to rest on. After a couple minutes of this, she finally found the strength to wave off the attending feeder bots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a moment...too soon...\" Liara huffed, completely exhausted. She could feel it by now, that she was days away from losing any semblance of mobility. Frankly it was a miracle she even got this far after growing over a ton, as much of a miracle as the tent-like shirt that managed to cover her modesty. Even Shepard, rapidly closing in on a ton herself, managed to find clothes that were somewhat presentable easier then she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn reflection, Shepard just seemed to be taking the extreme weight better then she was, probably because she didn't have a guilty conscience to drown with gluttony. Sure she was massive, threatening to blow the arms off the three seater sofa she squeezed into, but she could still feed herself, and didn't need as much help walking and carrying that girth around, even as her bulging belly bounced on the ground after a good feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope...she's accepting...\" Liara continued, trying to catch her breath after the intense gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, she knew we were getting big,\" Shepard reminded her. \"Sure maybe not an exact number, but we've never LIED to her about what we're doing here. Like you always said, just kick back and enjoy retirement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara smiled slightly. \"Yeah...kick back and enjoy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god she's going to freak out,\" Liara snapped out of her cool in seconds. \"This was a terrible idea, I don't need to move so much that it traumatizes my friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone let her in!\" Shepard said to the robots before turning to her big nervous blueberry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously believe that?\" Liara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>thud...thud...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it babe,\" Shepard teased. \"Just be cool about it, and Tali will be cool. I mean, it's Tali we're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>thud...thud...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Liara assured herself. \"Same old Tali, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>thud...thud...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same old....Tali....\" Shepard trailed off, listening closely. \"Do you hear something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel something,\" Liara pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew....\" a third tinny Quarian voice echoed out. \"Sorry I'm late you two had to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali audibly gasped at the sight in front of her. Liara, ashamed, looked away at the sound of Tali's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Keelah</i>...what happened to you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain, Tali,\" Liara offered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain? What's there to explain? This is <i><b>amazing</b></i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara, surprised, turned to look at Shepard, who had her jaw hanging open in shock. Liara shifted her girth again to look at Tali, and her jaw joined Shepard's on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit design was Tali's. Liara recognized the purple swirls anywhere. It just so happened to color the biggest enviro-suit she had ever seen in her life. The familiar helmet had doubled in width, sinking into a sea of shoulder fat that matched the sleeves of the suit filled like sausage casings, with dents where the elbows were and the thick-three fingered hand sinking into the wrist. Perfectly round breasts bobbed in front of her, dwarfing the size of Tali's helmet and resting inches above a huge double belly, squeezed against the suit's fabric so that a cavernous belly button was visible. Racks of love handles bulged from her sides as they flowed down to her hips and thighs, which despite flaring out to the sides wider then her enormous belly, couldn't block her gigantic rear end from being seen from the front. Liara half expected to see cracks forming under her portly feet, nearly being swallowed by her calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, Tali was fat. Monstrously fat. Almost as fat as Liara was weeks ago, before Jack showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I was, worried how you'd react to seeing me this size!\" Tali giggled nervously, rubbing her hands down her flowing thighs. \"I had no idea you two were even bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BRAAAAP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn timing that almost seemed comedic, Miranda waddled her way out of the kitchen, food stains running down her face as she stuffed it full of potato chips from an oversized bag. Coming to a dead stop at the sight of Tali, now notably fatter then even the five hundred point, food addicted secret agent, the sight was enough to make Miranda's single-minded obsession with food slip for just  a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell...and I thought <i>I</i> let myself go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext stop on this wild ride...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What's Up With the Weight:</b> Tali explains the backstory behind her ultra-obesity, and why she's so excited about it, as she finishes up with the gravity generators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cheerleader on the Rebound:</b> Uh oh...the shock from seeing Tali wasn't a temporary thing. Miranda is coming back to her senses, and she's NOT going to be happy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>My Ideas Are Better (Free Choice):</b> I'll be slightly hurt if you pick this one, but with the right therapy I think I can come to forgive you. </span></div></div>",

Liara didn't even move to stop the mechs as they automatically resumed feeding her after Tali waddled off into the back to work, chewing and swallowing on instinct as she continued her thousand-yard stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First us, then Miranda, and now Tali,\" Shepard commented, lowering her bulk into a sagging loveseat across from Liara's cusion and taking one end of link of sausages that one of her LOKI's looped around its neck, beginning to swallow them down one after the other. \"Don't you just love retirement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali's not retired though, she's an acting admiral and a leader in the Quarian rebuilding effort on Rannoch,\" Miranda pointed, uncharacteristically stopping herself from devouring a pastry in a messy fashion to speak clearly. \"I did not even think Quarians could get fat, let alone to THAT size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to....*glomph*...be a way....*urmph*...to ask her....*burrf*....tactfully....\" Shepard panted, swallowing one sausage link after another as she fed it down her throat like a rope on a winch. \"Liara honey, think you can turn on that old charm and find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAAAAAAAAARP...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the conversation lapse to eat, naturally, the three ladies became so engrossed with their food that they almost didn't notice Tali waddling over to the floor tiles next to Liara, dutifully followed by a helper drone with an omni-tool suite to match the one Tali sported. Bending over to remove the floor and presumably insert a grav generator, the Asari enjoyed an eyeful of the Quarian's enormous rear, her suit audibly creaking as it strained to keep cheeks that could have easily filled up the sofa Liara crushed under her mass a month ago. The Asari's mouth went dry at the dirty thoughts springing into her head, so she tried to quell them by breaking the ice as opposed to the furniture. After a few moments of blissful stuffing, Liara lifted her hand weakly to halt the endless march of food so she could chew the fat, so to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...uh....\" Liara huffed. \"Those seem...small...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small, but powerful!\" Tali insisted, straightening up at a steady, even pace. \"These are derived from the artificial gravity generators we had on the migrant fleet, perfect for when space is a limited commodity. And not to make judgements, but I think that you would appreciate that notion.\" Reaching out, Tali slapped the side of the giant Asari's exposed belly, sending out a rippling wave of blubber from the hit and knocking loose a small belch, making Tali giggle and Liara turn slightly purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's certainly less reserved then she was nine hundred or so pounds ago.</i> Liara thought to herself as Tali produced a couple of rings, somewhat resembling the device used to project omni-tools. \"Anyway, I think the generators are all set, these mini-tools have a remote connection you can use to adjust gravity higher or lower. They're flexible, so you can just stretch it around your hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good...\" Liara said, noting that she could have barely fit a couple fingers through the device at its normal size. She almost said something about probably not being able to reach her arm with her other hand, but Tali solved the issue by stepping forward to snap it on it for her, despite the impressive amount of blubber on Liara's forearms, it fit neatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave this a lot of thought, I see,\" Miranda commented, attaching her own wrist device herself as Shepard only just managed to reach past her flabby front to slip the device on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's become sort of a necessity, between the end of rationing, the economic boom, and the Geth helping to automate the labor intensive work on Rannoch,\" Tali explained. \"Our species is getting heavier at an astonishing rate, necessitating devices to help us manage it. I'd have been pinned underneath myself a long time ago if it weren't for these.\" Tali gestured to her chubby legs, which Liara noticed seemed to have devices similar to the ones Tali was installing underneath the floor attached to her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...alarming,\" Shepard suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alarming? It's incredible!\" Tali retorted. \"There's finally enough food to go around, and our people are prospering instead of starving! It's something I'd never thought I'd see in my lifetime!\" She tenderly rubbed her huge flanks with one hand. \"I...never thought I'd get to experience the sensation of being full, of being stuffed senseless, not just having enough to eat, but having TOO much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Miranda interjected. \"So...all this happened because you WANTED it to happen?\" Liara and Shepard winced at Miranda's blunt question but Tali didn't seem to mind. Far from it, she seemed practically giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course I wanted it!\" the Quarian declared with unrestrained glee. \"Look at all of this fat, so soft and round and warm...I wanted more of it the moment I realized I had it! I wanted to grow so big I needed a new suit, to waddle instead of walking, to crush things under my weight when I sit down!\" Burning through a few last-minute calculations, she drew herself closer to Liara, or as close as their respective bulks would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still remember waking up one day...and not being able to get up,\" Tali said, her voice trembling with excitement. \"<i>Keelah</i>, I could have died right there and it would be next to heaven. I had to install some of these gravity generators to function of course, but to be honest...I like it better when they're off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, well...I'd like to be able to move about a little bit easier, personally,\" Liara said, trying to force a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't knock it til you try it!\" Tali said gleefully. \"That's how the human phrase goes, right Shepard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>BUUUUUURP</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take that as a yes.\" Tali took a moment to double check all the systems, then looked over at Liara excitedly. \"Everything's set up, booting the grav drives now, you'll be able to feel the change in three....two....one...!\"</span></div></div>",

A fluttery sensation swept through the mansion\u2019s residents like that of a quickly descending elevator. As Liara took a sharp breath, she noticed a great weight was lifted from her chest. Her breathing felt lighter, easier, airier. Lifting a lardy arm high above her head, it felt as if the fat deposits were filled with air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeels weird at first, right?\u201d Tali noted through her thick accent. \u201cYou get so used to that heavy feeling that it almost feels wrong to be light again, like your fat is just fluff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to admit Tali, I\u2019m damn well impressed!\u201d Shepard said, rising to her feet as if it were nothing. She twisted back and forth with audible pops coming from her spine. Reaching her arms into the air, she pulled an effortless plantar flexion. Liara noted how Shepard\u2019s fat had much less sag than it used to, almost like she was floating in water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of fat on Liara\u2019s body was no longer like lugging around sacks of weight, but more like wearing an immense suit made of foam cushions that restricted her body\u2019s full range of motion. With an awkward struggle, Liara lifted herself off of the floor and onto her feet and felt light as air. Over two thousand pounds of flab and it felt like she hadn\u2019t gained an ounce. It felt... wrong. \u201cI see what you mean now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese little saviors are Personal Gravity Devices, or PGS for short,\u201d she explained, motioning to her own wristband. \u201cThey link up to the grav drives installed to your floor and adjust your body\u2019s weight as requested. Just personal preference, but I try not to dip beneath a few hundred pounds or I tend to feel all floaty. Kinda like that,\u201d Tali suggested as she watched Shepard test her mobility. The ex-commander was now leaping several feet into the air to do jumping jacks while Miranda bound around like she was on the moon. Their flab rippled like watery waves with every motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara lifted a wrist above her billowing breasts to look at her PGD and adjusted until she was at a comfortable weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really owe you one Tali,\" Shepard said. \"I know you're needed back at the Flotilla but you'd be welcome to stay if you'd like.\"</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, they were friendly faces, though one of them was rather reluctant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, this is a bad idea,\" Jack insisted, bouncing nervously on her heels as she traipsed up the front steps. \"Like, do you seriously need to tell her in person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, she's my sister!\" Oriana said, admonishing her lover. \"And yes you're coming with me, we're telling her together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...fine but... you know she's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know she's gotten fat, J,\" Oriana continued. \"I've been talking with Shepard about some Reaper tech, remember? I know that they're all massive at this point, so if you're worried about me being shocked or something-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, relief echoed across Jack's face as she was relieved of the burden of bringing up the elephant in the room, or rather, the three elephants in the mansion. \"Well, honestly,\" Jack said with a sly grin. Now I'm worried about how well you're taking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a designer baby who managed to live through an attempt to wipe out all life in the galaxy by a race of giant robot squids\" Oriana said bluntly. \"Seeing someone who weighs a ton at this point is just quaint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Jack shrugged. \"Let's just spring the news and jet, I need to get some grading done when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to stay and have a bite?\" Oriana winked as she rapped gently on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har har,\" Jack said sarcastically, though with a little ghost of a grin on her face. \"Bet you'd love to see this ass getting bigger, wouldn't you?\" Jack wiggled her skinny tush up against Oriana's hip, quickly pulling herself away when the door suddenly turned and opened, revealing the obedient little LOKI bot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Jack and Miss Lawson,\" the robot chirped. \"Please, come in. The mistresses are in the back with the Admiral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get my sister, please?\" Oriana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, madam, she's right in the front kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two milled about waiting for the robot to return, Jack felt a weird mixture of nervous and excited anticipation. Miranda being a fat slob was a hilarious mental image and would probably make her day, but Jack still remembered why she needed Liara and Shepard to distract her in the first place. To say Miranda was upset about Jack dating her beloved sister behind her back for quite some time was an understatement, and it was frankly a miracle that the hugely obese blobs that were her former teammates had kept Miranda's belly full enough that the ex-Cerberus operative didn't burst through her window and try to atomize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was shaken from her thoughts by heavy footsteps coming from the kitchen along with the sounds of chewing and swallowing, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIRI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriana ran over and jumped on her big sister, sinking her knee into the belly hiding Miranda's legs as she wrapped her arms around Miranda's neck, a tricky feat considering she had to reach across her massive breasts to do so. Handing her hoagie off to the robot, Miranda wrapped her arms as best she could around her sister as well, somewhat hampered by how thick the fat blocking her elbows were. Jack let out a little snort but hid her amusement at the whale Miranda well, clearly close to or surpassing a quarter ton at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look, uh, great!\" Oriana said, a little falter in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel great!\" her big sister said happily, her chin tripling as she let out a hearty burp that made Oriana wince. Smiling, Miranda turned to Jack. \"Hi Jack, nice to see you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi,\" Jack replied, awkwardly waving her hand. She was kind of surprised at how...uneventful it was. Maybe she'd not only been distracted, but had changed since she last saw her former frenemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, there's something I want to tell you about us, Miri,\" Oriana said excitedly, squirming in her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm?\" Miranda said, retrieving her hoagie and taking a big bite out of it, scratching the back of her flabby calf briefly with her foot. Glancing over at Jack, something seemed to itch at the back of her mind about the tattooed punk, something critically important...like she was an important relation. Liara's formula had done its job well though, and Miranda, while suspicious, remained clueless. The former information broker knew where to get the best equipment after all, and it'd truly take something monumental to shock Miranda back to her old self. Something like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this!\" Oriana said, holding her hand out. Miranda looked closer and spotted something new; a platinum white ring around her finger. \"Jack, show her yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack uncrossed her arms and held her left hand up, revealing a similarly colored band on hers. Miranda glanced between the two, her food-addled brain working furiously as Oriana stepped back and took Jack's hand in her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is...?\" Miranda faltered, the corner of her mouth twitching slightly and her hand gripping the sub tighter and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an engagement riiiing!\" Oriana practically sang. \"We're getting MARRIED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's facial tic froze as she looked over at Jack, who smiled weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Jack Lawson has a nice ring to it,\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the words 'Jack Lawson', something inside Miranda's head snapped, and she smiled her sweetest smile yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one that always preceded someone getting murdered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well I did need to get back to the fleet,\" Tali said, mulling over Shepard and Liara's offer. \"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation was cut off by a bloody shriek, and a loud thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Shepard said, touching back down on Earth after playing around with the gravity, her fat falling down around her like a puffy dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounded like Miranda!\" Liara realized. \"Was there something wrong with the gravity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Tali insisted, double-checking her omni-tool. \"There should be an alarm if the PGD fails, and everything's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara lumbered towards the front entrance, her unused leg joints popping and creaking even as the gravity generator helped her manage her tremendous tonnage. Leading the way like a big blue wrecking ball, Liara emerged in the front entrance to...MIranda, sitting on the floor looking rather stone-faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda, what happened?\" Shepard called out, coming up second in the trio. There was a groan and Shepard saw Orianna get up from next to the side table, where she appeared to have been thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Shepard!\" Miranda said in an unusually bright, sing-song tone. Spotting the Quarian bringing up the rear, she smiled even wider. \"Oh, Tali! I'm so glad you made this gravity generator work in reverse! I really wanna bust RIGHT through the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the three quickly realized why, because underneath her enormous pale ass...was Jack, gasping for breath and turning blue, crushed underneath the Cerberus cheerleader's immense girth which was only getting heavier as Miranda played with the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...off...me...lard...aaah!\" Jack gasped, her panicked breathing becoming shorter and shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, one ton!\" Miranda said happily. \"This outta do it!\" She reached for the control again but Shepard, as always, took action, jumping forward and thrusting her massive belly out. Miranda's eyes bugged out as she was caught unawares and belly-bumped right off of Jack, collapsing in a heap next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane?!?\" Shepard said. \"You're gonna fucking kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda sat back up, blinking in confusion. \"I...was going to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack coughed, her face changing from blue to bright red as her lungs worked furiously to bring oxygen back. Oriana ran back to her fiance to hold her hand, glaring daggers at her older sister. Miranda's hatred of Jack had indeed come back, but in that brief moment of bloodlust, bottled up by the chemical-induced gluttony inflicted on her by Liara, it seemed to have burned itself out remarkably fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm sorry, Ori,\" Miranda said. \"I...really don't know what came over me.\" She looked so guilty that even Oriana felt her feelings soften somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to apologize to the woman you just nearly crushed to death!\" Tali interjected, crossing her arms like a disappointed parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was calmed down, and refreshed with a little snack, Shepard sat down the Lawsons and Jack in a circle, an impromptu mediation as it were. Liara's sobering presence was barely needed; with Jack nearly suffocated under an enormous rear end and Miranda feeling guilty about almost doing that suffocating, both were receptive to talking, and with Oriana they aired out their grievances, talking for nearly a couple hours. It was a conversation a long time in the making, and for the first time, an encounter between Jack and Miranda was ended amicably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this was really productive, I think,\" Shepard said, sucking down a gallon of milkshake rather loudly. \"So, last thoughts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me,\" Oriana said at once. \"Miri, I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you from the start, I should have told you about me and Jack long ago, and I apologize for letting it get this far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda nodded. \"And I apologize for letting my emotions get the better of me,\" she said coolly. \"And while I don't...\" she began, but cut herself off following some urgent looks from the others. \"And...I trust your decisions, and I want you to do what will make you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at last, Jack spoke up. \"Okay...then I'm sorry for jerking you around like I was doing too. I was an asshole for sneaking around with your sister behind your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a rather forced smile, their animosity still not quite tempered, and probably not for quite some time. At long last, Miranda held out a hand, and Jack firmly took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take good care of her,\" Miranda said succinctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" Jack promised. Orianna let out a small sigh and moved closer to Jack, squeezing her around the waist and nestling her head against Jack's. Miranda took a deep breath, and held her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we standing around for?\" Shepard declared. \"It sounds like we have an engagement to celebrate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the robots start preparing a feast, then,\" Miranda declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't do that already?\" Tali joked, prompting billowing belly laughs from the obese squadmates as they began their pendulous waddling towards the dining area, long abandoned after Liara and Shepard had been rendered immobile. Jack stood up to follow but found herself stop, pulling back by the wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One quick thing, J,\" Oriana said, drawing in closer. \"I couldn't help but notice...when my sister, well, sat on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes?\" Jack responded with caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you seemed flustered when she got off and you could breath again,\" Oriana suggested, noting how Jack froze, biting her lip as she recalled the incident. \"Last time I saw you that...well, it would have probably prompted a reaction from my sister at the time, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what you mean,\" Jack said, playing dumb,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaaack...\" Oriana teased. \"You LIKED that, didn't you?\" Jack's face immediately flushed, and Oriana looked triumphant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-don't know what you mean,\" Jack repeated herself, looking side to side as if for an escape route. Oriana thwarted any such maneuver by holding onto her arms and keeping her there, drawing so close that Jack could feel the puff of her breath on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, admit it. When my fat sister sat on you...you really liked it, the feeling of all...that...<i>weight...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack snarled, her defenses shattered upon being called out. \"Well...so what? I..I...er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriana reached over to the table, picking up a small cookie, the same laced with that fattening chemical, that had been leftover after a binge session earlier, and stuck it into-</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t the same knee-buckling reaction Miranda had to the serum, but the Lawson felt a tingling jolt coarse through her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I could eat these all day. Imagine that... you could be my skinny little slut, fetching me as many calories as you want to fill me with, and I\u2019ll be all yours at the end of the night.\u201d Oriana stuck out her waist for emphasis, caressing her slender tummy as she popped another cookie in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack\u2019s mouth went dry as she tried fruitlessly to find any words. \u201cUh- y-yes!\u201d When Oriana first met Jack, she never would have imagined her as the submissive type, but a few weeks into their relationship she discovered the girl\u2019s soft spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA belch sounded from the dining hall followed the commander\u2019s strong voice. \u201cYou guys coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn our way!\u201d they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the dining hall, the engaged couple observed the scene before them. Shepard and Liara were seated across from one another on what looked to be the floor, though truth be told, if there were anything underneath they wouldn\u2019t be able to tell beneath the oceans of flab. The half-ton quarian looked to be seated in a specially designed seat, though the residents of the house knew it to be the sofa Liara once called home, and Miranda was sat back in a reinforced armchair, allowing her gut to hang free from her undersized shirt. The table, it seemed, was more of a formality than of any true function, with the only dishes being Jack and Oriana\u2019s, resting in front of two expensive dining chairs. Rather than feed themselves by hand, (as per usual), everyone was sat back as assembly lines of LOKI mechs laboriously gave them their fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple gave inquiring looks at one another before walking to their chairs, which were oversized for their lithe frames. No wonder everyone here was so big\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plates before them were surprisingly light compared to what everyone else was eating. Only a salad and a glass of wine. Between bites of food, Shepard noticed the puzzled looks on their faces. \u201c*Smack* *munch* If you guysh - *Mmm* *Slurp* - want anyfhing elsh - *Munch* - jusht ashk the mechsh. *UUURRRRP*\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began on their salads, which tasted surprisingly clean compared to the others\u2019 meals. When finished, they sipped on the wine. Jack looked over to Oriana with a new, yet familiar look in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s probably enough for me, but you could probably do with some more.\u201d She turned to one of the mechanized servants. \u201cCould you get her something heavy? Some Lasagna maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin only a minute, the meal was in front of her, steamy, cheesy, and filled with the household\u2019s signature fattening agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, Oriana was ready to burst. Her stomach churned away as the drug worked it\u2019s magic, helping somewhat to soothe the pain and aid digestion. There were still a few bites left over, and Jack slowly teased them into her overstuffed fiancee. The others it seemed, kept on eating without slowing pace, aside from Miranda who was wrapping things up with dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the final bite was down, Oriana let out a satisfied belch as Jack caressed the bulge of her belly. A few moments of rest later and the two stood up from their chairs and prepared to leave, but not without asking the mechs for some sweets for the road. Shepard noticed this and the feast was put on pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dWell Oriana and I are ready to head home, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Jack looked over at Miranda, who looked as if she were a few brain cells short of being functional. The bloated bitch took a moment to process what was going on, but more importantly why her meal had stopped. Miranda\u2019s brain slowly kicked back into gear as she recalled the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was great to see you two again!\u201d Shepard said. \u201cAnd congratulations!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and Liara,\u201d Jack paused, looking at Miri once more before returning her eyes to the blue hostess. \u201cThanks again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara nodded, once more feeling conflicted over whether what she\u2019d done was okay. Perhaps she may never get over it unless she told Miranda directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group said their goodbyes, congratulations, and good wishes as the engaged couple turned to leave the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you guys go...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriana and Jack looked back to the voice. It was Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack\u2026 I- I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked back at the bloated girl, trying hard to ignore the smears of cream and chocolate surrounding her face. It wasn\u2019t an artificial apology, like the one Shepard coerced the girl into during their little meeting. It was heartfelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiranda you- I... I\u2019m sorry too.\u201d Jack stepped towards her new sister-in-law, shared a moment of silence, and hugged the doughy mass before her. Stepping away, they looked at one another with a genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a little something there,\u201d Miranda teased, pointing out some chocolate Jack picked up from their little embrace. They both chuckled, and Jack wiped herself clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack and Oriana left she looked back at Miranda, and found the smile never left her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome seconds later, the sound of the front door closing echoed through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was very sweet of you Miri.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda just sat in silence, pondering her new life and her old. There was just no point being hateful anymore. Miranda smiled at the thought, and felt her stomach ask for something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do hate to change the topic, but I believe you offered to let me stay earlier...\u201d Tali remembered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had her butt gotten so huge that her height didn't change when she sat down? The Quarian felt a surge of carnal emotion at that particular idea but kept it under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I could manage it,\" Tali said happily, patting her expansive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard clapped her hands together. \"Wonderful! We have a room set up for you right away, germ sealed and everything so you won't get sick or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali tilted her head. \"That's...awfully convenient that you have a room like that set up, Shepard.\" She watched Shepard's bloated food-stained cheeks turn pink before breaking the tension with a laugh. \"I'm only joking, I appreciate that you went through the trouble to set it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*BRAAAAP*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep belch echoing from Miranda's mouth grabbed everyone's attention, revealing she had already continued to feast on dessert, chocolate sauce dripping down her chins and flecking over her substantial cleavage. The three much larger girls suddenly remembered that they were nowhere near filled up and quickly joined Miranda in devouring the spread, or rather Tali joined Miranda and the two far larger girls sat back and ordered the robots to continue stuffing themselves senseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tali shoveled cakes and cookies into her stomach, she was thankful for the new addition to her suit, the detachable lower part of her mask that revealed her mouth (and her row of three chins). It had been a godsend for a lot of Quarians who would happily take a immuno-booster every once in a while if it meant eating solid foods, and it had really been a dream come true once Tali discovered her great love for food, stuffing, and her own increasing mass. Sure she could have gotten this far on her old diet of liquid feed, and in all honesty the idea of hooking herself up to a feeding tube that could properly fill her up was kind of hot, but it was interesting to taste all the solid versions of foods that Tali only knew as liquefied before now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay sure she gorged herself so quickly nowadays that she barely got to experience that for more then a few seconds, but it's the thought that counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her fingers clean, Tali's stomach gave off mixed messages of being stuffed and still demanding more. Eager to please, the Quarian reached for a nearby double-layered cake...and stopped, her fingers half a foot away. Confused, she tried reaching again and felt an unpleasant gurgle and a painful sensation from her belly. Looking down, she felt both embarrassed and aroused; her gut was pressing into the table, so bloated and immense that it kept her from reaching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finally gotten too big to feed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Liara,\" Tali said loudly over the messily loud smacks and chews of the Asari. \"How do I order the robots to...give me food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...ask...\" Liara huffed in between swallowing down an obscene amount of ice cream cake being poured into her mouth. \"Smart...little....things...\" She strained to lift one of her bulbous arms and gently brushed her bloated fingers against the chassis of the nearest robot, which might have been the one-ton version of a pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay...robots, can you feed me?\" Tali asked, unsure. She was pleasantly surprised as two mechs sprung from the side room, immediately grabbing the cake that the Quarian reached for and taking large chunks to feed directly into her waiting mouth. This was a new experience for Tali, being fed like this. Sure when she first became aware of her feelings towards obesity and did some research she learned about feedees and feeding, but to experience it firsthand, even from artificial drones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali was going to need some private time when this was all said and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Liara, her belly spilling across the floor and swallowing up the table even better then she was, Tali felt unrepentant glee at the idea of catching up to her size. Only a thousand pounds to go, and she'd be the fattest Quarian in the galaxy, no doubt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh wait, she already was. Well, at least Tali would make sure her title would be very, VERY secure.</span></div></div>",

The moment the genius spy tasted it her tastes changed to consume the simplest, cheapest junk she could get a hold of, both dietary and entertainment wise. Everything else faded away, leaving her to gorge herself on any and all fattening goodies she could get her hands on in the heart attack factory that was Shepard's retirement home and to entertain her dulled wits on trash TV. Day after day after day, she'd shoveled ten or fifteen thousand calories of grease, salt, fat and corn syrup into her mouth while watching soap operas and trashy talk shows, cheering along and laughing at the usually obese, lower class interviewees. She'd gone from wearing designer clothes even to relax to wearing stained, overstretched white undershorts and rapidly shredded granny panties. Her high standards had fallen away and her self importance had crumbled, she barely had an identity anymore and while she was aware of herself gaining a couple pounds a day, of sweating between her room and the kitchen, of her feet disappearing from view of her heart hammering during the dangerous ascent up the stairs to the shower, Miranda's true self was viewing all of this in a dream like haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the day she saw the half ton Quarian that had once been the wide hipped but slender Tali a few months ago. How had she gotten so fat so fast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRusted gears began turning in Miranda's mind as her true personality came to the fore, breaking back into control of herself like a drowning swimming breaking to the surface. The bleary, piggish eyes that had once been able to freeze a man or woman in place blinked and she swallowed a huge mouthful of potato chips, blanching at the disgusting sludge of grease and salt going down her throat. She hated potato chips, they disgusted her taste wise and on a conceptual level, why were they in her mouth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways fast heart rate rising, Miranda angled her head down, feeling layers of chin fat bunch beneath her once modelesque face and seeing the sagging ruins of what had been her torso. Perfect breasts had become flappy, floppy tube socks stuffed with coins, pimples and stretch marks and crumbs scattered across their pendulous cleavage. The trim, strong arms of a scientist and spy had swollen up, a pair of immense, spider vein striated bingo wings giving her lunch lady arms, fast swallowing her wrists and making her greasy fingers thick and clumsy. She dropped the horrible bag of chips they held with a faint shriek and turned to run, panic that this ruined body was her now threatening to overwhelm her recently regained wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore getting trapped in this madhouse, Miranda had run six miles a day, every day and each day it took her exactly thirty six minutes. She made it about ten feet before she had to quit and fall to her knees with a heavy thump, having driven the swollen, cellulite coated lumps that were her legs up to almost four miles an hour. Chest on fire, sweat pouring off of her overheating body, joints screaming, Miranda made herself calm down, taking deep breaths in through her nose and out through her mouth, an old runners trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miri, you alright?\" the literal ton of lard that was the savior of the galaxy said through half of a ham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda ignored her and tried to get up. Thicker than her waist her arms might be, but they were woefully weak and she had to use her biotic powers to get up. Those had crumbled with disuse too and the psychic might that had let her lift a tank was barely enough to get her to her feet. Ignoring Shepard's question, the wheezing brunette waddled to her room, wincing as her sore knees complained of the almost normal walking speed they'd endured for a few feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed the door behind her, wadding across the sea of potato chip bags, ice cream tubs, beer bottles and cake tins the robots hadn't cleaned up from her breakfast. Miranda's swollen feet screamed, a bad case of gout flaring up as she kicked aside a small mountain of rocky road ice cream, and her deflated bouncy castle of an ass knocked over a four foot stack of pizza boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wot the fuck happened to me, I waz hot as shit! Now me ass is bigger than a fucking Krogan!?\" Miranda slurred, shocked to find her accent that of gutter trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glance in her mirror almost killed the spy on the spot, showing how far she'd fallen. She had to put a swollen hand on the side of her bed to support herself, making herself look at what had been done to her, cataloging it from the bottom up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's slim, arched feet had fallen, growing wide and flat under her weight, her toes swollen with gout. Cankles softer than chewed bubble gum hung almost to the floor, days from hitting before her feet and her calves were surely bigger than her old thighs. Her knees were red and swollen, already complaining at standing up for minutes. Acres of thigh fat pressed in on each other, each thigh rivaling her old body for sheer mass, the skin an ugly mess of warped stretch marks, pimples and spider veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Used to be a fooking champion goddamn jogger bitch, I waz!\" Miranda stammered, making herself close her slack jaw afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShapely hips that begged to be squeezed were balloons of fat, so huge that in a normal house she'd have gotten stuck in the doors, so much fat had been packed into them they were doubling over. Her crotch, once her lowest belly roll had been lifted up to expose it, was a swollen mess, her usually hairless bush having become a jet black tangle. The granny panties tore to pieces in her hand but the various fat rolls held them up and when Miranda dropped her heavy gut it covered her \"modesty\" anyway. A turn around showed her back was a tide pool of fat rolls, leading down to a deflated crinkle ass that looked to be made of melted wax until slapped, ripples forming in the toneless, almost flat sea of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch, I did a thousand damn squats a fucking day for that ass! Now I've gotta gut like bloody melted ice cream!\" she sneered, turning around to finger the immense apron of her stomach, which was in a race with her ass to see which could sag to her knees first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Miranda had had a six pack, now she had two inner tubes of fat stacked atop each other. It gurgled faintly, digesting the nutritional nightmare of her breakfast. She pressed her sausage fingers into the folds, finding sweat filling the deep crevice. Her once spectacular breasts sagged down to her fist sized belly button, parodies of their old firmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was even worse: fat had swallowed her perfect features, her chins covering up her long neck, sauce stains ringed her mouth and her piggish cheeks looking bee stung they'd swelled so much. Her long black locks had been replaced with a no maintenance pixie cut that didn't do her any flavors and she'd clearly stopped waxing her eybrows, her one flaw growing in wild and wooly. A case of adult acne had spread across her face, marring her perfect ivory complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wot the fuck happened ta me?\" the trashy cerberus operative wheezed, \"I wuz bloody beautiful I wuz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug through her messy room, finding in her luggage a never unpacked first aid kit and a medical testing device. She wrapped it around her puffy wrist with difficulty and fumbled with the buttons, having to squint to make out the display due to her vision having gone from 20/10 to 20/100. It began taking in data with a happy hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited, memory came flooding back: taking that drink, feeling cold, feeling hungry for months, eating and eating, getting fatter and weaker in body while her mind rotted on trash tv. For the first time in months an emotion other than hunger bubbled up in her belly, so strange that Miranda couldn't identify it. The medical device dinged that it was ready and she squinted at the holographic read out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wot da fuck, is dis a joke?\" she squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blood pressure was sky high. Her cholesterol through the roof. She had gout. She had arthritis. She had lost four inches in height from her own fat compressing her, going from 5'10 to 5'6. Her BMI was a laughable 80.7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe weighed <i>500</i> lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda recognized what the feeling was and it was hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara and Shepherd had ruined her, when all she'd been trying to do was protect her sister. They'd been her friends and had wrecked her genius mind and perfect body, turning her into an obese, low class slob. And by God, she was going to get her revenge on both of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory divulges:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The High Road</b>: Miranda was going to regain her perfect body and mind, then she was going to make Liara, Shepherd and Jack pay in a suitably ironic fashion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Low Road</b>: the New Miranda knew exactly how to fix this, drag the galaxy's savior onto cheap daytime television and show the entire galaxy just how trashy they'd become!</span></div></div>",

Jack could only nod, leaving Shepard to quell her laughter with the refreshing taste of about a gallon of vanilla and strawberry shake. \"I'm surprised she told you something so personal so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was kind of an accident,\" Jack admitted. \"I was bored and borrowed her computer to play a video game, and...she had pictures of you on there, Shep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard turned a little pink as she finished slurping. \"M-me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you like a thousand pounds ago,\" Jack admitted. \"She collected a couple tabloid photos of you puffing up and put them in a little sequence. I thought it was some intel project so I teased her about having a kink for pretty girls getting fat and...well she confessed.\" By the shameful look on her face, Liara could tell that Jack felt pretty bad about blowing the lid off of this little secret. It was quite a change from the brash firecracker who practically got off on humiliating people that she knew years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she asked you to put on some pounds?\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Ori said she loved me the way I was and didn't want to change me just to suit some fantasy of hers,\" Jack said with a sigh. \"But...I...the way she makes me feel...\" Jack hung her head, her eyes watering. \"I...I never felt this way about anyone before. And I don't want to lose that, ever. I want to make her happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By...getting fat?\" Liara questioned. Jack nodded mutely, and the blubbery asari couldn't help but smile. \"That's so sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blinked. \"You don't...find it weird that I want to be a tub of lard for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara, huffing, reached down with both of her hands to lift up her enormous gut, letting it fall onto her naked thighs with a heavy slap, jostling loose a belch that rattled the window frames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I suppose that wouldn't be as weird to you guys,\" Jack admitted, stepping forward. \"I knew you were getting fat, that's why I went to you guys but...holy shit...\" Jack hovered her hand over Liara's expanse. \"Can I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Liara chuckled. Jack lowered her hand onto Liara's stomach, delicately feeling the surface and how it shook before kneading it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So weird...\" Jack said, removing her hand and running it across her own flat stomach for comparison. \"Wonder how it'll feel on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's one way to find out.\" Liara shifted her massive rear end slightly and patted a sliver of space left over on the couch, just enough for a regular person to sit comfortably. Jack hesitated slightly before sitting down next to Asari blob. \"First of all, if you want to gain weight, you have to get off your feet and relax. Stress burns calories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori's at the tech conference on Mars, right?\" Shepard piped in. \"If you wanted to, you could hang out here for a while, we're not exactly starved for food and there's plenty of room to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys aren't going to turn me into a blob like you, are ya?\" Jack asked, somewhat accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you want us to,\" Liara countered. Jack opened her mouth, hesitated, but before she could finish a robot tottered up with a third massive milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you guys drink a lot of these,\" Jack said. \"Unless you two are splitting this last one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it's yours,\" Liara said, lifting up her other arm with the omnitool on it, hidden from Jack's sight by the expanse of Liara's gut. \"I plugged you into our system, you'll get meals just like ours now, if you want them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyes widened and she looked at the gallon-sized shake like she was just asked to crawl over flaming coals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can NOT drink this!\" Jack insisted. \"It's the size of my freakin' head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUBJECT REQUESTING ASSISTANCE WITH NOURISHMENT,\" the LOKI suddenly chirped in. \"ENGAGING ARISTIPPUS PROTOCOL.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, I didn't mean to turn that on,\" Liara said, hurriedly returning to her omnitool and stumbling to work the controls with her sausage fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn what on? What the hell is an -MMPH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was cut off when the two LOKIs came in from the side to stick a tube into her mouth that was attached to the end of a funnel. The move was so surprising that the angry biotic hesitated to respond, letting the robots set up their device and begin pouring the milkshake into the funnel. Jack was so shocked by the sudden chill that she swallowed, feeling overwhelmed by the delectable chocolate taste. Despite it being so thick and sweet, it kept flowing, forcing Jack to keep swallowing so it wouldn't get sucked into her lungs. Shepard and Liara both watched awkwardly as Jack was force-fed the milkshake, their eyes drawn to the belly emerging and swelling from beneath her shirt, pressing against Liara's mass on one side and the arm of the sofa on the other. By the time the shake was drained dry, her belly was perfectly round and rolled her shirt up to put her belly button on display. Gasping for breath, Jack tore the tube out of her mouth and collapsed backwards on the sofa, covered in sweat from the exertion of an intense feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Jack?\" Shepard prodded carefully. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrgh...\" Jack mumbled, letting out a moan followed by a dainty burp. \"...think I'm gonna....hrrk...pop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Liara said, feeling a little sheepish. \"So uh...I take it you'll be skipping second breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Jack's quest to gain began on a rather auspicious note. She did indeed skip second breakfast after belching out a couple swearwords, but managed to stomach a big lunch and dinner with some excessive dessert afterwards. Eventually, Jack did settle into this new routine and developed an appetite to match the two much larger girls, if only out of love for her new girlfriend, and it wasn't long before the Skinny Jack was a thing of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Ori would be back from her conference and would find a new Jack that was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shepard and Liara were friggin' miracle workers, Jack thought to herself as she ponderously stepped out of the shower that morning. After getting so used to the massive installation that the enormously obese couple had in their bathroom, the shower in Jack and Ori's flat felt tiny by comparison, by extension making Jack feel even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange feeling to say the least, but by the time she said goodbye to the two blobs in that mansion, Jack had gotten used to the ins and outs of \"the fat life\", as the pair had called it. And honestly, it wasn't all that bad. Sure it was tiring more often then not, but her new waddling gait was manageable, the sensation of outgrowing her clothes at a rapid rate was tolerable, and the constant need for snacks was honestly probably the best thing about it. Especially the shakes; she wouldn't admit it even with a gun to her head, but she really got to enjoy the feeling of being stuffed with that milkshake, and that Aristippus Protocol was probably the biggest contributor to her rapid rise in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even wore it well, or at least Jack thought so. Checking her appearance in the mirror as she dried her hair, her face sported a nice thick double chin with a third on the way, working together with her chubby cheeks to create a nice round face to match her body. Below her thicker neck, her breasts had gone up a few cup sizes as well but still remained perky and bouncy, not unlike the growing bingo wings that hid the muscle beneath them. Tossing the towel aside, she tugged on her shorts over her wide and chubby hips, thick and flabby enough to start hanging out the sides of chairs, and only just managed to pull them over the pair of basketballs that made up her butt, sticking out the back like a shelf. Skipping on the bra this time, Jack donned one of her nicer T-shirts, pulling it down over her new breasts and as far down her blossoming buddha belly as she could go, only managing to reach just above her navel, and on an extra large too. Taking a deep breath, Jack pondered the skinny punk alpha bitch turned flabby fat and pampered alpha bitch in front of her, running her hands up and down her love handles and patting her thick thighs to send them into a jiggle. Shepard and Liara had done an excellent job fattening her up, Jack thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost felt bad about lying to them about why she wanted to get fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*click*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door unlocked and opened with a creak, followed by shuffling footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, you home?\" Oriana called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here, out in a sec!\" Jack shouted back, barely able to contain her excitement. Gussying herself up at the last minute, Jack dashed out of the bathroom and headed through the hallways, hoping to position herself before Oriana saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess! Jack strode into the entrance hall just as Oriana was bending over to set down her suitcases, showing off a pair of basketballs herself. Even in her tight skirt and blouse her rear end looked huge, matching perfectly with her chunky legs and hippo hips. Righting herself with a huff, the younger Lawson placed a fleshy hand on the belly, defiantly showing diamonds of flesh through the tight buttons on her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm such a fat hog...\" Ori whimpered, tears visibly welling in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look that bad to me,\" Jack quipped. Oriana turned to argue once again that yes she was practically a hideous ugly blob of fat until she saw the new and improved Jack. Her mouth opened in a perfect little \"o\" shape, matching her nice round double chin as she pointed between the gut she sported and Jack's own belly. Jack grinned, lifting up her shirt slightly to show off the layers of her love handles and belly fat before Oriana found the words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack....what did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I ate a lot,\" Jack said simply, jostling her belly with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...you're so fat now!\" Ori pointed out, looking deeply confused. \"You were so skinny and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I'm not. I'm fine with the size that I am,\" Jack completed her sentence for her. Ori's shocked expression faltered slightly as she was cued into what was going on, replaced with a mix of confusion and affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this for me, didn't you?\" she asked outright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much!\" Jack said brightly, bouncing forward with a pleasing jiggle. Ori almost backed away but Jack was too quick for her, wrapping her meaty arms around her fat girlfriend. \"I love you for you, Ori. It doesn't matter to me how fat or how skinny you are, it won't change how I feel about you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was no cunning manipulator or master strategist. If she was, she might have been able to come up with a better way to make her girlfriend feel loved outside of getting fat for her. Still, the smile that crossed Ori's face when she was finally convinced that Jack loved her unconditionally made her feel like she could take on ten chess grandmasters all at the same time and win in four moves each. Oriana wept tears of pure happiness as she buried her face in Jack's blooming chest, leaving Jack to stroke her hair affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I love you so much, Jack...\" Oriana mumbled into her girlfriend's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto,\" Jack said teasingly, making the two break out in giggles that wobbled their fat rolls. Ori leaned upwards almost immediately afterwards and planted a kiss that seemed to last for days, weeks even. Breaking apart at last, they shared a content smile, swaying gently on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Oriana said, wiping tears off her plush, red face. \"You want to get something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: <b>A Growing Love</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their relationship rekindled, the loving couple enjoy being a couple once more, and with no further consternation about their weight, you can guess what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: <b>Double Date</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack takes Oriana to see the masterminds behind her rapid weight gain, Shepard and Liara. And it's very easy to eat way too much when you're hanging out with a couple that weighs well over a ton together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption C: <b>The Inevitable Free Choice</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything can happen, really. Perhaps one of them gets into weight gain more then the other, or another friend of Shepard's gets roped into the mix. And of course, Miranda must be <i>overjoyed</i> at what Jack has done to her little sister...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Orianna couldn't sleep. Lying in bed staring at the ceiling, the sound of Jack's breathing next to her keeping a steady tempo, Oriana's mind was racing too fast to drift away into the night so easily. At first she thought it was because she was so happy; what Jack did to herself to make her feel better about her size was incredibly kind, and thanks to the stunt she did finally feel comfortable with the way she was again. Idly kneading her stomach, Jack did feel less miserable about herself, but that was in addition to how she felt about Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put...Jack looked hot as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized it when they shared dinner and Jack idly stretched her arms in such a way that her shirt rolled up, leaving a belly to pooch over her waistband. The sight left a tingle in her loins and a heat in her chest that wouldn't subside, not helped by when Jack made a joking comment about how she was going to outgrow all her shirts soon. Soon every little thing to do with Jack's weight was giving her little moments of ecstasy; her hips brushing against narrow door frames, the gentle creak of the furniture she sat in, even the way they could only just barely fit in the same bed without squishing into one another. And in the height of this ecstatic feeling of attraction, Ori began to imagine what it would be like if Jack got even bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriana shuddered, turning over to look at Jack's porcine form with a hungry look in her eyes as she was lying on her back, fast asleep. Picturing the belly hanging out in the air rising like bread dough, Orianna leaned over and wrapped an arm around Jack and squeezed against her, dreaming of a time when she wouldn't be able to fit in the same bed as her. Something, deep in her darkest desires and sexual fantasies, she decided to make a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you went all out for dinner tonight, haven't ya?\" Jack said with a giggle. \"What are we <i>*hic*</i> celebratin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just us being together,\" Orianna said with a charming smile that would have made her sister proud. \"Now eat up, you're not finished yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack let out a groan as she reached over with her fork to finish off the steak Orianna was plying her with. Swaying slightly, Jack knocked over one of several empty beer bottles, consumed alongside the five empty plates stacked up next to her at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, thish is good...\" Jack mumbled through a mouthful of her dinner. \"I didn't know you could <i>*hic*</i> cook so well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a helpful skill I picked up,\" Ori said coolly, already preparing yet another plate of food for her girlfriend. She felt like pushing her luck today; getting Jack tipsy was a great way to push more food on her, and since she got back a week ago Ori had been careful to cultivate a bigger appetite in her girlfriend, all the better to fit more food into that wonderful belly of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's sixth plate was gone in a matter of moments, as she unleashed a rattling belch and finished off another bottle of beer to wash it down with. Trying to set it on the table and missing, Jack leaned back in her seat, arms hanging limply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sho stuffed....\" Jack mumbled. \"No more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's your faaaavorite~\" Ori said in a singsong voice, spearing a chunk of steak on a fork and holding it up to her mouth. Pulling a face, Jack let out another belch and opened her mouth, allowing her girlfriend to feed her. Trying to hide her own ecstasy, Oriana smiled as she fed Jack one bite after another, her overstuffed girlfriend groaning and moaning with every swallow. On the very last bite, there was a distinctive *snap* as the button on Jack's shorts popped open, her taut gut bulging out unrestrained as her head swayed back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...<i>*hic*</i>...good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOri smiled as Jack's head fell to one side, falling asleep almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's going to get even better...\" she cooed, rubbing Jack's almost spherical belly with the most delicate touch she could manage.</span></div></div>",

She was still plenty fat, with a big belly that hung in front of her with thick thighs and legs to support it, but there were warning signs. She seemed to be moving a little faster, they hadn't gone clothes shopping in a while, and the third chin threatening to arrive under her flabby chin was a no-show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen was losing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't supposed to, though. Liara did the math and found the formula, she should be fat happy and inflating with lard at an astronomical rate! She was getting fed like a hog at every meal and annihilated course after course. WHY WAS SHE LOSING WEIGHT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Liara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's fine, my love, just...thinking,\" Liara said, her heft feeling more cumbersome then usual. Was it her twisted imagination, or did Shepard actually look slightly thinner then her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's always a good thing!\" Eileen Shepard giggled, planting a kiss on her lover's chubby cheek. \"I was actually thinking as well...what if I made breakfast today? I've been thinking about your blueberry waffles and I just want to try my hand at them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?!?\" the fat Asari cried out. \"B-but...I'm supposed to make breakfast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're wonderful at it, but I think I owe you a few breakfasts you don't need to make, darling,\" Eileen said sweetly. \"Let me make them...please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was horror-struck, feeling her whole grand plan for Shepard coming down around her.....but she couldn't say no to her. Not in a million years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! You'll love it darling, I promise!\" Eileen said gleefully. Wobbling out of the bathroom, she left Liara staring at her fat reflection in the mirror. Shepard wasn't succumbing to the formula anymore, it seemed, and she was going back to her old self more and more. No wonder she'd been having her old nightmares of witnessing her beloved Shepard's death over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a girl to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the days rolled by, Liara's desire to do anything about the situation slowly but surely evaporated. She still had that urge to stuff Shepard so full she couldn't walk, to pamper and protect her so she'd never be unhappy or unsafe again, but it was rapidly losing against just the love and affection that she felt for her beloved Shepard. When Eileen asked if she could make dinner every once in a while or go out shopping, Liara just couldn't say no to the woman she loved so much. On top of that of course was the struggle of being a big girl. A few dozen pounds was manageable, but three hundred was highly cumbersome and made her usual routine far more exhausting then it would have been. Asari biology and Salarian medical science meant that she wouldn't suffer from poor health, but no pill could make carrying around a one hundred pound badonk any less strenuous. Thus love and weight combined to create a potent force that convinced Liara that it wasn't a big deal if Shepard took over some of the household tasks, which led to Liara becoming lazier and lazier. Soon enough, Shepard was cooking and cleaning every day, and Liara simply lazed about enjoying the fancy dinners her beloved made for her, dinners that kept growing and growing in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Liara realized that her and Shepard had effectively swapped places in the relationship, she was far too lazy to care and settled into the new arrangement with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day things came to a head began like any other; with Liara waking up to the smell of something delicious. Stirred from a post-breakfast nap, the Asari tried to get to her feet, shifting a few inches before collapsing onto the comfortable sofa again. Shrugging it off, Liara braced herself and tried again, moving a couple more inches but dropping heavily onto the sofa with a resounding thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara, darling! Don't hurt yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Shepard,\" Liara said huskily, sweat forming on her brow from the effort of standing up. She gave one last push, and at last completely left her usual perch, stumbling forward as her weight shifted but managing to straighten herself out at last. Trying to get to her feet was such a tasking ritual that Liara was trying to do it less and less, but for food she'd gladly do it ten times over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her first step towards the kitchen, the groan of the floorboards underneath her feet helped her realize just how immense she had gotten. Liara was fat before, but Shepard had pushed her to all new heights of gluttony and adipose, all of which was on full display thanks to the (comparatively) tiny shorts and tube top-like garment that Liara's lover had dressed her in that morning. Her face was cherubic and almost entirely round, with a row of triple and quadruple chins, depending on how far Liara opened her mouth to shovel in more food, and it remained perched between a pair of immense meaty shoulders, leading down to blubbery biceps thicker then a regular person's head and thick fingers that were starting to get too big to use effectively. The tube top did a decent job of keeping the watermelons growing on her chest in line even as they outgrew the bra sizes you could find in regular stores, but the same top let her belly out on full display, a delightfully round apron of flab so large that Liara couldn't even reach her cavernous belly button. It was frankly a miracle she could walk, but it was easy to see how she could remain balanced, since her hips were wide enough that she needed to use a three-person sofa to sit comfortably and mounted a gigantic rear end that stuck out almost as far out the backside as her belly stuck out the front and was so caked in blubber that the jiggles and wobbles it made from merely walking around took several seconds to die down if Liara stopped moving. At the very least the jiggle stopped when she jammed her ass in the doorframe, as she had started to do when entering the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara! It's not quite finished yet,\" Shepard giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry!\" Liara said thickly, her piggy eyes gleaming with excitement and her stomach roaring for sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sit tight, I'll get the grilled stuff for you to snack on,\" Eileen Shepard relented as Liara thundered toward the table and lowered herself across three chairs clumped together, rubbing her monstrous gut happily. If she hadn't been so excited about the food, she probably would have noticed that her lover was still shrinking; without the massive influx of calories and the repression of the nanites in her body by Liara's little formula, Shepard's flab had been reduced to a rounded face and a cute belly bump, with some padding left over on the rest of her, ahem, 'feminine assets'. She wasn't skinny anymore for sure, but it was quite shocking that she could get away with being called curvy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain though, Liara didn't care. Her only thought was on the plate of fried, fattening grilled cheese sandwiches and the extra large chocolate milkshake set in front of her. The immensely obese Asari practically squealed in delight as she attacked the shake first, tearing the lid off and pouring the thick, sweet concoction down her throat in one gulp, with some of the shake dribbling down the corners of her mouth. As Liara set the cup aside and unleashed a booming burp, Shepard leaned in, pressing another shake into her hand and dabbing at the corners of her mouth to clean them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink up, sweetheart,\" Shepard cooed seductively, before leaning in and whispering-</span></div></div>",

It feels like I spent my whole life fighting against the Reapers, I don't know what I'm gonna do now that they're gone...\" Eileen Shepard's face fell slightly at the uncertainty, but Liara put a hand on her chin and lifted it up to give her a long, sensual kiss. When they finally broke apart, Shepard was as red as a tomato and struggling to string words together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...we could do that,\" Shepard said, giggling like a school girl at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Shepard,\" Liara said. \"We have spent so long fighting the Reapers...now that our destiny is our own...why don't we spend it enjoying what life has to offer? We can visit distant worlds, see new faces, indulging in whatever pleasures we encounter along the way. My old connections and safe houses could easily become vacation homes, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds intriguing,\" Shepard mused, turning to her prominent paunch, giving it a wiggle with both hands. \"Maybe I should work this off before we go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why though?\" Liara said suddenly, taking her hands in her own. \"Our lives are our own now, Shepard. What need is there to care about your figure anymore? Why not enjoy life without having to worry about restricting yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard blinked. \"You mean...I should just keep eating, damn the consequences?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's blue skin took on a slightly purple hue. \"I...suppose that is one way of looking at it, yes.\" There was a pregnant pause as the two stared into each others eyes before it was broken by Shepard laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it means I don't have to stop eating all these treats you give me, then why not indulge?\" Shepard reasoned. \"I'm retired, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shepard, I -mmf!\" Liara began, before she was cut off by Shepard suddenly stuffing a slice of cake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correction, actually,\" Shepard said with a grin. \"WE'RE retired, so I don't plan on indulging like this on my own, honey-buns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara instinctively chewed and swallowed the cake slice, the taste hitting her like a wrecking ball of deliciousness. No wonder Shepard was getting pudgy from her cooking, the Asari reasoned as she took a great shuddering breath. Taking hat moment of enjoyment as a sign of agreement, Shepard got to her feet, taking the cake tray in one hand and Liara's hand in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's say we go inside and finish this cake?\" Shepard said brightly, adding in an oh-so-suggestive wink. \"We got a retirement to enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara turned a deeper shade of purple as she was dragged into the house for what was assuredly an amorous evening. This was going to be a lot of fun, and Liara and Shepard couldn't wait to see what will happen...</span></div></div>",

She got lost in her thoughts again, thinking of how the last few months of her retirement had gone. It had truly been a wonderful experience, traipsing across the galaxy without a war to fight, just enjoying all the sights and sounds they missed in between their missions. Shepard took Liara on a tour of all the famous earth cities and landmarks, followed by Liara taking her to all the immaculate cities she heard but never saw before on Thessia, and they had gone on to visit every place in between, drinking in all the beauty and wonder that the galaxy could provide And the food! Together they sampled cuisines from across the cosmos, sampling some of the most delicious feasts you could have in Citadel space, and every time Liara borrowed recipes and ingredients so that she could recreate the most delectable courses at home. True to her word, Shepard had abandoned everything that could cause her stress on her epicurean adventure, feasting like royalty at every meal and staying as far away from any semblance of exercise or restraint. And now that they were back home from their epic adventure, for now, the effects of all that feasting were...quite apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shower turned off, there was a pause, only interrupted by a tinny electronic voice recited out a number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Five hundred...fifty!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds about right....\" Shepard mused, wrapping an oversized towel around herself and stepping into her bedroom, preceded by an absolute mountain of a belly, falling around her in two thick rolls of fat. Taking great waddling steps towards the wardrobe to get dressed, Shepard started out with a flabby belly but her hourglass figure had taken the brunt of her new diet's effects, with tree trunk thick haunches propelling her along to her next meal and her belly propping up breasts the size of pumpkins that needed special bras with enough letters to fill a dictionary. Hurriedly getting dressed, Shepard quickly put on a polo shirt and jeans that would have been tiny on an Elcor, straining momentarily to button the latter closed. It wouldn't last one more feast at this point, Shepard realized with glee, and she glanced in the mirror to make sure her hair was orderly and framed her wide, triple-chinned face nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming Liara, sheesh!\" Shepard moaned loudly, turning to lumber out the room and down the hall, rattling every loose object as she stomped by before arriving in the kitchen. The smell of all the delicious food being prepared was heavenly; her mouth was already starting to water at the spread in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich could have meant the spread of food, or the spread of the absolutely massive rear end blocking the view of the stove. Shepard, a mischievous grin on her face, waddled up to the rear end and grabbed it with one fat-fingered hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!\" Liara yelped, standing up straight with a hot bowl in her mitted hands. \"Not when I'm in the oven, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look so good, honey,\" Shepard said seductively as her lover turned to set the dish among the others on the table. Indeed, Liara's smooth dress left little to the imagination and hugged every one of Liara's curves, mostly because she had blown past a quarter ton as well. It highlighted just how much of a pear she was, with her decently large breasts and upper arms upset by a perfectly round boulder of a belly perched in front of a massively wide set of hips and haunches, which had a chair kill-count that ran into the double digits at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it for later, my love,\" Liara chided, her large round face purpling slightly. \"We have a guest coming over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" Shepard said, dropping down into a steel double-wide chair. \"It'll be nice to hang out with someone from the old team at least. I imagine she'll lose her head once she sees all of this though.\" Shepard slapped her belly, sending it wobbling for a good few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm not so sure of that,\" Liara said, setting up another dish and popping a little piece of it into her hungry mouth in a well-practiced move. \"I've heard she's gotten rather portly herself, so perhaps seeing us won't be such a surprise anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, people were still shocked to see the savior of the galaxy looking like this,\" Shepard pointed out. \"Not that I mind of course, I look damn good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No argument there,\" Liara said, leaning around Shepard's massive rack to give her a kiss, which was still a little awkward at their size. Right on cue, the doorbell gave an electric trill. \"Ooh, that's her!\" Liara said happily. \"Can you get that, I need a few more trips to get this set up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I got it.\" With a herculean effort, Shepard heaved herself to her feet and made the lumbering journey to the door, the electronic hatch sliding open to reveal...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Krogans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk, fatass,\" Shepard replied with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gave a hearty laugh and munched down the last of her candy bar, jiggling her belly to let out another piercing belch. And there was a lot to jiggle; Jack had dressed up a bit for the occasion with a presentable shirt and slacks, but only the latter did anything to cover her up, since her great boulder of a belly was unable to be contained and forced itself out over her waistband, putting all those tattoos on display. Jack evidently was a super-heavy fatass not unlike Liara, and most of her five hundred pounds seemed to be concentrated in her legs and rear, which were wide enough to make Shepard worry that Jack would get stuck in the door trying to get inside. Her upper body got a decent amount of that flab judging by Jack's brand new bosom and the one thick double chin wreathing her face like a scarf, but it was definitely her massive ass that made up most of her new bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to see you're doing well, Jack,\" Shepard said warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Jack said, turning sideways and stepping inside with a slow gait. \"Ya know, I heard you were kinda turning into a whale, but...damn!\" she continued, reaching out to jiggle a handful of Shepard's belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? Retirement has been good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, it's tough teaching biotics when you're the size of a whale. Still, least I can threaten to sit on my students if they misbehave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could probably sit on the whole class at once,\" Shepard pointed out, giving her a friendly elbowing. Jack opened her mouth to snark at her but stopped short when she saw the spread of food laid out for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see someone's hungry,\" Liara remarked, finishing up the table setting and taking her seat. Jack slowly waddled to the table, her eyes fixed on the feast in front of her, and immediately dove for the largest hunk of meat she could find, not even bothering to take her seat, and began devouring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Liara said, giving Shepard a hungry look. \"How does the human phrase go again? When in Rome...?\"</span></div></div>",

While Shepard was an overinflated hourglass, since their war against the reapers Samara had blossomed into a top heavy behemoth around the same size as Shepard. Still in a red outfit similar to her old uniform, Samara's belly ballooned outwards in a perfect sphere the size of a IVV tire, propped up by pleasantly plump thighs, and the sharp angles along her jaw had melted into smooth curves that left her with a perfectly round face with three chins hanging down, but all that took a backseat to her absolutely massive rack, approaching the size and shape of beach balls and unable to be contained without showing a generous helping of cleavage. Shepard got to enjoy a face-full of them as she wrapped Samara in a hug, who in turn held on as best she could with her flabby ham-hock arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in, dinner's nearly done,\" Shepard said, her tubby cheeks turning a shade of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be delighted to, Shepard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them lumbered back into the dining room just as Liara finished setting up the last of the dishes. Shepard and Samara both sniffed the air, getting a bit of delight from the feast that was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samara, I'm so glad you could make it!\" Liara announced, her eyes flicking down to Samara's enormous cleavage. \"We have...quite a lot to catch up on, don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems we do,\" Samara said, a smile flickering across her stern expression. \"For now though, shall we begin?\" Shepard grinned as she and the monstrously overweight Justicar lowered themselves onto the double-wide benches, and all three girls began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard and Liara learned a while back that when you reached a certain point, table manners just slowed down how fast you could eat and were best left by the wayside. To that end, the loving couple had learned the art of devouring and enjoying their meals at breakneck speed, and dove into the feast before them with an animalistic spirit. Shepard tore into a Turian bird dish by tearing chunks off with her bare hands while Liara tore off massive chunks of steak from a Krogan meal and swallowed them down, occasionally sounding off with an impressive belch. Samara was not offended by the astounding lack of manners; far from it, she was messily tearing into barbecued ribs in one hand and shoveling down mashed potatoes with the other, eagerly enjoying two Earth-based delicacies. Eventually their feasting slowed down enough that they could talk through their gorging and properly catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're no stranger to this arrangement,\" Liara commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Samara responded, wiping her mouth with her sleeve. \"I see retirement is treating you well. Is that why you've grown to such a size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We decided to enjoy life to the fullest,\" Shepard explained. \"The mission is over, why not indulge a bit? Or a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara chuckled. \"I sympathize. My time as a Justicar is over, and I intend to spend my twilight years with friends and family. I've left my daughter Falere alone for far too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is she, by the way?\" Shepard asked, showing concern despite shoving handfuls of meat into her hungry maw. \"It must be rough for her, losing a sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was, but we've coped,\" Samara explained. \"I convinced her to turn to the culinary arts to help her heal, and it's worked quite well...as you can tell.\" She patted the side of her belly to emphasize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's interested in cooking as well?\" Liara said, her eyes lighting up.</span></div></div>",

Refocusing herself on the meal, she picked up a whole new steak and sloppily devoured it, coating her cheeks in delectable steak sauce. Breathing deeply, Liara let out a loud belch before collapsing back in her chair, causing it and her dress to creak dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I see,\" Samara said thoughtfully. Scouring the table, the former Justicar spotted her quarry and picked up a whole bowl of pasta, lifting it overhead and pouring the whole thing into her eagerly awaiting maw. Shepard and Liara looked at the red-clad Asari in shock as she slowly swallowed down the whole mess before she finished, the bowl dropping to one side with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Samara?\" Shepard asked cautiously. Samara didn't respond, other then to puff her cheeks out and sway gently in her chair, pasta sauce dripping from her face. Shepard and Liara made to move away, fearing she was going to upchuck the whole dish, but instead Samara leaned back in her chair and opened her mouth to unleash an incredibly loud roar of a belch, one that put Shepard and Liara's to shame and would have woken everyone in their impressively large house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the...<i>hurrk</i> Goddess....\" Samara said at last, stifling little burps every few moments as she let the dish settle. \"That was...<i>hic</i>....amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arguments here,\" Shepard admitted, sounding amazed as she grabbed for another bowl of noodles. \"I so have to try that now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the three women finished off the feast with renewed vigor, steadily growing bigger as they reached the end of their capacity for food. Unrestrained by her constrictive pants button, Shepard's monstrous gutswelled out from in front of her, putting her belly button on full display, while Samara faced a similar issue and had to loosen her own garment to allow her round, stuffed taut belly room to escape. Liara escaped any such wardrobe malfunction (for now), but her voluminous dress still tightened considerably around the boulder that was her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out small hiccups and belches, the three ladies retired to the living room to rest off the meal, Shepard and Liara squeezing their hips into a couch while Samara settled her overflowing rear end into a loveseat. As they digested, Samara got caught up with Shepard and Liara, who were eager to talk about all the wonderful places they visited in their trip across the galaxy, not to mention the many, many buffets they partook in. Samara on the other hand informed them of goings on at the new monastery and how she had been reconnecting with her daughter, notably all the cooking competitions she was entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that she's allowed to enter, considering...well, you know,\" Shepard commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Shepard, since the end of the war, our society has become more accepting of Ardat-Yakshi, considering what the Reapers did to them.\" Liara recounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an encouraging development,\" Samara said with a smile. \"I admit I was worried how well my daughter would cope with the isolation so soon after losing her sister, so it is a relief to see this social stigma become lessened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you worried about the ones that are more like your eldest?\" Shepard said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am,\" Samara said tersely. \"But at the same time, it is wise to remember that not all of the Ardat-Yakshi are like Morinth, and that many deserve the chance to live as well. And I am glad that Falere has that chance now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Shepard said, looking through the photos that Samara brought with her of Falere winning the competitions. Shepard couldn't help but notice how Samara's figure steadily grew wider with every win by her daughter. It would be amusing finding the correct order based on the size of the Justicar's hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit I'm surprised you have not joined any of these competitions, actually,\" Samara said to Liara. \"I imagine you would do a fine job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something to consider,\" Liara admitted. \"Though I admit I mostly do this just to enjoy life to the fullest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise endeavor,\" Samara said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though the day had to end, with Samara bidding her farewells and promising to inform her daughter that Shepard's lover was a budding chef as well. The two decided afterwards to make it an early bedtime, and lumbered upstairs after they finished cleaning up from their feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, I thought all this eating would get old after a while,\" Shepard commented, rubbing her belly with contentment and admiring her elephantine form in the mirror. \"It hasn't. I love retirement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we are both enjoying it then.\" Liara called from the bathroom. \"Our next trip will have to be to Samara's home now, so I can cook with her daughter.\" Shepard licked her lips at the thought of that, despite the massive feast still percolating in her blob-like tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those competitions sound fun too,\" Shepard mused, turning to let her hips jut out. \"I bet you'd wipe the floor with the competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can certainly try...\" Liara said, shutting the door behind her. Shepard turned around to comment but was stunned into silence at the sight of Liara in a black bra and panties, with her enormity on full display, a blue ocean of flab from her many-chinned face to the breadth of her sofa-crushing hips to the front of her boulder belly and the tips of her chubby little toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see, Shepard?\" Liara said, seductively wobbling her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, yeah...\" Shepard said, stepping backwards and sitting down on the bed, her belly splayed out over her own impressive thunder thighs, her pleasure center lighting up like a fireworks factory catching fire. Shepard let out a little squeak of pleasure as Liara clambered onto her lap, pressing her great flabby tummy against Shepard's and resting her chins on the expanse of Shepard's cleavage. Taking charge, Shepard shimmied around a bit to move her gut out of the way, leaning forward to deliver a deep, sensual kiss. Caught up in the moment, the Asari responded with such enthusiasm that her lover fell onto her back with her on top, the combined half-ton of blubber making the bed wobble dangerously. Not that it would stop them, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems they weren't going to sleep off that meal after all...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Commander Shepard's decision to live life to the fullest and fattest alongside her Asari lover did not happen in a vacuum, naturally. Alliance tabloids were having a field day documenting the once brave commander's descent into mindless hedonism, with the pro-humanity rags tending to be the most harsh on the idea, and even more respectable publications were weighing in, no pun intended, on the issue. When a video of Liara's growing rear end crushing a chair at a restaurant went viral, everyone began to speculate on what was going on. A malfunctioning Alliance military experiment? A strange and obscure alien ritual? A rare and highly abnormal disease? No one really knew, but when Samara's daughter started getting noticed in the news for her culinary victories, everyone took note of how the former Justicar was steadily inflating after every win and began to ponder if the sudden descent into hedonism was something that afflicted not just the hero who defeated the Reapers, but her many allies and friends as well. Some of which weren't pleased about those rumors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one more follow up question, Miss nar Rayya. Have you taken any steps to change your diet or upgrade your wardrobe so you avoid blowing up like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bosh'tet!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali'Zorah punched the shutdown button on her console's commlink, immediately ending the live interview with the Alliance news crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those...leeches! Parasites!\" Tali shouted, kicking over an empty container in her mini-tantrum. \"They said they wouldn't bring it up!\" Kicking the container repeatedly, she finished venting with one last kick that sent it sailing across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's going on in-HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDucking under the flying container with ease, Garrus Vakarian straightened up and began approaching Tali more cautiously, who was still inflicting violence on packing containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it the interview didn't go well?\" the Turian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always the weight gain!\" Tali fumed. \"No one asks about what it was like facing the Reapers, becoming Admiral of my own fleet, or retaking and working to rebuild Rannoch, it's always 'my goodness your commander got fat, how are you dealing with it?' Are humans always this desperate to learn about personal issues of others!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do get asked a lot about what you look like under the mask,\" Garrus chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Keelah</i>, you're impossible,\" Tali said with a hint of affection in her tone, grumpily parking herself on a container she hadn't yet vandalized, the Turian cautiously taking a seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I can see why everyone is so curious about what's happening with Shepard,\" Garrus confessed, unconsciously placing a hand on the Quarian's leg. \"But honestly, I think it's overblown. I bet when we see her tomorrow she'll be fine, just a little pudgy if anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" Tali said, placing her hand gently on top of Garrus' and leaning against him. \"Maybe I'm just anxious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing, you're cute when you're anxious,\" Garrus teased, nuzzling her neck gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Tali sighed, melting into the gentle caress of her lover. \"I'm sure they're not...actually fat, or anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali, Garrus! It's so good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Quarian was numb as a five hundred pound Liara wrapped her meaty arms around her and pulled her into a hug, sucking her into her belly and chest fat. Her glass visor squeaked as Liara's fat cheeks brushed against her face and she moved to pull an equally numb Garrus into a big hug as well. Behind her incredibly broad back, he shot a look at his girlfriend that plainly stated 'Help I am losing my mind over here'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...great to see you too!\" Tali managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah all of you,\" Garrus said, hissing as Tali elbowed him sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't just stand there, come in! We were just about to start eating!\" Liara said, giving a belly laugh and a good slap to her bulging belly. \"It's half dextro as well, you'll have plenty to sink your teeth into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, the two still skinny squadmates followed the Asari down the hall, going at half-pace to match Liara's lumbering gait, seeing as her hips blocked off the hallway. Tali was genuinely surprised that her former teammate found something she could squeeze her mammoth-sized rear end into, let alone such a fancy and elegant dress for the occasion. Of course that just begged the question of how Shepard looked at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough they came to a rather spacious dining room, with a spread that made Tali and Garrus' mouth water almost immediately. The whole arrangement was neatly divided in two, with a pair of chairs sitting on one side and a sofa lying on the other end. Only at second glance it turned out to not be a sofa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!?\" Garrus spoke up, shocked at the sight of the woman he once had a relationship with, now blossomed into a morbidly obese whale spread across two chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus! It's great to see you again!\" Shepard exclaimed, her fat cheeks dimpling with smiles. \"Tali, great to see you too!\" Without warning, the commander, perhaps the greatest War Hero who ever lived, lightly bumped her fist against her chest and shook lose a loud and unladylike belch. \"So, you two ready to start eating? I'm starved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready as we'll ever be...\" Tali said, taking her seat alongside Garrus, as her hosts immediately started piling into the feast sitting between them. Thinking back to her interview fiasco, no wonder all the reporters were asking about her weight and how big the Commander was. Liara and Commander Shepard hadn't just gotten fat, they'd gotten enormous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here she was about to tuck into a feast just like they were!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So I can still blend something for you if you like, Tali,\" Liara offered through a mouthful of potato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I can stomach solid foods,\" Tali said, detaching the bottom portion of her helmet to expose her jaw. \"I got a immuno-booster an hour ago, should keep me from getting infected for the rest of the day.\" Cautiously, she took one of the platters on the dextro- side of the table and gave herself a helping of some multicolored tubers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you need a constant stream of the stuff to keep from getting sick?\" Shepard asked her, pausing her own impressive feasting at the sight of Tali opening up her helmet. Tali wasn't surprised that the commander was so shocked she stopped eating; Kelly panicked nearly dialed emergency the first time she saw the Quarian use that feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the newer ones are stronger and more long-lasting. Being able to work with the homeworld's atmosphere again has really helped us improve our immunity boosters, to the point that within a year or two we might be able to live without the suits entirely,\" Tali explained, forking some of the food into her mouth. She was still getting used to solid foods so her opinion may have been somewhat biased, but she had to admit that Liara's cooking was pretty good. Oftentimes when anyone except Turians tried to make Dextro-cuisine it came out bland and dry, and somehow Liara managed to figure out how to make this not only edible but quite tasty as well. Not bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has to be pretty exciting, working to restore your home planet and your species,\" Liara said admiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been very fortunate,\" Garrus interjected, chewing on a succulent-looking steak. \"And since the Hierarchy has me as the adjunct overseeing our assistance to the Quarians and the Geth, we've been able to spend a lot of time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In addition to actually helping us with the rebuilding effort of course,\" Tali added, shooting Garrus a sideways glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, right, that too,\" Garrus said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, I'm glad you two are well,\" Shepard chuckled. \"How's Chikktika doing, by the way? Still blasting away the bad guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dinner went on, Tali felt a little more relaxed about the bizarre circumstances of the meeting. With or without the extra four hundred or so pounds, Shepard was still Shepard, and Tali saw the same confidence and spirit that made her respect the Commander back when they were fighting the Reapers, making the newly obese Shepard sitting in front of her just a little bit easier to take in. And Liara...well, Tali didn't care for her all that much, but now she seemed a lot better too. She always found the Asari to be a little bit snooty and full of herself, but since turning into a morbidly fat alien Liara had mellowed out considerably and felt much more relaxed and approachable. Maybe in time Tali would even be able to see what Shepard saw in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether the four friends feasted for what felt like hours, talking and catching up all the while. Liara and Shepard had predictably demolished their half of the dinner, while Tali and Garrus had only managed to take a respectable chunk out of their end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you have leftovers!\" Liara joked, her chins wobbling as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yeah....oooh....\" Tali groaned, clutching her belly. She had been so distracted by the pleasant conversation that she didn't notice she reached her limit a while ago; now her tummy bulged painfully out of her middle, thankfully contained quite well by the rest of her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you enjoyed yourself,\" Garrus quipped, patting her on the stomach tenderly. Tali groaned and gently swatted his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two want dessert?\" Shepard asked as Liara rose to her feet and began the laborious task of turning around without knocking anything over. \"Liara made a really tasty cheesecake, dextro-neutral!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're fine,\" Tali said, ignoring the sad look on Garrus' face at the lack of cheesecake. Pushing herself to her feet, Tali suddenly felt a little out of sorts. \"I.....huurp....had fun, was nice to see you, Shepard....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Tali?\" Shepard asked. \"Don't move too quickly, you're stuffed to the gills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not....that stuffed, thank you,\" Tali insisted, bracing herself on the table. Her head was starting to ache pretty badly. Where was the mouthpiece of her helmet? She reached around on the table for it, but her vision was fogging over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali, what's wrong?\" Garrus asked urgently as Liara quickly lumbered towards the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine...just need...a nap...\" Tali slurred, pitching backwards and collapsing onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, she's coming around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, let me check her over then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali blinked, her eyes hurting from the sudden beam of light shone into them. She tried to swat it away but her arms were too heavy. She groaned, her stomach gargling furiously to digest a big meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie still, honey. You took a nasty fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she going to be okay, doctor?\" Garrus asked, his voice harrow with worry as Tali felt him grip her hand tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Mr. Vakarian, she's going to be just fine. Let her breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali regained her bearings as someone pressed a facemask into her hand, which she reattached to her helmet almost instinctively. She was lying with her back on a sofa, with Garrus sitting next to her and Liara and Shepard looming nearby, their gargantuan forms casting shadows on the two of them. The doctor, a Salarian that Tali didn't recognize, examined his omni-tool with one hand as he felt Tali's wrist for a pulse with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Tali asked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You collapsed after your...ah...dinner,\" the doctor explained. \"I don't think it's anything serious, could have just been overeating that did it. Quarian digestive tracks are rather fragile...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali turned red with embarrassment under her helmet. If it wasn't bad enough being humiliated like this in front of her friends and her fragile health being made into a punchline once again...she was being accused of overeating! Tali would have bet half the migrant fleet that this doctor made that comment because he knew about the reputation of Shepard and her crew in regards to waistlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Garrus demanded a little too forcibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems I was slightly mistaken...she has Lacovian Disorder.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali had no idea what that could have been, and judging by the look on everyone's face, no one else knew what that was either. But it didn't sound good, whatever it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing serious, I assure you,\" the doctor said, perhaps sensing everyone's anxiety. \"It's a temporary health disorder, she'll be fit as a fiddle before long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I can-\" Tali started to say as she got to her feet, but the doctor pushed her back down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lacovian Disorder is relatively new, it's essentially a negative reaction to immunity boosters. There's been a spike of cases among Quarians given recent developments. Were you using the newer boosters, perchance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the newer models from earlier in the month,\" Tali confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would do it. Unfortunately, while its mild, there's really nothing I can do about it. You need to wait for your body to adjust to the booster stimulant, and until then you should stay in bed. Too much physical exertion or staying on your feet for too long will cause another attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bosh'tet</i>,\" Tali swore. \"I can't stay here, I have-\" she began before Garrus forced her back down, a little more gently then the doctor did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to be able to do anything if you can't stay conscious,\" Garrus pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a responsibility!' Tali insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your people already know that you've done a lot to help them over the last few years,\" Shepard pointed out. \"I'm sure they'd understand if you needed to take a break to get healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle any of the work back on Rannoch while you recover,\" Garrus offered. \"That way all you need to worry about is getting back on your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd really do that for me?\" Tali said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twice over, if I needed to,\" Garrus insisted, leaning against her helmet affectionately. \"You don't need to worry about a thing, I've gotten pretty good at calibrating things over the years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNEW you'd say that,\" Tali giggled. \"Alright fine, I'll stay off my feet and get better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you stay with us?\" Liara interjected. \"We can take care of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali looked between the expansive forms of her former commander and her lover with mixed feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'd rather just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to stay off your feet for a while, and you're already here anyway!\" Shepard said excitedly. \"Seriously Tali, why not just stay with us? It'll be fun getting to hang out again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus I can keep working on those Dextro recipes,\" Liara fantasized, rubbing her multi-rolled gut slowly. \"You'd probably make for a great taste tester too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the look of excitement etched on Liara and Shepard's faces...Tali couldn't bring herself to say no. As the two rushed off excitedly, jamming their rear ends in the door-frame as they went, regret warred with gurgling digesting noises inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped she wouldn't regret this.</span></div></div>",

If you don't slow the shipments down now they're just going to stop altogether when our convoys are bled dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali groaned, tearing off another chunk of Rudarum Steak and stuffing it into her mouth, a valiant effort to polish off leftovers while Shepard and Liara were out at a buffet place for a date. She knew this added stress wasn't helping her recovery from Lacovian Disorder, but it probably would have just stressed her out more to not do anything at all. Luckily Shepard and Liara were understanding, letting her set up a mini-workstation from her new home on the loveseat that both ladies had outgrown by now so she could keep working. It helped, but Tali would be glad when her strength came back and she could get back to work properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she was disliking her time crashing with Shepard, of course. It was nice to hang out with some old friends like this, and they had gone out of their way to make her temporary stay here as comfortable as possible, including home-cooked meals courtesy of Liara's foray into Dextro-cuisine. That being said...Liara didn't seem to want to portion her meals for someone who was a normal size. The pair never forced meals on Tali of course, but there was just a lot of food around the place, and when the Quarian got bored or frustrated, it was a little too easy to reach for. She'd only just gotten used to the feeling of her belly pressing against her suit after a big meal when it started to press against it all the time, rising from her once flat stomach like cookie dough. Tali gave her doughy gut an idle prod as she let out a small sigh, resolving to diet once she was completely over the disorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about...extra protection on the shipments?\" Tali decided, in regards to the piracy problem. \"I have a few contacts and strings I can pull, help get the pirates off the trader's backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can manage that it'd be a great help,\" Tali's contact said. \"Until the protection gets here though I'd like to at least slow down the outgoing shipments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but don't go below 50% on output,\" Tali insisted, taking another bite of her steak. \"The people need to eat, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...I'll get on it Admiral,\" the adjunct said, dropping sarcasm that Tali missed because she was focused on eating. Dialing in a familiar number on her comms system, the Quarian was distracted when her fork scraped against a bare plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? All out?\" she sighed. \"Hmm, maybe Liara has more in the fridge...\" Spurred on by food, Tali slowly and unsteadily got to her feet, leaning on furniture nearby in case she had a fainting spell from the disorder. Taking the long way around the overtaxed furniture, Tali traipsed through the hallway and was stopped when she saw a photo of a... wait that's a mirror...and that's....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huhh...wahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali's words failed her as she realized that sitting down for so long mislead her about how much damage she was doing to her body. She thought at worst she gained fifteen or so pounds, enough for the belly and slight pudge she had all around her, but she hadn't gained fifteen pounds. It was a little closer to a hundred or so, hiding in and around her legs, meaning there was no hiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali's butt was pretty darn big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Quarian shifted her stance to get a better view, feeling her suit strain to contain the flab caked on her lower body, and gave her rear end a soft smack, sending it rippling and quaking. At this rate, it wouldn't be long until the loveseat was a perfect fit for this monstrous rear, already wide enough to fill out a regular chair and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing onto the offending body part and shaking it dejectedly, Tali tried to reason with herself on this daunting change to her figure before concluding thusly:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Last post was kinda lame, here's my penance for the previous chapter lol)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, I can lose this in no time...right?\" Tali reasoned with herself as she hefted her meaty cheeks in both hands. \"Yeah....yeah of course I can!\" The Quarian took a shuddering breath, wincing as her rear end thudded against the mirror and tipped it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...well, I've been inactive and eating a lot, it's only natural I'd put on....a few,\" Tali reasoned as she meandered her way into the kitchen. \"Once I get home everything will be back to normal!\" Really, it was the only thing Tali could do in response to this sea change, since if her reaction to the first time seeing tons of fun Liara and Shepard was anything to go by, excessive weight was not something she was accustomed to. It would have been bad enough if her species hadn't spent generations dealing with rationing and food shortages, pretty much the exact opposite problems that they had nowadays, but Tali had always worked with active professions; marines, bodyguards, spies, and engineers, all people she looked up to and were inspired by, and these people were...well, they were skinny and athletic types that didn't sit around gorging on Liara's cooking like she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was bad enough that she was watching two of those skinny athletic types, some of her best friends, balloon up in front of her. It was another thing entirely when it seemed to be happening to her. She was Tali'Zorah, the hero who defied the status quo and fought alongside the best and the brightest to save the galaxy! The brave Quarian who helped broker peace between her people and the Geth, and who led the charge in rebuilding their homeworld! She wasn't SUPPOSED to be a fat lazy overeater crashing on her friend's sofa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she wasn't. The massive shelf behind her wasn't a sign she was fat, neither was her newfound love of Liara's cooking, and certainly not her more recent requests for a second helping, or just an extra slice of that delicious shortcake. Nope, no fat Quarians here, she was just temporarily out of action until she could get back in the game. <i>Keelah se'lai!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<i>Keelah se'lai</i>, I am so hungry...\" Tali groaned, opening the fridge and trying to ignore the tightening of the suit around her new assets as she bent over. \"Where did she leave the steaks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like a surprise visit from your boyfriend to make you change your tune, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not coming out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...'honey', it's not that bad...honest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, IT'S WORSE! I LOOK...<i>GAH</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus leaned his head against the door to the bedroom in frustration and anxiety as the ground shook behind him, indicating Shepard had arrived on the scene. \"Who's shouting?\" she asked, scratching the side of the belly spilling out from under a too-small shirt. Everything was too-small on her at this point, really. In just a few weeks even the already huge Shepard appeared to be noticeably fatter, with a wider face and an extra roll for the apron sprawled in front of her, an apron that brushed against the sides of the door as Shepard entered the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Tali,\" Garrus explained, dropping his voice. \"She's uh, upset about her...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like a Kilvaglian Jeefirn!\" Tali mewled. \"An overfed Kilvaglian Jeefirn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a Kilvaglian Jeefirn?\" Shepard asked. \"It sounds delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really need to ask that now?\" the Turian demanded, somewhat irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken. You think she's upset about how you'll react?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knows I don't care about that sort of thing,\" Garrus rattled off tiredly. \"I care about her, not her weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>sure </i>she knows that?\" Shepard pushed the question, raising a suggestive eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am!\" Garrus shouted, rounding on his morbidly obese former commander. \"I'm not good with the cutesy flirting dialogue or the dating thing, but I know enough to be sure there's no one in the galaxy I care about more then her, and she could be the size of a house and I'd still be so in love with her that I couldn't hope to put it into words!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pregnant pause as Garrus' outburst rang through the hallway, with Shepard glancing towards the bedroom expectantly while her Turian friend stewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you really feel that way, Garrus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus immediately softened and melted as Tali's voice came from behind the door, looking over at the triumphant expression on Shepard's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...of course I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I'm coming out, give me a moment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works every time,\" Shepard whispered as muffled footsteps sounded from behind the door. \"If your species could blush I'd bet you'd be turning red right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no I wouldn't,\" Garrus grumbled rubbing the back of his neck bashfully. Thankfully, he didn't need to endure more of Shepard's teasing once the door shot open. It took quite a bit for Garrus to not react with surprise at the sight of his beloved Quarian. He knew what had happened and meant every word of his previous outburst don't get him wrong, but....woof...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt immediately became clear that at some point Tali needed to replace her suit. It looked the same as the old one, maybe with a bit more gold on the trimmings but otherwise it was still recognizably her. It was almost certainly broken it at this point, or perhaps it was new and Tali was just growing really quickly, because it put on full display exactly why Tali needed a new suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly led the way out of the bedroom, cascading down her front in multiple doughy rolls and layers of flab, with a deep belly button just visible through the fabric stretched taut around her middle. She kept her thick fingers clamped on her stomach to stop it from wobbling too badly, revealing the thick, plush bingo wings hanging down from each arm, wobbling almost as violently as her gut did when she moved. Even her helmet looked wider then before, and going by the smudges a few inches below her eyes on the other side of the visor, her chubby cheeks regularly smooshed up against the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Garrus, uh, I'm sorry but I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't ever need to apologize to me,\" Garrus immediately said with utmost sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm stuck in the doorway.\" Tali continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, that should have been a given; Tali retained her weight in her lower half and that hadn't changed at all since she first got anxiety about her size. Even the far heavier girls only brushed against the sides of the room and got stuck once in a while; for Tali getting stuck was practically guaranteed thanks to the whale tale she lugged around. Too wide for any seating besides a sturdy bench and the love seat Tali overflowed downstairs, her rear end was truly gargantuan, to the point where you could be forgiven for thinking Tali had stuffed oversized watermelons into the back seat of her pants. Barely supported by thunderous thighs wide enough to fit a skinny person inside, her butt was an unstoppable wobbling monster, bouncing off the walls and knocking small objects off of tables when she lumbered towards her next meal. It said something that despite being the lightest one here by a hundred pounds or so, she was by far the one with the largest caboose trailing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully it was pliable enough that Garrus could compress the flab and just barely squeeze her through the doorframe. Holding her immense frame in his arms, Garrus looked over at Tali's shameful expression and, seizing on inspiration, nuzzled her thick neck with his forehead. It was strange nuzzling into the fat, but it produced the desired effect as Tali shuddered with pleasure, her flab jiggling all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you, Tali,\" Garrus cooed. \"It hasn't been the same without you around to micromanage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Garrus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment was interrupted by a pair of stomachs rumbling, first Tali's, then Shepard's, who was so enjoying the moment that she almost forgot about the feast waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, let's get to the eatin'!\" Shepard said excitedly, beginning the slow lumbering journey to the kitchen. Garrus, feeling a little better about things, followed, going at a slower pace so Tali could waddle alongside him, her meaty hand clutching his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, a surprising night for the Turian, but the night wasn't over yet...</span></div></div>",

It did help, actually, and left her with a warm feeling in the bottom of her stomach. Her tubby, tubby stomach. So yeah it didn't help entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think you're overreacting,\" Miranda admitted. \"Yes the two of them have gotten...heavy, so to say, but I don't think they're trying to deliberately fatten you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do you explain this?\" The Quarian stood up from her seat and showed off her rear end, big enough that she would have been squished up if she had to share the booth with another. Oriana let out a squeak of surprise at the sight of the junk in Tali's trunk, but Miranda, always the cool and collective operator, didn't even flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said yourself you were sick,\" Miranda explained away. \"And combined with the recent trend of Quarians gaining weight now that the food shortage and economic troubles are resolving themselves, it's not hard to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Oriana mused. \"I've kinda been following the news lately, a lot of the Commander's former friends have been putting on a few. Last I heard the Justicar couldn't exit the front door of a monastery somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tabloid guff,\" Miranda said dismissively. \"Why are you even reading those stories about Shepard's friends fattening up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I dunno, just a little bored I guess...\" Oriana said, suddenly becoming very interested in her hands as her cheeks took on a pink tinge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, I still feel you're overreacting. You just need a diet plan and things will get back to normal for you,\" Miranda finished saying to the nervous Quarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive,\" Miranda said, smiling warmly. \"If you'd like we can start now, I can give you some pointers on sticking to a healthy eating schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if they force food on me?\" Tali asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are NOT forcing food on you,\" Miranda insisted. \"I've eaten with them before about a hundred pounds ago, they don't force anything on you that you don't want. You just need some self-control, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Tali mumbled, feeling the expanse of her enormous rear end. \"Th-thanks, Miranda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always happy to help!\" Miranda Lawson smiled. \"Now, how about we go over some healthy dextro-meals for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while the initial meeting went incredibly well, dieting proved to be quite hard for Tali to pull off, since...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tali wasn't surprised that the commander was so shocked she stopped eating; Kelly panicked and nearly dialed emergency the first time she saw the Quarian use that feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the newer ones are stronger and more long-lasting. Being able to work with the homeworld's atmosphere again has really helped us improve our immunity boosters, to the point that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali came to a sudden dead stop when she took a bite of her food mid conversation. She thought by now she would have gotten used to the superior taste and texture of solid food, but she wasn't ready for the pure, intense bout of flavor that overcame her with that simple bite of multicolored starches. A perfect balance of salt and starch with just a hint of sweetness to give it that flavor-packed kick...<i>keelah</i>, it was like she never had good food til now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Tali?\" Shepard asked, her jowls wobbling as she chewed nervously. \"Still with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...oh....yes, I mean....w-within a year or two we might....b-be able to live without the suits entirely,\" the Quarian managed to spit out, only to immediately take another bite of the meal, reveling in the overwhelming sensation of taste that it gave her. She had to try something else, she thought as she reached for another dish, a steak made from some alien pack animal that was a pleasant shade of purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...has to be pretty exciting, working to restore your home planet and your species,\" Liara said, trying to bring the conversation back to the focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been very fortunate,\" Garrus interjected. \"And since the Hierarchy has...uh...\" He trailed off at the site of Tali suddenly tearing into the steak after the first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the ancestors, this is incredible!\" the Quarian exclaimed. \"I never knew how good real food could be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did we,\" Shepard chuckled, patting the flank of her great belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I never want to not eat like this!\" the Quarian insisted, abandoning all pretense and starting to shovel great forkfuls of food into her maw directly from the dishes in the center. \"I can't go back to eating nutrient shakes out of induction ports! I need real food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I think we should give her a crash course,\" Liara grinned. \"I didn't expect tonight to turn into a gorging, I would have made more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>what</i>?\" Garrus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm placing an order, couple dozen or so pizzas should do the trick, plus all this,\" Shepard said, punching in a few key commands on her multi-tool. \"Tali you want to throw in anything else on top of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali replied with an intense belch and kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing like three girls gorging themselves senseless to make a guy feel like a third wheel, Garrus thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had finished eating a while ago and was quietly sipping a coffee that Shepard made for him as the girls spent an hour or so gorging. It was kind of impressive in a surreal way, how those three could pack in so much food at high speed, even if it left the place in a complete mess, with plates stacked to the ceiling, takeout boxes scattered around the room, and food stains adorning most surfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, now that was good,\" Liara moaned, rubbing a taut stomach that at some point burst from its confines in her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it,\" Shepard replied, gently massaging her own belly that was making a good effort of trying to do the same. \"Incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus sniffed. Honestly, the incredible bit was that Tali had somehow managed to keep up with these three, her relentless drive and passion making up for her lacking weight and capacity, and of course suffering for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna *hic* pop,\" Tali mumbled, her hands caressing the round orb of her belly. Stretched taut against the material of her suit, Garrus could even hear it groan as it digested the enormous meal within, and it looked so heavy and bulbous that if she tried to stand up she'd probably tip over. Of course, she may have been in pain from how stuffed she was and more resembled a round ball with legs and arms attached then an actual Quarian, but there was no mistaking the joy she felt at being so stuffed she could barely walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you, uh, had fun,\" Garrus tried to comment lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had fun? Garrus, this was....incredible,\" Tali said breathily. \"I...I don't ever want to go back to eating like a Quarian ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more nutrient shakes or light snacks for meals,\" she insisted. \"From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat, eat, eat, eat, EAT! And no one or nothing is going to tell me otherwise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go girl!\" Shepard cheered her on, suppressing a light belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you, Tali,\" Garrus said awkwardly, not sure of how to take this revelation. It was odd and certainly not something he expected from her, but if she was happy...well, that was good enough for him, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should just let this play out, until she came down from her enthusiasm a bit.</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t mind, though; she had been called Shepard and Commander so often, that Eileen didn\u2019t feel like her name any more.

This was probably because when Shepard ate too much sugar, she would get what Kelly had dubbed \u201csugar giggles\u201d, which left Shepard feeling giddy and a tiny bit slaphappy. Or it could have something to do with the amusing way that Kelly\u2019s newly chubby belly bounced about as she walked. Probably some combination of both, actually. \u201cHey, baby, come join me.\u201d Shepard said, then patted the spot next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly happily sat her chunky butt down next to Eileen, then handed her wife a bowl of ice cream. \u201cWhat have you been up to, sweetheart?\u201d She asked thoughtfully with a cheery smile. It had taken several months of counseling, but Kelly was finally able to deal with what happened with the Collectors, and regained more of her cheery demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust enjoying some time to myself, but I\u2019d be more than happy to share it with you.\u201d Shepard answered with a goofy smile, then took her first bite of ice cream. For the last month or so, it seemed like all Eileen and Kelly had been doing was enjoying each other\u2019s company and eating sweets, not that either of them minded this. Even after all this time the couple still felt like they were on their honeymoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly smiled at the eagerness with which Eileen ate her ice cream, then started eating her serving of the cold treat with similar gusto. The ice cream was gone quickly, leaving the two to munch on the cookies Kelly had also brought, but even those, as numerous as they were, did not last very long against the two chubby gluttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with cookies and melted ice cream, the married couple\u2019s stomachs had both swollen to be much bigger. With her system full of sugar, Shepard was laughing softly, even though nothings was being said or done. A chuckle escaped Kelly\u2019s lips even, though that was due to how cute she thought Eileen was being, not because she had the same reaction to sugar as her. \u201cI love your laugh.\u201d Kelly admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d Eileen begins.</span></div></div>",

Peace had been good to her as well, and she was starting to sport a cute little muffin top through her suit. Her new suit, to be exact, somewhat similar to her old suit but thinner skinned, with simulated long flowing sleeves and a sarong-like garment decorating the lower half, not helping to hide that muffin top in any way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loving that new outfit by the way,\" Shepard commented, sitting up in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you like it?\" Tali said, taking a moment to twirl around and letting the hem of the sarong swirl around her ankles. \"I wanted to experiment with the newer suit models coming out and vary my wardrobe a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Shepard encouraged her to continue, slowly getting up from her seat and coming towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, now that we're not all ship-bound there's been less of a need to be as ergonomic in our wardrobes as before, so all sorts of new fashions are trending. The really interesting thing though is that the new suit models are fitted with delicate pressure sensors that give neural feedback to allow us to have a sense of touch through the suit membranes. It's something that we've been working on for decades without much success but now it's almost like I'm not wearing it, it's so accurate. You'd think it would be easy to solve but figuring out how to transfer light sensations like sunlight or the light pressure of clothing is more nuanced then you would think. I actually considered pursuing this line of study when I first left on m-<i>ahaah</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali ended her nerdy rambling with a sensual gasp as Shepard suddenly wrapped her arms around her waist from behind. She nearly dropped her slushy but managed to set it on the nearby deck rail before it tumbled out of her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....Sh-Shepard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, it's Eileen,\" Shepard teased. \"I'm not your CO anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eileen that....oh wow...the sensors really do work...\" The two shared a few blissful moments in each others embrace, enshrined in the light of the sunset, so close they could feel each others hearts beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....uh...wonder how it compares to the real thing...\" Tali stammered out at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard raised an eyebrow. \"So you want to see how it feels outside of the suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what I mean is...oh...OH! Shepa...<i>bosh'tet</i>...Eileen!\" Shepard giggled at the thought of Tali blushing like crazy at a rather saucy suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute when you're flustered,\" Shepard teased as she leaned into the crook of her neck. The Quarian happily received the cuddly gesture, reached over and picked her drink up again, guzzling it down with a large audible gulp. \"Wow, you knocked that thing down quick,\" Shepard commented, somewhat impressed, as she spun around to a comfy side hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figured I could use the energy,\" the Quarian said coolly, slurping down the last few drops. Shepard couldn't tell obviously, but there was something...rather flirty about the way she said that simple statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore things could get really exciting however, there was a pounding on the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures,\" Shepard grumbled, breaking apart from Tali with more regret then anything else. \"I'll get that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who could be here at this hour?\" Tali wondered allowed as she followed the former commander to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't order pizza, did I?\" Shepard asked as she opened the door wide, the Quarian peering over her shoulder curiously. Sadly what waited on the other end wasn't pizza, but it was in fact...</span></div></div>",

Her body felt different somehow, She ran her hand above her head and felt a unfimiliar tingle at the back. Normally she should have felt the smoth hair off hers but it felt like when she used to touch liaras head on the normandy Before the unknown ship Destroyed Normandy SR-1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But she was still as hard as ever. A voice crackled to life over the intercom. \"Shepard, you need to get out of that bed now, this facility is under attack!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, this should be interesting.\" Shepard thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when she sat up she could turn her limbs in a more athleatic way than before, she turned her head around to see her ass and body be more femenine than she used to be. She felt no pain by turning around in that manner like her skin was smother and leaner that made..... she then halted those thougts when her eyes peeled down at her hands. They were Blue! She got up on her legs and found an mirror sitting above a research table in a room that resembled a lab more than a medic bay. She was indeed an Asari with a blue color but with a more purpule hue to it, she was dissy so she could not determine the color of her skin. She saw her arms less defined, she lost all her muscule looking like an avarge Asari, but tallar than avarge. 6 foot 2, she looked streched somehow, maybe these people at this station might have answers on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went out of the lab doors finding a M8 Assult rifle mk 7 with an enhanced scope and a rocket, She had no combat armor so she sat in a croched position when her biotics flared up in a bright shining red light that was so strong that the hostile mech at the otherside of the room melted into a goe on the floor. \"That\u00b4s interesting\" Commented Shepard on her super burst of biotic power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe later found a dark skined man that were firing at some mech at the other catwalk bridge on the other side of the room. He pulled a mech up in the air in a blue bright flash of light that caused a singularity that crushed the mech at the same time he shoot it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you know what going on here and with me?\" Asked the now blue asari commander Jane Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to uplighten you later but first we must find Miranda and get out of here to talk to the Illusive Man.\" Said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know what\u00b4s happend to me!\" Said Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, far as I know, you been dead for 2 years, and reviving you under all that time was not easy. We had to experiment, I would be lying if I said a little\". Said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, continue please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to rewrite your DNA structure because the blodcells were expanding when the revival process was initiated, so we understood that reviving you to what you ere before was not possible. We enhanced your body with Element Zero, a stronger variant, that makes yor biotic flare up red instead of blue, I dont know why but doeas it matter?\" Said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im ok with that,  but why change me to an asari completly!?\" Said Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either you become an Asari by the extracted DNA to repair you and delete 90% of Human DNA was necessary to keep you alive. If we hadent do it you could look like a Frankenstein, a deformed abomination.\" Said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense. Let\u00b4s move out.\" Said Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sprinted down the hallway into the hangar bay while they conversed and chated while crushing down some mech\u00b4s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else I should know about?\" Asked Shepard while her gut made a large growl like a loud horn froma boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A side effect from your Biotic enhancement maked you urge for food and energi more often, What you did to those heavy mech back there should make you pretty drained. I mean look at them, you completly seperated the atoms and molecyles from each other wich caused the mechs to dissolve to nothing.\" Said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard Nodded while she found an protein bar or a couple of them and showed them down her throat while she ran to an air lock where the cerberus shuttle waited and miranda as well.<br>\r\nShe unwrappeled a rather hude bar and at it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We dont have time to eat now, were still in a fire zone\" Said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I been dead for two years and my appetite is larger, so why wait any further.\" Said Shepard. A bulge jutted slightly out from the Asari Shepards gut.<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard escaped the facility with the help of a man named Jacob.

It\u00b4s common knowlege for everyone, fat is stored energi, saved for times when more energi is required. Like your Biotics, far as research goes it can make Biotics stronger and more durable.

Throughout the dwindling rest of her meal she took small-ish bites that soon began to increase in size, satisfying her more and more, yet leaving her cravings growing stronger everytime they resurfaced. In addition to the large amount of food she was already practically inhaling, Miranda wound up going through all three bars she had packed with her onto the excursion. Unlike last time, her swelling stomach had made short work of her belt soon after the second bite, popping open by itself and allowing the marvelous belly to stretch itself across the raven-haired woman's lap. She let out a groan of relief once it had, finally free of the constraining leather. Her now large breasts threatened the global standard of decency itself, looking very well to spill over the small opening in her uniform in a tidal wave of boobage. Her tummy formed a taut ball, as if she were pregnant for a good 7 months, something that strangely gave a sense of warmth to Miranda. Her ponderous booty, always a prize among her perfect body, grew even more ponderous by the minute, filling out the chair she made residence in and causing the material of her hexagonal uniform to chafe and squeak with every light movement she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon but Miranda was shocked to learn, she gained a partial amount of weight.

She literally could feel her stomach stretch further with every one she ate. The straps on her bio suit had long given up and snapped from the extension and rounding of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was something to see, it was rounder and bigger than if she were pregnant. To the touch even through the bio suit it was very warm and soft. It heaved significantly up and down as she struggled to breath, its size impeding her lungs. It visibly swelled just a bit larger as another donut had found its resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down to eat some more, but found it was all gone. All the food had been eaten. In its place was a massive dome roughly the size of a beach ball connected to a young woman who had defied what was possible. She had turned into a absolute glutton, who was more gorgeous than any.

Pulling up her omni-tool, she ran a few diagnostics on the system. \"It's software.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well where is it coming from?\" Orianna demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the Reaper mainframe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she made that realization, the screens flickered again and returned to normal, showing the research Orianna was trying to complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to run a diagnostics on the whole system,\" Orianna said, rapidly punching up the scanners. \"I don't know what's going on but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ping!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna's jaw dropped as the results of the full system sweep popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't...those usually take a couple hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda leaned over to look at the results. \"That...that level of efficiency increase is impossible. The computers would melt if they ran that fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well everything's running perfectly. I...I think the Reapers just turbocharged all of our systems,\" Orianna realized. \"We could do a day's work in fifteen minutes at these speeds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim, Miranda checked for news updates on her omni-tool. To her amazement, the information came in crystal clear on the first try, like she was standing right on the Citadel promenade, and it showed the same stories all around the galaxy. Every computerized system and mechanism had downloaded the Reaper's programming and supercharged their efficiency to absurd levels. Things would be getting so easy and simple that people would have to find other things to fill their time, it seemed. Utterly amazed, Miranda glanced out the window at the Reaper floating obediently outside the research station, a tear rolling down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still full of surprises, aren't you Shepard?\" Miranda choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Javik, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prothean looked up sullenly from the computer monitor. \"Tracking the movements of the Reapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky the new upgrades mean I can automate almost all of my Shadow Brokering now,\" Liara teased as she walked up behind Javik and wrapped her arms around him. \"Speaking as someone who finds paranoia a valuable trait...you're being too paranoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bands of Reapers are going through asteroids, mining for rare minerals,\" Javik grumbled. \"Possibly for construction of new superweapon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or they're gathering resources for industries to help them speed up too,\" Liara explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard should have let them die,\" Javik scowled. \"It nauseates me to see them so highly regarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Javik, these aren't the same Reapers you fought all those millennia ago,\" Liara responded coolly. \"If anything, they're more Shepard then Reaper. Some people are even starting to call them Shepards, in fact.\" The Asari walked around to Javik's side and gave him a peck on the cheek, right below two of his eyes. \"I understand not trusting the Shepards...but can you at least trust me on this? She wouldn't let the Reapers come back and undo everything she fought for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prothean sighed, then finally closed out of the reports. \"I will still be monitoring them, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have something else you could monitor,\" Liara replied, stepping back and coyly undoing her bathrobe, letting it fall around her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sincerely doubt you could have anything of interest to...monitor...\" Javik stopped turning in the chair when he saw his lover standing there wearing nothing but a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...stand corrected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you've seriously run out of room?\" Samantha Traynor said incredulously, thinking she misheard her friend over the din of the Citadel eatery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As incredible as it sounds, yes,\" Admiral Tali'Zorah repeated herself a little louder, sipping her fruity drink from the induction port \"Our need for food supplies has gone drastically down over the last few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha Traynor let out a low whistle, leaning back in her chair. \"That's going to be interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the Reapers are doing to the soil on Rannoch, it's been incredibly effective,\" Tali recounted. \"We've hit levels of dextrograin and sugar production we weren't expecting to reach for years in a matter of weeks. We've even abolished the rationing system and we're still just overflowing with foodstuffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nuts,\" Samatha replied. \"Though not surprising, we're having the same issue with our own food supplies being over capacity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali laughed. \"I almost have to wonder where all that food is going to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness for the Reapers,\" Samatha said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pregnant pause between the two, filled by the background noise in the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tali,\" Samatha continued. \"You don't think Shepard could still be...in there, do you?\" She pointed up towards the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of people think so,\" Tali suggested. \"I'm hearing a lot of people call the machines 'Shepards' now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali stared down at her hands, lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd...like to think she's up there, taking care of us,\" Tali admitted. \"It's...better then believing she's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha smiled. \"I feel the same exact way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies,\" the waiter interrupted. \"Would you care to peruse the desserts menu? We have a two for one special going on, seeing as there's so much food to get rid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't argue with that!\" Samantha said, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(And after that doozy of a setup, consider this sort of a triple free choice, because there's really only one direction for this to go ;) )</span></div></div>",

Oriana asked, popping the last of the fried rice pasta balls into her mouth after dipping it in the calorie heavy sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'd like them better if I had more of them,' Miranda smiled, politely slurping down some linguini alfredo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and her sister sat at the dining table of the repurposed Cerberus research station the two called home. Both beautiful brunettes wore formal evening gowns, having decided it appropriate to don formal wear for the first real meal they'd had in months. Miranda was in a jet black short dress that showed off her spectacularly athletic legs, hugged tight to her lean hips and rock hard backside and dipped low to demonstrate her large, perky breasts. Her younger sister Orianna was dressed more demurely, wearing the blue gown she'd worn to prom, a more proper floor length dress that still showed off a genetically flawless physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Lawsons were perfect, although slightly different. Miranda had a curvier, more athletic physique with muscles on her legs and larger breasts, while Orianna's mostly daintier body made her profoundly round ass all the more surprising. Right now they were separated by a long metal table that was heavy with pasta dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry, they were just so good!' the littler Lawson sister smiled, 'after so long on military synthetic rations some real food was too tasty to resist.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And who knew you were such a good cook,' Miranda smiled, putting a hand on her own stuffed stomach, all the pasta bulging her perfect abs out a little, 'we're learning all kinds of things about each other doing this research.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah..., I'm glad we're getting to spend some time together,' Orianna agreed, eyes flicking up from the alluring sign of gluttony on her perfect sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had been researching ways their own improved genetics could help others since the end of the war. Miranda's cover girl looks came with a nobel prize winner's brain, capable of undoing death with the right resources, and Orianna was shaping up to be a great assistant. They'd made progress over coming the fertility controlling limit their father had put on them and were working on a way to give the same perfection to others as adults. Still, the little feast of Reaper delivered food stuffs was a welcome break. The military rations they'd been subsisting on in the massive Cerberus station were both bland and barely enough to get by on, Mirada's skin tight cat suit had even been getting a little loose as her food starved boobs deflated from E to mere DDs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had seemed a real tragedy to Orianna. Not on the scale of the reaper war of course, but sad enough to cry over in private. She'd always been fairly flat chested and the sight of her sister's gigantic Eezo tanks had awakened something in her at first glance. Part of her own desire to work here was to find a way to boost her own B cups up to the same size and part of it was just getting to be close to those huge funbags...but now, she was strangely more interested in the little food baby poking out against her sister's dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its a shame we can't eat like this everyday,' Orianna ventured feeling her own taut tummy's magnificent roundness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much more appealing than it being flat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'd get fat wouldn't we...,' the younger Lawson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Of course not Ori,\u2019 Miranda told her, \u2018we can\u2019t gain weight\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018...we can\u2019t?\u2019 Orianna asked, suddenly down cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, not above a certain amount anyway,\u2019 the older woman told her, \u2018140 lbs is my set weight, once I\u2019m there I\u2019ll stay there.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So why don't we eat until we get to our set weights then?' Orianna asked, 'after all we've been working so hard...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well when you put it that way...,' Miranda agreed, thinking that it would do no harm.</span></div></div>",

Her and her sister's genetics had been hardwired to burn away any excessive adipose past a certain limit; they could eat twenty meals a day and drink protein shakes at every meal and they wouldn't see an inch of extra flab or poundage on their perfect bodies, and there was no reason to assume that the food the Reapers helped to grow would change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the rub though, the Reapers were not just helping to harvest it, they dusted the crops with chemicals hidden in deep space that helped it to grow incredibly fast. Outside of some Quarians thinking that it made food taste a little better, the chemicals used to make the food were harmless to the other species in the galaxy, with one small caveat; an immunity from certain calorie burning genetic markers that a few humans possessed, and that Miranda's father had copied into his \"daughter's\" genetic coding to create the perfect humans. Thus, with the combination of the unintentional genetic sabotage and the Lawson sisters confidently eating as much as they liked without fear of consequence, the results came quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna for her part was enjoying eating succulent meals with her sister too much to notice her pants size steadily climbing or how she got seconds and thirds more often, until something literally snapped mid-meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>snap</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrinna went wide-eyed as she felt the pressure around her chest loosen suddenly, dropping her fork full of rigatoni in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter?\" Miranda asked, dabbing her widening cheeks gently with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urm...nothing much...\" Orianna replied, quickly turning red. \"Excuse me a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing herself away from the table, the younger Lawson made her way to her room and into her private bathroom as quickly as she could, stepping over discarded shirts and pairs of pants that she had thrown on the ground out of frustration after they didn't quite fit her, and grabbing an unused bra from her drawer. Stopping in front of a mirror, Orianna tugged off her shirt in one smooth motion, her bra fluttering to the ground gently. The bra that she just snapped the strap off. With trembling fingers, Orianna took the new bra and started arduously putting it on, snapping the fastener into place with some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a perfect fit. Orianna felt like singing; she was a DD-cup now! A perky, perfectly round DD-cup!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna took a step back and performed a sexy swivel in front of the mirror, admiring her curves. Her sister had been dead wrong about the limits to her weight, and here was the incredibly alluring proof. The younger Lawson had steadily inflated into a big, sexy hourglass, her wide hips flaring out from the sides and overflowing any chair she sat in and her large rear end making her sit a few inches higher in said chair. Looking down past her new set of funbags, she could just barely see the tips of her toes past the heavy gut she now sported, with love handles that tried desperately to match her hips and thighs in width. Even her shoulders and upper arms had widened out to help support her still round and perky DD cup. Orianna smiled at herself, her double chin widening and hinting at a third on the way. She had blown past that one hundred forty limit with ease, probably even doubling that limit and speeding towards the three hundreds. She was so big and sexy now, and unafraid to admit that she was excited to see how much bigger and sexier she could get!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Orianna thought as she put her shirt back on over the new bra, she had a meal to get back to. Rushing back to dinner, eager to pile more pounds onto her frame, Orianna arrived back at the table to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Orianna was stuffing her new boobs into a bra, her sister was busy stuffing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elegant emblem of human genetic perfection was no more. Miranda's slinky cat suits and elegant civilian clothes were abandoned for loose shirts and stretchy athletic shorts. Well, they'd started out as loose and stretchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now the brunette's tentish tee was a second skin over her puffy shoulders, its sleeves cutting into her new lunch lady arms, pressing her saggy tatas flat and riding up over her spare tire. Her deepening belly button showed, as did the pair of purple stretch marks on each side of it, the thin black fabric clearly showed her stretched nipples and at its corners was starting to split under the relentless pressure of her bulky frame. Meanwhile, the stretchy shorts had a life span of hours, its seams making small ripping sounds as Miranda's ballooning buns, pillar thick thighs, door brushing hips and floppy fupa pushed them to their limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Oriana was a plus size hour glass, Miranda was a blob. Her narrow waist had ballooned into a bean bag slab starting to bifurcate, her athletic legs had grown thick and clumsy from swollen cankle to chafing thighs, taut ass cheeks swelled into cellulite coated beach balls and her fabulous breasts had plunged, losing their perk and being partly swallowed up by her expanding chest fat. Now they flapped against her chest and would barely fill up a C cup (not that she'd worn a bra in weeks), giving her a shapeless, humiliatingly plush figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This pasta is exquisite, but I'd prefer some more breadsticks,' Lawson told herself after her sister shuffled off, leaning across the table on one thick, wobblingly weak arm to grab the basket of fried, buttery bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table let out a worrying groan, but Miranda ignored it. Furniture design had taken a hit during the war. Everyone knew that. When her gargantuan buns slapped into the chair, which itself nearly screamed, it reinforced her ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA floppy jowl flapped and flopped as her well exercised jaw chowed down on the bread, tongue licking up parmesan powder. Where Oriana had only put on enough face fat to become a little cherubic, Miranda's visage was a ruin of its former aesthetic glory. Her cheeks were round, red and puffy, burying her patrician features. Her nose had broadened out, losing its point and her delicate chin was a small bump over the droopy flap of her jowls. Even her big blue eyes had become piggish, shrinking down as her face puffed out around them. A faint but growing dusting of adult acne testified to the amount of fried food in her diet, while her jet black hair was no longer quite so shimmery, hanging limply to her hunched shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh God, how did I ever live without garlic butter?' Miranda said with a groan of pure, near sexual joy and pushed away the empty basket, stomach sloshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose up with a groan of her knees, having to use her hands to push up her 284 lb hulk of a body off her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna hurried back to the kitchen and saw her sister's bulky torso filling up the open fridge, ass flab hanging from her disintegrating shorts and stacked rolls of back fat leading up to a set of beefy back boobs bigger than her front set anymore. Miranda turned around, arms full of 10 gallon ice cream containers, heavy mixing bowls, tubs of whip cream and enough chocolate sauce to bathe in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just in time for desert!' the obese ex operative smiled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One ice cream massacre later and both genetically engineered sisters sat back in their chairs, groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groans came from both the stuffed women, who's appetites over the past few months had skyrocketed, and from the chairs which were not designed for women of this size. Both sisters were in the 280s now and it didn't matter how it was carried, both were damn heavy and the average woman was a hundred and forty pounds smaller than either. Orianna was considering it practically, she liked being this big and wanted to get bigger, to round out and chub up, to keep growing her generous breasts and shapely hips. And the fluffy paunch her girl abs had softened into was cute all things considered, she was interested to see how it would go. She knew from browsing old, ancient internet databases that there were people out there who liked soft figures, a rarity since the end of earth's obesity epidemic a century ago and felt no shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did consider the issues of getting bigger: stronger furniture, wider tubs, their increasing laziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting fat would be hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda on the other hand had dealt with getting fat, the thing she said was impossible, by piling denial atop denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her pants began to get tight she blamed the laundry and ordered the clothing printer to make ones tailored to her, without telling her the measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her tight abs melted into a gut that pushed against her belt, Miranda 'forgot' to wear it that day and every day after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her chin began to double in her reflection, the former operative simply stopped looking at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the midnight snacks made getting up early to work out too hard, she stopped working out early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her thighs began to chafe, her whole body jiggled and her joints got sore when she jogged, she stopped jogging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her late rising and big breakfasts left only two hours in the morning before lunch break, Miranda stopped researching in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen some quirk of genetic engineering and reaper made food made her formidable bustline loose three cup sizes in as many months to become sloppy, floppy pancakes that barely filled up Oriana's old C cups much less the DDD cup bras Miranda owned even as her rapidly expanding back fat began to make fastening the bands impossible, she stopped wearing bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the long avoided scale reported that the missing five pounds had returned with fifty three friends, the scale went out the airlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she polished off her first box of cereal in the morning, a Shepherd recreated formula called 'Cinnamon Toast Crunch', and going and getting another was too hard, Miranda used her biotic powers to haul it over instead of getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the research station's facial recognition protocols stopped recognizing the porcine features of her face as Miranda Lawson's mathematically perfect cheekbones, Miranda simply turned off the facial scanners and used an old id card with the face blurred out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenial piled atop denial, burying the warning signs of advanced medical knowledge and basic comic sense alike into a sediment of insanity until now, months later the pasta and ice cream stuffed blob of a woman with ice cream and chocolate around her lips' denial had become hard as rock in her denial. Miranda was fully convinced that she was still the same leggy stunner as she'd been before, still athletic, gorgeous, lean and dangerous instead of lazy, grotesque, obese and pathetic. When she looked down and saw the sloppy, bulging, roll covered slopes of her torso her mind mentally corrected it all to neat, trim and muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came at a cost though. So much double think used up a fantastic amount of mental energy, leaving the once chipper Miranda mentally lazy. It wasn't that she was stupid by any means, but her laser like focus had faded away and her eyes glazed over when ever she had to read anything. She hadn't done any research in weeks, spending most of the day in a food coma, floating in the tub or playing video games in VR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh this is all so delicious,' Oriana said as she polished off the last of her ice cream, wiping whipped cream off her cleavage, 'maybe I should have a second helping. What do you think?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's blue eyes went over to her sister, taking in how the once skinny, flat chested girl was now a squishy hour glass with a well fed paunch. That paunch was fully exposed, as Oriana's standards of dress had vanished with her jaw line. Instead of a fancy dress or a business like jump suit, she now only wore stretchy shorts and t-shirts all day. It was pathetic, seeing her look like a slob with her ice cream swollen gut exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think that you've taken this a little too far,' Miranda told her, rising up with a grunt and waddling to her sister, in her own mind rising easily and strutting sultrily, 'you've gotten fat Ori.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...Of course I have,' the confused younger sister said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she was fat, she'd been fat for months. What was hers sister thinking bringing it up? Would she bring up her black hair next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This has gotten completely out of hand,' Miranda said, pinching Ori's drum taut gut for emphasis, then sitting a hand on her own groaning stomach which Orianna took as an admittance of her own obesity, 'tomorrow we're going to start up a vigorous workout regimen for you. I hope you enjoyed yourself, but you're not allowed to get any bigger from now on! Rest well, I'll see you at 6 am!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost tripping, Miranda turned on her heel and waddled off, stopping to grab another basket of bread sticks to munch on the way to bed. Orianna watched her ass wobbled from side to side in shock and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah she'd gotten fat, but so had her sister. And yes, it had done a number on Miranda's physique, blimping out everything but her tits but if she was unhappy about it why take it out on her sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its not like it matters, she hasn't gotten up before 9:30 in weeks,' Ori muttered, making herself a second set of deserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So determined was Miranda Lawson to whip her lardy sister into shape that she woke up five hours before normal. Her body was pumped with an energy not found in weeks and she practically bounced out of bed and hurried to the clothing printer station. Not that fast of course given Miranda's own ludicrously poor physical condition but the obese woman had a look of determination on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Exercise outfit options,' she ordered the computer, only slightly out of breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything from simple shorts/shirt combos to leggings to skin tight body suits to things that were barely bikinis flashed in front of her eyes, on 3d models of perfect fitness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah this skimpy one, with the V cut thong and the sports bra. It should shock her into losing weight. Get me that exercise outfit for a woman of 5'8 and 290 lbs for user L2, body type hour glass with some extra in the waist' Miranda ordered the computer, 'and then measure one for user L1. It should flaunt what I have enough to further shame her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd automatically avoided anything that might put her own actual measurements in front of her face, automatically looking away as the laser calipers measured her dumpy flesh. But when the shockingly large fabric was printed out, Miranda quickly slid the p her lardy legs until her flabby ass hung out the thong and her FUPA pressed at the front, then shrugged her shrunken, sloppy tits into the sports bra. The half way insane operative ran her hands up her sides and stomach, imagining that the cellulite rolls and bulges were taut abs and lean obliques. When she cupped the saggy ruins of her previously spectacular breasts she didn't let herself feel the shrunken remnants but the huge, firm boobs she'd used to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh once she sees me she'll have to exercise,' Miranda smiled, not at the mirror of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later she was in Orianna's room, the other obese Lawson was snoring cutely in suited PJs, the silky fabric unopened to let a stomach stuffed taut with midnight ice cream runs to rise and fall. Miranda shook her head, pony tail bobbing and chins waggling, as she considered how bad Orianna had let herself go and put a silver whistle to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'AAAAHHhhhhh!' her sister screamed as the shrill squeal hit her hears and she sprang up, tits bouncing so hard they broke a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rise and shine, Ori!' Miranda smiled, puffy hands on her obese hips, 'today's the first day on the road to recovery!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe station's gym was state of the art, featuring gravity alterable weight stations and advanced biometric monitoring. It was also very dusty, having not been used since Miranda's jiggling got so noticeable she'd stopped working out lest she think of herself as fat. Miranda ignored the dust, just as she ignored how she was pouring out of her outfit. Ori followed after, miserably tugging at the skimpy outfit that put a tinge of embarrassment on her cheeks and amazed that her sister was flaunting her dumpy figure in an identical outfit. Her body confidence must be off the charts to flaunt herself like that, even if it was in front of her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not really sure if I want to work out...,' Ori whined as Miranda ushered her to a weight bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ori, dear, sweety, I love you but you've turned into butter,' her older sister said sweetly, poking her siblings gut, 'this was flat a year ago, ever since the Shepherds started giving us food you've become a complete butterball. A girl your age shouldn't look like this! What will those boys you had crushes on at school think to see you all rolly polly?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOri blushed, she might love her new tits but she did have to admit that her body was a bit fluffier than normal by a hundred pounds or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I guess that's true...,' she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, let's start pumping...' the operative grinned evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later and Ori was a rubbery pile of pain. Long retired muscles screamed and muscle groups she'd never thought she'd had complained under her fat. The sweaty hulk of the genetically perfect woman groaned as her sister helped her off the last weight machine and patted her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'oh good job lovey,' Miranda told her with pride, 'let's go get you some high protein breakfast to build those muscles now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But what about you?' Ori gasped, sucking cold water with desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Me?' Miranda asked, 'what about me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aren't you going to work out?' Ori asked</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Now...,' Miranda said softly, dulled, confused mind scrambling for reasons to object, 'well I guess I can...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind Miranda Lawson was still an amazing athlete who had a sinewy strength to her limbs. The firm pecks under her impressive boobs could bench nearly two hundred pounds while her bulging, rock hard buns weren't for show, she could squat three times her own body weight with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, could was the operative word here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiling fat had smothered her muscles under its embrace. As her appetite had grown Miranda's physical abilities had degraded, her mile time falling and her bench weight falling as she spent day after day too uncomfortably full to work out. Instead of working out every day it had been every three or four, then every couple weeks, each increasingly pathetic until the previously perfect brunette was so out of shape she'd stop going to the gym lest she have to confront the evidence growing out of her workout gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, it'll do you good,' Orianna suggested through a pant, pushing her butter ball of a sibling into the bench machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Set the gravity pull to ...,' Miranda's tongue almost said two hundred before she corrected herself, 'automatic.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple process, the muscles in her chest and arms pushed up against the gravitonic bar from its resting place, and as soon as the 45lbs were all hers to hold up, it came down unnervingly fast against her deflated chest and the bar adusted itself to her maximum strength. Miranda's deflated muscles offered so little resistance to the minimum weight that by the time her floppy dugs had jiggled under the impact it had reset itself to the physical therapy setting, under the assumption its user was either very elderly or very ill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on, push!' Oriana yelled, looking down her own pert tits to her sisters' pie round face, which had gone beat red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'AAAAHHHH!' Miranda screamed, pushing the 25 lb bar off her chest with a great lurch of terrible form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floppy beauty was more exhausted when she was done with the bench presses than she'd ever been. Her pecs burned like they'd been hit with an incendiary round and her arms trembled while sweat poured off of her.Both arms were soon on fire as Oriana dragged her over to the bicep curls, which began at ten pounds and declined to five as Miranda's sloppy crunches continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And onto the ab workouts!' Ori cried, her own face red at seeing just how pathetic her sister had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been easy for Orianna to forget that they'd used to be in such good shape. In school with her foster family she'd never tried to excel as an athelete, having been more of a computer nerd, just doing a few fun sports and had done very well at them without effort. As much as she'd loved her tits it had been a startling realization to find out just how out of shape she'd come. By no means did this make Ori want to slim down again but she realized she needed to spend more time in the gym...especially as it meant seeing what a pig her sister had become. The thrill Ori had gotten at seeing her sister inflate and deflate by area had been intense, horribly but intense, but seeing the perfect Miranda Lawson struggle with the bare minimum? That was something else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was wheezing by the time they got to the squats, once her favorite exercise, one she'd spent long hours doing. Just bending and thrusting had been a thrill, feeling her firm booty bounce and flex...now it filled her with dread she couldn't acknowledge, less she have to admit to herself that she wasn't perfect, wasn't fit, wasn't even healthy, that she was just a fat blob who couldn't even exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ready?' Orianna asked as her sister staggered under the next bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Urrrrrrr,' Miranda groaned, mind working harder than her body to not let herself recognize the symptoms of being severely out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Squat!' her sister yelled, watching the basketball buns of her sister swallowed her workout panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's perfect squat form had gone the way of her perfect figure. Her drop was lazy, uncoordinated and dangerous to her well being, muscles complaining of over strain immediately and her back bent. Her thighs slapped against each other and against her gut and a great wheeze of air went out of Miranda as she tried to stand back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on, you can do it!' Ori yelled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I...I...,' Miranda gasped as seams ripped along her panties.</span></div></div>",

Smugglers are hardly a pressing issue anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not slacking off in your duties, are you mother?\" the younger Asari teased. \"Imagine the scandal if the legendary Justicar was lazy in her quest for justice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them shared a laugh as they entered the front doors of the monastery, still bearing battle damage from the Reaper's invasion of Lesuss. It had been one of the many scars left after what the machines did to the Asari that lived here, but thanks to the Shepard's benevolence, the wounds were slowly healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad to see you are coping well,\" Samara said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been keeping busy, mother,\" Falere responded. \"Even with the drones made by the Shepards, there's still a lot of damage to repair, and it feels like the crops and plants we grow are coming in every other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grew your own food here?\" Samara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, it was mostly done to help control our urges, but whatever the Shepards did has been making our farmland incredibly potent. We barely need foodstuffs from Thessia anymore, but they're still sending us twice as much as before. It's no wonder half of us are turning to eating to control ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does feel as though food is more commonplace, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a laugh, though more subdued as they approached a rather touchy subject as of late. Sure things were wonderful between them; Falere had opened up to her mother in ways she never would have done back in the old days, and Samara had loosened her devotion to the Justicar code so that she could spend more time being a mother then a galaxy-roaming crimefighter, but there was still a notable elephant in the room, and neither woman was willing to broach the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Falere smiled and didn't pay any mind to the potbelly bulging out the front of her mother's outfit, tried not to feel how wide she was getting when they embraced, and bit her tongue when her mother smiled at her and her puffy face hinted at a double chin. Likewise, Samara looked the other way when her daughter adjusted the dress tightening around her hips, politely ignored the meatiness of her daughter's arms bulging from the sleeves, and feigned deafness when a slight burp escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, would you care to join us for dinner?\" Falere asked her mother kindly. \"We've been working on a rather interesting stew, I believe you may enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara could feel her stomach rumbling already. \"I certainly hope so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..and they're considering disciplinary charges against me.

Grumbling, Jack fished around in her pockets for a credit chit and dropped it into the jar with a soft clink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally baited me there,\" Jack snarled, though a friendly grin was creeping onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're buying me lunch because of it,\" Kahlee responded, patting the belly that hung over her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna need to swear more to buy you lunch,\" Jack shot back, prodding her friend's love handles gently. \"Getting soft after the war, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takes one to know one,\" Kahlee shot back, gesturing towards Jack's own blooming potbelly. Indignantly, Jack tugged her jacket tighter over her exposed navel and mumbled something about hitting the gym after work. \"Seriously though Jack, the war's over, you can't get away with manhandling your students like that anymore,\" Kahlee continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Habits are kinda hard to break,\" Jack admitted, gesturing towards her stomach again. \"As indicated by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try and use a softer hand, okay? I'd hate to see you leave, you've been one of the best instructors the Ascension Project has had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smirked as she reached over to fish around in a large box of donut holes, popping a few into her mouth at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not planning on going anywhere just yet, blondie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and we'll be able to raise the center section by tomorrow and get the holographs up and running the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I want this place back in business as soon as possible,\" Aria T'Loak ordered, strolling into the remains of the Afterlife club for the first time since retaking Omega. The scars of battle were almost wiped away as Batarian and Vorcha laborers milled around, working tirelessly to restore the club to its former glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually this would be a good time to add some safety features, miss,\" the contractor piped in, a pudgy Turian female by the name of Sennea. \"I was looking at the old plans, and there were definitely some corners cut when the place was built originally. The ring around the center in particular can't support a lot of weight, for instance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't plan on keeping shipping containers on it, just the dancers,\" Aria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but you don't exactly want them to fall, do you? Never know what could happen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria stewed, wanting so very much to be irritated with this Turian, but she couldn't deny she had a point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, reinforce the ring and anything else you don't find standard. Just don't go breaking the budget, got it?\" This was a lie, as money really wasn't an issue for Aria thanks to the fervor she stirred up when she took back her asteroid, but she had to show some sort of control over this Turian or she'd be building a second Citadel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!' Sennea said, giving a salute before heading off to continue the job, her backside gently swaying back and forth. Aria wouldn't have noticed...okay she absolutely would have noticed either way, the girl was pretty cute...if her rear didn't seem to be slightly bigger then the last time she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, that wasn't why she arrived today. That was waiting for her upstairs. Spotting the entrance to what was once her upstairs lounge, she dismissed her guards with a wave of her hand and strode through, heading up the stairs until she reached her loft. The walls still needed a paint job and the old flooring was still there, scorch marks and bullet holes aplenty, but it still had that amazing view of the club floor, the atmospheric controls set at her preferred temperature, and above all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria ran her hand across the surface of the brand new sofa, sadly not the one she had grown to love so much, but just from the feel of it she knew it would be a worthy successor. She lowered herself into the center like a queen entering her throne, crossing her legs and sitting in her usual pose. Then, after a quick glance to make sure no one was spying through the windows, Aria stretched out and undid her belt buckle, letting the gut she had concealed in a very tight outfit spill onto her lap before spreading out her arms and reclining, gently stroking her exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...it's good to be back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So far, so good. Hey, this machine goddess thing isn't too hard after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's nice to be able to take care of everyone this directly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it's kind of weird to see some people starting to worship me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...I wonder what else I can get this Reaper tech to do?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The days when a Reaper appearing in the skies over a planet heralding impending doom were, instead the reformed machines brought a sense of serenity and security. Even as a destroyed landed on the surface of Horizon and promptly set about doing nothing at all, not a single person thought anything of it. The presence of the Shepards had been embraced as a simple fact over the years since the Battle of Earth, a sign to everyone that the dark days of the galaxy were behind them. It was this serenity that left Ashley Williams, and indeed many soldiers like her, in an odd place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter uniting to fight a single common enemy, the many species and factions in the Milky Way were in no hurry to go back to fighting each other. The Geth and Quarians were peacefully coexisting on Ranoch, while the Krogan kept cool relations with both the Turians and Salarians as they reintegrated into galactic society. Even the Vorcha and Batarians were quieter. All this made for a stable galaxy, and a stable galaxy left little to do for the militaries of the Milky Way. Indeed, with no one to fight, there was no reason to maintain the massive fleets and armies that had been fielded to fight the Reapers, and they were slowly dissolved into much smaller, less bloated, more reasonable military forces. This lead to billions of military personnel, both those drafted to fight the Reapers and those that had made a career of soldiering, being relieved of their duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s how Ashley found herself back on Horizon, as a part of its colonial militia. She knew the planet and its internal politics well enough from all the time she spent on the planet many years ago, and while the Alliance may have no longer needed her service, her Williams blood kept her from simply quietly retiring from the life of a soldier. Still, though she had been given the job \u2014 as a Commander, no less \u2014 that didn\u2019t mean there was particularly much of a job <i>to do</i>. Aside from some scheduled patrols to maintain a sense of normalcy and control in the rebuilding colonists, there wasn\u2019t much need for the militia. Of course, that had been the case before, right up until the Collectors attacked, Ashley reminded herself as she looked up at the motionless destroyer. It still hadn\u2019t moved since it landed an hour ago, and it was starting to make Ashley feel a little antsy. If it really was Shepard controlling the Reapers, like so many seemed to believe, then Ashley knew the machines would be filled with noting but good intent, just like the woman herself, however she also knew it was always best to err on the side of caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was off duty, and watching the destroyer from a distance, Ashley was just about to go inside and armor up to investigate it when Samantha Traynor exited their prefab home to join her on the balcony, data pad in hand. The retired comms. specialist now ran monitored communications for the militia, and though she never had the hardened physique of combat personal while serving on the Normandy, her figure had grown even softer in the years since she had returned to her homeworld. Yet as Samantha speedily waddled over to her partner, Ashley\u2019s attention was drawn to her distressed expression she wore rather than the oh so alluring way her belly bounced in her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s\u2014\u201d Ashley began, but wasn\u2019t allowed to finish her thought, as Samantha forcefully handed the data pad over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to read this.\u201d She said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled by the unusual forcefulness from the specialist, Ashley looked down at the screen and did as she was told. Or, she tried to, at least. \u201cYeah, this just looks like a bunch of squiggles to me, Sam. You\u2019re gonna have to read it to me.\u201d She tried to crack a smile, but it couldn\u2019t hold up in the presence of her partner\u2019s serious demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Reaper code,\u201d Samantha explained as she snatched the data pad back, \u201ca new variant of it, as well. That destroyer is broadcasting across the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? Isn\u2019t that just something they do now?\u201d Ashley didn\u2019t really understand why Samantha was making such a big fuss over this, and wished she would just cut to the case. She knew Samantha thought she looked cute when she was confused, but if this was as urgent as she was acting like it was then this was not the time for dramatic pauses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like this. They\u2019ve been sending data, updates, information we can decrypt and use, but this new code is different. They don\u2019t want just anyone crack it. It\u2019s meant for someone specific. Me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 the Reapers are sending you secret messages? How do you know? Why would they even do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shook her head. \u201cThe Reapers aren\u2019t sending it. The key to crack the code is C1-G5.\u201d When Ashley continued to loom at her in confusion she could tell she needed to elaborate more. \u201cC1 and G5 are positions on a chessboard, and they are very special to me. Only one person knows their significance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, come on, out with it already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy king was on G5, and a bishop moved to C1 putting me into checkmate.\u201d Samantha couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at how ludicrous it all sounded, still not fully believing her conclusion herself. \u201cIt was the only time Shepard ever beat me at chess, and the last game we played before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s mouth hung agape. Did that mean\u2026 Jane was still alive? Somehow controlling the Reapers just like people said? \u201cWh-what did it say\u2026? When you decoded it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter typing in some code, Samantha turned the data pad around so Ashley could see the decrypted message on the screen. It was only one word. A question. One that convinced her that this really was a message from Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRematch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does this revelation mean for Shepard and her friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha is able to use the code to create a two-way connection, making it possible for Jane\u2019s friends to communicate with her directly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they find that the communication is only one way, but at least Shepard can let her friends know that she\u2019s all right, and that she\u2019s still looking out for them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The realization that Jane might be alive up there dropped like a bombshell. As Samantha took her data pad back to peruse through the code, Ashley staggered backwards, dropping heavily into her chair.. In spite of herself, she laughed through the tears streaming down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I just got over her being gone,\" Ashley choked, taking a deep gulping breath. \"And now here she comes strolling back again, just like she did on Horizon. Damn it, Shepard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's not exactly strolling back,\" Samantha admitted, turning around more of the code to show her. \"Unfortunately like most everything we've been getting from the Reapers it's been a one way street. I don't exactly see how we can communicate with...wait where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Ashley had all but jumped out of the chair, turning on her heel and heading right out the door. Samantha waddled behind her, already out of breath, and exited the prefab just in time to see Ashley raising her assault rifle in the direction of the landed destroyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha winced as a burst of automatic fire pierced the calm air, matched by metallic ricochets off the thick outer hull of the landed Reaper vessel. The destroyer shifted in its position but did not otherwise move or react to the wild weapons fire. Samantha on the other hand stomped up and punched Ashley in the shoulder, a move to which the seasoned combat veteran barely flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone insane?\" Samantha nearly shouted at her. \"Firing at a Reaper! You're going to get us killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill, you said Shepard's controlling them,\" Ashley placated her. \"I was just establishing a dialogue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"By going full Blasto on her?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's data pad suddenly blipped, indicating something new had been sent. The communication specialist furrowed her brow and plugged in the decoding variables she used before and looked at the resulting message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Ashley said expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...nice shooting, Ash.\" Samantha turned her data pad around to show her the message. Ashley smirked, patting the side of her rifle proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Establishing a dialogue,\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Ashley introduced herself by going Rambo on the Reaper, Samantha's data pad was flooded with new information from the same source as the two personal messages, forcing the two girls back inside to start decoding it. Or rather, forcing Samantha to start decoding it; Ashley on the other hand still had some raw emotions to deal with and had meandered into the kitchen to track down some comfort food and sate her emotional state. By the time Ashley had gotten into the rhythm of the decoding and translating, Ashley had returned to the communication center, two quarts of ice cream stacked on top of one another in her hands while she dug into the top one with a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you some mint chocolate,\" Ashley said thickly, passing the bottom quart and a spoon to her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Samantha popped the top off and took a big scoop to start with, her focus entirely on the information streaming in. The chair across from her creaked ever so slightly as Ashley and her hips plopped down into it. \"This is pretty intense stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's she saying to us?\" Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can glean parts of it.\" Samantha tapped a few buttons to bring up some diagrams and charts. \"Most of what she's sending us right now looks pretty ancient. Prothean tech maybe, but it's definitely tech. I think she wants us to try and build something, and since most of this looks like it functions on the same principles as some of the communications tech I work with, it may be something to help her talk to us directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley could feel tears coming on again and stuffed strawberry shortcake ice cream into her mouth to quell it. \"Well, what are we waiting for then? Let's put it together and say hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you miss the part where I said this is super ancient advanced tech?\" Samantha reiterated. \"There's no way we can make this thing on out own. I don't even know where to start on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley pursed her lips, swirling the melting ice cream idly with her spoon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>The galaxy had known war and conflict for so long that many felt the new peace wouldn't last, even if it was enforced by the Shepards. Yet as impossible a pipe dream as a galaxy without war was, after nearly half a year even the cynical were beginning to feel hopeful about the future. With the Shepards fueling the rebuilding, the major powers at the center of the galaxy had unleashed a golden age of peace and prosperity that spread throughout the known universe, and as those empires rose to new heights, others joined them in that lofty tower. The Krogans went through a cultural revolution that proved there was more to them then being mindless fighters, and the Batarian government was overthrown by a new meritocratic democracy, bringing a semblance of law and order to the farthest flung reaches of Citadel space. Both new empires would join the Citadel alongside the Quarians, whose homeworld had been restored to its former glory thanks to the Shepards, and as the farthest reaches of space were touched by the new peace, it seemed like the Galaxy was heading towards a period of true unity, in a universe that was getting smaller and smaller by the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shepards were the instruments of the new peace, but they were also the instruments of a new quirk of life in this united galaxy. The machine goddess driving them had a desire to take care of the universe she left behind, sharing the arcane tech of the Reapers with the public, mechanizing hard labor and unpleasant jobs, suppressing criminal elements, and providing the materials to ensure no one lived in poverty or squalid conditions. And perhaps because of the pre-goddess Shepard's own experiences seeing the toll starvation took on people, the Shepards always ensured food was plentiful and that no one would go hungry under her care. Shepard offered the galaxy unlimited abundance and leisure, and the people happily accepted. Sure a few were concerned as people got lazier, their stomachs swelling and their buttons popping off as they lived in this new world, but they soon melted away. After all, what was a couple dozen pounds or so compared to a peaceful, almost utopian galaxy that they all lived in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, the universe may have been getting smaller...but it was also getting bigger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the war ended and Shepard was declared \"missing in action\", Ashley Williams was surprised when Shepard's will stated that the apartment on the Citadel would go to her. It was a nice place, but it felt wrong to try to make it her home, so instead she went to Shepard's companions and friends with an idea; every year, on what would have been Shepard's birthday, they would meet at this apartment and throw a fun party in her memory, so as to keep her spirit alive (so to say, Ashley didn't even pretend to understand what Shepard being part of the Reapers meant these days). The others agreed to it readily, and now that today was the big day, Ashley was actually kind of excited to see everyone again, and to see the apartment the center of a great party once again. It'd be just like old times...even though the apartment did feel a lot smaller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party technically began in less than an hour, but people had already arrived to start filling up the room so Ashley positioned herself near the front to see if she could catch anyone familiar, grazing one of the many dozens of snack trays scattered around the room. She was glad there was only the one entrance; with all the buddha bellies and wide hips in here, you couldn't exactly see through the crowd. Taking a moment to crowd watch, Ashley's eyes darted between all the exposed love handles, torn seams, and double and triple chins adorning the guests as they chatted and snacked with one another. Aside from the occasional alien with weird metabolism, there probably wasn't anyone here who wasn't comfortably obese at this point. Nothing really wrong with that though; Ashley was herself on the larger end of the spectrum, but if the alternative to that was fighting and dying against a bunch of genocidal machines, Williams would wear these chins like badges of honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before she started to work on the snack platter with both hands, Ashley caught a familiar face coming in and, with a great huff, waddled towards the door to say hello.</span></div></div>",

All in all, her whole body had softened causing her to not exactly look pregnant, instead just that she had gained weight and quite a bit went to her middle. Her stomach had swollen out while her hips, thighs and breasts had each puffed out about equally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard steps in and inform his crew of some R&amp;R...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you two, just wanted to inform everyone about the 5-day break we\u2019ll be having starting today as soon as we dock at the Citadel.\u201d he informs them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, what brought this decision to fruition?\u201d Chakwas asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust figured that everybody was deserving of a break, so here it is.\u201d Shepard responds while leaning back against a wall and loosely folding his arms across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty generous of you, Commander\u201d Ashley speaks up with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I thought so too.\u201d he replies while waving to them and walking out of the doctor\u2019s quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the gained weight, her armor was starting to be a real pain to get in and out of and she was almost getting to the point of requesting lighter duty. One of the only reasons she hasn\u2019t yet is because she believes that if she does Shepard will think she has let herself go and is becoming lazy, and she doesn\u2019t want anything remotely close to that to go through his mind. While not aware to Ashley being pregnant, he was fully aware, as was the rest of the crew, to her weight gain. He didn\u2019t mind the added weight and truthfully he kind of thought the weight was making her look more beautiful as the days and weight went on. So he chose not to bring it up at all while it didn\u2019t seem to him that she was worried about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the first and last time Shepard would tell her that. Mere moments later the Normandy was attacked by a massive unknown alien ship that completely decimated the SR-1, and the Commander was killed getting Joker to an escape pod. The reports claimed that the hero of the Citadel died a painless death, killed instantly when thrown against a wall by an explosion, but Ashley knew the truth. The short range communicators in their helmets were still working, and she could hear the frantic gasps for air, followed by screams as Shepard was being cooked alive by the heat of entering the atmosphere of the planet below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory was too painful, so Ashley forced it down by forcing a cupcake down her mouth. It was made with rich chocolate batter, covered with a raspberry buttercream frosting, and topped with a fresh raspberry: absolutely delectable. With the tasty treat devoured, the soldier balled up the wrapper, then threw it into the trash. Swish, three points. Sighing, Ashley stood up from the table in the small prefab she was staying in while stationed on Horizon, and walked over to the locker where she stored her arms and armor. Unlocking it, Ashley her Phoenix X armor and began to put it on, noticing a new snugness to it as she did. \u201cDamn it; i need to lay of the sweets\u2026\u201d Ashley grumbled to herself, but it wasn\u2019t really just the sweets that caused her figure to softened; t was all the comfort eating making her plump up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much the only thing Ashley did in her free time was snack on anything that made her feel better. The trash in the corner of the room filled with the wrappers, bags, and boxes of junk food almost faster than she could stay on top of. Potato chips, candy bars, bonbons, pretzels, and of course cupcakes made up her diet, and who could know what she would be having for lunch. It made Ashley sick to think what would happen if she kept eating like this, but to her, so long as it kept her from thinking about Shepard.</span></div></div>",

There were quite of few: the pain her sister had gone through, the devastation of Earth, the sheer loss of life but at the forefront of her mind was John Shepard. Shepard was currently in the hospital, having been found near dead after the final battle. She had it on good word that he'd recover, those cybernetics that Cerberus had used on him truly saved his life. It'd be a while but he'd eventually get back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Ashley was glad for that, it reminded her of just how much she messed up their relationship and that she'd missed what they had had. Looking back on it, all the things she said, that she did...it made her sick. She had sounded so paranoid and had been unfair. Every turn she questioned, doubted Shepard. She had even accused him of being a traitor. The memories of that gnawed at her, even now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, Shepard had stayed civil and even kind towards her. When that Cerberus A.I. had sent her to Huerta, Shepard always made it his business to come see her. Reconnect with her, bring her a book from her favorite poet. Even when she even pulled a gun on him during the coup, he could have just shot her but instead talked to her. Believed in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she\u2019d given him nothing but betrayal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Well not anymore,\u2019</i> Ash thought, resolutely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to make it up to him and she knew just how.  After Shepard and her had officially gotten together, Ash had discovered a few magazines that had contained ladies of a...larger variety. Much larger. Naturally, she\u2019d confronted Shepard about it and him, being the honest, upright man that he was, he had come clean. He had stated that it was a preference but that was it and it didn\u2019t change anything between them. Ash had let the matter drop but now it was going to be her ticket to making things right again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018If I have to get to size of dreadnought to get my man back then that\u2019s all there is to it!\u2019 </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what should she do first? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley let out a long sigh as she crossed the threshold into her house, her sight blinded temporarily by the sunset shining through the windows. Doffing her coat, she tossed it onto the rack and rolled her stiff neck around; whoever said that a desk job was cushy and comfy was a damned liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay so technically it wasn't a desk job. Running security for the Systems Alliance embassy on Thessia meant she spent a lot of time on location going over patrol details and bodyguard rosters to ensure important diplomats and politicians were protected from anyone with a bright idea, but compared to running around fighting robot squids in space, it was by all accounts more of a desk job if anything else. Still, who would have thought years after the Reaper threat united the galaxy that there would still be nutjobs running around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley you're home!\" came a voice from the kitchen, along with a clanking series of pots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you!\" Ashley called back, smiling. \"I thought you were working late tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to surprise you!\" the voice called back in a sing-song tone. \"Plus I'm meeting with my therapist the day before you're doing the security detail for the Alliance president, so I wouldn't see you for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a few days,\" Ashley pointed out, walking into the dining room of her spacious apartment. She turned to face her wall of medals, slightly adjusting one diploma so it would be straight, when a pair of blue arms suddenly wrapped around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but for your species it must feel like an eternity,\" Aeian T'Goni teased her. \"I know it feels like that for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley giggled, turning around and locking lips with her lover in a tender embrace. She was right, it did feel like an eternity when she was away from her. In fact, Ashley didn't know how she managed to live before she met Aeian. She met her when she was still at the Huerta Memorial Hospital recovering from PTSD and they managed to make some light conversation, comparing their experiences dealing with their personal trauma and helping one another to cope with the ongoing war. The therapist said that Ashley had been enormously helpful in helping the poor Asari heal, and when she bumped into her on Thessia years later, it felt like she was right. Like Ashley, Aeian had retired from the service and had taken up an administrative position at a medical center, and she had come a long way from her days at the hospital, where she said that Ashley had really helped her recover from her phobia of humans. Needless to say the two reconnected quickly, only to find out they saw one another as more then just friends, and before you could say \"embrace eternity\", here was the most beautiful Asari in the universe moving into Ashley's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you want to go out tonight?\" Ashley said at last, coming up for air from the passionate embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Aeian said cautiously. \"I made dinner tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blinked in surprise. \"You cook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...my therapist recommended a course to help me on my bad days,\" Aeian explained, trotting back into the kitchen. \"I specialized in some human courses, figured it would help with my phobias and I thought you might like them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Asari cuisine fine, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll take that course next!\" Aeian laughed. \"Go ahead and take a seat, I'll bring out the dish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled as she pulled up a chair and dropped down heavily, glad to finally be off her feet again. She was actually somewhat excited for this; she hadn't had a home-cooked meal in quite some time. It felt like she was leaving mostly off of restaurants and junk food the past few years; frankly it was a miracle she was still relatively fit. Sure she had a slight bulge to her stomach since she started seeing Aeian, but that was probably because they went out for dinner so often. It hadn't been the first time a relationship had added a few inches to her waistline. Maybe a nice classic meal would be just what the doctor ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments a delicious smell emanated from the kitchen, and Aeian entered the room again, holding a steaming dish in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just tried something simple to start with, a sort of casserole made of noodles, Earth meats, and various cheeses and seasonings for a bit of 'alien flare', as the teacher called it,\" Aeian explained, scooping a nice serving for her girlfriend. \"Might need a little bit more Ginarian thestleroot...\" Ashley, always the marine, grabbed her fork and took a healthy bite of the casserole, slowly chewing it as her Asari lover looked on nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not any good, we can order out...\" Aeian suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it's pretty great!\" Ashley said brightly, greatly enjoying the familiar, savory taste. \"Very hearty, reminds me of what my dad would make for us.\" She took another big bite to prove it. \"Might even go 'fer seconds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeian, her eyes glowing, served herself a portion as well. \"If you want to try some more, I made an attempt at baking as well. I made something with chipped chocolate in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to,\" Ashley said, repressing a giggle. \"I can't wait to try more stuff you make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them shared a loving look, then tucked into dinner properly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley would have never thought she'd be able to re-adjust to civilian life post-Reapers. She was a soldier, descended from a long line of soldiers, practically born and raised to march with rifle in hand into the heat of battle. And yet, this new life of hers, a life that a younger Ashley would have been bored to tears having, was just something she couldn't imagine going without. It was just so blissful, coming home at the end of the day from a job well done and not having to worry about any ongoing war, Reaper or otherwise, not having to worry whether or not she wouldn't come back when she left tomorrow for another day on the field. She almost felt spoiled, and the lazy afternoons spent with Aeian over a home-cooked meal certainly helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeian in fact fit in so perfectly into the new routine that you'd think she had been here for years. With her loving girlfriend's support, she had made good progress with her therapy, even getting a big promotion at the medical center. Sadly this meant longer hours and a little less time spent together every night, but it gave Ashley the chance to surprise Aeian with a home-cooked meal of her own when her Asari lover came home after a rough day. This ended in predictable disaster since Ashley's culinary experience mostly boiled down to making an MRE edible, but after ordering out Aeian told her how much she appreciated the gesture and promised they could learn to cook together. And they did, finding their mutual interest in the culinary arts to be a wonderful thing to bond over and just strengthened their bond even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, Ashley loved everything about her life, especially the wonderful woman she dreamed about before waking up every morning. This particular morning, Ashley had a wonderful vision of the two of them together on a beach underneath two setting suns when the actual sunlight stirred her. Yawning, Ashley's first conscious observation was the other side of the bed being empty. It was the weekend so neither of them had work today, though the distant sound of the shower and the steam floating out from under the bathroom door frame hinted at where she was. Her second observation is that it was rather chilly today; shivering slightly, she heaved herself to her feet and shouldered into the steam-heated bathroom, immediately starting to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof, it's like a sauna in here!\" Ashley called out, fanning herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too,\" Aeian teased from inside the source of the steam, her hair tendrils just visible over the top of the shower wall. \"It is rather cold out today though, maybe something warm for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't go wrong with a nice big bowl of porridge on a cold day,\" Ashley recounted, waving away steam as she made her way to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the grain mixed with milk and water, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very same. Mix it with some sugar and strawberries and a hot cocoa on the side, it's just the thing for a start on a cold day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that sounds heavenly,\" Aeian swooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Ashley sighed wistfully, rubbing mist of the mirror with the palm of her hand. They talked about food a lot nowadays, and looking at her own reflection, Ashley could sort of see why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy shorts and tank top she slept it were practically skintight and left nothing to the imagination for all the wrong reasons now. A belly that could fill a salad bow perpetually hung over her waist, accompanied by nice thick love handles that flowed down to her flabby thighs. Sighing, Ashley pressed a hand underneath her formerly angular chin, now rounder and a little puffy to match her waistline as the shower turned off, the volume in the room dropping considerably. Sidestepping onto the electronic scale set up in the corner, she stretched her neck slightly so she could just about see the magic numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two freakin' forty...\" Ashley grumbled. \"Hell, I really got fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBare feet padded across the tiled floor and Ashley felt a hand on her shoulder as Aeian looked down at the number too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. What an utter tragedy,\" Aeian said dramatically, leaning into her girlfriend so their guts pressed together. \"I can't ever imagine what that's like...being so rotund like you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them shared a laugh that made them jiggle ever so slightly, treating Ashley to a similar display of adipose on her girlfriend. They shared a gut hanging in front of them, though Aeian's was a bit wider and while she had a towel wrapped around her top, her upper body had clearly swollen a bit from her sudden growth, her thick chin even doubling ever so slightly when she turned her head in the right direction, to say nothing of the twins hanging below it. Ashley had mentioned before that people in love tended to gain weight, and if that was indeed true, this HAD to be true love at this point. It would explain why it didn't seem to bother either of them that they were really starting to balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to go bundle up and get started on breakfast,\" Aeian decided. \"Unless you want to take a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I showered last night, I think I'm...\" Ashley started to say, before she became tongue tied at the sight of Aeian's towels lying on the ground around her legs. \"Oh. OH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice and warm in here, too,\" the Asari grinned. \"I'm sure it'll...wake you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, that pushed every button Ashley had. \"Really, right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be blunt, if this keeps going,\" Aeian pointed out, hefting one of her love-handles. \"I think it'll be a tight squeeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had to be cherry red at this point. For whatever reason, the idea of the shower being too small for their...ahem...purposes was...very interesting. Not that Ashley gave too much thought as she was taken by the hand and led back to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissful. Just blissful. Before descending into ecstasy, as you do, Ashley wondered what life would bring her next.</span></div></div>",

She paused, taking a deep whiff of the delightful smells filling the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeian slipped the finger out of her mouth that she used to sample her cooking and turned to give a glowing smile. \"You're right on time, actually. Would you like to help with this? The coating for the Kyrinian chops still needs to be made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't mind if I do!\" Ashley quickly made her way to the counter, grabbing a bowl that needed mixing and peppering it with the right ingredients before bashing it to bits with the whisk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, you're going to break the bowl,\" Aeian laughed, walking up behind her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry...\" Ashley let out a nervous laugh. She resumed her pounding with the whisk before her Asari lover wrapped her arms around her, the chub on Aeian arms slightly compressing against her own as she took her hands and demonstrated the correct, gentler movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and easy, like this,\" Aeian said gently, removing her hands to let Ashley take over. \"That's it...you're doing great.\" Leaving a gentle kiss on the inside of Ashley's neck, Aeian squeezed her a little tighter, swaying on the spot, before returning to the cooking again. The cooking finished up with the usual amount of lessons, kisses, and hugs exchanging between the two, though Ashley seemed somewhat distracted, like she was expecting something, and soon enough another feast was finished, one which the two were eager to sink their teeth into. Lowering themselves into their seats, Aeian dug in with gusto, but faltered when she saw Ashley hadn't taken a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Aeian pressed gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley let out a choked sigh, staring at her plate with the air of a student hoping the paper she's getting back was a pass. Taking a deep breath, the portly former soldier pushed herself up from her chair, her hand digging through her jacket pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...uh....\" Ashley started. \"I...tried to look up how Asari do this, because I didn't want to be offensive and stuff, but the information was conflicting, and I couldn't get a straight answer, but I wanted it to be special, and...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeian stared, not used to seeing her girlfriend quite so disoriented and unsure as she dropped onto her knee. What exactly was she doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess if you...well, we can maybe do it your way, that is if you WANT this...\" Ashley meandered, taking something out of her pocket and tumbling it over in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...talking about a human custom I'm not aware of?\" Aeian asked wearily. Ashley swallowed, her nerves steeled from fear-driven courage, and responded with what little vigor she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am!\" Ashley said loudly, holding up the small thing in her hand and opening it up. Inside was a beautiful ring, glistening Turian rhinestone set in gold. \"This is how humans...ask to marry one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes the down-on-one-knee custom, I'm familiar with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething clicked, and Aeian suddenly realized what was going on in front of her. Her blue face paled in shock as she looked between the ring and her girlfriend, and then, inexplicably, she began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....Ashley, I wish I knew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew what?\" Ashley asked, looking crestfallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you got the blue.\" Aeian, who had done some research of her own, pulled a box out of her pocket and opened it up. \"I would have gotten yours in a matching color,\" she said, tears of joy streaking down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsari weddings, as it turned out, were nowhere near the lavish affairs that human ceremonies entailed (or maybe they were, because the author can't find anything about how Asari weddings work). Ashley of course didn't mind, she could have been married in the bottom of a garbage dumpster and it would still be the happiest day of her life, but it turned out to be a wonderfully little ceremony all the same. Sure the fact that neither of them could fit into their dress uniforms without a giant potbelly hanging out put a damper on things, but with a cute set of matching dresses they soldiered on, their hands clasped together underneath a sacred tree in a secluded grove, only inhabited by the couple, the priestess, and one guest each to bear witness to the love they shared, as Ashley was told. Her choice may have been a little too obvious, as the young priestess was somewhat flustered to see who Ashley invited.Still, the ceremony was perfect, absolutely everything Ashley could have wanted, sealed with a loving kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be one in the eyes of the goddess,\" the priestess concluded, bowing her head ceremonially. Breaking apart with hands held, the new couple stepped out from underneath the tree to the sound of a high-pitched wail. Aeian had warned Ashley that her childhood friend Sega V'tiari was a touch emotional, but it still surprised her when the tall Asari jumped on them to give a giant hug, openly weeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm s-s-so happy for you t-two!\" Sega sobbed, squeezing into their fleshy bodies and nuzzling their necks one after the other. \"You're just so cute together I can't stand it, aaaaaah!\" Breaking off the hug suddenly, Sega ran off in tears of joy, arms over her head, leaving Ashley's guest to hobble up, still recovering from her second near-death experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, you two!\" Jane Shepard said brightly, her puffy eyes betraying her otherwise stoic expression. \"You'll forgive me if I don't jump on you and start shrieking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One is quite enough,\" Aeian laughed as Shepard approached them and pulled them into a hug of her own, one after the other. \"I hope you'll be staying for the after-party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the doctors advised me not to, still recovering and all that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're going then.\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it, sunshine,\" Shepard smirked.</span></div></div>",

Now, to anyone else, the sound of glass hitting metal wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been cringe worthy, but after twelve rounds of Turian brandy, things tended to get\u2026intense for the drinker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh, you little bosh\u2019tet!\u201d Tali hissed in the direction of the bottle, holding a finger up to her mask. The young Quarian\u2019s day had already been rough enough and she didn\u2019t need any of the bottle\u2019s shit. It was a good thing Garrus was near by, just in case the bottles tried to pull anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bottle stopped rattling Tali made a move for a new, full bottle, primed for drinking with an \u201cemergency induction port\u201d already in it. Reaching out a three fingered and, Tali starched towards the other end of the bar and began to lean in her seat. When her finger finally wrapped around the bottle, Tali\u2019s body was at full extension and she lost her alcohol hindered balance, causing her to fall onto the floor. At least she managed to keep her drink from spilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBosh\u2019tet artificial gravity\u2026why are you such a bosh\u2019tet?\u201d Tali complained as she attempted to move into a upright sitting position with little avail. As she rocked herself back and forth, Tali looked a bit like a turtle that had been flipped on its back. After about a minute of struggling she finally gave up and laid still flat on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why does everything have to happen to me?</i> Tali thought, recollecting on the events of the day. First she was accused of treason,then she found her father dead, she would have been exiled if it weren\u2019t for Shepard, and now she was under attack by gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm feeling began to well up in Tali\u2019s belly at the thought of Shepard sticking up for her. How she could ever repay the Commander for that kindness was beyond Tali. Even joining her suit with Shepard seemed sufficient enough. At least Kasumi was kind enough to let Tali have the Lounge to herself while she thought things over\u2026and drink her brains out, but Tali would have managed that on her own without the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she\u2019d be able to think of something when she was sober, but that was a problem for a later time. For now, she had another ten rounds to go though before she figured she\u2019d start to feel better. Minimum.</span></div></div>",

I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's about as far as she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wracked her brain for the next few minutes as she absentmindedly walked towards the mess hall. She found a suitable seat and sat, finding herself next to Gunnery Chief Ashley Williams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey kid. How's it hanging?', she greeted the Asari, but got no response back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Liara? You turn your ears off or something?\", Ash tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, Williams, hello, yes good evening, hello.\", Liara spattered out every greeting in her vocabulary in a span of five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok? You feeling alright Liara? Did something happen with you and Shepard?\", she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, well...\", Lara started off, a bit hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, don't be afraid to tell me, we're both ladies here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Williams, Asari are mono-gender, meaning that we are not necessarily-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, you've told us plenty of times\", Ashley interrupted, \"Just tell me what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you familiar with the human term 'friendzoned'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Sarah put you in the friendzone?!? Jeez, that's harsh, even for her.\" Liara's usually emotionless face was showing a sign of sadness and disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though we had a connection, that our connection with the Protheans linked us somehow. I guess my assumption was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe there still is. Maybe you just need a good push to get her to see it.\" She had Liara's full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard on the grapevine that Sarah is into this fetish called feederism.\", Ash whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeder... ism?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's basically where a person gets off on fat chicks, stuffing their faces, gaining weight, things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah is interested in... overweight women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Ash could see the gears turning in the lovesick Asari's head. \"And you know what? I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I'll take any help I can get!\" Liara pleaded to her human friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's the spirit. Now, we've got a couple ways of going about doing this. I got this little compound from the black market that increases your appetite, but decreases your metabolism, but we can ALSO take some of Wrex's Krogan food, enough calories and fat in one serving for a human to go two WEEKS on. Sol where do we start?\"</span></div></div>",

Didn't want to deal with getting caught by Wrex,\" Ash said dismissively, thankful that Liara wasn't picking up on her rather transparent motivations. \"In any case, the enhancer isn't alone, we're going to need a lot of food. I can probably lean on the quartermaster to get some extra rations, but that'd take a while to get here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain we can't use it sooner?\" Liara pleaded, desperate to get started on this impossible gambit for Shepard's affection. Ashley chuckled at her insistence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just getting to that,\" Ashley continued. \"While Shepard's off in the citadel doing whatever, there's a nice little restaurant on the Presidium that can work for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gordogan's? What kind of name is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" Ashley said as the pair of them looked at the stylish neon sign advertising the cozy little restaurant, which admittedly looked rather shoddy next to the other shiny storefronts. \"But the owner's a Krogan who specializes in 'foreign' cuisine, which means we can get very large portions for a good price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you even know about this place?\" Liara asked. \"I've never heard of such a store, let alone one on the Presidium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...have my ways,\" Ashley said coolly, leading the Asari to a table. As the pair of them sat down, a disinterested looking waiter appeared nearby to take their order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a bacon burger, all the usual trappings,\" Ashley said. \"And she'll have the Tri-Burger Special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter scoffed and looked over at the timid Asari. \"You sure you can handle it, blue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara furrowed her brow and glared back. \"Positively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your funeral,\" the waiter said before trouncing off. As soon as his back was turned, Ashley pulled out a plain looking bottle from one of her pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, hold your hand out,\" she ordered. Liara did so immediately, receiving two small green pills. \"There you go, that should be enough to kick you into the feeder mindset. So to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara, without a second's hesitation, swallowed them down and pulled a face. \"Blecch, what a revolting taste...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll probably be feeling the effects of those for the next week or so,\" Ashley reasoned. \"Just a fair warning, they can be rather potent...so I'm told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope it will get her to notice me,\" Liara said sadly, her heart aching all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best way I can think of...oh here it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your food, ladies,\" the waiter said. \"Good luck blue, you're gonna need it.\" Liara glared after the waiter, only for her face to fall when she spotted the burger itself. Liara was slightly familiar with Earthen cuisine and wouldn't know the proper size of a dish like this, admittedly. But even she knew this was way larger then it needed to be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Goddess!\" she exclaimed, picking up the unholy hunk of hamburger in both hands, the sauces and toppings dripping from the sides. \"It's larger then my head, how am I supposed to eat this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley idly started counting off on her fingers, picking up her own burger with the other hand. \"Three...two...one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Liara groaned, scrunching up. \"My stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic,\" Ashley assured her. \"The initial hit is the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think I've been poisoned!\" Liara stammered, tears coming to her eyes from the immense pain. Glancing up at the giant burger in her hands, all thoughts of poisoning or something going wrong fled from her mind at the sight of that absolutely succulent meal in front of her. The tenderly cooked meat, the delectable combination of sauces and seasonings, all perfectly topped off with the finest ingredients you could find. She wasn't poisoned, she realized. She was hungry. Extremely hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon App\u00e9tit,\" Ashley said, not that Liara heard as she chose that moment to dive face first into the burger and start scarfing it down. The intense hunger of the pills turned her into an eating machine, tearing into the burger like a ravenous beast without caring about manners or who was looking. Not that they mattered anyway, Liara thought. Only one thing mattered right now. She was hungry, and she wanted to eat eat eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it though, her hands were empty. She had devoured the burger in its entirety, its only remnants being the stains of sauce smeared across her hands and face. Glancing down, she saw sauce dribbling down her front as well as her distended stomach pressing against her once pristine outfit. Ashley grinned, still only halfway through her burger that Liara was eying suspiciously. Liara almost wanted to snatch it out of her hands before the waiter returned with another one of the Tri-Burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" she said, confusion temporarily winning out over hunger. \"You ordered another one for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...you did,\" Ashley said. \"You screamed for another one when you were annihilating the first one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even remember...ooh...\" Liara groaned as her stomach pulsed, demanding more sustenance despite the burger already in her. Giving in to her ravenous instinct, Liara picked up the new Tri-Burger and started again, tearing into the delectable meal with renewed vigor. At some point a breeze told her that her overstuffed belly had split a seam on her dress, and before she knew it, even that burger was gone, and she started licking sauce from her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good...\" Liara said wavering on the spot. \"So...sleepy...\" Her thoughts fogged over from that point on, overwhelmed by the sheer bliss of an overstuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Normandy left the space dock the following day, the lurch of the vessel taking off roused Liara from her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" she groaned. \"What a night...\" As she got to her feet, feeling that she had been dressed in her usual tank top and shorts sleepwear, the events of the previous day came flooding back to her. The appetite enhancer, of course! But had it worked? She remembered that she was able to eat those massive burgers, but they were supposed to tank her metabolism as well. How effective was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily her quarters had a bathroom with a decent sized mirror in it, so she made her way over. Not daring to look down at herself, fearing that it hadn't worked, Liara felt a little slower then normal. Was it her imagination, or her still being tired from waking up? Positioning herself in front of her mirror with her eyes closed, she braced herself for what she was going to see, and opened them. She gave a small start when she didn't recognize the Asari with the rounded face staring back, but the truth hit her right afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Goddess!\" she cried. \"I'm fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands flew to her belly in amazement. When she last saw her belly it had burst through the front of her dress, but instead of subsiding the bulge had spread around, leaving behind a healthy potbelly with love handles. Giving it a few healthy jiggles, Liara ran her hands across more of her body, feeling the substantial layer of pudge that covered her arms and legs. Especially her legs, Liara realized, with brand new thunder thighs and a monstrous rump that was straining the seams of her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot believe it worked!\" Liara said aloud, flexing her arms and giggling as the fat hung off of them. At that moment, her stomach grumbled, demanding to be filled, but the flabby Asari had other things on her mind. She was a big girl now, and Shepard was sure to love the new her! Heading to get dressed in something that would hopefully fit her, Liara planned on what she would do when meeting Shepard that morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liara had to sort through a good portion of her clothes, but she managed to find something that she could tug over her new girth that was still presentable. Smoothing out a few wrinkles, Liara ran her hands over her protruding belly again, and turned on her heel to observe her rear and thighs straining against her leggings. Her fat wasn't as obvious now that she was stuffed into her clothing, but it still left her looking quite porky. All the better for attracting Shepard's attention, Liara concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith baited breath and knowing Shepard's habit of stopping in before breakfast, the Asari headed for the lab she haunted, enjoying the sensation of her thighs and belly wobbling with every step. Getting an idea to postpone the issue of her angry stomach demanding food, she stopped by her locker and rummaged through the basket of assorted chocolates and candies she stashed there, a gift she had for Shepard before the commander \"friendzoned\" her. Taking out the biggest candy bar she could find, the portly asari arrived at her workstation as usual, swallowing down a king-sized bar of chocolate in a few bites. She was licking her fingers clean when she heard approaching footsteps. Taking a deep breath, Liara straighten up, trying to act normal. Don't come on too hard, just...let her see you. She's bound to go nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara, are you busy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Shepard, I was just doing some...preliminaries!\" Liara said, stumbling slightly as she got to her feet, keeping her expression as neutral as possible. Shepard seemed to match said neutral expression as she stood there with her arms crossed. Were her eyes flicking downwards, Liara wondered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we found some information on the Protheans that may be useful,\" Shepard continued. \"Do you think you could give it a look and see if it fits in with your research? I want to make sure we're not chasing something phony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be happy to Shepard,\" Liara said. Feeling brave, Liara moved like she was stretching, extending her new belly outwards, which backfired when a little, ladylike burp escaped her lips. \"Oh...pardon me,\" Liara said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, fine,\" Shepard replied carefully, still not betraying much of an emotional reaction. \"Keep me updated, if the info is legit it could be bad news for the Alliance presence on Noveria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Commander.\" As soon as the Commander left, Liara took a moment to breath and, out of pent up frustration, went back to her locker and devoured all of the candy remaining there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, she didn't say anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Liara complained to Ashley, idly stirring her eggs with her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep eating, Liara. Gotta get used to putting away a lot,\" Ashley reminded her. Liara forced herself to keep eating her big breakfast despite the candy she enjoyed an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that it matters...Shepard isn't going to go for this anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure she will Liara, just gotta stay the course,\" Ashley said encouragingly. \"Big part of being this new you is confidence, you need it to keep eating as much and often as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara nodded. \"That is true. I admit that since I got big last night I have felt a bit more confident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit,\" Ashley said, encouragingly \"Now eat up. We gotta get you even bigger if you wanna get with Shepard.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"In fact, if you're up for it, around dinner time we can do a feeding session. To get you into the mindset and whatnot,\" Ashley suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A feeding session?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's a big part of being a feedee. You get fed.\" Ashley snarked. \"Clue's in the name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very <i>urp</i> funny,\" Liara said, stifling a soft burp. \"But you're probably right, if this is what Shepard 'prefers', I should become well-versed in the technique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled. \"Meet me in my quarters for dinner and we'll get this ball rolling, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara finished her large breakfast and would later go on to have a large lunch as well, but even that wasn't quite enough to sate her, and she brought snacks into her lab to silence her demanding belly and help her focus on her work. It was very surreal to be eating like a hog and still be so hungry, Liara mused to herself, feeling around the edges of her new belly. Maybe it was wishful thinking on her part, but it felt a little larger then it did this morning, and when Liara looked down on it she could feel a burgeoning second chin as well. She didn't feel too concerned though; if anything it made her excited for her \"dinner\" with Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the appointed time, Liara went against the tide of personnel making their way to the mess hall and wandered her way into Ashley's quarters. She couldn't help but notice that Ashley's living place was rather spartan compared to hers, probably because Ash was an Alliance soldier and wasn't afforded special accommodations, but that comparison was quickly forgotten as Liara spotted the massive array of food laid out across numerous foldout tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...right on time, Liara,\" Ashley said, wiping sweat from her bow and pulling up a chair. \"Want to get this started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh most certainly,\" the Asari said, her mouth already starting to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be aware,\" Ashley warned Liara, coming after her with a plate of hamburgers, sadly not the size of that delectable Tri-Burger from the previous night. \"Shepard's not gonna let up, and neither will I. You're going to be eating all of this, Liara, no exceptions or excuses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara bit her lip, a hunt of doubt in the back of her mind, but as Ashley hovered the burger in front of her nose, all thoughts to the contrary vanished as her stomach roared for sustenance and Liara opened her mouth wide, letting Ashley stuff the burger in. Liara thickly chewed the massive hunk of meat and letting out a little sigh of relief as the thing plopped into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit,\" Ashley said, stuffing in another burger. \"Keep on eating, don't stop until I tell you to, and you'll get BIG.\" Liara obediently swallowed again, and Ashley stuffed in more burgers, one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep...going...!\" Liara said with an involuntary shudder that, in the back of her mind, concerned her somewhat. She was doing this for Shepard, so that she could catch her eye, right? She wasn't...enjoying this, was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid thoughts vaporized as Ashley graduated to donuts, their sweetness shocking the Asari scientists back to the here and now. Like the burgers then went down one by one, Liara obediently accepting them again and again, even as Ashley moved to two at a time to speed things along. Before Liara could even try to savor the sweet taste, the marine had moved on to a big bowl of pasta forking it into her mouth with great speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on fatass, don't slow down now,\" Ashley ordered. \"We got a long way to go before we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrf?\" Liara said through a mouthful of spaghetti, looking hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Ashley said, forgetting for a moment that this was new to the Asari. \"The insults are a good thing, it's what feeders say to the people they feed, 'cause they enjoy getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mnng...ah, I didn't..huff...know,\" Liara said, catching her breath at this respite from the feeding. \"This is...exhausting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it,\" Ashley explained, lifting up the pasta bowl. \"Now open wide, my...er, Shepard's prize pig. It's time to really fatten you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara obediently opened her mouth to let the feeding continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the week, members of the Normandy were starting to notice a startling change in the Asari scientist that Shepard picked up from Therum. When asked she would claim it was a common ailment that only afflicted her species, and since most of the crew knew little about xenobiology (aside from Chakwas who Liara was avoiding for obvious reasons), pretty much everyone took what was happening at face value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't stop the occasional giggles and mutterings though, and it earned the scientist a nickname among the crew; the Blue Whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a whale she was. The appetite enhancer had done its job incredibly well, morphing Liara from \"a skinny thing to a Capital F Fatass\", as Ashley so eloquently put it. Thanks to her new feeding sessions and skyrocketing appetite, Liara's belly blossomed into a mighty ocean of flab, hanging out over her crotch and bulky enough to set on a table in front of her when she's eating. Her hips and shapely rear got a generous portion of her new weight as well, both becoming too wide to fit in a normal chair and oftentimes impeding her travel through narrow crowded hallways on the ship. Nowadays it was hard to miss the Asari that doubled her weight and had started to soar past that number in a matter of days, especially considering her wardrobe was becoming more and more revealing as she began outgrowing her usual garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact there was one person who seemed not to have any interest in the \"blue whale\", and it frustrated Liara to no end; Commander Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She barely looked at me!\" Liara vented, her voice rife with frustration as she tore into a hunk of steak the size of her head. \"I had to practically wave my data pad in her face to get her to acknowledge I was even there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was equally flummoxed at this news, moreso because it left Liara in such a bad mood that she didn't want to be fed like the last few evenings. \"Maybe...she's under a lot of stress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she is then she needs medical help!\" Liara said, her jowls and chins wobbling with righteous indignation. \"I'm at least three hundred of your pounds heavy, she has to have SOME sort of reaction! How can she miss me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three hundred?\" Ashley asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably more...that is as high as the scale went before it stopped working,\" Liara replied sheepishly. \"It's just....augh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you need to change your approach,\" Ashley started to say before shook her head vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't want to hear about it right now,\" she insisted. \"I just want to eat. A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sure thing, you're the boss,\" Ashley said, folding her hands in front of her and watching the Asari whale gorge herself, arm fat jiggling as she flew back and forth for more food to stuff down her angry maw. Eventually her rapid pace started to slow down and her eyes started to glaze over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard...\" Liara slurred thickly. \"Why won't you...look at all of this...\" She swayed on the spot as she grabbed at her voluminous belly. \"I'm so...sexy now, Shepard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara?\" Ashley backed away as the bloated overstuffed fatty of an Asari looked like she was about to puke, but instead unleashed a massive belch and collapsed into her chairs, blissful asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking over some scans of Prothean ruins buried in the magma, she lowered her datapad and spotted, of all things, a cupcake sitting on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Who left this here?\" Liara wondered aloud, picking it up and turning it over in her hand. \"Well, I skipped lunch anyway,\" she reasoned, plopping the muffin into her mouth. The second she swallowed the muffin, her stomach gurgled and immediately pooched out against the fabric of her dress, a couple pounds at the most, and when Liara blinked there were two muffins sitting on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about that?\" she mused, picking up both muffins and eating them one after the other. Her belly bulged further out with every bite until they were finished, only for <i>three</i> to appear when Liara glanced away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like them?\" came a sultry voice from behind, the speaker obscured by dream logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're delicious,\" Liara said happily, munching down one after the other, raising her head to watch four more appear in front of her and reveal her new double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good,\" the voice said soothingly. \"Because it's for you darling, it's all for you. I want to see you grow~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Liara didn't have to look away and look back, the cupcakes were just there, never being depleted somehow. Shoveling in one after another after another, Liara's clothes began to strain against her growing form, seams tearing and leaking blubber from the broken stitches. Before she knew it the cupcakes were turning into a pile, and she was grabbing them by the fistful and devouring them with no end in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat, eat, eat..!\" the voice demanded. Liara complied with eagerness and her belly burst from the dress and fell heavily down her front, exposing her undergarments to the world. Not even stopping to cover up, Liara kept eating and eating as a pair of hands reached around her and started caressing the expanse of her globular gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so intoxicating, Liara,\" the voice said. \"Imagine how good you would look if you got...bigger.\" Liara kept on eating as her gloves began to strain, finally bursting off of her fatty fingers as she reached for more muffins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a tear down the side of her thigh, Liara looked down to watch her leggings shred to bits, her boots splitting apart and letting her fat feet spread across the ground at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<b>bigger!!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two loud snaps, her bra and panties cracked under pressure, leaving the Asari naked, but the growing didn't stop there, her belly growing out and around until it reached her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...good....\" Liara murmured as her arms grew thicker, heavier, and slower by the second. Her neck thickened to help compliment a roll of chins, and her belly quickly joined her feet in spreading out across the floor in good time. Shoveling infinite numbers of cupcakes into her mouth, Liara felt herself grow and grow, flying upwards and in all directions as her weight grew to new and indescribable heights, her flab spreading across an unknowable area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...big...\" Liara groaned, but gave a little yelp as something clambered onto her belly, making its way towards her face ringed with chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a good piggy for me, Liara,\" the figure climbing up her body said. \"So big, so very, very fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm such a fatty,\" Liara said with a giggle, sending her whole body shaking violently. \"I'm gonna be the biggest, fattest Asari in the whole galaxy for you, Shepard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard?\" the voice said curiously, climbing her way up to her face at last. \"What makes her so special, my big blue whale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's expression changed on a dime as she realized who her encouraging feeder was, just as they clambered up to an intimately close distance with her extremely flabby face, and gave her a passionate, loving kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Gah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara woke up in a cold sweat, jiggling from the sudden movement in her belly. Looking downwards, Liara found herself back at the size she was since last night. Running her hands over her face to ensure she had the right amount of chins for her weight, she pondered what she saw in that dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara still pined for Shepard, right? If so, why was her mysterious dream lover...</span></div></div>",

Night was upon this remote world now, but Liara T'Soni was still up and working. She flipped the page of her virtual book, and snorted at the preposterous theories presented therein. Honestly, Protheans inventing disco music? How did the writer come up with this nonsense? Better yet, why was this a best-seller in human space? The asari maiden snorted, and bit into yet another donut, the custard filling spurting into her mouth. Filling dripped down her double chin and splattered on her UC-TN sweater. It clung tightly around her breasts and belly, clearly intended for a woman at least fifty pounds lighter. Liara <i>was</i> fifty pounds lighter when she got it, but her grant to study at the famous human university was stingy, and she had to seriously cram in order to finish her course early. Cramming wasn't a problem for the studious asari, but it meant no time for proper meals. The cafeteria was a goddess-send, and the dozens of nearby fast food and delivery places were essential to her avoiding starvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman food was a lot different from typical asari cuisine. It was sweeter, bolder, tangier - All the flavors were overpowering to one used to a subtle palette of tastes. That made it hard to stop at just one donut, just one bag of chips, just one burger. It was also extremely fattening, packed with so much cholesterol that she could just about hear her heart crying with every bite of pizza. Her body ballooned, from 150 (According to her scale, which used the primitive human measurement unit of 'Pounds') to 300, turning all the clothing she'd packed into skintight stripperware and forcing her to switch to human clothing. While jogging pants and a sweater weren't the most dignified outfit for the daughter of a noblewoman to wear, she had to admit, it was one of the most comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand through her tendril hair, Liara shook her head and tried to focus on the reading. Pretty soon, however, she grew bored, and reached for another donut, only to find the box completely empty! Now that was a horror she couldn't stand, even worse than the terrible pseudoscientific nonsense she was reading, and she got up. She was going to have to...</span></div></div>",

She bent over to lift it out, the seams of her sweatpants gently creaking, and immediately popped the top open to retrieve a jelly-filled one, stuffing it into her mouth with a few quick munches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...just divine,\" she moaned, licking jelly from her lips. Tucking the box under her arm for ease of access, she immediately went in for a second, her somewhat noisy eating drawing a few stares from passing students in the halls. If she hadn't been so focused on doing well in her studies and packing away calories to help deal with the stress of higher education, Liara probably would have been embarrassed by how she looked and acted in front of all these humans, making her species look like a bunch of prim and proper softies who turn into fat slobs at the slightest provocation. And while a few people probably did think that, most of the students at UC weren't going to make any judgements. Liara wasn't the first student to get fat in response to the stress of university education, even if she did go a little farther then the infamous 'Freshman fifteen', and even then most people didn't see it as a mark of shame or a personal failing. It was just a funny quirk of the school, like the library with the best computers in the second row, or the sneaky back entrance to a campus building that'll let you shave five minutes off your travel time. Oh, the fat Asari who carries boxes of donuts between classes? Yeah she's cool, really nice once you get to know her, just be careful she doesn't steal all your fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Liara waddled through the campus devouring donuts on the way to her next course, a rather challenging lecture on human archeology. Not the Protheans inventing disco kind either, ACTUAL ancient history. She rather enjoyed the difficulty of the coursework even if the seats were a little small for her, Liara thought as she grazed the curve of her belly with the back of her hand. If she hurried though, she could get the larger seats up front. She wasn't too big for those benches, at least not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her head though, Liara knew that the classes were going to get harder as the year went on, more stressful, more time-consuming. At last sparing a thought for her flabby body, she wondered if perhaps she should work to lose some of this weight, at least so she could still fit through doors before the semester ran out.</span></div></div>",

But denial over just how big her nine thousand calorie a day diet was making her. As a child she'd been rather spoiled and consequently very chubby but her strict mother Matriarch Benezia had put her foot down on that, putting Liara on a seventy four year diet that had only ended when she'd arrived at UC and gotten out of the figure conscious Matriarch's fingers. Access to an unlimited meal plan meant that Liara had splurged, indulging in old habits and trying to ignore the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her Asari formal dress robes had started whiskering over a little belly pooch two weeks into term, Liara had told herself they were just shrinking in the wash. When she'd suffered a wardrobe malfunction and split a halloween costume, a slutty \"Batgirl\" one her roommate had suggested, from crotch to breast she'd blamed it on beer bloating. When her belly fat had first started to press against her desk in mid-November, she'd blamed it on picking a bad seat. When her back had started to hurt from her boobs getting bigger than her head, she'd assumed it was just becoming a woman. When her butt had gotten too big for any of her underwear to fit over, she'd quietly bought thongs. When her thighs had gotten so layered in cellulite the craters showed through her yoga pants, Liara started buying specially formulated cream. When a physical had showed her weight had increased by a hundred and fifty pounds in a semester and her blood pressure was \"worryingly high\", she'd blamed the later on stress and gone on medication that only increased her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't until she'd arrived at the building her first serious archaeology class would be in, that she found the class was on the twelfth story. And that the elevator was broken. And that the two liter of soda and heavily creamed coffee that morning didn't count as hydration. And that the box of blue icing donuts didn't sit easily on her stomach as she began to haul her heavily overweight body up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara had at first hoped to sneak into class but instead she waddled into the room thirty five minutes late. Her grey sweat pants were stained black with sweat and she gasped continuously, unable to catch her breath. Every eye went immediately to this blue berry cream puff wobbling into \"Practical Archaeology\" and interrupting the lecture describing the physical exertions of high altitude digs in extreme heat and cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara waddled towards a chair, huffing and puffing as she waddled through the tight rows of desks, wobbling hips bouncing into several students, and forced her beach ball buns into the seat. She began to mentally lambast the school for having such tiny desks but when she looked around the room all she saw were fit and active looking young humans easily fitting into their chairs. As the lecturer went on about how difficult digging on exotic planets with few resources and nothing to depend on but your own body was, the obese, gluttonous Asari looked down at the doughy double belly pouring into her lap and surging onto her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is new,\" Liara had to admit, looking at the sweat double folds of blue fat, \"I've really let myself go to seed. I'll never become a real archaeologist until I can get back in shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words diet didn't enter into Liara's mind. Indeed the obese Asari was even now pulling a candy bar out of her bag to get her energy levels back up. But she remembered liking exercising six long months ago, when she'd been thin, active and restrained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Liara mused as she munched on the chocolatey goodness, how hard could working out be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon, Liara waddled nervously into the campus gym. The gleaming machines and taut hotties both seemed alien to the plus sized Alien, who was feeling that her very heavy lunch and post lunch snack might have been a bad idea. Although some students had extra padding, UC's merch store only carried sports bras up to 38E and shorts up to size 20, both of which a bit too snug for the tubby Asari. Pastel blue fat poured out over her light purple shorts and bra, her bean bag belly bearing dark blue stretch marks around its belly button and her cellulite speckled thighs already turning purple from friction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, cheeks turning purple from embarrassment at seeing just how big she'd gotten. She'd been fit and athletic, a skilled runner and dancer six months ago but now the woman looking at her in the mirror was as alien as a human. No more was she a delicate Asari maiden, slender, graceful and girlish, but a big blue balloon of bulbous blubber. Liara realized she was twice the size of anyone else at the gym, that she'd inflated herself into a parody of an Asari far too fat to be in this temple of fitness. She turned around to go, only to find her inflated stomach bouncing right into a hard set of abdominal muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, I don't think I've seen you around here before...,\" a cool voice observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara looked up into the eyes of...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jet black hair was pulled back into a glamorous ponytail that hung down to mid back, sweaty from a hard workout. Her workout gear was even tighter than Liara's undersized garb, but jet black and probably custom made. More like lingerie than regular workout clothes. They left nothing to the imagination, showing off a tall, leggy frame that had had every ounce of unnecessary fat burned off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong legs gleamed, defined muscles twitching after a six mile run. Chiseled abdominals quivered after four hundred weighted reverse slope sit ups. She turned to pace around the obese alien student, showing off a pair of buns inflated to 40 inches from thrice daily squat sessions and hanging out of a tiny thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I don't think I've ever used the gym before,\" Liara stammered, nearly drooling at the sight of these gorgeous muscles and curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So its your first time?\" Miranda said, \"I'd heard there was an Asari here but I never knew your species could be so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black haired human leaned in close, perfect and all natural 36Ds bulging against her skimpy top, \"Sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say...,\" Liara tried to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you looking to drop a few pounds?\" Miranda went on, as if she hadn't said a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe more than a few, really I've just been wanting to get back into shape,\" Liara tried to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I bet you get out of breath real easy,\" Miranda said, tapping the bulging roll of fat hanging over Liara's pants, \"hauling all of this around. You're like poking a big ball of whipped cream. I bet laying on you is like laying on a big, warm, jiggly, cuddly water bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...have gotten a little soft,\" Liara admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you huff and puff at the slightest thing,\" the ultra fit Miranda smiled, pinching the roll and biting her own lip, \"I'd love to see it up close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's face went beet purple, her entire jello like body quivering with lust. She'd left home a virgin and stayed one, a hundred and fifty pound weight gain in six months not getting many suitors into her bed despite the Asari's somewhat unfortunate reputation as temptresses. Her strict mother hadn't ever gotten around to teaching her daughter the in and outs of dating and such <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about I give you a hand working out?\" Miranda asked coyly, \"Just to make sure you don't get...over exerted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I could use a coach,\" the obese Liara quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, glad to see you're willing to take help. Stick with me and I\"ll get you into perfect shape,\" Miranda smiled, showing perfectly white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara smiled nervously as Miranda dragged her towards a rowing machine, brain trying to comprehend why the most popular girl in school was taking such a shine to her. Lawson was beyond rich, the daughter of one of the richest men in human space, she always dressed in customized clothes of the latest fashion and got a new, ivory white hover car every semester. And Lawson was beyond popular, always being hosting the best parties at the mansion her father had bought her and with a hookup list longer than anyone on campus, each paramour abandoned the moment they annoyed her in the slightest way. Lawson was beyond smart, boasting the highest GPA of any double business and medical research major ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was so <i>hot</i>. Her long pony tail swished against perfect buns, their muscular bounce making the Asari's mouth hang open. Every breath made perfectly toned muscles across her back flex, while every step made her outlandish breasts sway from side to side. She'd led the university's cheer team since her sophmore year, pushing daringly acrobatic and eye searingly sexy routines that maxed out every ball game, and thanks to her three year back to back center fold status the team's yearly calendar was earning record money every year. The photo shoot of the perfect brunette sitting naked atop the bronze statue of the school's bear mascot, modesty protected only by her long hair, had gone a long way at getting Liara to pick this school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contrast between the ultra fit  senior and the morbidly obese freshman was glaring, even before one got into Liara's blue skin and hair tendrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was a quiet, socially awkward nerdette with few friends and thoroughly academic interests. She spent her days eating on her way to class and after finishing home work, her nights and weekends eating and playing video games. Although Matriarch Benezia was a powerful member of the Asari government, she kept her daughter on a tight leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat ever could Miranda Lawson want with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tired of being perfect:</b> Miranda was born, bred and is now being educated to be the perfect human woman: be smart, be hardworking, be fit, date only sexy humans. And she's tired of it all. Shes' especially tired of not indulging in her fat fetish. She wants to piss off her controlling dad by dating an alien as far as human perfect as possible...and maybe relax the last six months of senior year...just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Human Supremacy:</b> Miranda wants to prove how superior humans are to Asari by turning this already obese alien into an immobile balloon of azure fat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It would be easy to assume Miranda Lawson was not an emotional woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, her nickname on the cheer squad was \u201cIcequeen\u201d for the cold way she cruelly cut any girl who failed to meet her exacting standards of appearance and ability. She never shed a tear whenever she broke up with one of her ever lengthening list of boy/girlfriends for the slightest reason. Miranda ruthlessly crushed anyone who could possibly be a rival to her academically or relationship wise and got little pleasure from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut really the raven haired beauty felt a lot. Even though her father, or more accurately nannies and tutors had raised her to be cold, ruthless and emotionless, Miranda was really a quite sensitive girl who cared a lot about what other people thought about her. For twenty one years the brunette had pulled off a perfect balancing act of athletics, academics and looks and after all that, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hopped up lithely from her four hundredth reverse slope weighted sit up, what Miranda was feeling was tired. Not physically, a mere maintenance workout wasn't going to make her more than sweat a bit.But spiritually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was twenty one years old and couldn't remember a single <i>moment</i> lived for herself. The cheer captain was a test tube baby in every sense of the word, her genome had been carefully constructed from a dozen different female Nobel prize scientists, Olympic gold medalist runners and gymnasts and fantastically hot supermodels to the tune of eight billion dollars. Knowledge of her price tag had been used as a goad on the young woman her whole life, pressing her to always be the best and earn her cost. And now, with only a semester left of college what had that gotten her? A bunch of medals and awards and black belts and modeling contracts in the summer and a hundredish very sexy partners? People called her smart and people called her beautiful and people called her talented but it was all...so exhausting. And if she stopped working on all of it then they wouldn't approve of her and where would Miranda be then? College was the one time where people had <i>fun</i>, something she'd never done lest it harm her grades or looks, and now it was almost over and a just as packed vice presidency at her father's company was looming before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was tired of being perfect. Of having to be the best at everything all the time and never relaxing. Not looking perfect of course, she did take pride in her appearance and the turning heads and drooping jaws, but really if she'd actually drank at all those keggers and slept in on the weekends sometimes and occasionally had a piece of chocolate cake would it have killed her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the cheer goddess hopped up and saw three hundred pounds of ample Asari pouring out of skimpy workout gear, her perfect heart skipped a beat and she fell head over heels in love at first sight..and also over a weight bench but she put her cheer training to good use and gracefully sprang back up, without anyone seeing. The near injury didn't phase her, because in front of Miranda was what she'd always wanted: someone relaxed. Here was someone who clearly never stopped relaxing to the point she was sweating just walking into the gym and who didn't care what people thought about her to the point she was shamelessly showing more ass fat than the entire cheer team had on their entire bodies. Someone who lived life to the lazy, decadent fullest and damn the consequences...and it didn't hurt that she was sexy as <i>fuck</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda quickly checked her hair in the mirror, adjusted her sports bra to show more cleavage and strutted over to the blue ball of a woman, trying to hide the quiver in her inner thighs as years of sexual conquests drained from her head. She was nervous and anxious as a virgin, her self confidence crumbling in the face of drooling desire because mad as it seemed, Miranda Lawson had a fat fetish. The tall, pale woman was still thinking of what to say when the blubbery alien turned around and rammed her drooping, melted butter belly right into Lawson's hard abs almost bringing the cheer captain to immediate orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't seen you around here before,\" the cheer captain managed, taking in the glory of the Asari's puffy cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda spent the rest of the conversation in a daze, guiding the Asari through an easy set of weights and stretches, enraptured by every wobble, jiggle and quiver. This had to be the fattest girl on campus, sure plenty of non-athletes got a little chubby freshman year but Miranda's social circle was nothing but super fit high achievers. Her experience with actually obese girls was essentially nil, letting her long buried desires run unopposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how hard this is,\" the Asari huffed, balloon belly turning into deep rolls as she went through a set up, bringing her soft lips tantalizingly close to Miranda's, \"I was never an athlete but, ugh, I did enough sports a sit up shouldn't be this hard...I've really gotten fat...I need to lose this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lose it? No, you should focus on getting stronger. That's the real way to get healthy,\" Miranda told her hurriedly, not wanting an ounce of this blue blubber to burn off this bloated beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wanted this nameless vision of lazy excess to get bigger and bigger and if that meant building up a little muscle on her, then so be it! Miranda was almost ashamed of herself for getting so attached but she was hearing wedding bells everytime the blue blobs back blubber bounced onto the floor. She pictured going down the aisle, getting a house, getting pregnant at the same time and growing old together...and just growing together. If this Asari, clearly young for her breed, was so fat now what would she be like in a few years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genetically perfect woman having a fat fetish hadn't been part of the plan, her father was a massive lipophobe after all. But the same woman who had given Miranda her blue eyes and 162 IQ had also passed along a love for sloth, gluttony, weight gain and obesity to her partial daughter. A childhood without the warm, soft, loving embrace of a mother had only heightened the budding chubby chaser's need for a soft cuddle, making the firm, gym toned embrace of her many lovers unsatisfactory. Seeing the Asari struggle with simple exercises was driving her completely and totally wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved on from sit ups to light weights, an hour spent getting both of them increasingly hot and bothered. By the time the five pounders were put up sweat was pouring off of both coeds, Liara's from exhaustion and Miranda's from pure sexual need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more, please, I think, I think I'm going to faint,\" Liara whined, collapsing onto her weight bench and panting, sweat pouring off of her in torrents, \"I didn't realize how hard exercise was. Oh goddess, I'm so tired. I need to go lay down in my dorm room and never get up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda felt her taut stomach flip flop. The far too short hour was over and her obese crush was going to leave! She'd never seen her before, would she see her again? It was a big campus what if she never saw her again? If only there was someway to stay in touch with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if I'm going to be coaching you every day we should properly introduce ourselves,\" the ultra fit cheer leader came up with, \"I'm Miranda Lawson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know. I recognized you,\" the swollen Asari admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, she knew her. How could she know her? Oh wait, the popularity and the modeling and the school promotional calenders and the cheerleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get around,\" Miranda waved off, wondering if it was it too early to propose to the new love of her life, \"but please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara T'Soni,\" the obese girl said, barely able to take her eyes off of Miranda's glorious half naked physique and reaching out a hand to be helped up, \"Clearly you know more about getting in shape than me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, T'soni. The daughter of some big Asari matriarch. The only Asari student on UC's campus. That Liara...who'd been merely a little chubby when featured in the school paper. Her future wife and the mother of her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's strong, manicured hand grabbed the soft, puffy fingers of the blue alien and hauled her to her feet. The perfect cheer leader's muscles were like shapely steel cables but still she marvelled at Liara's heaviness. What must it be like to be so slow, so heavy, so soft and so blatantly imperfect? To not spend hours a day staying the most beautiful woman ever? To get obese and weak and flawed...something Miranda would never feel. Because it would be <i>crazy</i> if she started gaining weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's thoughts were cut off by accidentally pulling the sweaty, sloppy Liara into herself. Piles of lumpy blue fat hit ripples of steely pale muscle, the two women pressing tighter than lovers. Their accidental embrace stretched on, ending only when Liara's pampered tummy let out an angry rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that reminds me. Exercise is only one part of this, you need a proper diet too,\" Miranda said, desperate to stay in further contact, \"Let's me get you a meal at my place after a spa soak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara purpled at the thought of going to the Lawson mansion, sight of so many swanky soirees, at last but she was also well, a practical girl. She didn't want to impose on this far more popular beauty who'd sweetly helped her wobbly, uncoordinated bulk through her first workout. And she could really go for the dining hall's bread sticks and brownies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have an unlimited dining plan...,\" Liara started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dining plan? How charmingly bohemian,\" Miranda giggled, \"how about we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fancy Overeating</b>: Liara is treated to the high class treats of Miranda house, who enjoys them herself for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>How the other 99.99999% lives:</b> Miranda learns what an unlimited dining plan can get you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liara still didnt\u2019 know why this gorgeous woman was with her. A woman who had every eye in the gym on her, who\u2019s every movement was a confident, graceful strut, who could have anyone and anything she wanted, had picked her. The biggest, fattest, blubberiest girl on campus who was an alien to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany humans had an almost fetishistic interest in Asari, but for everyone Liara had met that didn\u2019t extend to Asari over a hundred and fifty pounds. Why would Miranda want to be with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got more intimidated after getting their coats, she was led out to a new Ferrari hover-car worth half of her dorm. Liara\u2019s mother made excellent money from her government position, but nothing like this. She plopped into the real upholstered leather with a grunt, muscle groups she\u2019d forgotten had existed screaming into wakefulness, and Miranda had easily slid into the drivers seat. She\u2019d reached across and buckled the tubby alien in, takign a bit too long, before flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going kind of fast\u2026,\u201d Liara said, noticing the big houses on university row go past, \u201cum, isn\u2019t that your house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that? That\u2019s just for parties, barely a gazebo, we\u2019re going to my actual house,\u201d Miranda had giggled, breaking the speed limit by a hundred kph and going past New Chicago to land at a sprawling, isolated mansion, \u201cits a treat few ever get. I hope you savor it, because I know I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara\u2019s legs had locked up in cramps when they landed and Miranda had to pull her out of the sports car like a cork from a bottle. She looked up at the six story mansion, larger than her dorm and shivered. Partly from the cold, for New Illinois was just as cold as the original and Winter Break was just ending, and partly from being impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts just a little private apartment,\u201d Miranda yawned, throwing an exotic fur coat over her hard curves, \u201csorry its not impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA butler opened the main doors for them, a butler with a tuxedo spray painted over its armored plate. It was a combat mech, cutting edge and armed to the teeth. It put an edge of fear into the cream puff Liara, who\u2019d run from every confrontation since elementary school, but Miranda sashayed up to it authoritatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeeves, I\u2019ll need two spa treatments, two custom gowns with shoes and two meals,\u201d Miranda ordered it, looking over Liara, \u201cOne standard post workout and one cheat day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot hummed in a cockney accent, \u201cA cheat day madam? You\u2019ve never ordered that before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake it a double cheat day,\u201d Miranda insisted, \u201cthen lead our guest to her bathing chambers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Liara had been showered, mud bathed, showered, steamed, massaged, facialed, soaked and massaged again. Apart from some issues with the tub clearly not being designed for a girl of her size and her ever building hunger, she\u2019d never felt better. But she was a little...disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the servants were mechs, apart from Miranda there didn\u2019t seem to be another person in the place. It was ultra luxurious, she was pretty sure the sinks were pure platinum, but it seemed sadly lonely. Liara felt out of place when the butler mech led her toweled body to a changing room, past oil portraits of a seductively posed Miranda showing off firm legs and taut abs, feeling like she was intruding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that, an asari vestal robe?\u201d Liara gasped when she saw what was hanging on the hook, a green silken tent of a garment, \u201chow did she get one here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Lawson ordered it rush produced for you specifically,\u201d the butler mech hummed, \u201cI will let you change and then lead you to dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara had gotten used to struggling into increasingly tight clothes but this green dress fit like a glove. A very snug glove but one that didn\u2019t pinch uncomfortably and had plenty of stretch to it despite being tight. The archaeologist in training looked herself over, seeing how the pencil skirt showed off her pudgy cankles and dimpled knees. How its belly window showed off the purple stretch marks around her belly button and how her E cup cleavage could really use a bra. She turned, seeing how it pressed tight against her butt, showing that she wasn\u2019t wearing any underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt fits perfectly!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cgranted I\u2019ve gotten a lot fatter since I wore one last but still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clumsily put her feet into her shoes, having to guess their position due to her gut blocking things, and then walked out of the changing room unaware that she\u2019d put her shoes on wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like a blue rose,\u201d Jeeves hummed, \u201clet me lead you to the dining room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk was just long enough for Liara to feel winded again, her thighs starting to rasp, when she caught the scent of food. T\u2019soni had become quite the glutton of cheap dining hall fair and was a little unfamiliar at this luxurious human food. Her eyes widened to see a long table of rare wood, one side nearly groaning with a chicken pot pie, a full rack of ribs layered in sauce, a huge bowl of lobster macaroni and cheese, a platter of greasy brisket, a tower of fried truffles, a salad with so much fried chicken, blue cheese crumbles, bacon and sweet oil dressing as to qualify as all food groups, an entire cheese tray and enough icing thick carrot cake to cause the cheer team to purge for a month. The other side had a lean cut of filet, a plate of asparagus, some mashed potatoes, a salad and a protein shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hungry as the gluttonous girl was, she was distracted by the goddess who strode into the gigantic room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda in skimpy workout gear was unbelievably gorgeous, but Miranda dressed to the nines nearly knocked Liara unconscious. Long black tresses had been piled up into an intimidating tower, with two locks framing her perfect heart face, lightly dusted with make up to make her big lips gleam and her huge blue eyes pop. A designer black dress barely clung to her body, its thigh slit almost merging with cleavage that came all the way to her hairless navel. Delicate abs and pert cleavage surged towards freedom, held up only by a faint tingle of biotic power, and every step of her stilletto heels flashed her perfect runner's legs and feminine hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miri you look like a goddess,\" Liara gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, I was going to tell you the same thing,\" the perfect woman smiled, \"but really though, this is just an old rag I through on after a much needed workout. You though, you're so voluptuous. So...full and curvy. You must tell me how you do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well mostly I just eat a lot,\" Liara said, looking down at her belly fat and remembering when it had just been a little puff, \"I was always a little chubby and spent every summer at fat camp. But once I was free to choose my own meals, well I guess I went a little overboard. Its a good thing I'm going to lose it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's blue eyes widened, \"Lose it? No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the point of all that exercise?\" Liara asked her in some shock, \"I've always wanted to be an archaeologist in the field but this morning they all but told me I was too out of shape for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impossible woman blinked, trying to remember her poise, \"but but...you're so gorgeous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Liara's turn to blink in amazement, \"Me? I weigh three hundred pounds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? You're just so,\" Miranda's pert buns slumped into a chair, \"so relaxed looking. So care free...so soft and comfy...and you just want to be skinny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human looked like she'd been gut shot, her face falling. Liara felt awkward, seeing tears gather in the Icequeen's eyes. The most popular girl in school was about to cry in front of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um well, I don't really want to lose that much weight,\" Liara admitted, \"really if I wasn't so out of shape I'd be fine with it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Miranda sniffed, \"you're not just saying that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, well. I mean if I could trade places with you...,\" Liara began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't, its miserable. Up at three a.m. every morning for pre-workout workouts, then nothing but practice and class and home work and awards ceremonies and then if you're lucky a quick roll with someone who starts coming the minute you take your clothes off,\" the cheer leader huffed, \"with every eye on you at all time, judging you and your father constantly on your neck to be <i>good enough.</i>. It's miserable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what that's like, my whole life my mother was always bitching at me about my weight and wanting to be an archaeologist instead of an official like her,\" Liara shared, folding her meaty arms under her heavy boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't listen to her?\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sometimes but I just did what felt fun to me and wound up like this,\" Liara said gesturing at the folds of hanging fat that were her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head cheer leader looked her obese guest up and down, taking in the hundred and fifty pounds of fat that came with \"fun\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me what fun is?\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So are these two blood cells, are they going to ...have sex?\" Miranda asked as the old cartoon flashed on her four meter screen, \"because they're blood cells and those can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miri, its just a cartoon. Don't think too hard about it,\" Liara giggled, \"the point is to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda blushed, both at the tiny rebuke and at the sensation of Liara's fat rolls vibrating over her body. The two were crammed into a love seat in the mansion's immense living room, which had a holovision screen larger than most apartment walls currently playing a preserved cartoon from Japan. What remained of the double cheat day meal sat atop a table in front of them, slowly disappearing into the two's stomachs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I relax if I'm sitting here wondering if the red blood cell and white blood cell are going to get together or not?\" the perfect girl demanded to more of the Asari's giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teaching you to relax is going to take a while,\" T'soni smiled, \"could you get me another rib?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue element zero field wrapped around a large, succulent short rib which levitated off of the still laden table in front of the two and popped into Miranda's open mouth. The cheer captain's eyes closed in joy and the bone popped out, leaving the mouthful of meat behind to carefully stack itself onto a spare plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, that was the last one,\" Miranda smiled, BBQ sauce staining her pink lips,  \"...until the second order gets here at least. Until then explain to me how this anime thing works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were still in their fancy formal wear, complete with elbow length gloves and depending on Miranda's exacting biotic powers to feed them. Liara giggled again to see the cheerleader's coy smile, shaking like a jello mould in an earth quake. That made Miranda blush again, feeling the soft pillows of fat draped over her body shake. The two were in a tiny, very old love seat that didn't have nearly enough room. The bean bag chair of an alien flowed over her half of the seat and onto the cheer leader's, sixty one inch hips pushing Miranda tight against the arm rest. A pillowy love handle was jammed into the taper of the cheerleader's firm waist and T'soni's bloated belly roll hung over the human's firm thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt so warm, so comfortable, so at ease...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe episode ended, the game console playing it asking them if they wanted to continue watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can turn it off if you're not enjoying it,\" Liara told her, hoping the brunette would tell her to hit play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked at her expensive watch. It was almost midnight already, she had to get up for pre-practice exercises at three, regular practice at 6 and then the four theoretical physics classes she'd signed up for her last semester...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just finish off the season,\" Miranda smiled, \"I'm undecided yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later and the credits for the last episode were playing. The only food left on the table from the now triple cheat day order were a fresh pyramid of truffles, rising one by one to the two girl's mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did you like it?\" Liara yawned sleepily, mouth opening obediently for a truffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was silly and weird and didn't give me any sort of reward or acknowledgement...but it was very nice to watch it with you,\" the cheerleader smiled at the nerd, opening her own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think *yawn* you get the point,\" Liara said, waving off the next hovering truffle, \"no more please, I'm going to burst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's stomach was stretched to the max. Usually she was a grazer, constantly having a candy bar or a sweet at hand, never really getting full. Such a large meal had laid the freshman out, her stomach was swelled up mighily, such a mound of fat and food her double belly was back to one dome and was stretching the magnificent dress to its limit. She'd chowed down on about two thirds of the food though, having really let loose despite her decision to get in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More for me then,\" the cheerleader shrugged, letting truffle after truffle slide into her mouth until her cheeks puffed up with fried mushroom, \"It's *chew* so good...*gulp* a little greasy...I'm not breaking out am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if a pimple would dare touch your skin,\" Liara yawned, \"ugh If this couch wasn't so uncomfortable I'd fall asleep here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's from Versailles, I don't think it was designed with aliens of size in mind,\" Miranda said, \"I need to get some better furniture if I\"m going to have you over here frequently...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tentative question, a plead that Liara come back frequently. And strange as it was to stuff herself alongside the most beautiful woman she'd ever seen in a 600 year old chair, Liara had enjoyed herself...she'd enjoyed herself quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you get a comfier couch. Ancient or not its hurting my back,\" the alien said, \"and I'll need to bring a bra. I'm too big a girl to go around unsupported all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asari dress showed off Liara's bountiful charms, but also showed off how the very dense, heavy E cups pulled at her back. Her shoulders were bent inwards and her neck leaned forwards, her expression one of pain. Miranda's blue eyes widened in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me rub your neck,\" she said, standing up with perfect grace only to realize that there was nothing covering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe billionaire cheerleader's dress had lacked buttons, seams or zippers, being just a drape of black silk held on by Miranda's biotic powers, letting a long slit of pale skin show from ankle to neck. But her concentration had lapsed between the food and the fluffy companion, when she stood up the cheer captain's dress stayed pinned by a blue fat roll and she was totally naked in front of her date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...this is me,\" Miranda said to her drooling companion, \"uh, that wasn't intentional but...ta-da? What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was a smart girl but her capacity for thought and response was gone. Miranda's glamorous curves hadn't been left to the imagination in her skimpy workout gear or fancy dress but naked, with every sculpted curve on display, the firm muscle gleaming with sweat from being blanked with warm Asari, she was stunning. High D cups seemed to defy gravity, their pink nipples pointed straight ahead. A lasered hairless pussy was so wet it threatened to drip down her slim thighs. But what really drew Liara's attention was Miranda's midriff: a gently stuffed little pale dome, swollen turgid with food and so unlike the rest of Miranda's firm body Liara couldn't take her eyes from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara? I know I look a little chubby right now...it's not bad is it?\" the cheerleader asked, voice tinged with a need for approval, putting her hand over her swollen belly, \"Oh I knew I shouldn't have eaten all that carrot cake. I've ruined myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no...you look amazing,\" the Asari drooled, \"your stomach is just the cutest. All the rest of you is so chiseled and hard but its just all pampered and sensitive looking, I'd love to see you with a real chubby tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was used to being naked or near naked in front of other people, be they temporary lovers or photographers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm sure that will never happen,\" Miranda smiled, with a little bit of nervousness and a lot of horniness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, get chubby? That, that would be...crazy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the way you eat I could see it,\" Liara laughed, \"but really though, you look fantastic...please though, my back Miri...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette made her way behind the couch, the little bounce of her stuffed belly strange to feel. It wasn't that Miranda didn't eat quite a bit, her muscles needed a lot of fueling, but usually it was carefully measured and not piles of greasy BBQ and fried delicacies and piles of desert. Her stomach gurgled at the strange feast, three or four usual meals starting to digest, when she got behind Liara and started pushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asari's shoulders were butter soft fat over tight muscle and Miranda's nimble fingers soon began releasing knots and popping vertebrae. Liara leaned forward with a moan and pulled her dress down, letting more plump back be exposed, and the cheerleader had to lean with her, food baby pressing against the couch's back and her own breasts hanging forwards. For once the flexible Miranda found herself be a little bit uncomfortable, she really was stuffed, and she had to stand on her tip toes to avoid her suddenly sensitive stomach be prodded, leaning her navel on the couch...which gave a groan at 440ish culmulative pounds of girl and food on oneside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda ignored it, pressing at Liara's shoulders as her breasts started to bounce against the back of the Asari's headtendrils. The tentacle like bumps featured heavily in pornography, which stereotyped them as being ridiculously sensitive...a stereotype that was very, very true. With every tap of Miranda's firm breasts against the back of her head, Liara let out a moan, pleasure shooting through her body from head to toe. She grabbed against the side of the chair, body starting to rock and sweat pouring off her forehead. Miranda smiled and pressed her breasts harder against the back of the blue girl's head, letting out a moan of her own...when the couch broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara fell to the side with a yelp, while the acrobatic cheerleader immediately did a flip forwards and landed on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm sorry I broke your couch,\" Liara quibbled, trying to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget the couch, I need a new one anyway,\" the cheerleader said, blowing hair from her face, \"I think though, its time for bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squatted down and helped Liara up, \"Yeah, I really need to get back to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to your room?\" the needy Miranda asked, eyes watering, \"but I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A motion activated light dinged on, showing a drooling Miranda Lawson in tight silk pajamas. The black haired woman looked adorkably cute: her slightly swollen belly was just a bit too big to get the button of the pajama shirt closed, a facial mask was over her face, she had a very old, well loved and much repaired teddy bear under one arm and wore a rather large retainer to keep her pearly whites straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asari was always uneasy sleeping in someone else\u2019s bed, but the look of devastated hurt on Miranda\u2019s face when she\u2019d suggested going back to her dorm had convinced her to sleep not just at the mansion but in Miranda\u2019s bed. Sleeping with the beautiful woman, who she was sure had been one snapped chair leg away from taking her virginity then and there, was hard...and got harder when Miranda immediately fell asleep and started snoring loudly, hugging Liara\u2019 tight as a life perserver in a ship wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho would have thought the campus ice queen would be such a needy softy?\u201d Liara thought, \u201cbut still, it feels nice to be so needed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asari\u2019s stomach rumbled inside her tight teddy, upset at the vast feast of meat and grease she\u2019d eaten. To her shame Miranda stirred, sitting up and showing an epic case of bedhead as she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, whaf thim ish it?\u201d the head-geared cheerleader asked, leaning past Liara for her communicator, \u201cUgh, ffive alshleady!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheer leader surged up, popping off her retainer with a squelch, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get a workout in before practice and then shower and get my make up on\u2026oh God I\u2019m such an ass, I\u2019ve got to get you back to your room and fed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally I don\u2019t have class till nine,\u201d Liara said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...that\u2019s good but I still need to get my first run and weights in,\u201d Miranda said, strutting over to a towering dresser and fumbling for workout clothes, \u201cespecially after last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara yawned and looked around the mostly dark room, with its towering dressers and wardrobes. It was cold, rich and austere, the only pictures ones of Miranda: elegant portraits and a few magazine centerfolds for some athletic win or academic reward. It felt...cold and lonely, a good explanation for both the brunette\u2019s icy exterior and the needy, affection seeking interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d be fine skipping one,\u201d Liara said, seeing Miranda strip off her pajamas, revealing a body almost all the way back to its perfect state, the food baby just a tiny swell, \u201cafter all, you said it wasn\u2019t really for you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I ate four thousand calories last night and don\u2019t want to get fat,\u201d the brunette said, sliding on a thong, \u201cOh god I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to imply it was bad you were fat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Liara said, \u201cI know you\u2019re a chubby chaser, that doesn\u2019t mean youneed to  want to get fat yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader blushed, \u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m not a chubby chaser\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara patted the dome of her gut, \u201cThen why is all of this in your bed? Miranda, I\u2019m fine with you liking me for my weight. But really, you said you were tired of doing so much work for everyone else. Why not relax the rest of the semester?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax?\u201d Miranda said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll, I mean I guess...but if I don\u2019t work out now I have class till three, I\u2019m trying to get a fourth major done before graduation\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Do you want it? Do you need it?\u201d the flabby Asari said, swinging her stiff, chubby legs off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no...I guess I just wanted it to be impressive. I already have what I need to graduate,\u201d the genius, rich cheer captain admitted, \u201cand I guess I really don\u2019t even need to have cheer practice this morning. Its off season and we\u2019re only required to do mondays and fridays\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you relax a while?\u201d Liara yawned, \u201cText out that practice is cancelled, you\u2019re the captain you can do that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can...and I will,\u201d Miranda decided, bounding over to her phone and sending out the alert to her assistant captain Kelly Chambers, \u201cand I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll drop those physics classes and take something easy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energetic brunette pulled up the school\u2019s website and began dropping advanced mathematical science theories for Traditional Baking and a new low impact gym class called \u201cAsari Spiritual Stretching\u201d. With every deleted physics course her soul soared and she was grinning ear to ear by the time she got signed up for the two easy courses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod I can\u2019t believe I did that, I\u2019m going to have so much more free time,\u201d Miranda grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat...now can you get me some antiacid so I can go back to sleep?\u201d the Asari yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Miranda smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t need much sleep, let me go get it for you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda\u2019s genetics meant she only needed three hours a day, but she wasn\u2019t quite willing to share that much yet. Placing her teddy bear in its safe spot on her dresser, she headed outside, mind awash with the possibilities of time to herself. Time to spend on her new couch with her new cuddly girlfriend. Time to spend watching this strange \u201canime\u201d stuff and maybe reading fiction books and even those \u201cvid-eo games\u201d she\u2019d seen frat bros play\u2026and maybe adding a few cheat days here and there. She\u2019d gone her whole college career without eating a slice or pizza or drinkign a cup of beer after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to a bathroom, seeing herself in the mirror. Ignoring the bedhead and shedding mask and the mark from her retainer, she did notice the little remnant food baby poking out of her pajamas. Last nights feast had been the most she\u2019d ever eaten, an uncontrolled bout of gorging that had put her two thousand calories up for the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a little less on the eating,\u201d Miranda said, patting the little bump, \u201calthough\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara had liked it when she was stuffed. And Liara while an obese porker, was hotter than hell. Not being at her best for once might not be the worst\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta keep it in limits though,\u201d Miranda said to herself, \u201ca few pounds I can work off but I don\u2019t want to get fat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Baking sounds fun: Miranda starts her new class, Baking with Professor Mordin and getting a new partner\u2026her hated rival Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsari stretching, sounds easy right: new Professor Samarra is teaching a rather suggestive class, with Miranda's other rival Ashley Williams in it..</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda strode toward Traditional Baking 101 fashionably late, with a click of designer heels and a swish of designer skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she'd agreed with Liara that she should be doing things for herself, the fashionista had still decided to dress in full on \"fuck me\" mode: four inch black pumps, white tights vacuumed onto her perfect legs, a dangerously short black skirt fitted tight around her hips, a white blouse with the top buttons undone to show snowy cleavage, a black jacket and thumbnail sized diamond ear rings. Several underclassmen had tripped or walked into walls passing her while she'd clicked into the basement lab, putting a little shot of self esteem into the anxious ice queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was rarely late to a class, especially without any of her regularly scheduled activities in the morning, but she'd made an exception. She'd taken a little cuddle nap with Liara and done a strong set of weights with her before breakfast. Both were an indulgence, Miranda loved the thrill of pumping iron yet had always limited it, as she knew too much would make her bulky and unfeminine. Yet doing what she wanted made her happy...which had led to a heavy breakfast of fruit and waffles and hot chocolate. She'd had so much fun chatting with Liara that she hadn't noticed the breakfast was refilling her food baby right back up to maximum size. She hadn't wanted to wear a skirt today due to cold winds, but none of her ultra tight pants would have fit and the perfect girl was feeling quite bloated and nervous someone would notice. The idea of eating what she wanted when she wanted still appealed to Miranda but she was still very afraid of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get it together Miri,\" she told herself, \"a cheat day now and again is okay.  A skipped cardio work out is okay. Doing that every day is going to fatten you right up. Just go to this fun class and take some notes, then go for a run...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab door opened to reveal a class already paired off around baking stations, save for one coed leaning on a table. Miranda grimaced to see a rail skinny girl with leather punk attire, a pony tail and several tattoos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, figures you're late, did you need to get your cow tits milked,\" Jack sniggered, \"or did your ass get stuck in the doors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's eyes narrowed, the ice queen coming back in full force, \"I was out bra shopping. I know you've never done that, but it takes a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no girl on campus that Miranda hated more than Jack, an English major and already published poet. They'd had a very brief love affair freshman year that had ended after Miranda asking what Jack's band size was for a planned gift and Jack saying Miranda's ass was big. Neither had meant anything negative about it, but scholarship student Jack was sensitive over her flat chest and the appearance conscious Miranda was always worried about the breadth of her 38 inch hips. Instead of an apology there'd been insults, a break up and an ever more acrimonious hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both opened their mouth when the professor swept up, a fast speaking Salarian, \"Oh yes, good good. Even number of students. Banter shows familiarity. You two will work together. Yes. Have to get started. Traditional cooking skills degrading due to easy availability of processed food. Time for introductory muffins, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda grimaced. Mordin Solus was known as the <i>hardest</i> professor on campus, one with so many rapidly earned degrees he bounced around various departments, leaving weeping students in his wake. His techno-biologic class was the only one Miranda had ever had to work at to earn an A in and she realized that this baking class would not be an easy time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it she and Jack were busy mixing and stirring...and arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says 400 ml of butter, are you trying to kill us?\" Miranda asked as Jack added in half a stick with her own very strong biotic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomato, to-mato,\" the poet shrugged, adding in more \"you get that batter whipped up yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking my time, I don't want any of it to splatter on my clothes,\" the rich girl claimed, stirring the sludge very slowly with her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the timers went off and the food was pulled from the ovens, it wasn't a surprise that the pair's muffins were limp and ugly looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice mixing fatass,\" Jack hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice ingredient measuring dumbass,\" Miranda whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Mordin moved down the line of students, handing out forms. Miranda's eyes widened when she looked at it, seeing that it was an entire packet of review slips for each of the dozen teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Project is done, time for grading. Must sample each team's results: taste, texture, temperature. Begin now,\" the Salarian ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dozen muffins?\" Miranda asked, eyes bulging at the caloric math, enough food for an entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Mordin said, relief making Miranda sigh, \"Whole muffin is unreasonable. Unless you want bonus points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked at her tray of useless food, other students already laying down slips marked with zero in all categories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can take a few carbs, unlike you porky buns,\" Jack sneared, picking up a tin and loading it up with other teams muffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked at the steaming baked goods, calculating that they'd be an entire weak of saturated fat and sugar, plus a whole day of calories. Through mighty clenching, her strong abdominal muscles were keeping her food baby mostly flat but she wasn't sure her skirt would stay on if she ate that many muffins. Really the last twenty four hours had been a caloric avalanche she couldn't let continue, it would ruin her figure! She was about to refuse when she realized that if she didn't eat these that Jack would get a better grade than her for the project!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please, when I gain it all goes to my breasts. Shame we can't say the same about you,\" Miranda smiled coldly, picking her own dozen treats and chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack ate all the faster to see the cheer leader unexpectedly munching carbs, while Miranda cut through the treats like a buzzsaw. She'd rarely had any sort of muffin before and most of the class's food was excellent. Each warm bite made her feel sleepy and comfortable...until about six muffins in and her trembling abs couldn't hold her stomach flat anymore. The brunette bombshell made a face and a faint gasp as her food baby popped, the waistband of her skirt suddenly pinching. Buttons stretched and seams strained, a tidal wave of swell that she arrested with a mighty clench of her abs. Despite flexing mightily she couldn't pull her waistline in, merely hold it steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a matter, suck too many dicks before class to finish?\" Jack said, slowly eating her seventh, \"or did your shapewear break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tattooed biotic wasn't looking to svelte herself: Jack didnt' work out or watch what she ate, making her toneless and out of shape even if thin. Her stomach was swelling over her waistband and she used a little burst of biotic power to undo the button of her jeans for comfort's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thinking about getting into a DD cup bra,\" Lawson sneered back, \"tell me, do training bras have sizes? Or are you not big enough for a training bra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda made herself eat, trembling belly muscles trying to suck in best they could. She broke the process into steps: Lift the muffin, peal the muffin, record appearance, bite muffin, record taste, bite muffin, record texture, bite muffin, record consistency. Repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other students had gathered around to see the epic showdown between punk and cheerleader, taking pics and making bets, numbers changing as the number of muffins dwindled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing her eleventh, Miranda regretted taking this class. Her stomach groaned, stretching out to a new, painful record. Sweat broke out over her make up and the glamorous girl swayed in her seat as number eleven went down. Nearly four thousand calories from just the muffins gurgled in her stomach and Miranda was ready to throw up and pass out. Blouse buttons were gaping wide over pale tummy flesh, skirt pleats were stretched wide and only a technological miracle kept her skirt button from flying off. If it wasn't for her superior genetics, fast metabolism already digesting the muffins, she'd have passed out into a food coma. And the worst part was she was still sucking in hard as she could, if she relaxed who knew how bad it would look?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Someone passed her a glass of whole milk, itself an unthinkable extravagance yesterday, and she drained it without a thought. Jack was looking even worse, swaying in her seat and with her pants fully unzipped. She'd been staring at the last muffin, one from her and Miranda's terrible batch, for nearly a minute, eyes unfocused as her non-genetically perfected body tried to deal with the rush of calories and sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda put a hand to her hot, swollen waist and levitated the last of her own muffins into her mouth. It tasted terrible, with clumps of unmixed flower and sugar and far too buttery, but she made herself eat it. Mighty as they were her own abs started to give way, but she put a hand to them, holding her stomach in as she plucked the last muffin from Jack's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a matter, too rich for you?\" Miranda grinned, eating the muffin with a smile to the cheers of her class mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass was dismissed and she strutted out, moving easy and coyly, as if Miranda Lawson was commonly seen with a swollen stomach ten inches bigger around than normal. She made it to her Ferrari in the parking lot, she opaqued the windows with a tap of a finger, put on the noise cancellers and then gave a mighty scream as she stopped sucking in. Mere cloth tore apart, her expensive designer clothes shredding under the assault of baked goods. Buttons pinged around the interior and she hissed as hot, sensitive belly skin touched the cold steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked down at the lap filling dome, \"I guess a post class run is out of the question today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda was lucky she had a full six hours until her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd spent almost all of it in a soaking hot tub, rubbing her swollen stomach, drinking anti-acid and wondering what the hell she was doing. She'd planned to relax, not make herself a freak! She'd eaten a frightening amount of food in the last twenty four hours and her body wasn't used to it, gurgling and complaining, making her feel tired and cranky. Worse, videos and gifs of her little victory were already floating around the campus extranet. All the comments were positive so far but still, people had seen her with a <i>belly.</i> Even though it had felt great to stuff herself to cheers and to win it was so embarrassing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look cute in the video,\" Liara messaged her, almost surprising enough to make Miranda drop the tablet in the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I really let go. I look all piggy,\" she said with an emoji, \"so embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The belly looks great on you,\" the freshman insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner at my place?\" Miranda texted, heart pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't. Lots of homework,\" Liara said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it all,\" the senior said to herself outloud, patting her slightly receded stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would her father say if he saw this? His billions of dollars in investment with a gut? He'd pull her from school, cut her accounts, she'd never get to have fun again...No.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck him. I'm an adult,\" Miranda decided, then carefully moved her own very substantial accounts into secure Volus banks in case he tried to cut her off anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a long nap, watched some anime Liara had recommended and went through another relaxing spa treatment before preparing for class. Asari stretching had a scant description, just that it was being taught by a guest professor and involved low impact exercise. Miranda got into a standard set of bikinish workout gear...then noticed that while not the full term pregnancy it was, her food baby was still very much showing. She sucked it in until her stomach was its normal flat hardness and then released it fully, tapping it and wondering what it would feel like soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that that will ever happen,\" Miranda said, changing from the bikini into some more concealing yoga pants and tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived on time at least to the second class, walking into a gym room to see a dozen other fit looking coeds. Her eyes traveled across them...until they met a pair of brown eyes glaring daggers at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lawson,\" Ashley Williams sneered, \"I'd have thought you'd needed rolled in after that video today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was yet another ex-lover, from a relationship that had lasted an entire weekend until Williams had asked if Miranda was ever going to do a real sport and Miranda had mentioned the ROTC student's shameful familial military history in response. The hatred had escalated from there, made worse as Williams was one of the best footbal players on campus and Miranda had to frequently cheer for her. Miranda had rather evilly made a game of shagging whatever player Williams had an eye on first. She was a little shorter than Miranda but thicker, her body curvaceous and muscular looking with hard arms and thick legs. Her breasts were only Cs and her abs weren't visible, indeed she had a little puff of spare flesh, but no one could deny that Ash was also a fit hotty in her white and pink spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a small snack, I burn a lot of energy stealing your boyfriends,\" Miranda smiled, setting up her yoga mat, \"you should try doing that. It might help with the beer bely you've grown since Freshman year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the professor came in, this one far different than Professor Mordin. She was an Asari and there her similarities to Liara ended. Where Miranda's new maybe GF was soft, short and lazy this alien was hard, tall and exuded fit energy. She was taller than Miranda by an inch and more ripped than Williams, built like a MMA fighter at peak shape or an olympic athlete who'd retained very feminine shape. A red spandex one piece showed off round, hard hips and what had to be E cup breasts dotted with dark freckles of bluer skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good moring girls,\" the Asari, clearly much older than Liara, said clearly, \"I am Professor Samarra. And you will be learning how to embrace eternity with me. Let us begin with a stretch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was superbly fit, she could run a four minute mile back to back, held black belts in six martial arts and could hold her breath three full minutes while swimming. But she soon found herself huffing and puffing , her motions sluggish and off key as she followed along. Samarra was merciless, moving and dancing slowly and smoothly for the full hour and a half of class and for the first time in years Miranda felt herself falling behind. A little might be the result of eating ten thousand calories since the night before but she found herself making mistake after mistake, while her muscles were locking up with painful cramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Ashley making an equal number of mistakes prevented Miranda from quitting, the usually ace athelete was stumbling around like a couch potato. Both brunettes nearly collapsed by the end of the exercise, sweat pouring off of them. To their shame, the rest of the class were daisy fresh. None of them were notable athletes, a few were actually chubby even but the ROTC cadet and occasional professional model could barely pick themselves off their mats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class is dismissed, except for you two,\" Samara said, falling into a cross legged position, \"stay and speak with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others left, leaving Miranda and Ashley to make their way over to the stern, blue woman, stiffly sitting across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today was the Arilat Kreash,\" Samara said, \"and it reveals to me internal secrets of its dancers. Both of you are weighed down with karmic loads, you will not be able to pass my class until you clear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth very sweaty seniors stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but is this a religious thing?\" Ashley asked, \"because I'm not interested in converting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm not into mystical bullshit,\" Miranda puffed, blowing sweaty hair out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara didn't look angry at the rejection, \"It is not religious, merely the shape of eternity. Both of you have such strong defensive walls raised to avoid hurt and hide your true selves. You deny what you want in hopes of getting recognition. Ashley, you wanted to be an english major but your cadet scholarship wouldn't cover that so you hide yourself as a jock. Miranda, all you want is for someone to accept you for you but you're afraid to be thought less than perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is...complete shit,\" Miranda started, only for the Asari to place finger tips to her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I...an english major,\" Ashley said sadly, Samara's other hand going to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can lower these walls for you,\" Samara said, \"and let you experience a day without caring about judgement. Would you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally Miranda begged for it, the thing she'd wanted her whole anxious life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExternally she sneered, \"Please like that would even work. This is all just mumbo jumob and I can't believe the dean is allowing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it won't work, why refuse it?\" Samara asked evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not really my thing,\" Ashley said, pulling away, a little roll of fat bunching over her spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and try, even if it was real its not like I have any defensive behaviors,\" Miranda foolishly boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you will,\" Samara said, surging a little bit of biotic power from her finger tips across Miranda's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of a childhood spent being tutored and coached, never a moment or possession for herself save for her beloved teddy bear and of an adolescent so desperate for affection and love and so afraid she'd never be good enough to earn it she'd developed an incredibly icy exterior shot through the cheerleader's brain. All the snooty upper class mannerisms and fiendish devotion to her own body to please everyone else fled past, leaving Miranda sitting alone. Her abs had fully relaxed, letting her little food baby show and she was soaked with sweat...but she didn't care at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...,\" Miranda blinked, the world looking new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now free. You will not let worries about being perfect or fears about being vulnerable control you for the next day,\" Samara said, \"what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...,\" the cheer captain stammered.</span></div></div>",

But she felt...good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do feel better after that exercise,\u201d she said to herself, patting a pillowy thigh, \u201cnot that I\u2019m going to see results if I\u2019m eating so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was still bloated from the high class, greasy feast last night and the big breakfast that morning. Despite the leadened feeling in her stomach and the mild soreness in her muscles, Liara felt more energic than she had since starting to blow up. She wondered if she should go on a walk and get something or, since her homework was now done if she should text Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be smothering,\u201d the Asari mused, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 want to bother her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at the gif replaying on her social media screen, one of a huge stomached Miranda chugging a glass of milk. It was so unbelievably sexy, the contrast between firm limbs, classy clothes and Miranda\u2019s bloated waist and hoggish demeanor. Goddess, what if she did put on weight for real? What if she got soft and chubby? Liara had never been into heavy girls before, her whole life she\u2019d been the heavy girl, but the thought of the flawless ice queen going to seed\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this is crazy, gorgeous cheerleaders don\u2019t juts do...any of this stuff,\u201d Liara sighed, \u201calthough she did seem really sweet in private. Would she really eat all that with me and let me sleep in her bed and let me see her with a retainer otherwise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asari\u2019s stomach growled, she hadn\u2019t eaten anything since breakfast after all and she sighed to realize she\u2019d missed the dining halls lunch and dinner hours. Frowning she decided to go for a walk and then text Miranda to see if sh ewas open, not wanting to seem clinging. She pulled on a t-shirt, sucked in her stomach to button her jeans and headed towards the door. A long walk and a small salad would do her good...but a heavy knock sounded on the door, almost shaking it off its hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d Liara asked in no small amount of alarm as animal pounding sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me Li,\u201d Miranda\u2019s voice cut across, high and raspy, \u201cPlease let me in, its an emergency!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara wondered why the senior hadn\u2019t just texted or why she\u2019d go to a three hundred pound freshman for help with anything beyond snack disposal but she opened up the door anyway to see a wild looking Miranda. Raven locks were a tousseled mess, her ears and nose were red from cold and she was covered in sweat, clearly having sprinted the whole way to the freshman dorms. Liara's girlfriend, she hoped, was near hyperventilating and her blue eyes gleamed with overwhelming desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miri, what's going on?\" she started to ask only for the tall human girl to lurch into her room, wrapping her arms around Liara's shoulders and holding her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you. You're so soft, you're so warm, you're so sweet. You don't judge me, you don't expect from me, you don't need me to be perfect,\" the cheer leader begged her, \"I want you. I need you. Here. Now. Whatever you want, any position, any kink, just take me now please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara opened her mouth to delay. Her V card and its unpunched state had weighed on her for twenty years, she'd always been chubby for an Asari even under her mother's harsh hand, a shy, plump nerdette too chicken to even ask another maiden out. And here was this glorious angel all but demanding they have sex....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but, I've never,\" she started to say, only for Miranda to kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink lips met blue ones in a soft, moist explosion of joy. Miranda grabbed the shorter, much heavier woman and lifted her up with her strong legs, pinning the blueberry blubber ball against the wall and keeping her there with a burst of biotic power. Liara's doughy stems wrapped around Miranda's slim waist, her soft stomach fat pressed around the cheerleader's tight torso and the two made out. Tongues danced across each other, Liara's double chin wobbling as her tongue shot down Miranda's throats. Miranda's hand snaked across her fat rolls, unsnapping the Asari's bra and pulling free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so heavy, its like holding up a bunch of cement bags,\" Miranda gasped, letting the blue girl slide down the wall to a standing position, \"while humping a big pile of jello...you're so fucking sexy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started tearing off the Asari's sweater like an animal, freeing the big flopping breasts. Obesity had brought Liara a large, heavy seat and Miranda shoved her face into them, warming up her cold face between their blue softness. Liara squealed at the feeling and kept squealing as Miranda motor boated her, tit flesh battering her face for nearly three minutes before she rose with a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could drown in there, my god I never want to leave,\" the cheer leader sighed, cupping the large blue breasts, \"your nipples, they're purple...I didn't think they'd be purple...can I...please let me suck them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yes, Goddess suck me off!\" Liara moaned, the cry rising higher and higher as Miranda's mouth met her left nipple, sucking desperately to get as much blue tit into her mouth as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stumbled toward Liara's narrow twin bed, which groaned as Liara fell onto it and started pulling off her pants. Miranda ripped off her own clothes, nipples harder than diamonds and thighs slick with wetness. Her hair blew and twisted in an invisible breeze, her biotic powers going haywire at her horniness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so hot, so soft,\" the brunette moaned, pouncing onto the waterbed of an Asari and pressing tight around her, \"Never stop touching me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scuttled around Liara, wrapping her legs around the fatgirl's face, \"Eat me, eat me like you ate carrot cake yesterday, do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara? Liara?\" Miranda whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara woke back up, heart still racing.. She was naked and pressed against the wall on her bed. She remembered the hot burst of intense sex and smiled, her V card was thoroughly punched. She craned her head around to see Miranda only to feel a jab in her side and realize that the slim Brunette was still pinned beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asari rolled over with a lurch, letting the fit girl sit up with a gasp. The sweaty Miranda sprang up like a vampire from a coffin, drawing in air as quick as she could before flopping back onto Liara's soft rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your first time, that was pretty good,\" Miranda smiled, running fingers into the depths of Liara's rolls, \"give me a few minutes and we can go again. I'll show you a few tricks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was about to comment on how the element zero fields on her nipples had felt divine but another growl came out of her stomach. Miranda laughed and kissed it, blowing a raspberry on the azure blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's hungry,\" Miranda said, looking around the small dorm room, noticing her ruined clothes, \"I can't go anywhere until i get a new set of clothes shipped to me. Let's order something, how about pizza? I've never had pizza in a dorm room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I should,\" Liara wheezed, \"I need to get in shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine pizza for me and a salad for my dainty little freshman,\" the cheerleader smiled, rolling up and standing, her little food baby still noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara might have asked about the dark haired woman's ravenous appetite but she was honestly far too tired to critize the weight of someone a hundred and seventy pounds less than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I'm pretty?\" Liara asked, forcing herself to stand on trembling legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you're the most divine woman I've ever seen,\" Miranda smiled, \"If all I do is fuck you for the rest of my life, its worth it. Do you like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you? Of course, you're so...on the inside you're so mushy and awkward. I love it, you're adorable,\" Liara grinned, \"you're twenty one and still sleep with a teddy bear. Never change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda giggled nervously, \"Yeah, please never tell anyone that...and I'm going to need that to sleep. And my retainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're staying?\" Liara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind, I've spent too long having sex with someone and then not sleeping with them,\" Miranda yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled a hoodie off of Liara's chair and used it as an impromptu skirt, the blue jacket keeping her mostly decent as long as she pulled it down a little, although her fantastic legs were totally exposed and the bottom of her glorious cheeks peaked out no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not busy, let's watch some anime and cuddle while the pizza comes,\" the brunette grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Progress</b>: Two weeks pass, Liara is slowly getting fitter...but Miranda sure isn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Free Choice</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can't do it,\" Liara grunted, sweat pouring down her face and her breath coming in ragged gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe iron bar on her shoulders was a torture device. Leg and glute muscles were screaming in a silent symphony. Yoga pants gave warning groans of stretching seams. Every fiber of the Asari's significant being wanted to lay down and quit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it Li,\" Miranda's posh accented ordered from behind her, \"I know you can, now push up and make that weight your bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara roared, forcing herself to stand upwards and slammed the squat bar back onto its rack with a heavy clang. She blinked and gasped, legs trembling and almost fell. At the last second, a biotic field supported her and Liara felt a pair of arms grab her from behind in a tight hug, blue squish spilling around slim white forearms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, easy there girl,\" Miranda said in her ear, \"no passing out after your new record. 160lbs after only three weeks, we better slow down. Don't want you to get too buff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much chance of that,\" the obese Asari puffed, feeling Miranda's hands run down across her hanging belly bulge and giving it a shake, \"the way we've been eating we've probably been gaining weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty one days had passed since Liara started her surprising relationship with Miranda. The lazy, obese girl had become quite active in that time, putting in hour and a half long weight lifting sessions every morning with her new girlfriend as well as a long walk together. Fat wasn't exactly evaporating off of her, although her clothes had stopped getting tighter and she felt more energetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you barely touched your triple chocolate fudge cake last night,\" Miranda said, fingers slipping around the curve of Liara's drooping love handles and playing with her stacked rolls of back fat, \"I can barely get my fingers into your fat rolls anymore. And your ass, I swear its only a little squishy anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara laughed as her couch cushion cheeks were squeezed and jiggled, fat puffing over the top of her yoga pants and a jiggle shooting up her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm no body builder but its nice to see a different number than my weight go up,\" Liara huffed, cheeks slowly purpling at realizing Miranda's arms were wrapped tight across her breasts, hands cupped across her nipples, \"I know its not what you can lift but its a start...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than a start, you deserve a reward for that,\" Miranda smiled, hugging her slightly firmer waterbed girlfriend tighter,  \"I'm thinking filet with chocolate cake, some protein shakes and then some hot tub time before an early turn in...so, let's get me done so we can get started. It's not every day you hit 160lbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda gave a quick and precise lick across the sensitive tips of Liara's hair tendrils, making the alien see stars before prowling around the front of her to get started on her own set of butterfly presses. And the sight of the head cheerleader's twitching glutes made Liara realize the celebration of hitting 160lbs might be two fold. When they'd met the raven haired cheerleader had been completely fatless save for her fantastic breasts but upon dating Liara, Miranda's dietary restraint had gone completely out the window. She was eating more than the Asari was at most meals now and snacking heavily, her tastes towards long denied sweets with plentiful added sugars and few nutrients. Chocolate stains were visible on the corners of her now permanent smile, a sign that she'd been eating in the gym again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you can say that again,\" Liara said, seeing the jiggles going up Miranda's long, shapely legs as she stepped, \"what do you happen to be up to now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose stems were still glorious, but they were also softer and fuller, no more the limbs of a long distance runner. Her ankle wasn't so delicate and her thigh muscles didn't pop anymore. The gap between her thighs was closing in, soft fat reaching towards one another and not far away from touching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On squats, about 280lbs. Up ten in the last month,\" Miranda said, bending down to set the weights, a roll of tummy fat pooching over her spandex bikini bottom, \"not the same rate of improvement as you though. I don't have all that cute fluff to serve as fuel like you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn meeting, Miranda had had a flawlessly chiseled six pack, so hard as to be almost threatening. Residual definition remained on the upper part of her stomach, although slight. The rest was turning into a cute little tummy pooch that had just started hanging over her pants. It begged to be pinched and sucked and fondled, as did the matching little love handles jiggling on the sides. Liara had to guess a couple pants sizes had added themselves to Miranda's waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erhm, I don't think its just ten pounds,\" Liara said, eyes bulging as Miranda bent to adjust the seat position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader had had a badonkadonk since high school. Her athletic progenitors had all had muscular cabooses and their cumulative daughter was no exception, her high school athletics and college cheerleading bulking out her glutes into hard, feminine steel. Miranda had confessed to feeling a bit subconscious about the ghetto-blasters she hauled behind her before, that she'd had to make herself wear short shorts and thongs to show it off and make the large buns a positive. Miri was continuing that trend now, her straining athletic thong drowning in expanded cheeks. Miri's but had gone soft, excess calories finding a new home there and sheathing her muscle in round fat. All the weight lifting and yoga kept it firm and high, but she was considerably wider across with a thick stretchmark on each cheek and the start of cellulite on the lower slope. The same with her girlish hips, which had a womanly roundness to them and a sashay Miri couldn't deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I'd know if it was more,\" Miranda said, putting her thicker arms up and grabbing the bars, \"you know I was always afraid of getting too bulky. Of not looking thin, but now, I just wish it was more. I hate that I needed to care so much about what people think of me that I didn't work out how I wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader pushed, her pecs straining against her sports bra and making Liara have to sit down. For a girl with 10% body fat, Miranda's D cups had been huge, legacy of a six time Galactic Sports Illustrated Cover Model who's tendency towards chubbiness had seemingly been edited out of Miranda's genome. They'd always soaked up extra calories and now that Miranda was eating six or seven thousand a day they were inflating. Soft boob fat mushroomed out of her sports bra, which had to be hooked on the loosest setting anyway, the pale mammary heaven straining the supporting fabric to the max. Each breath sent the D cup bra sighing, the new cup sizes Miri was packing eager to be free. Australian cleavage puffed out the bottom, side fat spilled out at her arm pits and soft shoulder meat puffed along the band. Liara had to guess her girlfriends tits were almost as big as hers, with Miri being a hundred and eighty...well, not a hundred and eighty anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miri, I hate to say this...well not hate. I think you look great, just don't take this as a criticism,\" Liara said, looking at the sweat coming off Miranda's face, slightly puffier than it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take what, Li?\" the cheerleader said, \"I can take some criticism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara didn't dignify that. Beneath her ice queen demeanor, Miranda was sensitive as a broken tooth. It had gotten a little better lately, the Asari Yoga class taught by Professor Samara having helped her find a moral center but Liara knew her girlfriend cared a lot about looking good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, really remember I think you look great,\" Liara said, taking in the small rip where Miranda's broad, childbearing right hip was pressing at the seam of her panties and the groans coming from the sports bra, \"but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda didn't have any visible muscle tone, despite her lifts going up considerably the last three weeks. She was building fat faster than she was muscle, her gluttonous, unrestrained diet obliterating her fatless, modelsque figure. Right now she looked a little like Liara had at the start of freshman year, a squishy hour glass with big boobs and a little tummy, although Miranda's curves were more drastic, drinking in extra fat faster than her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara, waddled over as Miranda finished the set, awkwardly forcing her azure rolls and bulk into Miranda's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not want to wait for dinner to get started,\" Liara smiled, kissing her girlfriend and slipping the tongue, \"and we're already almost naked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later the two lay on the floor, covered in sweat, completely naked and breathing heavily. Through the haze of endorphins and fading muscle tremors, Liara noticed how deeply Miranda was breathing as she rolled out from between Liara's twitching legs and caught her breath. The cheerleader was not in as good as shape as she'd been at the start of their fling, that was sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miri, I think you're getting a little out of shape,\" Liara gasped, still seeing stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda wiped her hair from her eyes, \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its been a bit since you've gone running and you're breathing so hard...,\" Liara puffed, barely thinking, \"never thought you'd get so chubby so quick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked down at herself, seeing the lack of muscle, the squish and the jiggle gaining twenty five pounds in three weeks had added and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fat Fashionista:</b> was happy with the results. Stripped of insecurities, Miranda has been intentionally gaining weight, wanting to bury the perfect image her father created and be her own, perfectly plus size woman.

Miranda's cleavage was still unbelievably firm, youth and muscle keeping the borderline Es shockingly round and her pink nipples were small. Lists gasped as they touched, pleasure radiated from her chest to the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing this on purpose?\" The archaeology major asked through the joy, \"for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More because of you. You taught me how good it feels to overeat, hope nice a stuffed stomach pressing into another is, how much better snacking and watching cartoons is than running,\" Miranda said, gasping as she made both sets of tits jiggle, \"but I'm doing this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda sat up, giving liara a good look at her naked. Her breasts seemed shiny, the skin stretching with a new cupsize or two of fat on the inside. And her belly pooch was more noticeable, puffing in and out with every breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be fat?\" The obese asari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you a secret Li, one only I and my father know,\" Miranda said, \"I'm perfect and I mean perfect. I was built that way in a lab. You read Frankenstein in first semester literature? Well you're staring at the bride of Frankensteins tits. I've got the human record holder for the 5Ks legs, a six time covergirls breasts, an Olympic gymnastics champs and and the IQ of the women who figured out Mass effect drives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara couldn't miss the sneer in Miranda's words,\"by the goddess, isn't that level of genetic modification illegal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you get caught. And Dad was careful, it's why I only did cheerleading in college. Id get noticed in the blood tests real sports require,\" Miranda sighed, putting Liara's puffy hands on her round hips, \"I was made to be the perfect heir. The brains and the model looks and the bitch personality were all made for me to have, to manage the Lawson fortune for father. The only thing I've ever done for me that hasn't been petty spite is date you and gain twenty five pounds. He'll flip his shit when he finds out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pinched her stomach fat for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting fat to spite your dad? Funny, I always snacked to get my mom angry. She was so upset I weighed 175 at high school graduation she put me in fat camp. Again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smiled, \"Lot of good that did. My dad will at best disinherit me. At worst assassinate me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're still getting fat to spite him?\" Liara squeaked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, weren't you listening? I'm getting fat because I enjoy it and it looks damn good on me,\" the brunette laughed, getting her to for emphasis, \"I'm going to take his business from him and put him in jail out of spite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in and kissed Liara on the mouth, \"we'll see how he likes his perfect daughter when she's testifying in court about how she came to be. Come though, enough plotting. I'm hungry and fat girls shouldn't be kept waiting. You gave me quite the work out and I'm wasting away here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's belly formed a little fold as she<br>\r\nStood and her breasts bounced pulling Liara up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess, I didn't know any of that,\" the Asari said, hugging Miranda while the brunette put in their order, \"you poor thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda hugged her back, patting Liara's back fat, \"Yes, I should really see a therapist or twenty but they'd tell me gaining give hundred pounds was a bad coping mechanism. But for now, we only need to worry about eating. Now where'd my sports bra go? I'm a big girl any more and need support.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her force her bountiful bouncers into the over whelmed spandex, Liara watched soft little back fat rolls appear across a once pristine back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you getting fat is, what's the word, sexy as fuck. But aren't you worried about how all this will affect your status on campus? You seem to enjoy being the hottest girl in school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda turned, jostling her breasts as she took in Liara's blue bulk, \"Right now, I think I'm a distant second. But I'm planning on regaining the title and I think everyone else is going to love the new me. Now let's go shower and eat. I want to be over two hundred pounds by spring break.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe near dragged the Asari out of the room, \"and that's going to be hard, given the calories I'm going to burn fucking your brains out.

The uniforms aren\u2019t here and we don\u2019t have any drills to do\u2026what\u2019s going on with you? Is this some sort of test?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo general in human or even Turian history had ever ran their armies with as firm a hand as Miranda Lawson. New Chicago University\u2019s cheer team was only \u2018required\u201d to practice twice a week, but under Miranda\u2019s iron hand they\u2019d practiced seven days a week in the off season and fourteen times a week in the on season. Girls had drilled jumps, throws and tumbles to the point that they did them in their sleep, their muscles growing stronger per pound than any athlete in the school. And to further Lawson\u2019s desire for perfection, draconian weight limits had been imposed, diets mandated and every cheerleader learned to dread the bite of calipers. Anyone found over the weight limit for a week straight was cut without remorse, Lawson\u2019s icy force of personality having long overawed their non-entity of a coach. Yet for every girl cut, three more hit try outs for to be one of Lawson\u2019s team was to be one of the most desirable girls on campus...especially as Lawson was more than willing to flat out buy girls who pleased her boob jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was one of those, she'd come onto the team with A cups and now after a year of sucking up to the icy, sarcastic Miranda and fulfilling her every whim boasted full, fake Cs in her tight cheer assistant captain's uniform. While some might see refilling Miranda's water bottle, printing out her cheer routines and handing out uniforms as too much work, getting to be around the gorgeous Miranda was enough to set the bisexual sophomore's heart a flutter. Lawson was so sculpted and curvy and leggy...and the captain's uniform was even skimpier than every one else's...Kelly remained a virgin still, because no one else could compare to the girl she'd pinned her heart on. And the weeks without hearing from Miranda had driven Kelly round the bend with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat none of the team had heard so much as a word, digitally or verbally, from their Captain in three weeks was alarming. Especially to Kelly, who worshiped the ground the lithe, busty ice queen deigned to walk on and devoured the tiny crumbs of near praise tossed to her. If she hadn\u2019t been seen around campus, and online in a near viral eating contest with angsty poetry major Jacqueline Nair, Kelly would have thought Miranda had been kidnapped. Rumors circulated: that Miranda was on academic probation for fucking the Dean, that she\u2019d gotten pregnant from an orgy with every sports team at once, that she\u2019d lost her money and was living with an alien freshman, even (most laughably at all) that she\u2019d gotten fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike that would ever happen to Miranda. Ugh, she\u2019s gonna be pissed when she sees me,\u201d Kelly sighed, looking down past her fake C cups to the little puff of belly fat she\u2019d picked up in the training hiatus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was short and skinny...ish...but hadn\u2019t always been that way. Her family were fatties and at one point she\u2019d had an extra hundred pounds on her body than she did now. It had taken a lot of work in High School to get and stay skinny and Lawson\u2019s training had made her steely and fit, with a flat stomach, tight butt and figure appropriate fake C cups. Lawson had picked Kelly to be the May girl in the cheer team\u2019s fundraising calendar and wearing just a miniscule cheer skirt on the beach had been the proudest moment of Kelly\u2019s life so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo proud that she\u2019d rewarded herself far too much during Winter Break with her very heavy set mother\u2019s excellent cookies, turning back up at school ready for a crash diet to try and get rid of the little tummy fluff she\u2019d picked up. Instead lack of contact from Miranda, no practices and the rest of the team chattering in her ear about what was happening had driven Kelly into stress eating. Five weeks of too many carbs and not enough exercise had taken the polish off Kelly\u2019s muscles and made her midriff squishy, as shown far too much by her skimpy cheer top. She knew her odds of being on the team next week were low. Every returning cheerleader were looking a little softer, without Miranda\u2019s boot on their necks they\u2019d over indulged. The twenty or so girls were still slender and gorgeous but all looked a little softer than before break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, why can\u2019t she just pick up,\u201d Kelly sighed, adjusting her short black skirt against her nascent muffin top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the holo-phone actually rang with a picture of the svelte Captain, 95% naked from the photo that had convinced Kelly to pick NCU as her college, she was so surprised she almost dropped it onto the gym floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, I need you to meet me at the gym side door,\" Miranda ordered, \"uhm...please. I'll need your help carrying breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bweakfwash?\" Kelly said, swallowing quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, for the new team diet. Come now, I want them in while they're fresh,\" Miranda ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly swallowed and hurried for the door, hating the little jiggle at her belly. She sucked her stomach in as far as she could and opened the door, admitting a chill and a very tall stack of delicious smelling donuts. The treats were plunked into Kelly's arms, heavy enough the out of shape girl almost dropped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there we go. Thank you Kelly, don't know what I'd do without you,\" Miranda said, uncharacteristically kind, \"go set them down on the bleachers and get the girls over. I'll get the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest?\" Kelly squeaked, shocked that the greasy carbs weren't bursting into flame from being near the perfect Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly staggered over to the bleachers, setting the stack down to the confusion of the other girls who'd gathered up around the unfamiliar carbs. Miranda soon joined her, much longer legs letting her put the stack of fresh donuts down almost as quick as Kelly. The Captain hopped agilely onto the bleachers, a move that few among the athletic girls could have copied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So girls, I apologize for the radio silence first off,\" Miranda said, hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked her idol over and felt...odd. Miranda was in a very short cheer skirt that's black fringes left nothing to the imagination, her gorgeous legs visible from ankle almost to her panties. And those long, shapely legs looked...thick. Thick and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I've pushed you over the last three years. Pushed you harder than you needed to be and not for your benefit, for mine. I'm sorry for that. I wasn't thinking like I should have been. I was using you and that was wrong with me,\" Miranda announced, \"and by way of apology, well...weight limits are now off. If you can do the routine, you're on the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty restrained waists relaxed, starter bellies popping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So girls,\" Miranda said, undoing her zipper to reveal an untoned, almost chubby waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's mouth fell open. Forget her little tummy, Captain Lawson had a full on muffin top! A belt of soft fat bulged over Miranda's skin tight skirt waist, pale jiggle instead of hard muscle. Further up, her ribs were gone and she instead had little side rolls. Her breasts were puffing out of her bra, the veiny white spheres about to rip free with every breath. How she'd managed to cram herself into the skin tight outfit was a mystery, Kelly would put even money on it catastrophically failing sometime in the next hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To show you I'm genuine, our first practice is going to be a breakfast,\" Miranda told them, opening up a box and taking out a chocolate eclair,\"and then a discussion on routines this year. We're going to be going for a less...acrobatic approach. But don't think for a moment this will be easy, we'll be doing seven practices a week still: three of them will be team breakfast's and weight lifting sessions. I'll be expecting you all to eat appropriately. See me if you need money for a nutritionist or extra groceries.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain further stunned her team by thrusting the entire eclair into her mouth, chewing and swallowing in seconds. Kelly felt sweat break across her forehead, what had Miranda done to herself? She'd been so perfect and fit, now she was so squishy and soft and decadent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and girls. From now on my...enhancement rewards will be off the table,\" Miranda told them, glancing down at her own mountainous cleavage, \"I assure you that you won't need it. So let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda grabbed another doughnut and sat, a little too quickly to a loud rip that echoed out over the gym. The front of her cheer skirt had, under pressure from hip and tummy, ripped in half, revealing Miranda's soft, squishy waist in full over her thong panties. Kelly half expected the other cheerleaders to break into giggles at seeing their tyrannical captain eat her way out of her clothes in front of them but the stunned crowd of women all just watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and we'll be taking orders for new uniforms. Trust me girls, be generous with your size,\" Miranda smiled, patting her stomach, \"if you're not watching you can get big quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly should have been hearing laughter, but instead she found herself on the bleachers munching a doughnut and chatting happily. It shouldn't be happening, they should be taking their revenge on Miranda's cruel past behavior but the chubby cheer captain was acting so nice and listening so well that all Kelly could do was eat and go along with it...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda sashayed her way towards the baking lab, leaving a trail of chaos behind her: books were dropped, walls were walked into, stairs were tumbled down and a few girlfriends would have become very angry to see their boyfriends drool over the Cheerleader...if their own eyes weren't glued to swaying hips and bouncing breasts about to pop out of a size eight little black dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawson smiled seductively at a traffic jam she caused at one class door, blowing a small kiss and throwing her hair back. Taken woman she might be now but it felt good to know the effect she had on the majority of sexual beings was only increasing with her mass. She might talk a big game to Liara but she was nervous as hell with every extra pound that she wouldn't be...what? Sexy, alluring, perfect? She might hate her father for having her patched together like a computer program but as approval seeking and needy as she was, Miranda did want positive attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially after gaining thirty, well, more like thirty five pounds now, in a little over a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda wasn't even medically overweight. At 5'10 and 175lbs, the tall, leggy cheerleader was only a pound or two above a normal weight. But compared to the rail thin diet fanatic she'd been before thirty three cheat days in a row she was ...negatively she was chubby with a budding double chin and thighs that had started to touch at the saddlebags, arms that were getting jiggly and enough belly chub to give her a little gut. Positively, and Miri was trying hard to think positively about this, she was a curvaceous bombshell with mouthwatering shapely legs leading up to impossibly round hips and bouncing into view from side to side was an ass like two volleyballs in a one volleyball sack. And that was only if someone could take their eyes away from her brain-melting tits: snow white 38Es that bounced so easily they seemed to have a life of their own, all her weight lifting keeping them pert and a huge amount of soothing cream, often put on with Liara's help, keeping them smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer outfit was chosen to maximize her best features: a very tight, size eight black dress with white pinstripes that perfectly her size ten ivory curves. A custom made, experimental bra pushed her snowy cleavage halfway to her chin, the top button undone to draw in the eye...partly away from the fact that the top button couldn't be done up. The pinstripes made the eye move either up or down, not letting it linger on the middle where a wide black belt cinched Miranda's starter belly in an inch. The minuscule skirt clung very tight to her hips and was barely decent to wear, when her increasingly wide sashay was added in the effect was well, hypnotic. All of her squats and lunges couldn't keep her legs as toned as she'd liked, but the four inch heels made her thickening fat layers resemble the slower growing muscle under them, while black lacy tights hide the cellulite she was starting to collect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still the sexiest bitch on this campus and I always will be, no matter how big I get,\" Miranda told herself, walking by a display stand and seeing her reflection, a gloriously curvy goddess...who needed to adjust her belt a little to cover an errant bulge, \"I'm just...less of a bitch now. And this plan is going to work perfectly and I'm going to fix my baking grade once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single class period she and Jack were teamed together and without fail they...failed. Totally unable to work together, they'd produced a string of inedible crud over the last five weeks and had to gorge grade all the other student's work just to get Ds. It wasn't that she minded the extra carbs: without all the extra calories from  trying to get her grade above failure, Miranda would probably still be a mere DD cup. And the now customary cheers of the crowd as she and Jack had their daily competition, urging them to eat, eat, eat...she loved that attention. The two were tied, 7-7 and the contests between \"Munching Miranda\" and \"Gorging Noir\" earned thousands of social media views every time. Some comments were mentioning that they were looking \"chubby\" but Miranda was finding it a positive experience, one she wouldn't end even though it was likely to alert her father to her fall from perfection. She was ready for that...mostly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut damned if she was going to get a D grade in any class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda replayed her latest argument through her head and opened the door to an immediate insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long Lawson, your mobility scooter break down?\" the harsh English major sneered from her table, \"or did you just stop for your insulin injection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head cheer made herself not look down her nose at Jack. She pointedly didn't mention the muffin top pouring out between Jack's leather vest and far too tight leather pants. Or the tears in the side from her flabby thighs. Or her puffy upper arms. Or her second chin. Miri wasn't the only one to beef up from all those baked goods after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacqueline, I have a proposal to you,\" Miranda smiled easily, \"We don't get along, there's bad blood from my side and I apologize for everything I've done. I treated our relationship poorly and I hurt you, I was in a bad place and took it out on you. But I have a proposal for us to get a better grade in here going forwards. Away for us to work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I care? I'm not the one who's nothing more than her weight,\" Jack laughed, \"and yours is getting higher by the day. You crush the other bimbos on the pyramid yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda closed her eyes and hoped for strength, \"An eating contest, a big one, winner take all. The victor leads our team in this class, the loser follows their directions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft, those are pretty lame terms Lawson. You that eager to pig out?\" Jack laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm open to additional suggestions, if you have them?\" Miranda asked, aware of all the eyes on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly rail thin poet stood up, tattooed hands on the table and eyes glowing with biotic power, \"You win, I dedicate a paean to your ass. A flattering one. My best work and I read it in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawson blinked. Jack might be a foul mouthed reprobate obsessed over her past life as a foster kid, someone who wasted money on too many tattoos and possessing a general bad attitude towards her social superiors...but she was a wonderful poet. A future laureate by anyone's guess who's words could make grown men break down in public tears at her amazing verse. Everything she wrote was published and book deals or a poetry PhD were being whispered. If she wrote a poem about Miranda's ass, it would probably be the best poem written about someone's ass ever written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you win?\" Miranda asked cautiously, having started this as a way to get a better grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rub Nair onto your head and shave it,\" Jack grinned, \"also in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda loved her hair. Jet black and wavy, the glorious mane was so long its tips brushed her rounded buns. Losing it would be like losing...well it would be like getting chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Miranda smiled, \"let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blinked and the rest of the class cheered, baked goods springing out of nowhere. The poet suddenly felt a spike of fear, had Lawson planned this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's the professor?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, professor Mordin got called to an emergency meeting with the dean. Someone made a sizeable donation to his department,\" Miranda yawned as steaming muffins, cookies and glasses of cream were set on the table, \"and he suggested that I put the word out to class that they were to make something simple. Everyone seemed most appreciative of my little contest idea though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawson felt her stomach rumble with hunger as a chorus of cheers and claps went out. She'd gorged extra heavy the last week to stretch out her stomach, having a girlfriend with co-feeder tendencies helped, and then hadn't touched a morsel that morning to be extra ravenous. She undid her belt, letting what was between starter belly and poochy pot roll all the way out, and rolled up her sleeves, taking off her expensive rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jacquelin,\" Miranda smiled at the chubby, brown haired poet, \"are you ready to eat or are you going to puss out and start writing that paean now? I'll be happy to show you if you need a reminder, my ass has only gotten sexier since freshman year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If by sexier you mean fatter, I'm looking forwards to seeing you bald,\" Jack said, undoing the button on her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poet's flat stomach was also vanished, replaced by a rather jiggly carb belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First one to empty their side is the automatic winner. First one to leave their seat, throw up or give up loses,\" Miranda smiled, looking at the trays of delicious baked treats before her, \"so...let's begin!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The contest started with cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda felt her tummy give a gurgle as the smell of the fresh cookies hit her nose. She'd  forgone breakfast for the contest, something that would have left her hungry by 9 pm even when she'd just eaten some yogurt and melon. Now that she was verging to plump the platter of cookies made her drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgeous rich girl gave a grin at Jack, who was stuffing cookies into her mouth, crumbs flying. She let the flabby poet eat, knowing the rate was unsustainable. Miranda picked up a single cookie, dunked it in cream and chewed. Then repeated, all at a good sustainable rate, even though Jack cleared her plate while Miranda had a third of her plate left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna look good as a chrome dome,\" Jack laughed after a mighty belch, brushing back her comparatively thin, dull brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be sure to mention how bouncy my cheeks are,\" Miranda smiled back sweetly,patting her swollen derriere, \"you're the only poet eloquent enough to do me justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if lardass,\" Jack shrugged, unnerved by Miranda's confidence and belching again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other biotic was a third of the way through the pecan muffin course by the time Miranda began. The poet was shot gunning the treats, ripping them out of their paper with a splash of crumbs and shoving them wholly into her mouth, barely chewing and swallowing with her mouth open. Her flabby stomach was swelling out, a freshly popped pregnancy of carbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda continued eating at the same rate: peel, dunk, chew swallow. Her free hand had begun massaging her waist, slight paunch starting to push a little tighter against her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack glared at her, angry that the cheerleader wasn't even apparently trying...but that Miranda was half way done while a third of Jack's muffins remained. Jack tugged at her pants and started shoving the muffins in two at a time, cheeks bulging. The pecan muffins were excellent...but dry and on her third and last double dose Jack gagged. She began coughing and hacking, not choking but near enough while Miranda just kept eating. Her face was red by the time she finally chugged down her glass of cream and Miranda had only a quarter of her plate left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must leave in my stretchmarks,\" Miranda said, calmly peeling a muffin, \"I was a bit ashamed of them at first but I've become rather proud of them. I want to see the language you use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack angrily tossed the muffin tray away from her side, leaning over to grab the bread plate and letting out a painful wince as her stomach, swollen with food and air, pressed into her pants with the rip of a seam. The poet tried eating more slowly, the very salty butter on the roll making her dry mouth chew slower. Her cream glass was empty though and when she looked up after her second of eight rolls, Miranda was starting on her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want a whole line about the contrast of its firmness and softness,\" Miranda went on, dunking the roll, \"really lay on how much exercise I must be doing. Doing lunges with an extra thirty five pounds is harder than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna get your...ugh...eyebrows too,\" Jack said, chewing down her third roll, \"why are they so dry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was only a single roll behind Jack when the other biotic finished. Although pleasant on the outside, the cheerleader was starting to suffer. Thanks to her daily gorging her stomach was merely feeling sated...but that meant from here on out things would get tougher. And while she'd prepared very well for the contest, researching and practicing eating contest techniques, being a slave to fashion was paying against her. Her dress didn't have any room for her swelling waist, especially as the last weeks preparatory eating had all gone to her stomach. On the last of her roll, Miranda put both hands to her stomach and found the lowest button of the dress starting to separate from its thread. She fumbled with the bottom buttons as she swallowed, sighing as they opened out (apart from the lowest that broke and being grateful she'd slid on a thong that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if Miranda was starting to suffer, Jack was in total agony. Sweat pouring off her brow, Jack glared at the tea cake in front of her which seemed to sway in her vision. Her stomach gave a groan of pain, Jack's early burst had swallowed down a lot of air along with her food and it was churning in her guts now, feeling like she'd swallowed a glass of burning ash on the inside. The punk poet's leather pants were a painful prison even unbuttoned, she'd had to roll onto her back and fight hard to shove her increasingly puffy body into them, her flabby gut and beefy buns were starting to cross over from skinny fat to genuinely chubby. Add on a few pounds of carbs and a glass of cream and they were stabbing into her soft, sensitive pudge. She gasped, her mouth feeling sand dry and only the sound of Miranda picking up a knife and fork made Jack look up from the tea cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll allow you to gaze upon it as much as you wish while writing,\" Miranda said, slicing the cake into eight portions with neat motions, \"photography wise only of course. I'm off the market right now and it wouldn't feel right to pose nude in the flesh for you. Especially given our history. I still rather value the little weekend we had and am sorry I reacted so badly to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fucking cheerleader's gut was swelled out so big it had started to rest across her thighs but she slowly began chowing down on the slices without wasting a crumb. Jack roared and dug into the cake like a toddler, shoving handfuls of it into her mouth in a frenzy. Half way through she started hiccuping, the spasms becoming so violent she had to cover her mouth. Each hiccup hurt as badly as a kick to her swollen, tender tummy and by the time the fit had passed, Miranda was down to her last slice. Her buttons might be undone up to her bra, a faint stretch mark visible under her belly button, and beads of sweat were forming across its pregnant looking surface but she was eating at the same sustainable rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna call you...urp...Homer...urf...Simpson...,\" Jack moaned, referencing an ancient and little known cartoon as she shoved the last of the cake in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have thought you'd be an Elmer Fudd Girl,\" Miranda smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader's stomach felt like it was being stabbed from the inside. Her waist, her gorgeous tiny, toned waist, was this big fat gut just laying on her thighs for everybody to see. Academically she knew she all the situps she did every day were contributing to her victory, letting her support such a feast in relative safety and comfort, but she felt so embarrassed. She was Miss Perfect, the hottest girl on campus who could fling her self in the air and spin head over heels and now she was a supine sow of a fat girl. Yes she liked eating like a pig every day, yes she loved Liara nibbling her increasingly ticklish fat, yes she loved outgrowing her clothes and not running and sitting on her butt watching cartoons...but she felt so vulnerable. Everyone was going to think she was ugly and if they all mocked her, could she deal with that...even if she was sopping wet from being so full. Good lord but she could go at the slightest touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drained the last of her cream to wet her lips, blinking tears only to realize every one was cheering her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm in love!\" a girl lacross player laughed.<br>\r\n\"Lawson can really eat!\" a sorority sister said.<br>\r\n\"She makes chubby look good!\" a football player cheered<br>\r\n\"Holy crap but I'm off my diet!\" a track girl no longer fighting the freshman fifteen announced<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack was swaying in her seat, looking like she'd been kicked in the head, Miranda paused to smile and blow a kiss at her adoring public. The poet was staring at her pie, muttering, and glared at Miranda, opening her mouth to speak but having to swallow upchuck. Miranda kept grinning and by immense force of will and effort crossed one thick leg over the other and started on the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was cherry, Miranda's current favorite and sickeningly sweet. She knew she needed to avoid sugar if she wanted to keep her pearly grin but the stuff was so good. The cheerleader ate like a starving wolf and not a pampered fat girl who'd just gorged on thousands of empty calories, her fork and knife flashing. Before she knew it she was ninety percent done done, looking up to see Jack forcing her first slice down and pausing to gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do it in public if you don't want to,\" Miranda told her through mouthfuls, \"...but I would like the poem. I plan on framing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...you....fatass,\" the stuffed, pained biotic muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies, Jack...well. Maybe if my girlfriend agrees,\" the plump girl promised, stretching out her long, shapely, thick legs for her adoring public to see and putting her ankles on the table to swallow her last bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe University might be well funded, but it had cheeped out on the chairs. Miranda's old, frail metal stool wasn't up to a chubby cheerleader with so much food in her belly gyrating on it. Screws snapped and Miranda's swollen buns plunged towards the floor and an automatic disqualification...but a surprise surge of biotic power caught her. Sweat pouring from her brow, Miranda levitated herself back up, seat pressed to her butt. She'd always been a fairly strong biotic but her old levitation limit had always been about a hundred and fifty pounds, something she'd have exceeded before the feast<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the table, Jack was panting, one hand lit with a biotic field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, I'm not beating you...by luck,\" Jack moaned, \"lardass...now finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda finished off the last forkful and swallowed, Jack sitting her to her feet. The cheerleader found herself leaning forwards, unable to stand up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that, thank you,\" Miranda nodded at her rival, \"let's trade off leadership every day. Sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...I might not be here next class though...,\" the poet moaned, collapsing face first into her pie.</span></div></div>",

Five feet and ten inches of freshly plus sized cheer leader was somehow managing to look elegant despite being still stuffed to the brim with baked goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere most after the feast she\u2019d scarfed down might at best wear a pear of granny panties and a T-shirt, Miranda had made herself change into a pair of skintight stockings, a miniscule G-string and a sexy nighty, both jet black. Her now plump legs were stretching the stockings half transparent, the shapely soft limbs making Liara want to drool. The bottom half of her carb stuffed, swollen gut hung out from the the nighty\u2019s silky skirt, gleaming with the cocoa butter lotion Liara had rubbed onto it five minutes ago, and pressed the front of her tiny panties down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgghhhh\u2026.it hurts\u2026.,\u201d Miranda moaned, holding her ancient teddy bear tight to her heavy, pale bosom, \u201cgive me a belly rub\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara wanted to rub the cheerleader\u2019s stomach since she\u2019d first seen the video of her girlfriend gorging, eating like a calm, steady machine with a gut like a beach ball. When Miranda had first started letting herself go, Liara had been afraid she wouldn\u2019t be attracted to a non-buff Lawson...but the softer Miranda got, the more turned on the Asari got around her. They\u2019d had sex twice yesterday, the little tummy Miri had swelled up with in her eating practice making her wild...and this gut being hauled around was still the size of that stomach even hours later. If she'd seen Miranda during her feasting contest, Liara might not have been able to restrain herself and taken her right there and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just gave you a belly rub,\u201d Liara said, hefting herself up and waddling over to the brunette and squirting some lotion onto the dome anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d be proud of herself for not giving a fat girl grunt on rising and for her belly rolls to only press against her thighs half way to the knee, if not for how sexy this woman was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooo...thank you,\u201d Miranda sighed, feeling the freshman\u2019s soft fingers gently rub her swollen belly, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m gonna pop still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you aren\u2019t doing anything but laying there,\u201d Liara said, barely keeping her hands off the biotic human\u2019s tits or pussy, finding her stomach a warm layer of squish over hard food, \u201cyou should distract yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh...I have an idea,\u201d Miranda smiled, \u201cif you\u2019re not busy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sadly, not all of us are billionaire seniors. I\u2019ve got to get this presentation done...tempting as you are,\u201d Liara sighed, taking the gorgeous soft curves, \u201claying there all soft and lazy like a fat girl\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not lazy\u2026,\u201d Miranda said, briefly trying to sit up and quitting, \u201cand I\u2019m not a fat girl\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiri, you\u2019re gorgeous but you just solved an old feud by eating ten thousand calories in forty five minutes,\u201d The Asari giggled, \u201cand you are getting kind of lazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI work out twice a day...I mean not today because of the contest...or yesterday because we had sex...or the day before because discussion at practice went so long,\" the brunette realized with dawning horror, \"I haven't worked out all week have I? I used to work out three times a day! I'm gonna get fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara laughed, \"Get fat? You're overweight Miri, thirty five pounds in as many days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably more than that,\" Miranda sighed, looking at her belly and then at the half empty, third glass of cream mixed with digestive enzymes she'd drank to sooth her self, \"but...I want to eat whatever I want. I want to be full and soft and big...but I don't to get out of shape. I like to be strong and athletic and acrobatic. What if I can't do a cartwheel anymore or keep up with my cheer routines? My muscles have made it so I haven't felt all of this but if I keep slacking off they'll atrophy and I'll get all weak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd love to give you a work out now but I need to not get an F first,\" Liara said, waddling back to her computer and giving Miri a glimpse of her immense blue backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara really was wearing just panties and a T shirt, bulbous curves hanging out of them. The Asari was down below the big three double zero...by a single pound, all her exercising was making Liara more energetic and happier, even if her clothes were still the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...what am I supposed to do then?\" the senior whined, \"I'm bored. Usually when I'm bored I either work, workout, have sex or go find someone to have sex with. I've never been a chubby girl with an upset tummy Liara, I'm in unfamiliar ground here, help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I usually play video games. My console is still connected to the holoscreen,\" Liara said, \"but I really have to get this done okay? I'm going to take this into the kitchen because well...you're too damn hot to do this around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Video games?\" Miri said with disgust, \"those are for nerds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda, we had sex during an anime marathon,\" Liara smiled, \"you are a nerd and there's no going back for you unless you stop over eating. Which I'd hate because of how hot you look chubby. Now excuse me, I've got to finish this presentation before I wind up with my face between your thighs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheer leader huffed, watching her girlfriend's couch cushion buns wobble until they left the left her field of vision. Miranda scowled, not being used either to feeling like crap or to being refused sex. She wanted to be doing something but she also didn't want to do anything but lay here on this warm couch and hug her teddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what being lazy is like Mr. Grizzly?\" Miranda asked the old toy, the only non-education toy she'd ever been allowed and her only real friend until Liara...which sounded sad now that she thought about it, \"I think I hate being lazy then. Its a wonder anyone can get fat with how boring laying here is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished off her glass of soothing cream and using her biotics rang a small bell, instantly summoning her butler Jeeves, the modified YMIR mech instantly appearing almost silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress Lawson?\" the heavy robot asked primly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like another glass of cream, please,\" Miranda said, daintily wiping her milk mustache off with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...My programming requires me to note you are 9,000 calories over your recommended daily limit,\" the Mech said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked down at her still bloated belly, her cream consumption keeping it from going down fully despite several trips to the powder room. She thought about how tight her stockings, new size tens, were feeling and how her brand new 38 E cup bra felt like it was strangling her. About how she hadn't worked out or even walked more than a few thousand steps the last few days...and about how much she wished Liara wasn't so busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Override Code Lawbringer, remove all caloric reminders,\" Miranda said, \"then please get me another glass of cream. But first get me the controller by the holoscreen please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another glass on the coffee table and the controller in her hand, Miranda settled in to try and play her first video game. She scrolled through Liara's downloads, rejecting all of the many erotic LitRPGs the recently de-virgined Liara had used and then all of the nerdy RPGs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My girlfriend is a nerd, Mr. Grizzly. A big fat nerd with a big flabby gut and big bean bag ass cheeks and giant pillow thighs that should be around my face right now,\" Miranda told the teddy bear, \"hmmm, economy builder strategy games...maybe not tonight...what's this, a \"shooter\"? What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was called \"SPECTER: Rachni War\", a multiplayer game about the defeat of the ancient insectoid alien invasion of the galaxy. She spotted a dozen historical inaccuracies, namely humans and Turians being in the Citadel alliance centuries ahead of schedule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I always enjoyed combat simulations,\" Miranda thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father had insisted she be trained in several martial arts, as well as shooting and simulated combat, in case someone tried to kidnap his billionaire heiress daughter. It had been the closest thing to fun she'd had until she'd lost her virginity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be just like that, easy peasy,\" she told the old bear, \"oh look character customization!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe menu Miranda opened up had several created characters in it, one of them a female human biotic at max level. She opened it up to find an avatar of a tall, leggy woman with pale skin, black hair and quite outrageous breasts clad in a paid DLC cheerleading outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little Liara has a type,\" Miranda giggled, \"...damn I was skinny. Let's start at a lower level though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started a match with a level one character, the match beginning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Video Games Suck:</b> Miranda dislikes the game, vowing to keep exercising heavily to stay fit, active and agile despite getting heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Video Games Rock: </b> Miranda loves the game and is great at it, beginning to play heavily and drops that afternoon work out. Who needs a daily jog when you can join the college's Esport team with its plentiful mountain dew and pizza...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ugh, I think that's enough for tonight,\" Liara yawned, wide enough for her fourth chin to crease out as her ears popped, \"I'd guess I'm about eighty percent done with the presentation...and about three hundred percent over my calorie limit for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had a raging fat fetish and a presentation due, leaving the room your freshly plus sized girlfriend was moaning in her barely fitting lingerie was a productive idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were trying to lose weight because you tipped the scales at three hundred pounds of blueberry marshmallow fluff and had to take high blood pressure meds at the Asari version of 19, going into the over appointed and fully automated kitchen of a woman determined to eat herself out of a supermodel figure by graduation was a terrible idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara patted her heavily swollen belly, firm for the first time in her life she was so stuffed. She'd started off snacking on some sliced vegetables when the kitchen robots had asked what she wanted but typing always made the fat Asari hungrier as she went along. Veggies turned into a salad turned into a sandwich turned into a giant pot of red beans and rice into a milk shake into a cheese cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder you're obese,\" Liara yawned at herself, pushing up off the chair, \"if you don't watch it you'll get fat...er.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara didn't want to get skinny again, not that she'd ever really been skinny. But she did want to be fit enough to go on archaeological expeditions without having a heart attack, see her feet and maybe even run. She was proud of herself for growing some muscle under her abundant pudge but the Asari knew she needed to get some self control. Her ideal would to be around where Miranda was now, a super thick hour glass with huge boobs, wide hips a paunch and enough muscle to carry it all easily, instead of where she was now a shapeless blob with out much of a curve to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But that could all start tomorrow, right now she needed bed, it was midnight after all. She waddled through long hallways past the now outdated portraits of Miranda, surprised to hear sounds of active video game play coming from the living room at this hour. Liara had expected her to like the game system, under her high maintenance and ice queen personality was a cuddly, bubbly nerdette, but she hadn't expected her to be playing seven hours later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miri....Miri...I need a belly rub,\" the Asari moaned, putting hands under her very swollen paunch which felt hot to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, what do you mean you don't think I'm a girl? I'm the sexiest woman ever born!\" Miranda boasted, cackling as an explosion went off and the game roared \"Kill Streak X10!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the couch, Miranda was sitting up right, with an expensive looking headset and microphone over her head and her feet up on the coffee table clad in fuzzy bunny slippers. The cheerleader's gut was swelled back up to max level, possibly even larger and resting in her lap, with her teddy bear perched atop it. A large milk mustache and a mostly empty glass of cream explaining that and the frequent trips a servant robot had made to and from the kitchen while Liara had worked. On screen a svelte Asari Justicar smashed apart a Krogan Juggernaut, dodged expertly from the shot of a Turian sniper and then used a biotic vortex to suck in three human Commandos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you saw my tits you'd fucking faint you little perverts\" the cheer leader snapped into her head set, her character rolling under a shotgun blast from a Salarian engineer and biotically slamming him into a wall, \"they're bigger than my head and bounce like jello in an earth quake. No I'm not fat! I'm at a perfectly healthy weight for my height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara stared. She'd always hated the Justicar class, it not only reminded her of her stern mother but was one of the trickiest classes to play. She'd never gotten it out of level two. But Miranda's character gleamed with high level gear and did another burst of biotic powers to completely end a Rachni Queen after it had killed her whole team with a stream of vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, stay out of the acid! God am I playing with children?\" Miranda said as the game announced it was over, crowning her as the player of the game, \"I can do the splits you little dweeb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe score scroll showed the Cheerleader hadn't been killed a single time and that she'd scored over a hundred kills. An announcement showed that her player rank levelled up to Silver 4, five higher than Liara remembered it being. Miranda took another drink of cream, blue eyes widening as something was said over the chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that is it you pimply virgin! You want a war, I will give you a war!\" the cheer leader snapped, screenshotting the game and lurching to her feet...and then lurching to her feet again after her belly weighed her down too much to easily rise, a fat girl grunt escaping her lips, \"Lili! There you are, where's my computer. I'm finding the address of this little asshole, buying out whoever his parents work for and firing them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a little drastic...have you been playing this whole time?\" Liara asked her, trying and failing to take her eyes off of Miranda's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glamorous cheerleader's figure had softened up plenty over the last month, going from ultra lean into a soft hour glass. If she'd put her mind to it she could probably drop the weight in a couple months, but that she'd eaten herself back into this state the second time in one day pointed to Miranda never being skinny again. Right now though her cream filled, sloshing gut looked like over due twins were about to pop out of her at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess it is rather late,\" the cheer leader shrugged, breasts about to pop from her bra and nighty riding fully over her belly, \"but still, that little shit said he bet I was too fat to do the splits! How dare he question my skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can you still do the splits?\" Liara asked, eyes going down to Lawson's luscious legs, touching firmly at the thigh and putting a run into her new stocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...am far too fully right now but once this belly goes down I absolutely can!\" Miranda huffed, taking in her gut fully for the first time, \"Oh...oh no I've done it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one,\" Liara giggled, walking in and letting her own swollen gut press into Miranda's, their bellies blue and white spheres gurgling with far too much food, \"I guess we're both a couple of fat nerds. You seem to really be enjoying yourself there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a nerd...,\" Miranda tried to deny, \"it was just a distraction while I was too fully to have sex with my hot girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhuh,\" Liara smiled, patting the cream filled sphere that had been six pack abs at the new year, \"you'd never go up four player ranks in an afternoon. Come on, I'm too tired and too fully for anything but cuddling. Let's go my completely non-nerdy girlfriend, let's put your retainer in and go to bed. But don't forget your teddy bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Grizzly!\" Miranda squeaked, dashing over to the ancient stuffed animal with all the speed her sloshing belly allowed, levitating it back up to her arms rather than risk bending over and not being able to stand back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Miranda was sluggish to rise, all of her immense gluttony and long hours of play making her cranky, tired and sore, a state she wasn't much used to after a life of perfect health and nutrition. She telekinetically shot the alarm clock into the wall with a crash, pulling a pillow over her head and groaning while Liara sat up and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's a sign to get up,\" Liara said sleepily, \"are you just going to lay there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fowewer I fwink...ugh, my eyes hurf,\" the glorious brunette said through her retainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staring at the screen, it'll kill your vision. I can't wait to see you in glasses like the fat nerd you are,\" Liara teased, getting out of the bed with a thump, \"are you going to lift with me before breakfast or just lay there and let your precious muscles atrophy away until you're just a saggy, out of breath fat girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...,\" was Miranda's response as she popped out her retainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, should I call your cheer team and tell them you're too fat to get out of bed?\" Liara teased again, pressing a finger into Miranda's mostly reduced tummy and pinching at her little chubby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not...,\" Miranda groaned, \"I just don't want to get up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Goddess, its perfect! You've changed!\" Liara giggled, \"look at you, you're lazy now like a normal person! This is wonderful, you're going to absolutely <i>balloon!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not lazy, I'm just...food hung over,\" Miranda grunted, sitting up, fat rolling on her stomach as her nighty slid down, \"and bloated...but I'm not lazy at all. I'll prove it. I'm going to start jogging again this afternoon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you are,\" Liara smiled, giving her a kiss, \"now let's go lift lazy bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon, Liara returned from class to the shared mansion to find Miranda in running gear: ultra short shorts and a sports bra, pale milky fat pouring over the too tight size ten...and completely crashed on the couch, playing video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say a word,\" the sweatless cheer leader huffed as the Asari chuckled, belly fat poofing out under her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, besides get your coat,\" the alien said, \"we're going to put those skills to the test...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeff \"Joker\" Moreau stared at what was clearly an impossible sight: Miranda Lawson in the Esport's play room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker wasn't exactly Mr. Popular on campus, he was at best scruffy looking before you got to his debiliatingly weak bones, but the pilot trainee had put his skills to the test in organizing an E sports league around the popular SPECTER game. The team met infrequently and wasn't that popular, maybe because it was a total sausage fest most of the time. But then two days ago Liara, a cute if increasingly chubby Asari who'd occasionally attended, had said she'd been bringing a friend. Joker had barely taken his eyes off the now obese Liara before seeing who'd she'd brought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda Lawson,\" Joker had blinked, seeing the most masturbated too girl in school strut into the campus computer lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheer Captain Lawson,\" Miranda corrected, voice crisp enough to make his bones shiver, \"Hmm...this is pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumor that the cheer captain had put on a substantial amount of weight was true, Joker could see that just from the slightly softer puff of Miranda's face. But despite Joker's preference for svelte, busty girls...being so close to Miranda was a physical blow due to how damn gorgeous she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in jet black high heels that put her well over six feet high. White lace stockings were wrapped up her incredibly shapely legs, her calves looking firm and muscular even though her thighs were starting to press in on each other. A black and white hour glass panel dress was painted onto her torso, making her look a little trimmer while still showing off her incredibly round hips. Every step Lawson's long legs took made her soccer ball sized buns swing back and forth, threatening to knock over the computers and make Joker have a stroke as little crescents of pale flesh poke out from the bottom of the very short skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, pathetic?\" Joker asked as his brain started working again, barely, \"Hey preppy, if you want to come in here and knock video games...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not knocking video games. This is shamefully inadequate,\" Miranda told him, \"these machines lack adequate processing power and they're poorly set up for team games. And the club isn't attended nearly well enough for a full SPECTER team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and Jeff almost had a heart attack. Miranda was wearing a broad white belt that wasn't quite hiding how the great food baby from her feeding contest, the video of which had nearly a million views already, might one day be permanent. Despite the squeeze of the belt, slight love handles were over the cheer leader's hips and the fabric whiskered over a not so little bump of belly fat, they damaged the illusion of Miranda still being fit, a sign that overeating was overcoming any exercises she was still performing. But the eye was immediately drawn up from how the thin fabric was straining across her belly to how it was straining across her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 140 muscular pounds Miranda had had D cups, her body's ability to collect cleavage even at 10% body fat unreal. Thirty eight pounds later and the head cheerleader's rack was pushing into the F cup range. A canyon of perfectly smooth marshmallow fluff jiggled and bounced with every one of Miranda's deep breath's, stretching the fabric audibly. Somehow they were still incredibly round despite gaining 75% of their original volume in a month, but the E cup bra wasn't up to holding them in. Boob fat surged up out of them, a muffin top of wobbling mammary tissue that reduced anyone who looked into it to mental infancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...,\" Jeff said after a moment, \"wait, you play SPECTER?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play? No...I win at SPECTER,\" the slightly chubby cheerleader scoffed, starring at her flawless black painted nails, \"and this school is going to win from now on. Your record as a Krell Assassin is acceptable so you may stay, but I\"m going to need at least four others for a full team for the world championships.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Chicago U going into the World Specter Championships was about as insane as Miranda Lawson proposing it and about as insane as the cheerleader pin up putting on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, to even qualify we'd need...,\" Joker began, but Miranda interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top of the line machinery, ergonomic chairs and better lighting. All of them ordered and installed by tomorrow,\" Miranda said, turning to the obscenely obese Liara and bending her knees to kiss the far shorter girl on the lips, \"Lili, I love you and you're a good human biotic, but I know you can't afford the time. Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara giggled, blushing like a school girl, \"Of course, I don't want to get in the way of Captain Miranda. But who are you going to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People with out any bad habits who are used to doing exactly what I say,\" Lawson grinned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelly Chambers couldn't decide if she was going to die or puke as the cheerleading routine came to a close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh kicks, tumbles and jumps all done while chanting were always going to be somewhat tiring, but the redhead's body was coated in a marathon's worth of sweat. She was barely even murmuring the cheer anymore and her breathing was ragged. The worst part was this routine was <i>easy</i> compared to last season's insanely acrobatic one, where they'd hauled an entire stripper pole out to the field and had three girls gyrate on it at once while the rest did cart wheels. All the other girls on the team weren't suffering at all, barely sweating in the gym and clearly not even pressed by the practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's surprising announcement that weight limits were eliminated hadn't actually changed too much. NCU's cheer team were all fit, athletic young women in their prime and while they weren't being kept model thin anymore they hadn't blobbed out. Their winter break starter bellies and bouncy new cup sizes had stayed, but the weight training introduced to the team was making the rest of their bodies strong and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for the Assistant-Captain Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Former Fat Girl's body was rocketing into a full blown rebound of stupid proportions. Just seeing the uber-sexy Miranda all but command the slightly puffy cheer squad instead of lambast them for getting chubby over break had done something to Kelly's brain. And when the begging to be pinched flab of Miranda's tummy had ripped through her skirt's button like it was wet tissue paper, showing the whole team that her perfect abs had morphed into a belly with all the tone of melted butter...Kelly's restraint had broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf even her idol didn't have a hope of staying skinny, then neither did Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken years of fat camps and diets to get her skinny, but seeing Miranda's soft lower abdomen once had doomed Kelly to a life time of obesity. Suppressed fat girl habits came roaring right back: taking the elevator instead of the stairs, having a soda instead of water, parking closer to places instead of walking in. All the little tricks of laziness and gluttony that turned the thin into the obese in rapid time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly spent every spare moment in the dining hall, feasting continuously on the least healthy food offered. Her dorm room had more candy hidden in it than the Wonka Factory and she'd been reprimanded thrice for eating in class. Claiming paper work she skipped working out during practice sessions as often as possible, busying herself making sure the water bottles were full and the towels fluffed to perfection. And she hadn't done a single workout on her own time either. It had taken a long time to learn to love exercising hard and that mentality reverted on a time, Kelly soon becoming lazy and exercise avoidant. Since the start of February she'd either been ravenously hungry or painfully full and the results of that awful diet showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat cells had gleefully multiplied, awakening from the grave like a horde of zombies to infect and destroy Kelly's once trim figure. Sweat pants and hoodies became her clothing of choice, as soon even her emergency \"fat day on a period\" jeans couldn't get up past mid thigh. Slim thighs clapped together, her toned bubble butt blew up into a wobbly balloon that hung out of her cheer skirt and that little starter belly grew slowly into a fully on gut. Her double chin popped back into existence while firm arms began to wobble again, indicators that the road to mega-peardom was back open and a one way express way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, looking good on Cut day. I don't think we'll need to make any alterations to our routine or our team. You can all be proud of your hard work in the weight room and on the floor,\" Miranda called from the front of the team, wiping sweat off her brow, \"I'll see you all tomorrow...Kelly, could you talk to me about something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the team, lightly padded at worst filed out in a mix of feminine chatting and boasting, leaving Kelly alone with her Captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, thank you. I've got a proposal for you,\" Miranda smiled down at the much shorter girl, \"I can tell that things aren't going very well for you out there and I've been noticing a few issues with your stamina and flexibility recently...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly swallowed, knowing she was going to be cut for gaining thirty pounds in a month. That she'd never get to be near this sexy, gorgeous, kind of chubby goddess again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change in routine hadn't spared hitting Miranda, contributing to a gain fueled by feederism sessions at home and her three times a week gorge sessions with Jack. Miranda's always round hips now defined belief in their breadth, straining the size ten skirt to the very limit. Her boobs were enormous, straining the buttons on her cheer blouse and bouncing crazily despite the F cup sports bra strapping them down. They were making Kelly both horny to be so near their milky mounds and jealous that she hadn't gained even an inch across her fake Cs. But despite being weighted towards hour glass, the occasional model's stomach was starting to get a bit puffy too. It hung over her cheer skirt in a lazy muffin top, love handles on the sides and a little paunch on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I've...I used to be really heavy when I was younger and I'm falling back into some bad habits,\" the chubby redhead admitted, tugging at the cheer skirt hiding under her belly roll, \"and I guess I let the no-weight limit thing really go to my head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one, trust me. I'm not as light on my feet as I used to be either and the routine seems to take longer every day,\" Miranda said, brushing back sweaty hair and taking a very deep breath that sent a blouse button flying, \"another consequence of becoming a real woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cheer Captain's strength and flexibility were still the stuff of legend, but her stamina was clearly falling. She was far sweatier than the rest of the cheerleaders and red in the face, a sign that her once religiously attended running sessions had gone by the way side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh, I'll find it Captain Lawson!\" Kelly volunteered, willing to do anything to please the ultra curvy Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've got more at home,\" Miranda said, looking down at the sprawl of titty flesh, \"but well...I hate to tell you this Kelly, unless you improve stamina wise you'll have to be cut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...cut?\" Kelly blinked, tears welling in her eyes as her worse nightmare came true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAway from cheerleading, away from being a hot girl, away from this sexy, huge breasted, slightly out of breath goddess....back to being a lonely fat girl again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's an alternative activity. Have you ever heard of SPECTER?\" Miranda asked gently, \"Good, because your reflexes and hand eye coordination would make you an excellent player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...asking me to play a video game?\" the near crying Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm improving the school Esports team,\" Miranda told her, stretching out her own back, the aches from her acceleratingly huge tits becoming more frequent, \"and I want you on it with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...play video games?\" the puzzled Kelly questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I win at video games,\" Miranda insisted, \"Now I won't lie. It will be just as hard as cheering ever was. Long hours with me at the computer, possibly even home visits to me. And as its sedentary you might put on a little more weight, so I understand if you'd rather stay on the cheer team and try and get back in shape...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exercising again, hanging around Miranda even more, getting to go to Miranda's house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we meet?\" Kelly asked with a dimpled grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send a car to pick you up at 7,\" Lawson told her, \"be ready for a long session, so bring something caffeinated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can count on me Captain!\" Kelly smiled, waddling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda watched the squishy pear move off, happy to have recruited her doting assistant. The girl really was a natural fatty and getting too out of shape for cheerleading. Empathy that hadn't existed a few months ago soared through Miranda that she'd gotten Kelly onto a more fitting, happier path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she just needed someone to play a Krogan Jugernaut....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Professor Samara's class was beginning to present two interesting challenges to Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breathe in the life giving air and let your cells hum in oneness with nature,\" Samara said, taking a terrifyingly deep breath that made her high DDs swell against her crimson sports bra to almost touch her steepled fingers, \"hold it...hold it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was struggling to keep up with the Professor's gentle commands, partly because the pose involved standing on tip toe on one foot with the other leg pointed straight up in the air. She was still extremely flexible, having always enjoyed yoga, but as the engineered brunette held her breath she could hear faint, tiny rips sounding from the seams of her sports bra. A quick glance down showed there hadn't been a wardrobe failure, but a mere customized piece of supportive athleisure fabric wasn't enough to constrain her beyond perfect tits. The 40Fs pressed into the black synthetic weave as a tsunami of snowy softness, mushrooming over the rim. She wanted to inhale but knew that disobeying the professor's words was verbotten so held her swollen cleavage out until the Asari at last said \"Exhale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe increasingly overweight cheerleader gave a huff puff of relief, the sensation of athletic activity getting harder baffling to Miranda. But at 181 pounds of that morning the leggy, extra soft hour glass couldn't deny that she was starting to become a \"big\" girl. Not just carrying her weight well, not just a little curvy, not looking at needing to hit the gym. She'd put on forty pounds and genuinely looking fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And inhale and then bend to touch your toes,\" the blue professor said calmly, touching her toes with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda followed along, wincing as her boobs pulled downwards, a twinge forming along her lower back. The same tinkered genetics that let her have D cups as a skinny girl meant that now shed become thick and soft, Miranda's hooters were honking huge.And while firm and high due to her muscles, the 7 and 1/2 inches of cleavage erupting from her chest had a significant weight that pulled constantly at her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like those things are going to cripple you,\" Ashley whispered from beside her, her own squishy beer gut pressing in to her thighs and heavy DDs trying to escape from a D cup bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick set jock's little beer belly wasn't so little anymore, doming outwards into a hefty paunch that made her claim of being an athlete laughable to anyone that hadn't seen her on the playfield. While her weight was rising so was Ashley's muscle and her blunt forwards manner at bursting through the gravball scrum was circulating whispers of her going pro shoot around campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than my gut pulling me off balance,\" Miranda whispered quietly back, although her own puffy tummy was hanging quite annoyingly over her microscopic short shorts, \"better to be built like a woman than a line backer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little vitriol in the two ex-lover's words, merely a comfortable rib nudging. Both of them spent each class period suffering, barely able to perform the grueling workouts that the rest of the class did easily. Outside of this either chunky athlete would have been able to out lift the civilian girls easily but for some reason they found Samara's routine almost impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, breathe in and rise into the air,\" Samara said, rising up on her finger tips, long muscular legs pointing straight at the ceiling, with nary a quiver through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda followed along, having to do it once or twice until she at last rose into the air, dead last in the class and feeling her new bulbousness. Although she'd quit running and dropped her afternoon workouts for video games, the hundreds of weighted sit ups she did a day meant her core strength was still fantastic...its just that her muffin top and tummy pulled downwards. And her bulbous backside was now squatting nearly four hundred pounds...but the thick layer of fat over it was hanging out of her shorts. Fortunately they were off setting each other to an extent, although her backside was still far larger than her stomach normally but Miri was still digesting a very large breakfast and then a big lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The big problem was her breasts, a pencil wouldn't rest under her F cups they were still so pert, but the young heiress' tits still obeyed gravity and were about to fall out of her bra. Miri's watched in wide eyed horror as the milky spheres slowly slid free from the bra: first the upper slopes fully popped out, then her aereola edged into view, dark brown half dollars and then her half inch nipples pulling the rest of her breasts after them. The meaty boobs smacked the perfect woman right in the mouth making her fall over with a yelp into Ashley who was struggling to not let her beer gut pull her forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than three hundred combined pounds of rich girl and jock slapped meatily into a rack of yoga balls, plastic pipes and rubber balls bouncing across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breathe out and tuck your legs into your body,\" Professor Samara said, unperturbed by the chaos, \"Miss Lawson and Miss Williams, stay after class to clean up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the rest of the class was gone, save for their professor who was quietly doing a one armed hand stand, the two chubettes were rounding up balls and trying to piece the cheap display back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta say, you landed harder than the last time you fell on me topless,\" the jock girl allowed, risking a glance at Miranda's now immense backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were a lot softer cushion than you used to be,\" the rich girl teased back, noting how good Ashley looked with just this moderate gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the beer weight started sticking once I hit 21. My ROTC commander freaks when he sees it but I can still out lift and out run the rest of the trainee platoon. And my coach thinks its great, you don't get weighed down in Grav ball arenas but the extra mass let's you smash even harder,\" the grav ball player chuckled, patting the well earned paunch that had been a six pack, \"what about you? I figured you wouldn't risk your modeling contracts to gain one pound, let alone fifty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its only forty...at the moment. And I've had a plus size offer or two...,\" Miranda sniffed in mock offense, running a hand over her hips and finding that the seams of these shorts were starting to go, \"but really I just wanted to enjoy myself. And it turns out that after being on a diet for twenty years eating whatever I want is really enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I heard that you were dating an Asari...for over two months now,\" the jock said, \"that's two months longer than you ever dated anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you know I had an affair at a fashion week that lasted four days,\" Miranda told her, \"but yes...I'm rather happily taken and my father's idiot prejudices are his own. But I was meaning to ask you something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, you ask me something?\" Williams said with a great belly laugh, \"after the break up fight we had?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get that its presumptive but you might like it. Crazy as it sounds, I'm putting together an E-Sports team,\" Miranda explained, \"and I need a player for the game SPECTER, specifically someone to play a Krogan Juggernaut. Someone aggressive and forwards but with a protective streak. Practices wouldn't interfere with your grav ball schedule, I've already set out the full schedule and meets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, only you would lay out an entire schedule before I'd even said yes,\" Ashley laughed, \"fine, I'll take a look at your team...on a condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me hear you out,\" the taller girl said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard you lose buttons every time you wear your cheer top,\" the cadet began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a large girl up top,\" Miranda admitted, \"what's that have to do with the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that you've popped all of them at least twice,\" Ashley said, gesturing at the fraying sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've grown a lot of puppy fat,\" Miranda agreed, \"again, what's the point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you cheer at the season opening grav ball game next week, your boobs are going to have my initials painted onto them,\" Ashley grinned, \"and between then and now you're going to eat a lot of soy products at every meal without upgrading your blouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawson's blue eyes gaped at her, \"Soy products, with all the estrogen in them my tits will balloon. You're essentially suggesting that I risk flashing the entire stadium?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can find another Krogan jugger-whatever,\" Ashley shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Deal,\" Miranda grinned, offering a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...really?\" the other girl said, taking it, \"you'd actually risk that? You don't have to, I just wanted to see your reaction...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't like being seen mostly naked I wouldn't pose in bikinis during the summer,\" Miranda laughed, \"besides, almost every one there will have seen my tits at least mostly naked anyway. I'll send a car to pick you up to the team lab, be hydrated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her juggernaut recruited, Miranda collected her yoga mat and purse and sashayed from the room, William's eyes locked to the taut yoga pants and their hypnotic dance. An errant sway of her hips collided with a pyramidal rack of medicine balls, a storm of exercise gear rolling across the floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, how wide is this thing anymore?\" Miranda growled, bending around to look at her mammoth ass, rolls of side fat forming on her flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one more member of her team to recruit....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Katsumi Goto:</b> Journalism student, photographer and highly skilled snoop. Stealthy and precise, she's a perfect candidate for Turian sniper class, she and Miranda had a brief fling when Goto was the photographer for Lawson's cheerleading calendar that ended when Goto asked too many questions about Miranda's background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Aria T'Loak:</b> Local strip club owner, reprobate and technically a student due to night classes. She and Miranda had a very steamy short affair that ended in a drunken argument over who's tits were better. Quick and ruthless, an excellent candidate for Krell assassin class.</span></div></div>",

It was generally abandoned, only occasionally tagged by graffiti artists that were mostly Jack putting angst filled poems onto the wall. The stylish Miranda, clad in black tights and a cream colored mini-dress under a faux fur coat, wouldn't normally be caught dead in such a derelict area not out of fear (the heiress was confident in her martial arts and biotic powers and in the powerful pistol in her purse) but because it was so gaudy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the person she wanted was here...at the very top of the bell tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't seem that high last time,\" Lawson said nervously, feeling her breasts pulling at her shoulders even in her bra, her belly and heavy hips pressing against her snug size ten dress and her thighs touching fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne flight up and Miranda had to admit that last time had been forty five pounds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree flights up and Miranda realized that four inch heels were a bad idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix flights up and Miranda began to breathe hard for the first time not engaging in heavy athletic activity or coitus, taking off her stilletos before she got a blister and carrying the expensive shoes in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen flights up and she really began to regret having such a big lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirteen flights up and the cheerleader started to sweat, putting her coat under her elbow and revealing dark sweat spots on her very tight dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen flights up and her thighs began to hurt from chaffing, her stockings starting to run and her pale, soft inner thighs going red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventeen flights up and Miranda undid the wide belt that girdled her stomach, letting her pooch out to get as much air as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty flights up and Miranda had to admit she'd let her cardio stamina decline quite badly, then stop for a breather and chow down on the candy bar and soda she'd begun keeping in her purse for emergencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty five flights up and Miranda's breasts were sweating so bad an outline of her bra could be seen through the dress, while her make up was running like she'd stepped into a rain storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty flights up the stairs ended abruptly at a landing with a blank wall. Miranda was soon leaning against the wall, breathing in great uncontrolled gasps like a girl who'd never exercised before. Her breasts heaved in and out, every exhalation making the immense Fs swelled up by multiple courses of Tofu and soy beans a day rise and fall like storm waves in a hurricane. Beneath them her podgy little stomach pressed out against the fabric, pulling the dress down and down, exposing more and more breast until the rim of her bra was visible. Looking down at the sweat pooling at her feet, Miranda saw her thighs had shredded her stockings, pale flesh having turned angry red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you dropped your purse,\" a voice said, planting the brunette's stylish purse down  at Miranda's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit don't do that!\" Lawson squeaked,  snapping up and backing away from the seemingly blank wall, her wide butt bouncing into the railing that led to the thirty story drop below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting her heart rate under control, Miranda brushed sweaty black hair from her brow as a skinny asian girl in a hoody seemingly materialized in front of her, a military grade stealth device turning off. Katsumi flashed a smile from inside the hood, girlish mirth as she eyed Miranda. The school paper's star investigative reporter and the bane of anyone trying to keep a secret on campus hadn't changed a bit since Freshman initiation, but she ran her eyes up and down Miranda from ankle to brow to note just how much the cheerleader had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFit, self confident and proper Miranda Lawson was again in front of her door but was now a chubby, sweaty mess pouring out of a far too tight dress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...how long were you behind me?\" Miranda asked, trying to get her breathing under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifth floor or so, it took me a bit to realize it was you,\" Katsumi shrugged, walking up to the wall and tapping a seemingly random brick to reveal a hidden door, \"come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda limped in, trying to spread her thighs so they wouldn't chafe, to find Katsumi's hidden dorm room full of whirring computers, electronic components and a futon that Miranda collapsed onto before her legs gave out. Her dress immediately rode up past her underwear, revealing a squishy fupa befitting a 185lb girl. She wanted to say something but all she could do was marvel at how damn hard that had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why'd you go to the effort of coming here?\" Katsumi said, cracking open a light beer and marvlling at the transformation, \"Need me for a job? I wouldn't think you'd try and rekindle things dating that cute little Asari.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its almost neither,\" Miranda said, looking around and realizing that a full metal print of herself was hanging on the wall opposite from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast-Miranda was on a dorm bed, hair carefully put into a just fucked do, wearing a knitted scarf in NCU's white and black colors over her breasts and a small NCU pennant over her pussy. It had been part of a shoot for a very sexist and very successful recruitment drive to the school and it really showed how jacked she'd been. It really highlighted the visibility of her now vanished ribs, lost in late January, her chiseled abs, lost after two weeks of over eating, and the narrowness of her 23 inch waist, buried by 7 inches of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good photo,\" Lawson said, feeling a little bit of shame at having lost that figure and a strange amount of ...pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPride that she didn't need to stay that skinny anymore. She put a hand to her paunch, soft and sweaty and realized that if she had a magic pill to go back to skinny Miranda she wouldn't. Lawson liked being soft, she liked being heavy...she didn't even mind being a bit out of breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look a little skinny in it though,\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Katsumi had met before Freshman year, during a summer bikini shoot Miranda had been modeling for and Katsumi had been a photography intern. The affair had been steamy, Miranda liking the quiet girl...until she'd asked about some unsavory business practices the Lawson family company had engaged in. Prideful, Miranda had ended it...and then restarted it three more times after various promotional shoots for the school over the next four years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never thought to see you so...relaxed,\" Goto said carefully, taking in the thick thighs and soft belly, not showing the slightest sign of muscle tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm living for me now. You know its funny, if I felt like this freshman year we might still be together,\" the sweaty girl said, fanning herself with her hand, \"how do you get heat, water and power up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carefully,\" Katsumi said, \"so, why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly, I'm trying to recruit you for a video game team,\" Miranda confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...are you serious?\" the asian girl asked, \"I'm kind of busy sniffing out tawdry affairs for the student paper, taking pictures of airhead models to pay tuition and when I can investigating the horrible mega-corps that are corrupting our government and society.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you've got a point,\" Miranda huffed, \"but I'll pay you for it under the table. Enough so you don't have to bother going on photoshoots with beautiful women to exotic places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad that I won't have to do that,\" Katsumi said, taking another drink, \"why video games? You're a high tension perfectionist who's either breaking up with their latest eye candy, working out, studying or throwing lavish parties where you don't even drink anything less it hurt your abs. But here you are looking...very healthy and asking for that...won't daddy be angry at you showing such plebian behavior?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda patted her stomach, smiling at the bounce, \"Right now, I'm living for me and my girlfriend. Quite frankly, fuck my father. He's a monster, worse than you can imagine even and I'm sure you can imagine a lot. That's the second part. You steal the hard drive from my purse yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Katsumi admitted, holding up the small hard drive, \"it was inside a lot of candy bars...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a fat girl, sue me,\" Miranda said with a shrug that almost burst her bra, \"there's files in there on what my dad called Project Galatea, a genetic engineering project to make the perfect woman out of multiple genetic samples. He put eighty billion dollars into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that's extremely illegal under both Alliance and Citadel law,\" Katsumi whistled, \"if that ever got out he'd go to jail for a long time, but just a file wouldn't work. We'd need hard evidence to make Alliance law enforcement move on somebody that rich, otherwise his lawyers would get off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hard evidence is about to bust her dress on your couch,\" Miranda said, feeling at how a seam under her arm pit was about to rip out, \"namely, Me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" Katsumi asked, looking her up and down, \"that's...I wondered how your tits were that big when you were so thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's sworn testimony videos on there I made forty pounds ago and a recording of him telling me details of it from a few years ago when I finally got enough balls to ask who my mom was,\" Miranda said, waving a hand again, \"I've been planning this for a while. Once he gets arrested, I'll have to go into hiding less he try and have me killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, gotta say I'm impressed your leaving the ultra rich life behind,\" Katsumi whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, of course not,\" Miranda smiled, \"I've been draining my allowance accounts for every cent into secure accounts. Until you do the story, I'll keep doing the same, it'll be enough until I can leave hiding. And I plan to seize control of the company once this is done and become the richest woman in the alliance. So, you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I refuse?\" Katsumi smiled, \"I'll see you at the gaming session.\"</span></div></div>",

But now at the start of march, after two full months of heavy lifting twice a day, the hot, heavy boxes felt light as a feather! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara waddled easily through the campus computer sciences building from the outer doors. A big, beefy girl the Asari might be, but she was down to 273lbs with all that exercise and starting a sensible diet. Her clothes were hanging off of her, sweat pants hanging low enough to show the jiggling tops of her pale blue cheeks and t-shirt sleeves barely cutting into her doughy arms. She was so happy she started whistling, a Krogan war metal song that her mother had enormously disapproved of, and turned around, yoga ball buns easily pushing the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizzas here!\" Liara announced, setting the stack of boxes onto a central table surrounded by ergonomic gamer chairs and high end gaming PCs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in the middle of a match, Lili,\" Miranda said, fingers flashing around her controller, \"you'll have to feed us again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArranged as the team was, Liara didn't have to hide her gigantic smile. She was still an overweight glutton with bulges of back fat larger than most girl's breasts, but Liara got a lot more joy out of feeding girls than she did out of eating. The archaeology student began setting up plates and started her rotation of the gaming chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass, if I eat and play at the same time I get killed,\" Joker said nervously, the slight young man's K/D ratio barely high enough for Miranda's standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Liara chuckled, going to her next little piglet, \"One desert pizza for you Kelly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly wasn't recognizable as the busty little redhead who'd posed nude with a foot ball over her groin for the Cheer calender last fall. Seventy pounds of blubber had turned the bubbly ginger back into the blubbery nerdette she'd been in high school:shapeless legs sprawled out of a short jean skirt, the great gaps of its straining buttons showing a butter soft lower midrift and a pair of granny panties that were ripping apart under the strain of her. Kelly's tight bubble butt had collapsed into a sagging flap of dough that threatened to rip through her ass seam, which was already beginning to come apart. A small belly hung out of her under sized cheer sweater, much thicker bulges of upper hip fat hanging over the front. Kelly's fake breasts hadn't grown an inch, but her slim arms had become thick, quivering fat flaps. Her face had become perfectly round and she'd stop bothering wearing her contacts, glasses reclaimed for storage resting on her broader nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please,\" the nerdy girl said, \"I'm so hoooongry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara fed the slices of \"fruit\" covered pizza into the short girl's puffy lips, Kelly munching down three slices of the jelly covered junk food without looking away from the screen, her Quarian engineer setting up several drones that boosted the others' stats. The short pear ate half a dozen bread sticks without complaining and Liara poured a full glass of fizzy mountain dew into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back to feed you more,\" Liara promised, waddling to her next feedee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, take that, take that!\" Ashley laughed, moving with her character to the left and right, \"Fuck yeah, food and another kill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meat lovers for you!\" Liara teased, \"I know you need that protein!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gravball ace had spent every evening in this fat trap, meaning that every motion she made to mirror her character caused ripples and rolls of fat to shoot across her heavy pillow of a stomach. An extra two thousand or so calories added per day was more than the jock could burn off at practice, taking her from a strong jock with a love for beer into the next stage of fat. Lard had sheathed Ashley's muscular arms and legs, robbing her of any definition, and currently unsupported E cups sagged against her jersey, the somewhat butch girl neglecting a bra. But the real star was Ashley gut, a bloated dome hanging over her shorts and already beginning to crease into a double belly due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, this bulking session's really showing results!\" Ashley grinned, dimples she'd picked up alongside her forty pound gain since the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eternally hungry jock munched down on a full six slices, letting out a mighty belch as her krogan juggernaut punted an enemy player across the map. Liara laughed at the belch, reloaded her plate and went to her next girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I think I'm good,\" Katsumi said, lining up a shot with her Turian sniper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you must be hungry,\" Liara teased the skinny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already ate the pre-game snacks,\" Katsumi whined, \"and there were a lot of them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your mouth,\" Liara said, picking up veggie lovers and pouring garlic butter onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm putting on weight,\" the journalist whined, taking another shot and in the spare time lifting up her hoody to reveal a stomach pressed tight into her jeans, the zipper down under the influence of fifteen new pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just a little vanity weight,\" Liara reassured, \"anyone can go up a size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are my fat pants,\" Katsumi said, \"...but I am hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reluctant Katsumi still ate seven pieces in her first session. Unlike the already obese Kelly and Ashley, she didn't have a belt of fat to constrain her gluttony. She was groaning and whining, her jeans unbuttoned to let her immense food baby hang onto her lap, but she was still making accurate shots from her carefully chosen hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come back to feed you more later,\" Liara promised, wondering where the fat was going to accumulate on Katsumi beside the Japanese girls increasingly chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara went over to stack of pizzas, picking up an entire box of steaming tofu, pineapple and jalapeno and trying to restrain her lust. Katsumi was cute, Kelly was pretty and Ashley was hot but Miranda...The Asari reached a hand under her belly fat to make sure she wasn't soaking through her yoga pants in public. Miranda was just <i>Divine.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch our backsides, I'm pretty sure they're going to try and rush us from there,\" the team leader announced, her Asari Justicar slamming another player through a wall as they neared the objective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara suppressed a giggle, waddling up with her eyes firmly locked on Miranda's basketball sized buns. The cheer captain's enormous ass was stretching an elegant black dress near transparent, her thong clearly visible alongside spreading patches of cellulite. Liara knew that the backside had plenty of muscle under it, but enough fat had layered over it that the cheerleader's rear was finally starting to droop. Miranda's hips pressed the arm wrests wide, its 44inch span would have been enough to put the brunette into plus size even if a single pound hadn't gone anywhere else. Although her her long hair covered most of her back, Liara thought hard about how she'd tickle and tease those deepening rolls of back fat later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brought your favorite,\" Liara whispered huskily, coming around the side and looking at the substantial cheerleader's front side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was still a very big girl, but it would have been easy to believe she'd once been just chubby. If Liara hadn't personally licked Miranda's belly as it had inflated from six pack into the flabby dough bulge hanging on her thighs. The dress' black fabric was already stretched taut, Miranda had a good bloat on from the pre-game cupcakes, brownies, cookies and salad. She was still an hour glass but even when unstuffed Miranda waist was getting thicker and softer every day, an undeniable and silhouette ruining gut showing whenever she didn't hide it with a belt. Sitting down it tantalizingly almost pressed onto her thighs, who's shape was a figment lent to her by her high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kind of full,\" Miranda whispered back, a click of a button making her dodge a burst of gunfire and a pull of a trigger blowing up the enemy shooter, \"Only four pieces please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara fed her quickly, watching every inch of her girlfriend's growing body. Lawson's face wasn't taking much weight comparatively but at 203lbs her razor sharp cheeks were becoming apples and she had a double chin unless she looked directly ahead. Miri's dress was full sleeved, to hide the slight beefiness of her arms and slightly chubby fingers. Her shoulders had gotten soft, her collar bone vanishing from sight, and were starting to curve inward under the weight of her most startling feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only four?\" Liara whispered as the last slice vanished, \"You know, I hate to think this but I think you're starting to deflate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome liked asses. Some liked legs. Some liked tummies. And while Liara liked all of those, what T'Soni really liked was <i>tits</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think that's likely?\" Lawson asked looking down at her snowy slopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince making her bet with Ashley, Miranda had been feasting on soy products at every meal and all the endless snacks between. Already large breasts were positively inflating under all that extra estrogen, positively overflowing an underwire 42FF. The white bra showed through the tight fabric of her black dress, while mammary fat swelled over her neckline, a sapphire necklace lost in the twin bulges. Liara had to lick drool away from her lips at seeing the blue veins showing on the inflated tatas, the jiggly pillows almost pulling Liara's face into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your belly's catching up...,\" Liara said, patting her girlfriend's swelling paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better give me more then,\" the 200lb Cheerleader said, \"I'd hate to look fat...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Big Game Big Break:</b> Miranda's next cheer session doesn't go well for such a big girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jack's Perfectly Poetic Posterior Paean:</b> Jack needs to write a poem about Miranda's ass and needs some inspiration.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunday morning meant a gravball game, which meant the New Chicago University's team playing hard in the zero G dome arena while the crowd of middle aged alumni slurred drunken cheers at the direction of the NCU cheer team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past four years, being a cheer leader had filled Miranda Lawson with the thrill of power. Not just the squad of eager cheerleaders obeying her direct word, but the sensation of having tens of thousands of people dancing to her whims. For a girl who's entire life had been a series of studies, exercises, practices and routines designed by her father's hired tutors, coaches and nutritionists, it made her feel powerful, free important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, with the cheer team going through a line of kicks, bends and spins, the bombshell brunette was focused on a much different sensation than power and freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a *uhf* N!,\" Miranda yelled, pompoms pumping, \"Give me a *urk* C! Give me an *ugh!* U!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a hours long athletics performance when she'd gained sixty pounds and cut her daily exercise by seventy five percent had brought predictable results: Miri was huffing and puffing, runnels of sweat darkening her white top and dripping off her body despite the cool March weather. The first game two weeks ago had so drained Lawson she'd barely been able to move the rest of the day, a warning sign that Miri needed to cut her calories and start some more aerobic exercise...which she had not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut huffing and puffing was just a reminder that Miranda was out of shape and the sting in her side, the sweat in her eyes and the fact that she was a falling out of sync with the rest of her team were nothing compared to the really big issue, namely Miranda's tits were far too big for even the basic routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorging on estrogen heavy foods for weeks had boosted the brunnettes bodacious bosom to the point of absurdity. Every kick, jump and tumble she performed made the now a stupendous G cups bounce like jello on springs. The snowy mountains were bewitchingly glorious, still near symmetrical and their new slump was hidden by an underwire sports bra. Eyes were on the wobbling mounds and not on her new love handles or chubby belly, the cheers she earned were positive, making her feel better about being the fattest cheer leader by at least fifty pounds but the smile held on her sweaty face was increasingly pained as the dance number came to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break!\" she gasped at her team once they'd finished the number, taking a moment to get drinks and a breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving big boobs had never slowed Miranda down before. But there was a difference between having a D cup and having a G cup, her breasts were twice the size they'd been last season and despite lifting several days a week, Miranda's muscles were weakening. Her perfect posture had changed even when standing, shoulders starting to curl in under the weight. Her lower back had begun to get sore under the strain and lances of pain were starting to shoot up her spine, over her sore shoulders and into her sensitive breasts.She felt like she was going to throw up and all she could imagine was going home, getting a massage, eating 10,000 calories or so and falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your drink Captain Lawson,\" Kelly smiled, handing her frosty bottle of sports drink, \"thanks again for keeping me on as water girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former vice-captain's extreme demotion would have shaken anyone else, but the tubby redhead's smile was bigger than her ass. Watching her beloved Captain's every new ounce flounce and bounce without having to worry about doing a routine was Kelly's dream come true! Miranda's cheer top was near transparent, its fabric drenched and its buttons straining apart under the constant jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, oh God,\" Miranda huffed, \"this game feels like its taking forever...at least its almost over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly minutes of Grav-Ball left...but then the other team scored a touch goal, tying it up. Miranda glared, both for school pride and having to do over time. The Grav Ball team needed to win, which meant they needed a cheering crowd which meant she needed to do something drastic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doing a wave maneuver,\" Miranda hissed, crushing the bottle in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are you sure about that?\" Kelly asked, even though she wasn't officially on the team anymore, \"that's a tough one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you have biotics,\" Miranda said, signalling her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly wanted to say something more, but her eyes were on Lawson's top which should probably be retired. The soy expanded breasts were about to shred it just from walking, but the wave maneuver involved the team tossing its captain up into the air repeatedly. Kelly wasn't worried about them getting Miranda up in the air, they were all very strong after all the lifting, but she was worried about all of Miranda coming down. Even with her biotic powers slowing Miri down, there was a lot of bouncing boob flesh to deal with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's team of slightly padded beauties crowded around her, looking fresh as daisy's compared to the panting Captain. Their fingers sank into her thick, soft legs, Miri having to suppress a giggle as her sensitive fat tickled. They raised her up into the air, propping her high and plaint to see for the crowd. She inhaled as far as she could, chest rising up and up, seams straining, a hook in her bra snapping and a button flying off her blouse, leaving it held closed by two fraying buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up in your chairs and  let the team  you care!\" she roared, \"WAVE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team dipped Miranda down and tossed her high up into the air, boosted by a thrust from Miranda's biotic powers to make her hang up in the air for just a little longer. For a moment she had the beautiful sensation of weightlessness but then her breasts surged up, almost popping out of her top. A blush hit her cheeks, the crowd vanishing from concern and her reality going just to the pale zeppelins attached to her chest. What if they broke free and she was exposed to the whole crowd? Yes she'd made that agreement with Ashley, but had she really expected to be possibly exposed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team caught her with a grunt, barely stopping her before her inflated buns hit the turf. Her boobs plunged low, bottom button snapping away and another hook on her bra clasp snapping. The deep valley of her cleavage and the ripping bra was plain to see for everyone, she was clearly indecent already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The smart thing would be to pick a skinnier girl who's breasts hadn't far out paced her uniform in size. She'd be humiliated, scandalized, possibly kicked off the team, the cheer captain who'd chubbed up so much she'd burst out of her top in front of an entire crowd? People would giggle and laugh at her, she'd be so humiliated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod she hoped Liara was ready to fuck tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toss me again,\" she ordered, the wave only flickering through the crowd, most of them focusing on the bounce of Miranda's tatas, \"high as we can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing, the team tossed the over plump Miranda as high as they could. She made herself levitate higher and faster, holding herself at the apex where her breasts popped up and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressurized middle button shot off. The last bra hook tore off. Her sweat soaked FF cup bra spun away like a sling shot, leaving the cheer leader totally topless in front of everyone, twenty feet in the air. For a quarter second she exulted in making such a high jump, a school record, only to realize her nudity and go absolutely red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy G cups were eight inches of fluffy glory, caught as their shape changed from perfectly round to tear drop. Almost as large as Miri's head, gleaming with sweat, their half dollar nipples just starting to spread and her deep blue veins contrasting with the snow white skin. They'd just started to droop from sheer mass but no one noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in the field, Ashley Williams blitz through the opposing line and scored a touch down, letting out a roar of triumph. She turned to celebrate, only to notice Miranda's massive mammaries filling the mega-screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n People stared, camera's flashed and she plunged to earth with a beat red face at putting on the pornographic display live. Her team barely caught her and Miranda's unsupported breasts slapped painfully against her gut, making her yelp with pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Let's Get Physical: After that display, the school requires the cheer Captain to under go a physical and see if she's still fit enough to serve. Surely Miranda will pass with flying colors though...</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Spring Break: Miranda and Liara prep for Spring Break, which means bikinis and beer, with no exercise at all for Miranda. Surely such complete hedonism won't have any effect on her declining fitness...</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dr. Karin Chakwas finished washing her hands inside the washroom of the campus medical clinic, looking up at the woman in the mirror in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn attractive Indian woman just entering middle age, her brown face soft and unlined, flattered by a pixie cut kept black by a dye job now and then. There was no doubt that she still looked pretty good despite her 41st Birth day being a month away...until you got down below her still high breasts to the problem area. Thrice weekly aerobics, healthy eating and good genes had kept Karin as slim as any co-ed until the day she'd turned 40, easily slid into the little black dress she'd met her husband in, eaten too much cheesecake and drank too much champagne to celebrate and started to balloon out of that gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty pounds in less than a year had given Karin chubby thighs, a flabby butt and most of all a great big, Buddha belly. A red line from her pinching pants bisected the soft brown sphere and Chakwas scowled at it, stuffing it back into her pants and sucking the flabby gut in as much as she could. Four separate diets hadn't even blunted this monumental case of middle age spread, the puffy paunch increasing by the month until the once slim doctor looked pregnant. Her two daughters frequently teased her, asking when she was due, for the doctor was having to dig into old maternity clothes and relaxed scrubs to fit into anything at all comfortable. Even those were getting tight though, Chakwas chubbiness too big for pants she'd worn at nine months!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get this thing under control,\" the pudgy physician pined at herself, frowning as she finally got the button done up, dried her hands and left the washroom for her next appointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe campus medical clinic was a comfy, ultra modern place, well decorated to instill school spirit alongside promoting good health and fitness in party school where many freshmen put on thirty pounds of beer weight their first year. To that end, the hallway bore a massive blow up photo of Miranda Lawson taken two years ago, the svelte brunette's abs mocking Chakwas gut and her icy blue eyes judging the older, fatter woman. The doctor had grown to hate that decal as she'd grown heavier, which was why today was so special...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stood up from her hover car with a wince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand immediately went to the squishy small of her back, pressing against her screaming lower back, while the other pulled her sweater back down over her paunch. This of course pulled her sweater's neck line down far too far, showing a soft canyon of cleavage down to the rim of her black bra. Sighing, the cheerleader abandoned her attempt to get a size twelve sweater to cover her at least size fourteen body and zipped up her stylish jacket by feel, unable to see it under the swell of her breasts. It went up with a little difficulty past her pooch and stopped right beneath her tits, the cheerleader not even trying to zip it up further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping they can do something about this,\" Miranda said, rubbing her back and making her way slowly into the campus health clinic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that the campus administration was having mixed feelings of their star student athlete was an understatement. Miranda's modelesque body had starred in many an ad campaign for the school, drawing in a large number of students eager to occupy the same campus as her and her scientifically chosen cheer squad of hotties. That she'd packed on sixty pounds in a few months was already sending alarm bells ringing through the athletic administration, only the good performance of the squad and herself at practice due to their strength and skill saving her position. But popping her top in front of a packed stadium, letting everyone see just how big she'd gotten?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the videos were viral popular and tuition from new enrollment would outnumber the fines for showing those G cups a thousand to one. But no one could deny that Miranda had gotten big, not helped by her excuse that she hadn't realized the strain her top was under and how she'd been completely and obviously winded during the game. A thorough mid-season physical had been ordered by the time the ultra-curvy Senior had had a letterman's jacket thrown over her breasts, the date set for Tuesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda limped into the building, forgoing her usual hip shaking sashay and winced again as she filled out the form on a tablet. The strain of her Gs flopping around unsupported at the last toss had put her back out to the extent she'd had to be on bottom during all three sex session's she and Liara had managed to sustain. On Monday, Miri had been so sore she'd had to skip her weight lifting session (which her softening body needed), baking class (not that she skipped eating cake) and Asari Stretching (she'd played video games), until Liara had come home and they'd gorged on pizza until they started making out. Such a day of lazy decadence should have left Miranda feeling relaxed...but she was instead feeling like shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back hurt from the toss, her tits were sore from growing so fast and not being fitted in a good enough bra and for the first time in the perfect woman's life she was out of anything to wear. Miranda's deep closets were full of ultra fashionable clothes that she'd never again fit into and the high fashion clothing synthesizer's at her mansion weren't programmed for clothes in the true plus sizes above fourteen, Liara's gown a one off downloaded from the internet. She could down load new patterns but that would've taken time, time that Miri didn't have as she'd slept through Liara waking up and two other alarms before having to stuff herself into outgrown yoga pants and a sweater like some sort of impoverished bohemian! If not for her four inch heels, dazzling jewelry and tasteful makeup she wouldn't have dared show her face...especially as Miranda had a big red blemish right on the tip of her nose courtesy of all that pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was sent right into a waiting room, each step a spasm of pain. Before she could even sweep in, a paunchy if pretty doctor opened the door, looking down at a chart. She raised her eyes up at the fat cheer leader, a look of confusion worn plainly over an expression of glee as she took in the cheerleader's softer face, thick and touching thighs straining her leggings transparent and a full round belly starting to droop. It was like someone had shoved a wet suit full of jello over the gorgeous fit girl picture on the wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry I was looking for Miranda Lawson,\" Chakwas smiled, \"I must have the wrong room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no you've got me,\" the cheerleader said quickly, not missing the little jab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich made her heart beat faster. She was heavy enough that she wasn't recognizable? No, no she was still recognizable this was a jibe...a real jibe over her weight. Oh God that was getting her going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well then,\" Chakwas said, \"let's get started. You'll need to strip for accurate readings, this isn't an ordinary physical. The school wants your health thoroughly checked before you can cheer again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...I thought this was just a check up?\" Miranda asked, perfect eye brow rising up, \"what do you mean cheer again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, recent events are calling your health into question. The school would hate for you to be hurt while cheering. They'd be open to lawsuits for letting someone in obvious bad health compete,\" Chakwas smiled wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I've never failed a physical before,\" Miranda said dejectedly, the world falling out beneath her as she realized she might lose her position and team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never had failed a physical before, her carefully designed genetics and exercise keeping her at the peak of human health her whole life. Miri had never before so much as had a fat day, much less the flu, she'd never had a hangover even! Surely she'd pass and keep her team, keep her vaunted position and all the thrill of control commanding that crowd gave her! But failing a physical...that was something a fat girl did...a really fat girl. One who'd totally let herself go into the type of fatness that could only ever increase...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll disrobe then, no need for you to leave,\" Miranda said, stepping out of her heels and unzipping her jacket to show her sweater had ridden up over her belly button, \"and this shouldn't take long. I may be a bit curvier but I'm in perfect health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore doughy cheer leader was revealed with every inch of wool, until Chakwas was rewarded with the sight of Miri's totally untoned torso struggling to get the sweater over her head. Her stomach shook back and forth, new stretch marks on its lower slope a vivid red as the collection of fat rolls creased and flopped at the fat girl's efforts. Somewhere beneath it all the pitiful remnants of once mighty abs slumbered, dreaming nightmares of the hot fudge and bean dip that had vanquished them. Deep creases formed at her sides, her love handles having grown enough to become floppy. Breasts bounced and wiggled against a beyond tight F cup bra, excess cleavage overflowing the top, pouring out the side and hanging out the bottom of the cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof, phew, there we go,\" Miranda said at last, getting her long black hair out of the sweater and starting on her leggings, soft arms bunching with exposed fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiri had always been an hour glass, and the doubling of her breasts had been matched by her hips. Stupidly round, the childbearing slopes of fat were cartoonishly shapely still, although stretch marks showed on the sides. Her thong was swallowed up by fat on all sides, from her meaty fupa to her soft love handles to her prize feature: an enormous backside that was now proportionately more fat than muscle, no longer a perfect sphere but starting to sag. Fresh cellulite shook as the tall girl struggled to get them down over her swollen thighs, the squishy upper legs clapping together as Miranda's back spasmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you alright?\" Chakwas asked, \"your posture is a little off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a sore back,\" Miranda said, \"let's get started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda's voice was full of confidence...but Chakwas took in the stretchmarks on her belly, the slump of her shoulders and the occasional audible wince of pain she gave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to ask before we begin,\" The pot bellied Dr. smiled, \"are you expecting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would you ask that?\" Miranda replied, face going red, hearing a seam in her bra strain and feeling her belly rub against her thong, \"I'm not pregnant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a precautionary question, let's get you weighed,\" Chakwas said, \"and a blood pressure and blood sugar test...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiri could have seen the scale's display if she'd been able to lean past her breasts, but she didn't dare bend her back. Her back muscles were so tight she couldn't bend even a degree, her pinched nerves screaming when Chakwas used a laser tape measure to take her height. Chakwas gave a rather happy looking hum as she typed it all into her chart and began taking Miranda's blood pressure with a cuff that cut cruelly into her arm and her blood sure with a little jab to the finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, I never had to have that before,\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its necessary for someone showing signs of, well, rapid weight gain. We want to make sure you're not getting diabetic,\" Chakwas grinned, grin fading as the device said that Miranda's blood sugar and pressure was still somehow well within healthy range, a side effect of her tinkered genomes, \"which you aren't. Well...that's good but at 5'9 and 207lbs you are quite overweight by BMI. Obese in fact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...O...Obese?\" Miri asked, blue eyes going wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was obese. She the perfect woman was obese. OBESE. The front of her panties, hidden inside her soft thighs, went darker with moisture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And obese athletes can't compete unless they under go more testing proving they're healthy otherwise,\" Chakwas informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't...I can't be obese, No wait!,\" the stunned cheerleader yelped, finding a board to cling to after a ship wreck of her self image, \"No wait, I'm, I'm 5'10!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not according to the laser,\" Chakwas grinned, \"I see you used to be 5'10 but it appears you've shrank a little bit. That happens when you're ...weighed down a bit more. Let's test your muscle tone! BMI doesn't count for muscle, maybe you're very despite your weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stared ahead, caught in a crosswind of shame and horniness that left her panties wet and her cheeks burning red, until she felt a sharp pinch at her waist and gave a high squeal. Chakwas was pinching her stomach fat with a cruel, cold set of callipers. The determined doctor went along, pinching all along her belly, arms, thighs, hips, buns and even her chin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, 31.8. In the overweight range but not quite obese. There's some muscle in there I suppose,\" Chakwas said dejectedly, her physician's code of ethics preventing nudging the readings to say the ballooned cheerleader was surely obese, \"you're still a cheerleader...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's heart swelled in her chest, until the doctor spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can pass a basic flexibility test.\" Chakwas told her, \"touch your toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...toes?\" Miri asked in fear, looking down, feeling her chin bunch and only seeing tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've seen many of the routines you've done in past seasons. You must be very very flexible,\" Chakwas told her, \"this should be easy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda blinked, knowing she could have done this easy as early as friday before she'd twinged her back. But now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" she said fearfully and started to bend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader made it about fifteen degrees before her back twinged again, right as her breasts began to hang down fully from her shoulders. A grunt escaped her mouth and Miranda froze, unable to move a muscle. Chakwas watched, eyes going to the roll of Miri's soft belly, burning the image into her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back pain?\" the comparatively svelte doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Miri whispered, standing slowly back up and rubbing her back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, let's see the exact reason\" Chakwas said, walking over and gently running her fingers up Miranda's soft, squishy back, jabbing them into the joints of her vertebrae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, you've got a badly pinched sciatic nerve and a slightly slipped disc on your third lumbar vertebrae,\" Chakwas said, \"the reason is easy to determine: your breasts are too large for your frame. I'd recommend a reduction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm sorry did you say a reduction?\" the pained brunette glared, hand going protectively to her immense bosom, \"Why would I want a reduction, I love having breasts like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your breasts are so big they're throwing your back out,\" Chakwas observed dryly, \"at least get yourself a properly fitted bra. That lacy negligee is for girls with small breasts, larger women need more support. Here's the number of a good bra shop, get them quick or those'll be on the floor by the time your thirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Miranda a card...and a passed physical form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...I...I pass?\" Miranda said amazed after that disparaging experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, your back is making me put you on medical exemption for two weeks until you're treated but you're otherwise healthy as a horse,\" Chakwas sighed, \"the only danger to you from cheerleading is blackening your eye with a stray boob. You are otherwise cleared to cheer but let me give you some personal advice: you've got to stop thinking like a thin girl if you're going to get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking like a...I don't know what you mean,\" Miranda denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try and cover it up, you've got a feedee fetish and probably an exhibitionist and humilation one too. Ice Queen models don't gain sixty pounds in nine weeks unless they want to,\" Chakwas told her calmly, \"oh don't look like you're the only girl who has a fetish. My college roomate gained seventy pounds freshman year because of me and my husbands tits are as big as yours. Then he suggested we turn the hot fudge funnel around for my birthday and now look at me, on the one way train to piggy-ville! I've tried to quit so many times but being stuffed and heavy feels so good. You know what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader blushed, feeling more ashamed than when she'd been topless in front of fifty thousand people but also hopeful that someone else shared her kink, \"I...okay. I admit all of this is intentional. And that feeling full is really, really nice. But, an explanation on the not thinking like a thin girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't treat yourself like this is a temporary thing and you'll be a size two again,\" Chakwas lectured, \"you're going to be fat for the long haul, which means eating plenty of greens instead of crisps, keeping up your exercising and dressing for your weight. Speaking of, what's your goal weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A goal? I don't really have a goal...I guess, I was just planning to keep gaining until I got...I don't know, until I was satisfied,\" Miranda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No goal...oh honey,\" Chakwas tut-tutted, \"You're going to get <i>huge</i> aren't you? Just, remember: you're not a skinny fit girl anymore. You're going to have fat girl moments: going up stairs, getting stuck in things, busting buttons, tone the routines down a little bit perhaps and let the thinner girls get tossed into the air. Keep up exercising but don't exert yourself, walk but don't run before you're on a mobility scooter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...me, on a mobility scooter?\" Miranda asked, feeling very real and very vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda, you've gained sixty pounds in three months,\" Chakwas laughed kindly, patting Miranda's full paunch, \"if you kept that up then this time next year you'll be needing one for long distances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mobility scooter, could she really get so fat she needed a machine to get around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's for after you graduate,\" Chakwas told her, \"I doubt that you'll get too much above three hundred before graduation, although you never know. Now, be sure to rest plenty and start wearing a back brace for your own good. And support those boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat fetishest doctor left with a giggle, letting Miranda slowly and carefully get dressed in a relieved daze. She'd been saved by a hairsbreadth ...but couldn't practice for two weeks, so now what was she supposed to do with all that free time? She looked down at the card in her hand: Matriarch Aethyta's Bra Shop, No Pair Too Big or Too Small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>My boobs!: Miranda and Liara try out the bra shop and get an invitation</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Bake off: Miranda and Jack enter a cake baking competition for extra credit</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liara T'Soni, covered in sweat and breathing hard, watched the numbers climb up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was used to being the biggest girl in the room. As a kid she'd been chubby, in her adolescence this had changed to a real weight problem: every school year she'd pile on the pounds through over eating and laziness and begrudgingly lose most of it at fat camps over the summer to begin the process again. Her explosive first semester growth was just Liara's natural weight without her mother controlling her, sneaking snacks could only take you so far. Liara's normal was being at least forty or fifty pounds heavier than other Asari, of being soft and cuddly in a species of graceful amazons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's harsh words whenever she'd popped out of another pants size or been found in bed with that delightful human plant byproduct \"chocolate\" had always stuck with her: \"Fat\" \"Lazy\", \"Shameful\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, 2.48. 2.49...,\" Liara wheezed, breath coming in heaves, thighs burning, breasts wobbling and heavy gut flapping, \"2.50!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed the stop button down on the treadmill, the machine coming to a halt and letting the sweaty Asari stop jogging. Liara let the slowing conveyor belt take her forwards, belly touching the control rail later than it once had. She breathed hard, but not uncontrolled, in through the nose and out through the mouth, smiling as she saw her longest run yet: 2.5 miles. She not waddled over to the mirror, seeing the Asari she'd become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt fat camp exercise had always been miserable, leaving her feeling groggy and exhausted and sore. But now that she was doing it on her own Liara felt amazing, energized and fresh despite her sweat. She looked down on her 250 lb body, 50lbs less than at the human new year: her double belly was merging back together, her pillow ass was perking up and she'd lost one of her four chins! If she pressed hard enough onto her dumpy thighs she could actually feel the hard muscle built by all of her exercise! And the thing was, unlike past weight losses caused by fat camp, Liara knew this one would continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause unlike then, she had a goal. Not to please her mother, no. Her goal was to be the skinny one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, police? Yes there's an intruder in my house. Yes a sexy, sweaty Asari,\" a voice said behind her, \"oh wait, it's just my hot girlfriend. False alarm, but send over chinese. I'm about to burn a lot of energy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Liara could turn she felt two soft bulges press into her shoulders and neck, followed fractionally later by another bulge at midback. Soft arms curled around her chest and the blue woman moaned as Miranda's mouth touched her hair fronds, tongue licking sweat off the sensitive tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummm, you being all sweaty gets me wild,\" the benched cheer Captain purred behind her, \"its not quite as good as you being drenched in chocolate sauce but that can wait until this afternoon. Let's do it here, on the floor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, are you up to that?\" Liara asked, easily removing Miranda's grip from her shoulders and turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last two weeks since Miranda's physical, the Asari's new fitness habits had put her weight loss into over drive, becoming an inwardly fit if still outwardly fluffy young woman. But Miranda, well...the most exercise the cheer leader got in a day was walking from her temporary handicapped parking space to baking class, less than three hundred steps round trip. Without any exercise at all and with all day spent on either asleep, floating in a tub or on the couch playing video games, Miranda was ballooning faster than ever into a decadent, hedonistic embodiment of laziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am,\" Miranda smiled, stiffly striking a pose with one hand on her hip and the other on her head, frowning as her back twinged, \"ugh, don't I look like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's thick thighs had gone *FWUMP*, meeting three fourths of the way to the knee, which they'd begun to hang over. Her childbearing hips looked too big for standard school chairs, a web of stretch marks appearing wider on their sides everytime Liara looked. In the back, her buns looked like beach balls filled 80% of the way with cottage cheese, cellulite spreading like wild fire as the best ass on campus started drooping, the muscle that had held it up shrinking by the day. The halt of her estrogen heavy diet, for the sake of her back, had let her belly make strides in catching up to her breasts: its upper 2/3rds were a large pot full of vanilla cake batter, with some strawberry swirls for the stretchmarks on its bottom slope, next to the deepening crease between belly and FUPA. That this girl had ever had a six pack was shocking to Liara, Miranda's stuffed gut didn't look like she'd ever done a single sit up in her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look ready for bed,\" Liara grinned, for while the Asari was in tight spandex shorts and sports bra, Miranda was wearing just a thong and t-shirt, \"honestly I'm surprised your up before 7 am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were undersized, the black thong's straps were swallowed up by Miri's flabby love handles, most of its panty hidden by her thighs and FUPA. The white shirt's sleeves bit tightly into her flabby arms, a christmas ham wrapped around Miri's once corded upper limbs. Her forearms were swollen and puffy, her fingers having gotten thick enough none of her rings fit. The main body of the shirt didn't go down to her belly button and was stretched tight by Miranda's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back wasn't letting me sleep anymore,\" the obese cheer leader admitted, rubbing her stiff lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should start wearing a bra, then and not have these floppers hanging off you all day?\" Liara asked, cupping the bottom of Miranda's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Liara wasn't sure how large they were, because Miranda hadn't worn anything even resembling a bra since her physical but the end of any exercise at all meant the end of Miranda's breasts defying gravity. The plain to see nipples, still small and tight relatively, were starting to point downwards and Miri's head sized boobs were hanging at least three inches lower than their peak, able to hold half of a pencil bag comfortably beneath their sensitive bulk. Her hunched, padded shoulders were curled under their increasingly pendulous bulk, their shape now fully tear drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it!\" Miri giggled, breasts bouncing and a grin breaking out across her dimpled face, \"those are sensitive enough I'll go in ten seconds if you start there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had changed the least, her smile was dazzling and her eyes piercing still, but Miranda's elegant cheekbones were soft apples usually red from the exertion of walking and she had a full double chin no matter what. She was squinting a little bit, playing a video game 12 hrs a day had dented her vision a bit, and her raven hair hadn't been styled in weeks, getting curly and hanging well beneath her meaty hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've both got class,\" Liara said, stepping in until their bellies met, \"but if we shower and fuck at the same time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed Miranda and frowned, licking syrup off of her lips, \"You had breakfast without me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm a big girl, you can't expect me to not eat while you're exercising,\" Miranda laughed, her 229 lb body bouncing, \"but let's head to the showers, I want to get in a second meal before I have to go to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the class where you eat nothing but baked goods?\" Liara asked her, eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't expect me to gorge on an empty stomach,\" Miranda said, jiggling her gut, which jiggled her breasts and then wincing as her back twinged again, back bending forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's eyes widened in alarm, putting a hand on the flabby arm of her girlfriend, \"Miri are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my back,\" the saggy cheer captain sighed, \"Ugh, I'm not sure how I can cheer like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you considered getting a bra?\" Liara asked, \"I love how lazy you're getting now lover, you make sweat pants and a tank top look good. But you're too big to go unsupported.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda sighed, a sigh that made Liara's blood pressure spike, \"I guess you're right, its just...I'll have to get custom fitted at a shop, I'm too big for clothing synthesizers, its so hard to get up and go anymore...its like I'm obese or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth laughed, getting into the palatial bathroom and starting the immense shower, built extra large so two fatties could get in and both be sprayed from several angles. The two pressed in close, soft, guts squishing together and kissed again, Liara standing on tip toe to keep the tall girl from having to bend. Liara ran her finger tips over the incredible softness of Miri's belly, marvelling that this was a six pack eleven weeks earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess but you've gotten fat,\" she smiled, \"you've done a really good job becoming a fat girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm going to be fatter than you soon I think,\" the gorgeous human confessed, \"I'm...going to just keep getting bigger too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why you need to get yourself some fitted bras, before you trip over your tits,\" Liara giggled, \"really, I love lazy Miranda struggling into sweat pants to go out for fast food but since we plan on getting you bigger and bigger, you might as well get some upgraded clothes again. I miss you wearing make up and fancy clothes and lingerie all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incredibly lazy cheerleader sighed, beginning to lather herself up, \"That's a good point, my back won't get any better unless I either lose five cup sizes, get back in shape or wear a fitted bra. And the first two aren't going to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to exercise with me at all?\" the fit-fat Asari asked, \"not even a little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the busty, fat cheerleader admitted, \"I guess a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bra shopping: after class, Miranda decides to hit the store..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteamy: hey, let's continue this scene...</b></span></div></div>",

Miranda noticed it but didn\u2019t stop eating, she\u2019d put a lot of work into her bear claws this morning, her baking skills skyrocketing alongside her weight. While the daily eating contest between her and Jack was still a crowd pleaser, the billionaire\u2019s culinary creations were becoming incredibly saught after, the rest of the class eating the entire thing to review them instead of just taking a slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I made a second baker\u2019s dozen,\u201d Miri thought to herself, swallowing the last of sugary calorie bombs and giving a demure little burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seatbelt trailed across her exposed gut when she undid it, the cold metal giving her a delightful little squeal as it touched her spherical gut. Getting out of the ivory white ferrari required the use of her hands and made her emit a fat girl grunt of effort. She sucked sugar off of her fingers, feeling like a lazy fat piglet and thrilled at the lazy gluttonous decadence of it all. Her belly was so swollen with carbs and cream laden coffee she looked ready to burst, her perfect legs were thick enough to burst out of her pants and her weight was weighing heavier on her by the day as her muscles decayed beneath her thickening fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really am perfect,\u201d she said to herself, bending back into the car to grab her late and nearly screaming in agony as her immense G cup tear drops stopped resting against her chest and pulled hard on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlutton she might be, but Miri abandoned the creamy coffee in favor of not crippling herself. The semi-retired cheerleader had to admit that her unsupported floppers were one minor issue towards basic things like flexibility and mobility. Her swollen tear drops were too big and her muscles too weak for her frame to adequately support them and while their rate of growth had slowed, they were still getting bigger. And now that Miri\u2019s strong back and shoulder muscles were atrophying, the gravity defying bosoms were starting to plunge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda wanted to be her own version of perfect and while thick thighs and a big gut were part of that, she\u2019d prefer her boobs stop losing an inch of perk per week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence the fat brunette\u2019s presence at Matriarch Aethtya\u2019s bra shop, a snug little store tucked into a quiet corner of New Chicago. Miranda didn\u2019t usually go into such small shops but her stupendous bosom was much larger than the sizes carried by the expensive designer stores she\u2019d frequented. As she waddled up to the door, Miri was at least glad that there weren\u2019t any stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass door was very heavy, making the once fantastically strong girl marvel at how out of shape she was, and opened into a large pleasant room full of mannequins and displays that elicited a soft whistle from Miri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like her girlfriend Miranda loved boobs. Huge ones, big ones, small ones, tiny ones. Saggy and squishy, high and firm. It didn\u2019t matter, it was just the presence of the most feminine part of visible anatomy and this little temple of titties that got her going. So the display of huge titted mannequins, ones that made her own bodacious bosom seem small and demure revved Miranda\u2019s personal engines hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, no no,\u201d a pack of cigarettes a day voice hissed from the back of the shop, \u201coh no, you are not doing that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Miranda said, looking away from the libido rousing display and having to pick her jaw up off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long lived Asari had a life cycle of three phases. First came the maiden stage, the youthful centuries spent slim, gracetul and wild. Then came the matron stage, where hips widened and breasts increased, the blue women\u2019s bodies demanding children. Then, at around six hundred years of age came the Matriarch stage where things could get\u2026.big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not going to waste those boobs like this!\u201d the enormous chested Asari nearly yelled, hurrying from the back of the room, a mobile earthquake of boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tits made Miranda\u2019s G cups look tiny. Perfectly round mega-boobs that made the stooped Miri\u2019s shoulders slump even more. The cheerleader couldn\u2019t tear her gaze away from the sea of blueberry boob blubber on display, 153 IQ temporarily rendered inert by so much cleavage. What was she even looking at, J cups? K cups? Good God above were those ...L cup breasts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...not,\u201d Miri stammered gesturing at her thin cheer shirt that was stretched tight over what were usually the biggest boobs in the room, \u201cwasting...them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re walking around stoop shouldered without a bra! Girl you\u2019re losing perk by the minute,\u201d the husky voice Asari snapped, grabbing the tall human by the shoulder, \u201cCome with me now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her giant boobs, Aethtya\u2019s body was thickly built. Her glamorous dress clearly showed wide, muscular shoulders, while a thick, meaty waist with matronly hips and big, beefy thighs. No one would have called her thin, minus the breasts the Asari had to be over two hundred pounds, but there was a lot of muscle underneath her ample padding. Miranda felt a twinge of shame, realizing how badly she\u2019d let herself go with the excuse to gorge and laze about but soon found herself standing shirtless in a back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this really necessary? I just came for some bras\u2026,\u201d she said, sheepishly blushing despite many a naked photo shoot and skimpy cheer routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course this is necessary! You\u2019re wasting a magnificent body,\u201d the Matriarch said, running a measuring tape around Lawson\u2019s curves, \u201cyour breasts have aged twelve years since you were exposed in front of the football stadium!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiri blushed a deeper shade of red, reaching for her old self confidence and finding it wasn\u2019t there. Its absence shocked and aroused her, as much as this self confident, strong-thick Asari berating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, uh, saw that?\u201d she asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone on this colony saw that,\u201d the Asari huffed, \u201cI knew you\u2019d be in here after that if you had any wits about you. But have you even worn a bra since then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no, I haven\u2019t had anything that fits,\u201d Miranda admitted, crossing her legs, \u201cI\u2019ve had a growth spurt lately\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, you found a little gaining fetish and went kaboom?\u201d Aethtya sighed, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten considerably fatter since just the game, do you realize that? You\u2019ve got a 35inch belly beneath your boobs, how many carbs are you eating a day to grow this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t quite been keeping track,\u201d Miranda said, feeling herself get wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re soft as melted ice cream too,\u201d Aethyta said, pinching a love handle, \u201cI\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t budged from the couch, have you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on bed rest for two weeks, Doctor\u2019s orders,\u201d the proud girl squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019ve been sitting on your butt eating because your boobs are too big for your back, right?\u201d Aethtya sighed, \u201cWell, you got here just in time. This plateau of yours is about to end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of plateau are you talking about?\u2019 the horny cheerleader asked, hoping the Matriarch was going to berate her some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a breast expert girl and your boobs are getting ready for another growth spurt,\u201d the Asari said, \u201cthree cup sizes, maybe four and if you don\u2019t properly support them you\u2019ll be tripping over them soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-four cup sizes?\u201d Miri stuttered,trying to imagine being that gigantic, \u201cI\u2019d be...huge, an I cup at least\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd dragging on the floor if you don\u2019t start supporting yourself,\u201d Aethtya told her, pulling out a bra big enough for a scout troop to camp in, \u201chere try this on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiri raised an eyebrow at the giant garment but reluctantly put it on, finding it fit magnificently once the numerous straps were hooked together. The at best lingering pain in her back suddenly lifted, her boobs lifted up almost to their old positions. She looked at her reflection, looking more like her old self than she had in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is...fantastic,\u201d Miri nearly moaned, \u201cI\u2019ll take twenty of them. Do they come in black?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they come in black,\" the Asari laughed, a sound that was strangely familiar to Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight young woman finally looked at Aethtya's soft face...a face that looked almost exactly like Liara's. If her girlfriend's weight was distributed to her chest and she was 700 years older, it would have been like looking at the girl Miranda had woken up next to. Asari were rare on New Illinois, the only other one she knew of was Liara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By any chance, do you have a relative at my school?\" the cheerleader asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the harsh Asari could answer, the bell to her shop rang as someone came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Not So Flat Biotic: Jack's here...and she's a big girl anymore.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other Mom?: Liara comes in for an impromptu reunion.</b></span></div></div>",

As if being an embarrassment to the class wasn't bad enough!\" Miranda finished her story with a flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda and her two cheerleader friends giggled loudly, earning anxious glances from some of the surrounding students trying to use the library for its intended purpose instead of a gossip circle. Even the library manager didn't look away from his computer to give the girls a stern look and tell them to quiet down. Even the teachers knew not to mess around with Lawson and her cronies, two beautiful but brain-dead lackeys who had stuck to her since she first led a chant in support of the Chicago Uni Cerberus'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to talk about embarrassments, have you seen that Asari waddling around? Laura or whatever?\" one of Miranda's ditzy friends said. \"What a fat slob, it's like she ate that gum from that candy factory movie or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Barely a year on campus and she's a total pig! And I hear those blue creeps are supposed to be, like, seductive and stuff!\" the other ditzy friend piped in. \"Yeah, maybe to the bearded lady at the freakshow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she'll actually finish Mir? Or will she have a heart attack or eat one of the teachers?\" the first friend asked Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope not,\" Miranda said coolly, a sadistic little smile curling her lips. \"Not until I'm done with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ditzy friends tilted their heads in confusion. \"What are you gonna do, Mir?\" they chorused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since this is my last year, I figure I should do my part to leave this school better then when I found it, hmm?\" Miranda explained. \"And what better way than to teach that alien's parents a lesson?\" The two girls stared at her with a lost expression, which was sadly par for the course for the two brain trusts in front of her. \"I'm going to make that Asari's parents regret sending her here, and hopefully no one else will be dumb enough to send their alien spawns here either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda held up a book from the stack gathered in front of her; a diet book for athletes to help build muscle mass and bulk up. Underneath was a recipe book of sorts, a dessert book with plenty of sweet treats and delectable delights within. Underneath that, workout manuals, conveniently focused on anything but cardio and endurance training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a shame really; the Asari couldn't handle what we humans can learn with ease,\" Miranda said maliciously. \"And the stress turned her into the biggest, fattest blob this planet has ever seen! Maybe next time the aliens will know to stay away, hm?\" The two cronies' eyes lit up on the realization of what the plan was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Miranda, you're brilliant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a genius idea! That'll scare all these freakshows away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasking in the glow of empty praise, Miranda looked up at the clock. \"Well, after my next class, I'm going to haunt the gym and see if I can track that fatty down. Then...well, you two will see, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls stood up, laughing all the way out the door and not paying any attention to the patrons they were disturbing. They had nothing to fear from anyone overhearing their plans. No one was going to take the side of some fatass Asari over the most popular girls on campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the far corner of the room, over the edge of an technical manual, a pair of glowing purple eyes narrowed in dislike at the retreating cheerleaders, her face obscured by a containment faceplate and shaded by a purple, ornately decorated headdress. The engineering sophomore was not brave or foolish enough to confront the three right then and there, but she'd been on the receiving end of bullies and bigots like them for too long not to have a reaction, and boy was she having one now. Her four-fingers were clenched around the book so tightly she was leaving indents in the paper, and steam was fogging the inside of her helmet from her heavy, angered breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes your stomach turn, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engineering student looked up at the human suddenly hovering over her, a punkish-looking female with black lipstick and a long ponytail, with the sides of her head shaved clean, clad in a rough-worn leather jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'll say,\" the engineering student agreed. \"Can't believe someone would do something like that. Makes me want to...urgh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, makes me want to 'urgh' too,\" the punk girl said. She leaned in closer. \"So...what are you gonna do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I can tell that pissed you off as much as it pissed me off,\" the punk girl said. \"What are you gonna do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engineering student, far smarter then the airheads Miranda surrounded herself with, caught on quickly, folding her hands together over the book. \"Well...what are <i>you</i> going to do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punk girl smiled. \"Give that Cerberus cheerleader a taste of her own medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll need some help,\" the engineering girl said. \"And I think I know just who we need...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you can do it, just a couple more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara wanted to complain about how much agony this was, but she was too out of breath to even speak. Heavy footsteps pounding the treadmill, she was soaked to the bone with sweat, making the regular slap of her stomach against her upper thighs all the more uncomfortable. She felt like a leaking water balloon, her enormous rear end and lumpy breasts bouncing and wobbling around, throwing her off balance with every other step, as Miranda overlooked her workout, casually sipping from a cup of some diet shake. She swung her arms out a little farther then usual, and she felt a seam pop on her workout clothes' sleeve. It was enough to make her cry uncle, and she stepped onto the edges of the treadmill and collapsed onto the floor, her shiny sweat-covered belly sticking out into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I made good time...\" Liara gasped between great heaving breaths, feeling a little bit proud of herself. \"How...how long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minutes,\" Miranda said, checking her watch. Liara let out a little whimper, pushing herself up to a sitting position. \"Hey, perk up, you're doing great! Just need to stay hydrated! I'll grab you a soda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara looked up at Miranda's retreating figure. \"I...isn't water...healthier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not as much as you'd think,\" Miranda lied coolly. \"Besides, a little boost of sweetness is great for a workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara wasn't sure about that, but she didn't know much about dieting and excersize, obviously, so she shrugged and got back up onto the treadmill. When this was over, Liara thought to herself, she deserved a little reward for this torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before Liara started on another five minute burst...</span></div></div>",

Waiting until Miranda was out of earshot, she strode up to the machines next to the portly Asari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, you mind if I work out here?\" the student asked kindly. \"Trying to work off a couple pounds.\" She patted the pillow she surreptitiously stuffed into the front of her containment suit to simulate a belly; a little white lie to make this scheme work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-by all means,\" Liara gasped, waving towards the treadmill. \"More use out of it...then I'm getting...\" She grabbed a handful of her fat with a forlorn expression, feeling more like an obese slob then usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, ninety percent of people who are in your position give up at this point,\" the engineering student said encouragingly. \"You should be proud of hanging in there and trying to stay fit!\" Cheap line, but it worked like a charm on Liara, who hadn't received much in terms of positive encouragement from anyone, and it coming from a fellow chubby student who knew what it was like to try and lose weight certainly helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks,\" Liara said. \"Uh...I'm Liara, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali, nice to meet you,\" the engineering student said brightly. \"You want to keep at it for a few more minutes then grab a bite to eat? I know a nice cafe at the edge of campus, has a really healthy seafood menu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds wonderful,\" Liara said, basking in the glow of a new friendship with her new diet buddy. Catching her second wind, she got back onto the treadmill and started at it again, huffing and puffing as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her scheme to fatten Liara up properly was getting hijacked, Miranda over at the juice bar slaved over what was the most calorie-laden drink to force on the blubbery blue alien. Setting aside her own perfectly healthy smoothie, she went to work at the drink machine, picking and choosing the best, or least healthy, addons for her calorie atom bomb of a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so deadset on this task that she was only barely aware of someone behind her getting close to her drink. Turning around sharply, she caught sight of a very familiar leather jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are YOU doing here, Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punk turned to look at the cheerleader, her hands flying back into her pockets. Grinning, she decided to goad the cheerleader on, giving the little surprise in her drink the chance to dissolve and vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you,\" the punk said coolly. \"Sorry, I saw that massive ass from across the room and wondered who let the cow in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader scoffed. \"That's your best one? Are your insults always this <i>flat</i>?\" She emphasized that last word while leaning forward and squeezing her arms together to press her cleavage outwards, a move that the punk almost certainly couldn't pull off. Ouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basic fuckin' bitch...\" Jack muttered, signalling she was backing off, much to the disappointment of the onlookers. The two of them had a rivalry that was pretty legendary on campus, sparked off, if rumors are to be believed, by a romantic tryst that went awry, making their animosity especially juicy to a gossip-hungry campus. It was the highlight of anyone's day to see them go at it like that and a profound disappointment when the shooting stopped early. The show would need to wait though; Jack's plan to avenge the porky Asari...</span></div></div>",

Shivering, she turned around in fury to see Miranda coyly smiling, the cup with the spiked drink completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops,\" Miranda said in an oily, false sincerity tone. \"Sorry, my hand slipped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold shock and the realization of the plan backfiring was the only thing that stopped Jack from screeching like a banshee and knocking the teeth out of the cheerleader's smug little grin right then and there. Seething, she watched Miranda turn on her heel and trounce off past her, and was about to do something stupid when karma decided to make her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling smugly superior, Miranda stepped right into the puddle left by the drink and her feet suddenly gave way. Letting out a screech, she pitched forward right over a rack of weights, which collapsed with a series of bangs as she toppled to the ground, finally ending with a sickening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>crack</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked up from the tangled mess of weights and racks she was caught in, her face turning pale and her eyes widening in terror. Jack dashed over, and saw her leg sticking out an odd angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think it's broken!\" Miranda whimpered, tears filling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn't help but smile. \"Whoops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Miranda could kill with a glare, that would have done Jack in for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that disaster was happening, Tali was busy guiding Liara back to the skinny side with actual diet advice and workout routines, including the nice healthy walk to the cafe, when in the midst of their conversation, karma decided to strike as well, only in favor of the pudgy Asari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, are you Liara? LIara T'Soni?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara froze, deathly afraid of turning around. She was starting to dread meeting people who already knew her nowadays, because of how much weight she managed to pack on. She'd met a few old friends who knew her from her skinny days, and the way their eyes always traveled to that pooching belly with a look of distaste...well, they didn't feel like friends afterwards, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she felt a gentle hand on her shoulder, and turned around instinctively. \"Y-yes that's me,\" she choked out. \"Who are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that a choir of angels singing? Or was that just in her head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe openly stared at the stranger who said her name, which was fine because she was being stared at as well. Tall and athletic, bright-red hair falling down to her shoulders, freckles decorating her cheeks, and...just the prettiest eyes. Suddenly Miranda and her smoking hot body looked like a barbie doll compared to this...angel. She didn't even reach down to tug her shirt more securely over her bulging belly, she was so smitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi...\" the angel said. \"Uh...I'm Jane. Jane Shepard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara T'Soni,\" Liara squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told you were my roommate this semester...I just transferred,\" Shepard explained, letting out a light giggle that made Liara's heart soar. \"I didn't think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords seem to fail the two of them as they looked into each other's eyes. Tali, standing off to the side, could tell exactly what was going on and stepped back to let the magic happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could...you...uh, show me around?\" Shepard asked at last. \"Then...maybe we can get dinner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara smiled. \"I'd...love that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali almost wanted to let out a little squee as the two walked off, seemingly unaware that they started holding hands. It wasn't exactly what she had in mind, but it'd work to keep the Asari away from the cheerleader that wished her ill. All's well that ends well, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood there swaying on the spot, no doubt the affection between the new girl and Liara reminding her of her feelings for her own boyfriend, Jack traipsed up looking especially pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not BELIEVE what happened!\" the two girls told each other at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara wouldn't care much about her saviors, or the cheerleader who tried to help her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option A:</b> Liara's lovestruck, and she works hard to lose the weight to look good for her new girlfriend, while her new girlfriend picks up some of her old eating habits and heads in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option B:</b> They say you put on weight when you're in love, and these two are very, very much in love...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option C:</b> Actually, how is our favorite cheerleader dealing with being benched?</span></div></div>",

She leaned against the hand-rail and popped open her water bottle to gulp down a generous helping. Letting out a little gasp of breath when she finished, she looked over to see Tali struggling a bit with the straw on her own bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a hand with that?\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I got it. Stubborn induction port...\" Tali at last managed to get the port working and took a live-giving draught of water, head hanging back in relief. \"Ooh, I hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good hurt though,\" Liara pointed out, lifting up her workout shirt to air out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're holding up well, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara grinned. \"I've never been better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reason to doubt that, Tali thought to herself. Ever since they became workout buddies (Tali had ditched the pillow she used to give herself a paunch after a while), Liara had been making some great progress. She was still fat of course, probably because her diet of donuts and greasy fast food hadn't changed all that much, but thanks to regular exercise some of that fat seemed to have been replaced with muscle instead. On the surface she hadn't changed all that much, still possessing the same big belly, meaty thighs, and double chin as before, but she definitely carried it better now, moving quicker and losing her breath far less often then before. She wasn't really getting thinner, but she was definitely getting healthier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali wanted to parade the steadily improving Asari in front of that racist cheerleader, but sadly she hadn't really been seen that much since breaking her leg a few weeks back. Probably for the best, she reasoned, to cut out the toxic people and replace them with better ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara had a jump on that already. Wiping sweat off the bridge of her nose, she opened her eyes and immediately her face lit up in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girl smiled as she approached the two of them, a tray of smoothies in hand. \"Hey there, blueberry,\" Shepard said sweetly. \"Got you and your friend a treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Tali said as Shepard offered her a purple fruit smoothie. \"I owe you one, Shepard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you two can call me Jane, right?\" Shepard laughed. \"You make it sound like I'm in the army or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Shep-...Jane,\" Liara said, taking her own blue smoothie. \"Force of habit I guess.\" Shepard laughed, taking her own red smoothie and leaning forward to surprise her girlfriend with a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop it!\" Liara squeaked, breaking into happy giggles. \"I'm all s-sweaty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help it, you look good,\" Shepard teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look fat,\" Liara mumbled in response, only to giggle again as Jane jabbed a finger into her fleshy flank. \"Like a big tub of goo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naaaah, you're just plush, like a big stuffed animal,\" Jane teased. \"I could cuddle up next to you and fall asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh m-my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tali watched the two break out in lovestruck giggles, she couldn't help but notice that Liara wasn't the only 'plush' one in the relationship. Looking at Shepard, only a few weeks in and the freshman fifteen had claimed another victim and then some. Maybe some of Liara's unhealthy eating habits had rubbed of on the new student, because Shepard was looking particularly plump nowadays, her once thin figure dominated by a prominent bulge around her middle and a new width to her hips. She wasn't fat yet, just exceptionally curvy, but seeing how she sucked down her smoothie, probably not the same healthy mix that the two gym buddies had, it was clear that if she wasn't careful those curves might get a little too curvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that that really mattered to the two girls getting closer and closer as Tali looked on, of course. Even if that initial dumbstruck infatuation had worn off, the two still had a certain spark going on, a spark that was settling into a true and proper relationship. Sure it made Tali feel like a third wheel when they started kissing in front of her and saying cute little nothings, but really the Quarian wasn't too upset. After almost getting duped by that cheerleader and having a rather miserable time at this human university, she deserved this bit of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, seeing those two go at it made her feel a little...amorous. Watching them kiss and hug each other like that, the cute little pet names, the way they looked at each other, it made her want to do that too...just with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddamn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping out her phone, Tali took a deep breath and punched out a text message, one she pined over for months on end since she was partnered with him that one time in Engineering Theory. She hesitated over the send button, wondering she was going to do this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Liara, not in public!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sent: <span class=\"cviolet\">Hey, do you want to go get dinner tonight?</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the text for what felt like hours, days on end. Then, a few spinning circles sent her heart fluttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Recieved: <span class=\"clblue\">hmm I have some calibration hw to work on...</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart felt like it was about to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Recieved: <span class=\"clblue\">eh, it can wait. Meet @ front entrance?</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what she's so happy about?\" Liara asked Shepard as she watched Tali suddenly shriek in delight and run out of the gym.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't too long before the relentlessly cold winters of Chicago finally retreated, paving the way for warmer weather. The trees and the flowers began to blossom in earnest as sweaters and mittens were stored in favor of shorts and flip flops, and as the last few piles of dirty snow began to fade away, there was one thing on the mind of most students at U of C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpring break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor two whole weeks the beaches and resorts would be swarmed by reveling college students having one last hurrah before returning to the boring doldrums of pre-final schooling, while other students planned to use the time to chill out and relax, or perhaps catch up on school work they may have missed out on the last few months. Jane and Liara, being excellent students who were a bit too geeky to really get into the hedonistic slams that made up spring break, had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I've never been to Europe before!\" Jane exclaimed as the monorail glided to a smooth stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara looked up from the data-pad she was reading and raised an eyebrow. \"But..you live on this planet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, in a slum over in Jersey,\" Jane laughed. \"I couldn't afford to go to Nova York, let alone here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara titled her head, unable to comprehend how humans could let one another live in such conditions, but Jane didn't seem to notice. The pair of them unbuckled and the human leapt from the seat, her belly flopping down over her thighs as she waddled towards the exit doors to the car, Liara waddling close behind. Suitcases in hand, the two made their exit from the train car, herded towards a ticket barrier leading to the glossy, hi-tech city beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Brussels,\" a bright-orange VI announced as Liara and Jane flashed ID badges to check out. \"You two must be together,\" it said after a moment to run through its limited collection of tinned phrases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we are,\" Jane said, taking hold of Liara's hand and pulling her closer, their tummies smooshed up against one another. Maybe it was just Liara's imagination, but Jane seemed to be quite fond of pulling off that move lately, ever since her curves finally did what they threatened to do and overtook her formerly skinny body, gifting her with a decent-sized paunch and nice plump legs, not quite as plump as Liara's thighs and butt, but pretty close. In fact, if Liara had to guess, combined with her own slight weight loss, the two probably each weighed close to two thirty or so, hence the comment from the VI about them being together. They were, after all, similarly chubby, even if Jane carried a little extra on her belly and chest, probably somewhere over two hundred or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting past the barrier, Jane looked over the city scape, excitement etched on her face as she tugged her shirt down to cover her tummy, while Liara quickly checked a map feature on her datapad. \"I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get peckish,\" Jane commented. \"Wonder what there is around here to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My auntie has dinner prepared for us, actually,\" Liara reminded her, leading the way down the street. \"Her place isn't too far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, right! Almost forgot,\" Jane laughed. \"I'm surprised you have family here of all places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't all that surprising honestly, given her complicated family life. Suedra, as far as she knew, was her mother's only living sister, and the two could not have been more different. She was far younger for starters, closer to Liara's age then her mother's in fact, and an awful lot warmer too, regularly sending letters and correspondence to check up on her as opposed to her own mother calling one time to make sure her grades were up to par before spring break. It didn't shock Liara that the two didn't have a lot of kind words for one another, and had a very distinct memory of a bitter argument the two got into over her, giving her the slightest hope that maybe she could have moved out of her nasty mother's house. That didn't parse out sadly, but her aunt fighting on her behalf was something that stuck with her a long time, even after Suedra got promoted and moved to Earth as a liaison for an Illium-based Asari corporation. Needless to say, when she was sent two tickets to Brussels and an invitation to stay over Spring Break, Liara was more then happy to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gonna be okay with me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" Liara asked, somewhat lost in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your aunt,\" Jane repeated. \"She's not gonna have a problem with us, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it, she's married to a human,\" Liara chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, duh,\" Jane said sheepishly. \"Sorry...I was worried that your family wouldn't approve, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to worry, my auntie loves everyone,\" Liara reassured her. \"Maybe a bit too much sometimes, but you'll get along fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by a bit too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a spring in her step, Liara bounded up to the fancy brick house flush with the others on either side, a large bright-blue door clashing against the dull red brickwork around it. She knocked twice, and a shuffling sound came from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie, it's me!\" Liara called out happily as Jane caught up to her, a half-step behind. Barely a few seconds afterward, the door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omygosh, Liara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie Suedra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically squeeing, Liara threw herself forward into a massive hug with...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"My goodness, you've grown!\" Suedra said as she broke apart from the hug with her niece. \"College has been treating you well, I see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it has,\" Liara admitted, a hand jumping to her pronounced tummy. \"Oh, Auntie Suedra, this is my girlfriend, Jane Shepard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're the one whose dating my beloved niece!\" Suedra declared, rounding on Shepard. \"I hope you're treating my precious niece like a princess, missy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Jane stammered out before the older Asari burst out laughing, the gut hanging a foot past her waist bouncing with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm joking, c'mere you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane gasped as the heavyset Asari pulled her into a great big hug with her thick arms, giving a tight little squeeze before letting her go. She hadn't expected all this bodacious blue alien all at once, and it left her a bit flustered. 'Auntie Suedra' definitely bore a resemblance to her younger niece, especially in the weight department. Wide and soft, her hips and thighs stuffed into tight summer shorts that left little to the imagination, jiggled at the slightest movement, and her plump face always had a big smile on it, matching the curve of her double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't have you darkening my doorframe all day, come on inside! Ami is just getting dinner finished up, your timing is perfect!\" Suedra declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriven by empty stomachs craving a home-cooked meal, the two college kids obeyed, squeezing past the plump aunt as she held the door open for them. Dropping her suitcase next to Liara's at the door, Jane took a moment to breath, catching the faintest hint of cinnamon and pine in the air, and take a look around the house. It was actually quite lively, with abstract paintings in exotic colors mixed with old movie posters from class human and Asari films decorating the walls and alien plants occupying the corners, adding vibrant blues and reds to the room. Jane had been bracing for something stuffy and boring or alien and weird, and much to her surprise, Liara's aunt's house was actually pretty cool. There was even a big screen TV around the corner and what looked like a few game consoles sitting underneath. Score!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane made a beeline to the TV and caught sight of a picture hanging prominently on the wall opposite, depicting an Asari and an olive-skinned human woman in a shawl, both wearing shockingly purple dresses and smiling; it took her a second to realize that the Asari was in fact Liara's aunt, looking unhealthily thin but practically glowing in this picture. Was it a wedding photo? Suedra did seem the type to wear an unusual color to her own wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girls, get it while it's hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, food! Jane detoured back and followed the sounds of Liara squeeing to the kitchen, where...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly cow, what a spread!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was dumbstruck by the bounty laid out on the large dining room table over top a fancy purple tablecloth; glazed ham, baked potatoes, a big turkey, steaks, corn on the cob...Shepard hadn't even finished seeing everything occupying the table when the smell hit her, and...had she died and gone to heaven? The roaring of her chubby belly seemed to suggest that, because all of it smelled utterly divine, and it took every ounce of willpower she had not to just dive in and start digging through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her eyes away from the spread, Jane looked over and saw Liara breaking off from a hug with a very fat woman, bigger even then her Asari aunt. Hiking her yoga shorts over the monumental rear end that stuck out the back of her like a shelf, she turned to face Jane and started waddling over, swinging her heavy arms as she went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Jane, Liara's told us all about you!\" the woman said brightly, if a little out of breath, as she pulled up a chair for the younger girl. \"I'm her other aunt, you can call me Ami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Jane said politely, taking a seat and finally recognizing her as the other woman in the picture, bloated and fattened almost beyond recognition. Honestly though, if the food she made was as good as it looked and smelled, Jane could absolutely understand how she got that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks incredible, Auntie!\" Liara said, taking her seat next to her girlfriend and starting to pile her plate full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was nothing,\" Ami said, waving a thick hand dismissively. \"Just a lil something to welcome you two to our home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't remember the last time you came here, of course,\" Suedra said, passing Shepard a delectable looking ham. \"What have you been up to since I last saw you? My sister's not bullying you around anymore, is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane would make light conversation when prompted of course, but for the next hour or so she was focused on one thing and one thing only after she had that first taste. It didn't taste as good as it smelled and looked, it was in fact even better then that. The human soon found herself wolfing down meats and cheeses and veggies and all sorts of delectables. Polishing off her second or third helping, she leaned back, rubbing her bloating stomach tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\" she murmured. \"This stuff is good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if you like that, try the shepherd's pie,\" Ami piped in. \"I had a similar seasoning, I bet you'll enjoy it too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did, very much so. In fact, she got two helpings. Then a third, then a fourth. Her belly gave a little whine in protest as her pants began to painfully tighten around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jane, try this!\" Suedra insisted, pushing a goulash towards her. \"It's a delicacy from where you live, Liara suggested it.\" Catching a super familiar scent, Jane scooped a generous helping onto her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This steak is wonderful!\" Liara said. \"Jane, try a bit, it's so savoury!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, you'll like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, try this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jane, have you tasted this? Here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's stomach started to lurch with every successive 'sample' given to her. Reaching down, she realized that at some point the button on her jeans had burst, never to be seen again until Suedra was vacuuming and found it in the corner weeks later. Still she kept sampling, and tasting, and eating, until at last the table was bare, and the four girls reclined lazily, stroking bellies stuffed taut. Liara and Jane were especially affected, looking almost completely spherical around the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think...I'm gonna...hic...pop...\" Liara wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't...take much more...\" Jane agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you ladies,\" Suedra piped in. \"But I could go for some dessert. How about some blueberry pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane moaned in agony. She LOVED blueberry pie. As someone put a thick slice in front of her, bathed in whipped cream. At least, she consoled herself as she reached out for it, every meal here won't be like this, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't really anyone's fault. In the end, it was just inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was so happy to see her aunt, the one person she could call family that cared about her in turn, that her regular workout schedule slipped. Jane had no such workout schedule, but was so enamored by the city and taken in by how nice Liara's family was that she was just as distracted as Liara was from the sheer volume of food they were eating. And Liara's aunts were so happy to meet their niece and her cute girlfriend that they happily overfed the two. Again, it wasn't really their fault; Ami's family were all chefs with big appetites, and Suedra took after her niece, being a chubby child with a sweet tooth who was forced onto a crash diet by her strict elder sister. Ever since they got married and didn't feel the need to keep perfect supermodel thin bodies, eating this much had just become natural to them. Normal, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so much for the two college girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn, this level is hard, why can't I just-\" <i>*urp*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane placed a hand over her mouth, turning slightly pink at the cute little burp that escaped her. Groaning, her bloated belly gargled angrily as it hurried to digest a heavy lunch before a goodbye feast in a couple hours. It was sadly their last day in Brussels, and having seen most of the sights by now, Jane decided she deserved a lazy afternoon spent tackling this unfair adventure game. Fingers working the controls furiously, she slouched down in the big fluffy sofa, occasionally puffing her cheeks out as she stifled more belches and burps. She didn't want to look like a total gross slob when she was staying at her girlfriend's aunt's place, even if they had grown rather close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane had to admit though, grown was the right word. Maybe she could have excused herself as being curvy or voluptuous before now, but after two weeks of excessive feasting, she finally thought to step on the creaky disused bathroom scale in the guest room, and was kind of perturbed at the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hundred or so could be curvy or heavyset at the very least. Three hundred and five? That's fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd knowing that, it was hard not to feel fat. Jane became acutely aware of how far and heavy her belly hung, even when she wasn't stuffed to the gills, and she could feel her ballooning thighs brushing against one another as she walked sluggishly from place to place. Her last trip out a couple days ago had been to pick up some new clothes, and yet her brand new polo left a sliver of her pale stomach out in the cold. Part of that may have just been her breasts (which, much to her delight, had blossomed into full, if flabby, D cups!), but the way the sleeves cut into her arms suggested otherwise. It was impossible to ignore even the small things, like how she took up more space on the couch, almost a whole cushion, or how the bed was starting to feel cramped with Liara beside her, or even just the gentle creaking of her footsteps growing louder. It was like she became a different person in just a few weeks; she certainly wouldn't have recognized the face staring back at her a month ago, now adorned with a thick healthy double chin and puffed cheeks. And Suedra had suggested that they come back over the SUMMER? Yeah, maybe if she wanted to be rolled down the street and onto a flatbed when she went home again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she thought about that shepherd's pie Ami made for her, and her mouth began to water. Luckily before she could get the chance to sneak off and gorge on leftovers, heavy breathing and footsteps echoed from the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey, Li,\" Jane called out as Liara came up behind and around the sofa. \"Want to double up on this and beat this guy?\" Liara didn't response, dropping down on the couch with a heavy thud. Not surprising, considering Liara had not been spared the effects of her Aunt's cooking either; she was back at the weight she was when Jane first met her and then some, her belly spilling out into her lap once again, flanked by wide hips that overflowed one section of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara?\" Jane asked again. The Asari said nothing, so Jane paused and looked over, seeing her sitting in an old pair of sweatpants, her belly button proudly displayed under a rolled-up shirt. The hands sinking into her puffy arms were trembling, and, much to Shepard's horror, tears were streaking down her fat cheeks. \"What's wrong?\" Jane pushed, placing a hand on her shoulder. Liara looked up at her at last, her voice scratchy and weak just like her eyes were red and sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go back to UC,\" she said. \"Mother has...cancelled my courses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked and felt like she got punched in the stomach hard. Blinking, she stammered out a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh..what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She found a photo on social media, of us at the Atomium sculpture,\" Liara explained. \"She...she's bringing me back home, to be put on a strict diet.\" She dropped her head into her hands as Jane leapt up, her fury propelling her fat body with surprising speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE CAN'T DO THAT!\" Jane shouted. \"You're a fucking adult, you have RIGHTS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara shook her head. \"I do, but I can only stay if I'm enrolled. She has the finances controlled. She pulls her funding, cancels my scholarship, I get expelled when I can't pay.\" She let out a wretched sob. \"I'm...I'm done for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <b><i>bitch!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls were so distraught and emotional that they didn't hear Auntie Suedra approaching, her eyes glowing with biotic energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie Suedra, I-I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT getting expelled,\" her aunt continued. \"I'm covering your costs, I'll pull every favor on Illium if I have to. I'll be damned if I let that woman rule over you like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're past the middle of the month,\" Shepard realized with dawning horror. \"Billing should have already kicked in, and if the payment's cancelled-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm expelled outright,\" Liara concluded sadly. Suedra didn't seem fazed, only more resolute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm making some calls,\" she said. \"By the Goddess, I'm not letting that witch control your life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>An Angel Watching Over Me:</b> Liara, somehow, is saved from expulsion! But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A Devil At My Back:</b> Benezia's machinations succeed, and Liara is expelled. But she's not going back home without a fight.</span></div></div>",

You too Jane, I'm sure you must be upset too.\" She smiled widely as Liara, even in her intense anxious sadness, eagerly dug in, followed up by her girlfriend. Jane was right, it did feel better to get something in her stomach. Eating made everything feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh? Well, okay then, you have my information, set it up right away,\" Suedra finished up. \"Goodbye.\" Snapping her phone shut, she turned to the trio on the couch, positively glowing. Liara stared blankly as her aunt clapped a hand on her shoulder. \"Liara, you're not going anywhere,\" Suedra announced. \"Your finances are in MY hands now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a move almost as exuberant as Shepard jumping up in rage, Liara propelled herself out from between her fat girlfriend and enormous aunt to leap onto her Auntie with a shriek of relieved joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygodessthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou... 34; Liara stuttered out, tears of joy streaming down her fat cheeks again as she wrapped her arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the goddess, don't crush me before I can arrange the payment,\" Suedra wheezed, the wind knocked out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you managed to get the first payment waived?\" Shepard asked, disbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't need to! It was already covered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer just left the two girls confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your mother made a mistake,\" Ami suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she definitely cancelled that payment,\" Liara said. \"Someone...must have covered it themselves. But who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, just so you're sure, there won't be a refund after this point in the semester, Miss T'Soni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Just cancel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timid administrator cowered under the icy gaze of Matriarch Benezia, cold and severe as ever, and no less elegant and refined. It was like dealing with a queen that had a penchant for decapitations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, it's done,\" the wormy little man announced. \"I'll..send the notice to enrollment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'll be back to collect my daughter and get her away from this hovel,\" she sneered. \"Good day.\" Without another word, she stood up and walked out of the office, leaving everyone in the room a little bit more at ease. Except for one person, who just happened to be nearby waiting to ask about a schedule change. Mumbling under his breath, the administrator went to go refill his coffee to sooth his nerves as someone tottered up to the desk, hampered by a stiff cast on her leg, peering over to make sure the wormy man wasn't in sight of the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda Lawson smiled, slipping behind the desk and opening up the file the administrator just closed. \"Liara T'Soni,\" she whispered, going over the details of what she just saw, feeling disgusted at the idea of someone else being controlled by their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miranda pulling out her fancy platinum credit card was a different Miranda then the one who plotted to humiliate the same alien months ago. Part of that was the freshman fifteen that finally caught her four years later thanks to her broken leg, giving her a pudgy tummy and a plump little chin, to say nothing of the healthy inches added to her flabby butt and hips. It was a devastating injury, insuring she wouldn't be cheer captain for the rest of the year, and no doubt led to the depression eating that gave her the added pounds, but being away from her racist, jerkoff 'friends' on cheer squad helped her to realize how awful she had been to people, many of whom mocked and teased her relentlessly over the injury. The final straw was when her friends even started to bully her over her weight gain, but while others would have broken down and fallen into the hole, Miranda was too good for that. Instead, she swore then and there to be a better person, and while she was nowhere near that point, maybe this favor for someone she had hateful thoughts towards would be a good place to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, a better, fatter Miranda covered the payment that would have gotten Liara expelled, forwarding the \"changed\" results to admissions before hobbling off to safety, shutting the office door behind her. She couldn't help but smile at her little misdeed, done in the name of something good for once. After being a superstar student for so long, it felt good to do something a little bad. Technically it was her second, since her human supremacist father wouldn't have liked the girl sitting on a bench outside, waiting for her to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That look,\" the sharply-dressed Asari said. \"You did something bad, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaybe,\" Miranda said teasingly. Her new girlfriend chuckled darkly before pulling her into a deep, sensual kiss, which Miranda responded to with vigor, letting out soft moans as her girlfriend's hand caressed the curve of her stomach.. Breaking apart, the Asari leaned in and whispered something into Miranda's ear that made her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we have class soon?\" Miranda pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were a bad girl,\" the Asari teased. \"Come on, let's have some fun~\" The two of them giggled as they made their way, hand in hand, towards the dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure you study hard, Miss T'Loak,\" Miranda said, mocking the tone of their business studies professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I will,\" Aria said suggestively. \"I have a <i>very</i> good study partner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, Miranda thought as her door drew tantalizingly close, this beat the hell out of cheer practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, with a bit of help from someone with a change of heart, Liara was going to stay in college after all! And with Spring Break coming to a close, it's time to look to the future, and what that may entail. The semester is coming to a close, and it's time to plan for the summer! What are our portly freshmen going to get up to on their vacation?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the scare of Liara getting kicked out was past, finals week was practically smooth sailing for the couple. The classes were pretty easy for Jane, and Liara seemed to be pushing herself in her studies out of spite, reaching for the highest marks she could just to show her mother that she was wrong about her. Soon enough, the school collectively set their proverbial pencils down, and Jane walked away with decent marks and Liara proudly sported 100's and 105's across the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for a well-deserved break. And this break was what made Jane really nervous. Yes, she did want to see Liara's aunts again, and yes she adored their culinary abilities, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come oooon, we're gonna be late!\" Liara said cheerily, pulling Shepard out the front of campus by the hand. \"You're gonna love it, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane forced a smile, but her eyes drifted to the gentle wobble of her girlfriend's belly...as well as the wobble of her own. It had been a small miracle that they managed to get through finals without getting any heftier, but they only got this hefty because of less than a month spent at her Aunt's place. Give it two months and change, and Jane would be lucky if she was able to be rolled out the front door. Hopefully, this 'surprise' Liara was so excited about involved an exercise bike, or hell just a light jog every once in a while, before she popped like a balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane felt her girlfriend tug a little harder on her hand and looked up, surprised to see Suedra already waiting next to a rather fancy skycar, drawing confused and jealous stares from the other students flooding out the campus gates. She gave a friendly wave as Liara dived into her arms for a hug, bring Shepard in with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AUNTIE!\" she squealed in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lia-whoah!\" Suedra said with a start and then a laugh as the two three hundred pound freshman bounced into her. \"Great to see you again. How were finals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece of cake,\" Jane reported. Mmm cake, she thought to herself before shaking off the feeling. She wasn't such a fatass that she got distracted by food references that easily. Not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My professor said I aced most of the material!\" Liara said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't surprise me in the least,\" Suedra said proudly, kissing her on the forehead. \"Now, I believe we have a tour to plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tour?\" Jane asked, prompting a confused look from Liara's aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right she wanted to surprise you!\" Suedra realized, reaching into the pocket of her dress. \"Well, with Ami away on business this summer, I thought it'd be fun if we three went on a little trek across the planet, seeing all the sights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's mouth dropped open. \"Wha....really? <i>A world tour?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it exciting?\" Liara said brightly. \"We'll be able to really explore your homeworld and see all the different cultures and places!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuedra removed three tickets from her pocket, handing one to each of the girls. \"These will be our passes; we can go anywhere anytime we want to from now until you two need to get back to UC.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was so shocked and touched by this that she was in tears. Growing up in a poor backwater, she had always wanted to escape from that wretched hovel she called home, to see the world around her or even the galaxy. It was smaller scale then she would have liked, sure, but that didn't matter. She'd finally get to explore the place she called home, and her heart surged with affection for Liara's aunt for getting this together, to say nothing of how she felt towards her little blueberry girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be a summer to remember girls,\" Suedra said dreamily. \"Just imagine...all the exotic cuisine we can sample!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's blankly happy face faltered ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...how much are we talking here?\" she asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as you want, of course!\" Liara said. \"I don't know about you, but I want to try EVERYTHING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane forced a smile again. O-okay, bit of a snag sure, but...she was going to see the world! It was so exciting! And sampling a lot of great food was part of that! She could manage a few cheat days no problem, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, me too!\" Suedra said brightly. \"Ami made me promise to sample as much as I could for her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane kept smiling as she was pulled into another hug, hoping that when this was over she wouldn't need to be rolled off the plane.</span></div></div>",

Liara had picked up on Earth's culinary delights after the end of the war, mostly because she enjoyed much of it Shepard, right before, um, *ahem*, 'embracing eternity.' *wink* Fine steaks, seafood, desserts and wines would always find themselves in the kitchen, and the tummy of the Shadow Broker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So it also comes as no surprise that said tummy is not the size it used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Goddess, would you just fasten already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Our blue-skinned beauty is just now starting to realize this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh, you insufferable- It wasn't this hard to clasp this jacket yesterday! Was it?\" Liara spoke to no one in particular. \"I would say these shrunk in the wash, but I haven't washed this...\" What she didn't realize, or, rather, what she didn't WANT to realize, was that her jacket was the same size, and it fit her perfectly; about 10 pounds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Pushing itself out from Liara's torso was a small little pooch of a tummy, snug as a bug in her already skintight suit. It was just big enough, however, that her jacket didn't want to comply. It was her favorite one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Fine, I'll go without it\" Liara huffed as she walked out of her closet into her quarters. To say it was a huge bedroom would be underselling it. It was ENOURMOUS! A king sized bed, a huge couch and gigantic, top-of-the-line television, A FRIGGIN' HOT TUB, and those are just the MODEST things in there. Not to mention the small pantry and refridgerator for her 'light snacks', consisting of chips and candy of all sorts, crackers and entire sticks of salami, just to name a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Is it really any wonder she has gained weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Stepping out of her quarters and into the ops center, Liara noticed her breakfast waiting for her on her desk, like it always was. Her assistant, an Asari named Dahlia, was always punctual when it came to her meals, and she was a nice youngling; only 87 years old. She was a little on the chubby side, though, but Liara figured they could get her on a nice weight loss regimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Liara sat herself down at her desk, her small pooch pushing the white and blue outfit to it's limit, unbeknownst to it's owner. Liara sat herself up to her computer monitor, checking the influx of emails from her associates. As she opened up the first one, however, a familiar clicking of footsteps approached her. Looking past the monitor, Liara saw the pudgy form of Dahlia walking towards her, carrying a medium-sized box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"My apologies, Miss T'soni,\" she started in her always timid voice, \"but I forgot to bring this to you, it just came in this morning, and the courier said it was extremely important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You made sure and had it scanned, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Of course, Ma'am,\" Dahlia continued, bowing her head slightly, \"negative on explosives, dangerous chemicals, poisons, dangerous creatures and superweapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Liara cocked a brow at her assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"A-And, very small lifeforms here to assassinate you!\" Dahlia squeaked swiftly. When the Shadow Broker gave her that look, she was telling Dahlia she wasn't on her A-game; she got that look a lot, and learned to fear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Alright,\" Liara chuckled, amused at her assistant's reaction, \"Thank you, Dahlia.\" Liara smiled as Dahlia bowed her head and turned to leave. Liara's eyes lay planted on the rear of her assistant, the skintight black uniform her staff wore leaving nothing to the imagination. Each cheek seemed to be made of Jell-O, an Earthly delicacy, and every step she took shook and jiggled them like an earthquake was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   'I'm going to get her in shape one of these days,' Liara thought to herself, unaware how hypocritical she was being. She pondered on how she was going to get her assistant fit, all the while, the image of her jiggling, plump rear end in her mind. Her daydreaming and scheming were cut short when she remembered the package she was just given. She reached across her desk to pick up the small object, a cuboidal piece of metal, about a cubic foot in size. A small button was on the side, perfectly clean, except for a small smudge. 'My security team already opened it, ' she thought, 'at least I know I won't blow up when I open it.' She pushed her monitor slightly out of the way and set the box down. A tentative blue finger brushed over the button. 'It could still be a bomb, designed to go of when my fingerprint presses the button, but there wasn't any explosives...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, Goddess be with me.\" Liara quickly pressed the button, and watched as four triangular flaps lifted up and folded to the side, leaving the contents of the package open to the world.

This was your \u2018important package\u2019,\u201d throwing up air quotes with her hands for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahlia started at the treats for a moment, then back to the Shadow Broker. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, Dahlia, but an unmarked box from an unknown sender with food of questionable origin is going to do nothing but raise suspicion... although,\u201d she eyed the one donut she\u2019d removed from the box, \u201cthey do look quite good.\u201d Though she wouldn\u2019t like to admit it, her mouth had been watering for quite awhile, as she had yet to dig into her warm breakfast, and these WOULD make a nice addition...</span></div></div>",

I see no reason for letting these go to waste,\u201d Liara says, a cartoonish line of drool streaming from her mouth, and stars in her eyes, \u201cAs long as security isn\u2019t slacking on me.\u201d This thought gives Liara a second for pause. \u201cDahlia, have medical on standby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Miss T\u2019soni,\u201d Dahlia says as she pulls out her Omni-Tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara gives the donut one final once over, before decided on a bite on the sprinkled side. She brings it up to her lips and bites down, preparing for the worst and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it\u2019s delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Goddess...\u201d Liara moans through her bite of donut, waves of flavor and joy passing through her. \u201cThis may one of the greatest things I\u2019ve ever tasted Dahlia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of relief passes over the younger Asari as she holsters her Omni-Tool. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s to your satisfaction, Miss T\u2019soni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSatisfaction is an understatement,\u201d Liara says as she goes for another bite, relishing the flavor even more. It had been awhile since Dahlia had seen such a jubilant expression on the Shadow Broker\u2019s face, she had always been so stoic and collected, given her position, though this side of her superior was a pleasure to see, though, now that the possible threat had subsided, she kinda wanted to try a donut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer her prayers, as Liara finished her donut, she offered one to her assistant, a similar chocolate pastry, but with red sprinkles. A look of utter joy passed over Dahlia\u2019s face as she took the chocolatey delight from Liara and took a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPure. Bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahlia could only assume that this feeling was second only to an embrace of eternity, if not, surpassing it. The rest was gone in mere moments as Liara followed suit, finishing off her second donut and reaching for a third. Dahlia was now the one to follow as she reached into the box for a second, but was met by a sharp glare from the Shadow Broker, who Dahlia remembered in that moment was her superior, and her timidity took the reigns once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry Miss, I uh, mean Shadow Broker, I-I mean ma\u2019am, I-I shouldn\u2019t have assumed, that was totally, uh I mean, completely, uhhh...\u201d The poor Asari looked like she could break down in tears. Luckily for her, Liara was not AS bad as the Yahg who had preceded her, and liked to get a few licks in on her assistant. She chuckled at Dahlia\u2019s reaction and gestures for her to help herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahlia felt faint. A donut would help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed and soon the box was empty, save for a few crumbs and traces of chocolate. Both Asari looked completely content with everything in life, bellies full of heaven. Liara had even completely forgotten about her breakfast, as this had taken precedence over anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoddess...\u201d Liara was finally able to mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right, Miss T\u2019soni,\u201d Dahlia added, \u201cshe must be the only one who can makes such delectable pieces of pure amazingness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more, Dahlia,\u201d Liara said, patting her full tummy, not noticing that it was bigger than it was just an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even... still growing slightly bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an alarm rang from Liara\u2019s desk, bringing both Asari back to an alert state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no no no no I\u2019ve lost track of time, that\u2019s one of my agents,\u201d Liara fixed everything on her desk and moved the now empty box out of the way. She took a second to compose herself before turning to her assistant \u201cThank you, Dahlia, you may go now.\u201d Dahlia, understanding she can\u2019t be around during her meetings with clients or agents, turns to take her leave, but the Shadow Broker stops her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDahlia? Let me know if we receive any more strange packages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Miss T\u2019soni,\u201d Dahlia replies, before trotting away. Before Liara can answer her call, her eyes can\u2019t help but be drawn to the plump figure of her assistant once more. Dahlia\u2019s ass was nothing short of huge, as Liara had noted many times before, the big blue cheeks of the young Asari testing the limits of the black uniform, but... Liara could have sworn it looked tighter than it did earlier. And her butt didn\u2019t jiggle that much, did it? And... was that a new roll of back fat she saw? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany questions flooded her mind, but they were all soon drowned out by the incessant ringing from her console. Finally, she answered, and took on her full persona of the Shadow Broker. Though, as she did, she was unaware of the affects that the donuts had placed upon her. Her love handles had softened, her thighs and butt thickened, all around her figured had grown slightly, making everything she wore go from tight to uncomfortably tight, a discomfort she had noted throughout her call, though she had attributed this to her larger than average breakfast. Once this call ended, she\u2019d thought, she\u2019d have to go get some looser clothes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liara set aside her breakfast plate, letting off a tiny little belch as she patted the tummy filling out her new jacket. She had to pull a few strings to find one that resembled her old, favorite garment in style, and luckily this one fit...not perfectly, but more then adequately for now. For whatever reason it STILL felt a little snug, and she definitely did not run this through the laundry first. Must have been a size mislabeling, she thought irritably. The seller seemed rather flustered when she asked about the size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore to the point, she turned her attention to the holographic display of the command structure in front of her, depicting a dozen different Turian officials of high status and prestige. The High Commander of the Seveso Sector had unexpectedly passed away the previous night and the ensuing shake-up was a prime opportunity to get one of her agents into the command structure, and by extension getting a foothold in the Hierarchy that would be incredibly valuable to her ongoing operations. It was a delicate and demanding task, one that needed her full and undivided attention to succeed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss T'soni?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dahlia, this is important,\" Liara reprimanded her assistant as she poked her head through the door. \"Whatever it is it can wait, I can't have anything distract from this right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...there's another package.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's eyes lit up, and with one flick of the wrist minimized the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, bring it here then!\" Liara said, perhaps a little hurriedly as her mouth started to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahlia daintily approached her desk, the familiar package held in her hands. She seemed to be moving somewhat slower today, and Liara couldn't help but notice how tightly her usual dress fit around Dahlia's plump, wobbling hips. Still, despite the caution in her step, there was a clear look of excitement on her somewhat rounder face, and Liara could see why; this box was clearly larger then the last one! Setting it down on the desk, her assistant took a breather and readjusted herself, smoothing out the bunched up fabric squeezed by her plush figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Liara opened the container like it was a lost ancient treasure; the pastries inside this time were less decorative, looking either plain or powdered. Dahlia looked a bit crestfallen at this, and somewhat confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't these usually have holes in them?\" she asked. Liara shrugged and, throwing caution to the wind, picked up one of the plain looking pastries and bit down into it. She detected the familiar sugary flavor and then her eyes widened when something delightfully tangy and sweet burst into her mouth. Liara looked down to see the insides of the pastry filled with a white creamy substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Goddess, these are even better!\" Liara exclaimed, happily taking another bite that smeared the creamy filling onto her lips. \"This filling...incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-ma'am, could I...?\" Dahlia asked, overwhelming desire overcoming her timidness as her hand drifted towards the box. When Liara gave a nod, too enthralled in her donut to even speak, Dahlia almost squealed in delight as she grabbed a powdered donut and bit into it. Her eyes widened with the same wild delight, and when she took it out of her mouth it left a red stain behind. \"This one...has a jelly in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save one for me!\" Liara chuckled, licking her fingers and reaching for a second helping. The powerful agent acting from the shadows and her confidant and assistant gleefully picked through the donuts like children in a candy store, eliminating each one by one and joyfully exclaiming whatever unique filling their donut happened to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the box being larger then the last, Liara reached for another and brushed against the crumbs at the bottom far sooner than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought....<i>hic</i>...the first one was heavenly...\" Dahlia muttered sleepily, licking chocolate filling off of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Liara mumbled in agreement, reaching down to undo her belt and relieve the sudden tightness in her gut, knowing Dahlia wouldn't be able to see it behind the desk anyway. The belt popped out as soon as Liara undid the clasp, leaving a bulging, round belly to hang out over her lap, a belly button just barely visible underneath the bottom hem of her jacket. Rolling her shoulders, Liara blushed as the top half of her outfit loosened with the movement, the zipper being forced down and showing off more of her cleavage then she would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahlia blushed at the sight and made to get up, revealing diamonds of blue flesh along her sides where the buttons of her dress were straining to contain her...or rather, failing to contain her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>snap, snap!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahlia turned several shades of purple as two of the overtaxed buttons snapped and fell to the ground with a loud clatter, her overstuffed gut pooching forward into the new space opened up by her dress. Not willing to comment on the obvious wardrobe malfunctions, Liara cleared her throat and pulled up the list of Turian commanders again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can go now Dahlia,\" Liara announced dutifully, not making eye contact with her. Dahlia bowed, equally determined not to make eye contact and waddled out of the room, her shapely rear end somehow even more shapely then before. There was a slight rip as a gap of fabric opened up across the younger Asari's hindquarters before she shimmied out, resolving to herself to finally update her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething felt off. Liara couldn't put her finger on it, but something was wrong about this whole situation. She knew the two of them were out of shape but...out of shape to the point of causing wardrobe malfunctions like this? It seemed impossible...it HAD to be impossible. There had to be a rational explanation for this. Liara looked inside the empty box, scrutinizing every inch of it but coming up short; the thing was entirely unmarked, nothing off or out of place besides the cream filling that leaked into the bottom. That delicious...heavenly...delectable...filling. Liara leaned in, debating whether or not she could push her face close enough to lick the inner surface clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Goddess, get a hold of yourself!\" Liara said aloud, shaking her head. Resolutely knocking the box aside and turning to her charts with renewed purpose, or maybe just out of spite, the information broker stubbornly put those ideas out of her head. They were just donuts, probably a simple gift from a client who wanted to remain anonymous, and she was just a little overweight. There's nothing sinister going on. You're just being paranoid. \"I need a vacation,\" Liara spoke aloud again. \"I'm starting to see things everywhere.\" She gave her holographic projections a forceful push, not noticing the new wobble her biceps had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day however, as Liara waddled (\"WALKED! I'm WALKING! Not waddling!\" she insisted to herself) into her office again, there was something different...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, I don't see the harm in it,\" Liara mused, licking her lips thoughtfully. \"I've heard good things about these pastries, perhaps they were sent by someone who considers them more of a delicacy. Ah well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gracefully took a bite from the donut in her hand, chewing thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....not bad. Quite sweet.\" Polishing off the donut in a couple bites, Liara paused at Dahlia's chubby form squirming slightly. \"Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no ma'am, I...just have work to catch up on,\" Dahlia stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't let me stop you,\" Liara said, turning back to her keyboard and picking up another donut with her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, ma'am,\" Dahlia said, giving a little bow and, when she turned around, gave a triumphant smirk as she strode out the door. Quietly shutting the office door behind her and sealing it, the security personal at the terminal nearby gave her a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you smirking about?\" she asked suspiciously. The tough Asari never quiet trusted her younger counterpart, and she was about to find out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...must take a few more seconds...\" Dahlia mused. The security guard opened her mouth to demand an explanation, but instead yawned, her eyes instantly drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...wow, I got tired all of a sudden,\" the guard slurred, swaying on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be the anesthetic introduced into the staff's water supply,\" Dahlia said brightly, projecting the confidence that was shockingly absent before now. \"Should be kicking in for the rest of you around the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....little...\" The guard made to unsheathe her sidearm, but her legs gave out from under her and she toppled forward. Dahlia managed to catch the guard in her arms as a series of loud thumps told her that the rest of the staff Liara had on hand had gone the same way. Setting the guard cautiously on the ground so her now ex-boss wouldn't catch on, Dahlia stepped across the body and over to her work station, retrieving a hidden omni-tool from her desk and slipping it onto her arm. Powering it up, the omni-tool projected a silhouetted humanoid figure, heavily distorted and hidden by fields of static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The job is finished?\" the figure asked, his or her voice equally distorted and warped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a few minutes, Liara T'Soni will be no more.\" Or perhaps a lot more, she thought to herself with a sadistic sense of glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, another target down. The payment has been transferred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure vanished as the channel closed, leaving Dahlia to make her hasty exit, slipping out a side door and merging into a crowd of workers coming home from the daily grind. She almost wished she could stay to watch the fireworks. It was unbecoming to make things personal, but after enduring Liara's constant jabs at her waistline she couldn't help but indulge in a little payback, if only via the method of execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy those donuts,\" she said to herself quietly. \"They'll be your last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the corner, the crowd of workers merged with a second crowd, and Dahlia vanished from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empty box landed in the garbage dispenser with a loud thump as Liara licked her fingers clean. Not quite the best donuts she'd sampled before, but they were a tasty treat nonetheless, and just the pick-me-up she needed to get through the day. She refocused on the investigation into the Volus assassination plot she was trying to bust wide open when she suddenly felt nauseous, her stomach giving a lurch in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....urp!\" Liara winced as a slight burp escaped her lips. \"Perhaps they were a little too sweet.\" Getting up slightly from her chair, she reached over to grab a water bottle out of the mini fridge on the far edge of her workspace. Taking a sip, she didn't notice the arms of her chair brushing against her hips for the first time as she fully sat back down. \"That's better...hrmm...\" Tugging her shirt down over her small belly, she dove right back into her work, too engaged to notice her shirt immediately pop back up to reveal her belly button. Taking another sip of water, she filled her cheeks with air and exhaled to fight the weird feeling in her stomach, not noticing her cheeks hadn't fully deflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should have saved some for later,\" Liara admitted. \"Ah well, power on through it I suppose.\" Doubling down on her report, she delved deeper into an incident on a Turian shipyard connected to the victims. Hunting for a certain file that would crack the case wide open, she lifted slightly out of her chair, then unconsciously sat back down when she felt the arms of her seat brushing against her broadening hips. Frantic typing and computer blips hid the sound of straining fabric and fasteners until at last her quarry was found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lynchpin of the entire operation, and the password to secure it is his birthday,\" Liara chuckled, rolling her eyes. She quickly retrieved the file in question to a physical data chit plugged into her system which she reached over to unplug. \"Easy as....what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand stopped short of the data chit by inches. Mildly annoyed, Liara squeezed herself against the desk and tried to reach, barely brushing her fingertips on the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I told her this desk was too big,\" Liara mumbled, looking down to see what she was hitting against. \"I'll need t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's voiced dropped and her eyes widened in shock as she looked down, realizing it wasn't the desk that was stopping her from reaching across it. Her shirt had ridden up entirely, revealing not a pot belly but a massive gut spilling over into her lap. She pressed her finger into it in shock, finding it to be very, very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething underneath her snapped. She turned her head and gasped in shock as she watched her hips flaring out beneath her, distorting and cracking the polymer arms of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what's happening?\" Liara's hands flew to her hips this time, and she looked in horror as her fingers began to thicken and bulge before her eyes. She thought back to when she licked them clean earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The donuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara tried to stand up, but her rear end was wedged tightly into the arms of her seat at this point. She slammed a meaty hand into her silent alarm underneath the desk. No response. Swearing, she tried to extract herself from the chair, the struggle popping her belt buckle off and sending it flying across the room; the front of her trousers split open and her gut split into two rolls and plopped down over her thighs. Her shirt had been reduced to serving as a bra for her swelling, sagging chest, and it was already starting to split apart at the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud snap, and the chair arm came off in Liara's pudgy hand. Her fat thighs sprung out to their full width as the Asari overbalanced and fell over, hitting the ground with an enormous 'smack' sound. Thoroughly winded, she tried to sit up but was immediately blocked by the immense stomach making a beeline for her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, though, the initial shock of fattening up at an extreme rate wore off, and Liara was able to think clearly. Whatever was going on, it was caused by the substance put into those donuts. It had to be. Meaning there was one hope left; the Antidote. A gift from Miranda Lawson after she retired from her own espionage work, the Antidote was a universal panacea, able to counteract even the most incurable toxins or poisons, and with her staff most likely eliminated, it was her only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Liara rolled over onto her knees before the adipose on her legs swallowed them. Getting up to a standing position, she felt her feet burst free from her fashionable shoes and spread across the floor, followed by the seat of her pants splitting apart and joining the remains of her footwear. Taking heavy, plodding steps towards the array of potted plants, she pressed a thick finger to an innocuous spot on the side, hoping her hands weren't too fat for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the old days...\" Liara huffed, feeling her multiple chins weighing her lips down. \"...when you could just slap...omni-gel on everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potted plant dinged as the pass phrase was accepted, the inside opening up to reveal a small plastic bottle of neon green pills. She grabbed onto it in desperation, trying to unscrew the cap. To her horror, it slipped from her meaty grip, bouncing onto the floor<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"No!\" she yelled, desperately bending over to try and reach in, her flexibility in the same shape as her shoes and pants at this point.  Her knees were crying out in agony. It wouldn't be long before they couldn't support her growing bulk anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not....going out....like...this....!\" Liara huffed, straining to reach the bottle on the floor as she reached her breaking point. Her hope began to drain away as her stamina did, she could feel herself starting to tip over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>BANG! BANG!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara gasped. The door! Someone was banging at the door, trying to open it up! Did the alarm finally reach someone? She tried to call out to unlock the door with another voice command, but sparks began flying from the sides as the hinges were shot or blasted off. The door slammed to the ground as Liara's savior jumped over the threshold.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thinking back, it felt rather light in her hands considering how intricate and complicated this box was designed. Maybe the box itself was the gift? Now that the Geth were on friendly terms with the rest of the galaxy, they were putting out devices that acted like this. Maybe this was intended to be a bribe or a payment from someone who owed her, and she racked her brain to think of who that could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Liara T'Soni...our Sisters give you a taste of what could have been.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's eyes darted around the room, methodically searching for anything suspect. That voice...it sounded like it came from inside her head. Making sure her sidearm was loaded and ready, Liara looked suspiciously at the mechanical box as it stopped its opening process. Whoever said that...it had to come from this thing. What exactly did it mean by \"a taste of what could have been\"? And who were the sisters? Liara came up with a few options on the spot, but the wording was too vague to really pin that name down. Choosing to investigate further, Liara leaned over and looked into the interior of the strange box. It looked oddly empty. She cautiously pushed the box with one slender finger into a better light, when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BANG*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara yelped as a plume of thick, gray-blue smoke erupted from the box, flooding her eyes and nostrils with the stinging cloud. Choking, she waved her flabby arms wildly to disperse the smoke, swearing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss T'soni, is something wrong?\" Dahlia asked as she strode into the room, hips swaying gently as she pushed a cart in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm f-fine, no thanks to my security team,\" Liara coughed, batting away the last of the smoke as it dissipated. \"I thought you said they checked this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did, it didn't do anything particularly odd, just opened up and closed again,\" Dahlia confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if another one comes, let me know. I'll deal with whoever is sending them after breakfast.\" Liara's knees started to ache, so she dropped into her seat with a heavy thud as Dahlia began collecting the multitude of plates decorating her desk, swapping them out with platters full of deep fried and battered delicacies. The smell alone was heavenly; even Dahlia couldn't contain herself as she stared at all the plates hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not sneaking some of my food, are you?\" Liara asked pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WHAT?\" Dahlia almost shouted. \"M-miss T'soni, I swear-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm only teasing,\" Liara chuckled. \"You can go now, see you at lunch Dahlia.\" Liara eyed her assistant as she quickly waddled from the room, nearly catching her hips on the door frame, and as the door slid shut, the Shadow Broker could hear the telltale sound of someone taking a large bite out of something and chewing happily. It was a good thing she was a fine assistant, because Liara knew almost from the day she hired her that the girl had a monstrous sweet tooth and was absolutely stealing any morsel she could. That ambition and determination made her quite reliable, even as she went from slightly tubby to comfortably obese in a remarkably short time, nearly doubling in size and bursting out of that black skintight outfit on a weekly basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Liara could complain, given she had an equally ravenous taste for sweets. Licking her lips excitedly, the Shadow Broker undid the bottom buttons on her jacket to make room, letting her enormous double-rolled gut spill out onto her lap, before tucking into the massive spread before her. Squeezing apart the arms of the chair, the Shadow Broker attacked the food before her with glee, crumbs and morsels escaping and falling down her thick cheeks and chins. Wiping across her lips with the back of her hand...Liara had the strangest feeling. Like...something wasn't normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from her desk (easier said then done, given how much she had to squeeze to escape the vice-like grip of the chair arms on her hips, Liara took an exceedingly rare break from eating and waddled into her quarters again to check the mirror on her dresser. She checked every inch of her appearance, from her makeup on her round face to her pants struggling to contain a butt that was outgrowing chairs. Cautiously lifting up her belly with both hands and letting it fall back to her thighs with a soft *plop*, Liara turned on her heel, popping her hips out to extreme effect and snapping a seam in her overtaxed undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara reflected for a moment and thought...                                                                                                                                                                  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two figures lay intertwined within a plush apartment set in a tower over the Silversun Strip. Arms and legs were tangled together as the two held each other close, and the covers were tossed and kicked aside, both savoring the cool air drifting across their glistening sweat soaked bodies. One was the blue-skinned Liara T\u2019Soni, and curled up beside her was the pale-skinned and red-headed Serah Shepard, a Spectre and the hero of the galaxy after breaking the eon long cycle of growth and extermination by the Reapers. Liara still thought back to when she was forced to leave Serah during the final push towards the Conduit and the strange mix of fear and joy when there was no contact with after the Commander was able fire the Crucible and stop the Reaper attacks. She also thought of how she nearly wept with relief when crews sent to the Citadel to find any possible survivors came across Shepard still stubbornly clinging to life; albeit barely. Since then Liara had stayed with her love through Serah\u2019s lengthy recuperation from the injuries sustained through the Battle of Earth and beyond. Once recovered, the two had spent a great deal of time together, reveling in the relative peace that had come to the galaxy and the chance to relax. The Normandy and its crew \u2013 including the gallant Commander \u2013 were still regularly called into action, but this happened far less often than before, and Liara had been spending less time overseeing the information network as the Shadow Broker \u2013 thanks in large part to Feron and some upgrades made to Glyph \u2013 both of which resulted in Serah and Liara having quite a bit more free time than either were used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought the Asari\u2019s wandering mind back to the present: her body pressed tight up against her heroic lover, who wore naught but a contented smile as she dozed after another marathon lovemaking session with Liara. Beneath her arm, Liara could feel Serah\u2019s breathing, slow and deep. Liara could also feel how her body was showing further results from her less active lifestyle that didn\u2019t often rely on military rations. Before, she was trim and slender, but now sported a small but noticeable layer of fat across her whole body, the softness conforming slightly to the trim and firm frame of Serah. The Asari wasn\u2019t exactly too sure about her weight, but Shepard oddly enough certainly didn\u2019t seem to mind at all though. As she thought of this, an idea that had come to her before and dismissed just as repeatedly returned yet again: a cautious wonder that maybe the great Commander Shepard actually maybe preferred a little meat on her lover. Remembering the feelings of Serah fondling Liara\u2019s slightly more fleshy breasts, and her hand snaking about to grope the meatier blue ass behind sent a pleasant shiver down the Asari\u2019s spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was too distracted with her thoughts till \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d came sleepily from right next to her before a pair of soft, full, and pouty lips were pressed against her own lips, breaking her line of thought again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kiss broke, Shepard scooted back just a short distance, as she tenderly caressed Liara\u2019s head crests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Serah, did I wake you?\u201d a familiar heat creeping into her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard gave a slight nod of the head in response, \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble, but what\u2019s up?\u201d moving her head down to Liara\u2019s cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escaped Liara before she went ahead and blurted it out, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about a lot of things, but I keep coming back to my weight.\u201d To illustrate, she reached down and gripped what she could of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes about that,\u201d Serah said, a blush coloring her cheeks as well as the last traces of sleep were dispelled, \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about that, but I\u2019ve been having some trouble finding how to admit it. Since you brought it up though...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara\u2019s mouth went dry and her mind whirled with possibilities, all of them various shades of bad news, as Shepard struggled to come up with the right words. The Commander had almost never been caught tongue tied, so Liara could only assume that it must be something really terrible for this to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiara\u2026the truth is\u2026\u201d as she run her fingers down Liara\u2019s spine, the Asari felt a familiar tingle spreading from the touch, a sign that her human lover was using her a tiny amount of her biotics, something both had started doing to stimulate each other, which only further confused Liara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Serah seemed to figure how she was going to say what was on her mind, and that proved to not quite be what Liara\u2019s panicked mind had been expecting at the moment.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't imagine how it must have been for Shepard to spend months in a hospital bed with her innards barely held together, after the Crucible explosion. Liara had only been here for a week and she was starting to feel a bit stir-crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you'll need to stay off your feet and leave the cast-shielding on for a month or so until your legs are fully repaired,\" the doctor explained, gesturing towards the hard-light constructs functioning as casts for her mangled legs. \"I assume you have transportation home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor gave a start as the Prothean spoke up, revealing himself after entering the room stoically and patiently waiting behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Javik!\" Liara pushed herself off the bed, wincing slightly. The doctor stood there, shocked at the sight of the legendary alien species as he walked up to her bedside, resting their foreheads against one another in a show of affection. \"Have things been busy?\" Liara asked as they broke apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've hunted down the individual responsible for the shuttle accident and inflicted vengeance upon him,\" Javik reported. \"His suffering was legendary and it can be assured he will not make that mistake again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a deadly silence as the doctor turned pale. Javik's stoic expression cracked into a slight smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara giggled as the poor doctor breathed a sigh of relief. At long last, the Prothean had developed a sense of humor, albeit a dark one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I'll...go get you discharged. And find the wheelchair...\" the doctor said, hastily making her exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, by the way,\" Liara said as her giggling came to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavik looked puzzled. \"What did I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reminded me of how much I missed you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavik, deeply touched, reached out to take her hand as she held it out. The Prothean wasn't one to wear his feelings on his shoulder, but the remarkable gentleness of his hand in hers betrayed his feelings. He might as well have been singing love songs on the roof of the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And....you're sure there won't be any lasting damage?\" Javik asked wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None so long as I stay off my feet for a while. I'll be back to sitting behind my desk in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so this is the stage of 'pampering' then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara raised an eyebrow, looking puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'pampering',\" Javik explained. \"I was speaking with the wild human Jack, and she insisted that while you are recovering I should and I quote, 'pamper' you. Setting you in a comfortable position, preparing you meals, activities to that effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she said that,\" Liara chuckled. \"So you're actually going to cook for me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be surprised,\" Javik said. \"Now that my service as an Avatar of Vengeance is unnecessary I've found I had plenty of free time to devote to such recreational activities. In addition, I figured you would appreciate sampling some Prothean cuisine I have knowledge of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's eyes lit up at the idea of sampling what the ancient Protheans would have eaten. Ever the enthusiast of the ancient culture, Liara's only familiarity with their diets was archeological evidence suggesting their bodies had a higher then average metabolism and needed extra calories to function. Years ago she would have laughed it off if someone suggested she'd be eating what the Protheans ate millennia ago, and yet here she was, being told that's exactly what she'd be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavik once again cracked a smile. \"I figured you would enjoy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara stirred as the light from a Thessian sunrise touched her face. Her legs felt heavy and numb, the light-casts keeping them securely in place as she slept. Cracking open her eyes, she saw the empty spot on the bed where Javik had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing herself up to a reclining postion, Liara stretched out her sore back muscles, still recovering from the stiff hospital bed and the first night back on her more comfortable mattress. As the tantalizing thought of a day spent doing absolutely nothing stretched out before her, she caught scent of something on the air. Something delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Liara,\" Javik announced, shouldering the door open with a tray in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...morning,\" the Asari responded, trying to stifle a giggle at the sight of Javik in, of all things, a cooking apron and a chef's hat. She couldn't fault him for being dedicated, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my first attempt at the Prothean cooking,\" Javik explained as he set the tray down. \"I had to improvise as a few spices seem to have gone extinct since the last cycle, but I think I've recreated it as best as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it smells delicious,\" Liara complimented, looking over the meal. It seemed to resemble the human delicacy of pancakes but visibly thicker, speckled blue and layered like a cake with a red butter-like substance melted on top. Liara took up the silverware and cut herself a piece, eyes widening as the flavor hit her. \"Incredible! I want to say it's sweet but...there's a body to it I haven't experienced before, like nothing I've ever tasted. Amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavik smiled slightly. \"It's one of the simpler dishes I admit, but it has a kick to it that a lot of cuisine from this era lacked. If you'd like, I can make some extra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmf...yeth, PLEATHE!\" Liara said through a massive mouthful, her cheeks bulging as she nearly reduced the Prothean dish to half. As Javik gave her a quick peck on the side of her face before leaving to make some more, a nagging voice in the back of Liara's head warned her of the dangers of no physical activity combined with a heavy Prothean diet, only to be quickly drowned out by the voice of the Prothean enthusiast screaming in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be the opportunity of a lifetime for her, she wasn't going to let fears about a couple pounds spoil that for her.</span></div></div>",

It was the kind of day that made you want to cuddle up in a blanket and watch a fun movie, and Liara was doing just that. Sure that was what she mostly did anyway thanks to her legs, but the bad weather made cuddling up even more pleasing, especially now that she had someone else to cuddle with. Leaning against Javik's chest as they reclined on the sofa, Liara let out a soft sigh as the last scene of the movie (<i>Citadel</i>, a fairly popular dramatization of Commander Shepard's fight against the rogue Spectre Saren) played and the credits began to roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Javik said thoughtfully. \"That was your first mission with Commander Shepard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm,\" Liara said soothingly. \"Give or take a few details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they seemed to think the Reaper indoctrinating him had been a spaceship,\" Javik said coolly. \"Not to mention they had an...unusual take on your relationship with the Commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if that was awkward,\" Liara said, remembering the uncomfortable shuffle the two of them shared when the scene featuring a rather charged encounter between Shepard's character and Liara's flashed on screen. It wasn't a surprise of course, the Asari had always been up front about the relationship she had with Commander Shepard, and how after she came back from the dead they just couldn't rekindle that spark and they both moved on. Still, it didn't exactly make seeing a dramatization of herself 'embracing eternity' with her ex any less awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not,\" Javik confirmed, putting her at ease. \"She was poorly cast anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was? I thought the actors did well. The man playing Mr. Moreau even confined himself to a wheelchair for the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True...\" he said, taking her hand in his. \"But I do not believe there is a soul alive who could match your radiance and set the stars alight as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's face immediately flushed at the amorous comment. \"That...is so cheesy,\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not appreciate my...waxing of the poetic, as humans call it?\" He drew in closer, and she could practically feel his slow powerful heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me put it this way...\" Liara said, drawing the Prothean closer and locking lips in a deep, passionate kiss. Javik responded in turn, careful to avoid bumping into Liara's damaged legs, still held in place by the cast shielding. They would be coming off soon though, and frankly she could not wait to be free of them and really \"show\" her beloved how deeply she appreciated everything he had done for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like hours had passed before they finally broke apart; Liara's stomach seemed to think so as it growled at the pair of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner time,\" Liara announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is,\" Javik confirmed. \"Are you perhaps feeling adventurous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me,\" Liara responded, playfully stroking the side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I have just the thing.\" Leaving her with a peck on the cheek, Javik stood up from the couch and strode into the kitchen, which sprang to life upon his entry. Stretching out her neck, Liara untangled herself from the blanket, now that she was plenty warm, and lay sprawled out on the couch, wondering what delectable awaited her. Of all the pampering and affection she got, by far the Prothean-made meals were some of the best parts. And of course now that she wasn't wrapped in a blanket that was starting to become apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara frowned slightly, reaching down to caress the side of her stomach pooching out from under her shirt. She had expected to become a little out of shape considering she couldn't exactly go for a walk to shed some pounds, but maybe not quite this soon. Far from just a belly, Liara was starting to gain a not-insignificant layer of fat on herself, rounding out some of her bony features and making her comfy clothes for lounging around something of a tight fit. It was prominent on her belly of course, and to a lesser extent her chest, which had started to visibly strain the buttons on some of her shirts. She didn't even want to think about how her legs or rear looked after being sat on 24/7 for the same amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smells from the kitchen began to arrive in full force, already making Liara drool in anticipation, she spared one last thought for her burgeoning pudge...</span></div></div>",

For now, I am left to be a vigilante with Shepard and the rest of her crew. It will suffice until I find a new purpose.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda Lawson sat up from the desk in her quarters and went to join Shepard on the bridge. She was up on the command platform, studying the map of the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we to do next, Commander?\" Miranda asked, standing at Shepard's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard sighed and brushed her red hair to the side. \"Right now, just a few distress signals, a job on Illium, and a few Alliance fetch assignments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest that we complete minor work for now, allow the team some easy work while they recover from Omega 4.\" Miranda said, \"Then, later, we can look at bigger ops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine to me.\" Shepard said, setting coordinates for the ship. \"We'll check out a wreck in the Traverse. Get Thane ready, then grab your gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away.\" Miranda said and strutted back into the elevator.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nA short while later, the team's shuttle was getting close to the planet's surface.

There were a few cases of palladium scattered outside the remains, along with some credits and a few blueprints. Once inside, they searched for the security room to find a log of events leading up to the crash. They found a recording of a conversation logged in the QEC records. The speakers said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've almost reached our destination, sir.\" The first voice said, \"We have avoided the Blood Pack thus far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure that you do, Captain.\" The second warned, \"You won't get a second chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's eyes lit with surprise. \"That's my father's voice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was he onboard?\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, all of the casualties were identified, he must have been the one transmitting.\" Thane concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's keep listening.\" Shepard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sir, we won't disappoint.\" The captain returned. \"You'll get what you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that my faith was not  misplaced.\" He paused for a moment. \"My daughter has made me wary of betrayal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a daughter, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two, actually. I never married, however. They were grown in a lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genetic engineering, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. I bred them to be perfect, in intelligence, endurance, and appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted them to have the looks to get by in life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, in addition to their other factors. I can't stand a fat woman, so I gave them great bodies and put healthy habits into their brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda crossed her arms. \"Judging bastard.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you when we get the goods, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, Lawson out.\" The recording ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team salvaged what items were left and returned to the Normandy. Miranda sat in her quarters playing that one sentence over and over again in her head. <i>I can't stand a fat woman, I cant stand a fat woman... That's it!</i> She thought, <i>He wanted me to be physically perfect. If he hates fat, that means I love it.

The sadistic gleam of vengeance-filled revelation painted itself across her face.  Fatass, she liked that term with Miranda.  Something about the \u2018perfect human\u2019 turning into some lardass pig.  Something about the destruction of the \u2018perfect body\u2019 that she valued so highly.

When Miranda came back she took a sip from the mug. \u201cheh drink up bitch\u201d Fortunately, Mordin was right about it working fast, as Miranda\u2019s figure slowly began to creep outward before Jack could blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new weight appearing on her body from the ingestion of the condensed calorie dust or whatever exactly it was Mordin had gave her, the majority of the weight was too lazy to move up, as it all seemed to go to Miranda\u2019s lower half. A very small belly began to protrude outward, fighting for space against Miranda\u2019s shirt and belt, while her thighs slightly thickened, and her rump became even more plush. Even with a more then generous portion going to her lower half, some still went upward, softening her perfectly sculpted face, and plumping up her large bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Jack had never been good at telling weight, she guessed that Miranda had put on 10 pounds over the course of five minutes from a teaspoon of the powder alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, even after absentmindedly patting her belly when her growth was done, Miranda didn\u2019t seem to notice the new weight. Jack smiled and stifled a giggle knowing her plan was going to work perfectly \u201cI will teach you a lesson you won\u2019t ever forget, you soon to be fatty\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miranda was done, she stood up and walked away to place her utensils away, when she walked jack noticed an almost imperceptible jiggle to Mirandas rear \u201cheh, this will be even more fun than I thought it would\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack figured to avoid suspicion she should wait and only use the powder once every few days, to avoid suspicion and to draw out the enjoyment from the cheerleaders suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 day\u2019s past since the initial dose of powder was given and Jack decided now was the time to make the perfect cheerleaders body a little less perfect. Jack waited in the crew deck till she saw Miranda order herself a meal and a drink, Jack could swear the meal looked larger than what Miranda normally ordered. She planned to cause a distraction to get Miranda away from her food so she could spike it again and just as Miranda was about to take a bite she sprung her distraction, she caused Miranda to get an urgent alert on her omni tool, Miranda obviously annoyed by this began to mutter angrily, however she didn\u2019t have a choice and left her food to go deal with the message. As soon as Miranda was out of sight Jack got up and walked over to the food on the table, she put a teaspoon of the powder into the food and a teaspoon into the drink, she then mixed it with an evil grin across her face and casually walked back over to where she was sitting before, to watch the cheerleader begin to fatten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda walked back in with an angry look on her perfect face. She sat down and began to eat with the perfect poise and grace that she always had, lifting the unknown calorific catastrophe into her mouth, Jack face lit up when she saw the effects starting to take place, she began to take a video as she saw Miranda eat, her white outfit slowly pushed outwards containing Miranda\u2019s new inch of fat that encompassed her growing lower half \u201cThat\u2019s right fatty keep eating it up, soon there will be enough of your \u2018perfect\u2019 cheerleader body to get stuck in doorways\u201d. Jack continued to watch Miranda eat she smiled every time she pulled her outfit to make it more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miranda had finished Jack\u2019s, eyes went wide when she looked at Miranda\u2019s waist and saw a muffin top. \u201cA muffin top!\u201d  she thought to herself \u201cThe perfect woman has a fucking muffin top!\u201d  She almost squealed with delight when she saw it. By jacks guess Miranda had put on another 20 pounds or so, however this time Miranda did notice the change, she wasn\u2019t stupid after all. Miranda stood up quickly causing her newly formed flesh to jiggle, giving a gasp of surprise as she stood, and it was there that Jack got her first good view of the damage. Miranda\u2019s face had softened, giving her slightly chubby cheeks and the hint of a double chin on her face, her neck looked thicker, her bust which had already been sizeable, had grown noticeably and her breasts usual perkiness had started to give way to a slight sag, her stomach had gone from the slight layer of fat that it was a few days ago, and become a full band of fat flesh spilling over her belt on all sides, however it was Miranda\u2019s butt and thighs which was the main focus of the newly formed fat, her legs and ass had lost some of their tone, giving way to softness. Miranda obviously confused and worried by this quickly walked to the doorway, red faced with embarrassment, tugging at her clothes trying to hide her new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched as walked out, her new fat ass jiggling as she walked through the door way. Jack howled with laughter as the doors closed behind Miranda \u201cHAHA if this keeps up she will be too fat for those doors! A couple more sessions and then maybe I can write a poem about Miranda! Maybe I\u2019ll call it, \u2018Mega muffintop\u2019 she would love that! Still 30 pounds total is a long way, I think 300 pounds added to your frame will make a nice additon\u201d Jack continued to smile to herself for the next few days, occasionally catching glimpses of Miranda going to and from her daily routines her new muffin top jiggling as she walked, \u201cwell she\u2019s much easier to spot now\u201d jack remarked to herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack watched Miranda for the next few days making sure she was in the crew deck when Miranda was, she was trying to make herself seem less suspicious, to make sure it wasn\u2019t obvious that Miranda gained large amounts of weight when Jack was there. Jack was still noting that Miranda\u2019s plate seemed to contain more food than usual and of the greasier kind, instead of fruit and vegetables, Mirandas plate contained fat greasy sausages, a heap of mashed potato and thick brown gravy covering it all \u201cwell fuck me she\u2019ll make herself a big fat cow if she keeps eating at this pace\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few day\u2019s past before jack decided to laden up Miranda\u2019s food with the powder again she would still only use 2 teaspoons of the powder, she wanted to draw out Miranda\u2019s suffering as long as possible. Miranda shuffled in at her usual time, wearing her normal suit, which at this point was obviously far too small for her now, as it was barely covering her enlarged midsection. She ordered her now usual fat laden greasy meal, 5 thick burgers with all the extras, extra bacon, extra cheese and fried chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also deep fried salty fries, onion rings, fried chicken, 2 large \u2018bulge\u2019 soda\u2019s and a couple slices of cheesecake. \u201cHoly fuck me she\u2019s gonna get so fat from this!\u201d. Jack activated her distraction once again just as Miranda was going to sit her fat ass down \u201cGOD DAMMIT!\u201d yelled Miranda \u201cDon\u2019t they know I\u2019m trying to eat here!\u201d Jack had never seen her this angry over a delayed meal before \u201cwow that appetite enhancer must be going to town on her\u201d Thought Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stomped off loudly grumbling to herself about ridiculous times to message her. Jack once again casually walked over to the food and realised that 2 tea spoons wouldn\u2019t cut it with this much food, so she was forced to use 3 instead \u201cJeeze Miranda might wanna cut back on all the food you lard arse, you\u2019ll get fat\u201d Jack thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sprinkled the powder over all of Miranda\u2019s food and in her drink and walked back a spring in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Miranda returned with a relieved look on her face when she saw her pile of food waiting for her, she sat down on the bench with a heavy thud that caused her to jiggle and began to shove the greasy food into her face, all of her usual poise and grace abandoned for a feeding frenzy that made Jack stare in awe. Jack had begun filming as soon as Miranda had reached for her burger and was waiting gleefully for the results to begin to show themselves on the once thin woman\u2019s frame, it didn\u2019t take long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda so engrossed in her food didn\u2019t noticed the large bulges forming rapidly all over her body, Miranda\u2019s new fat started to threaten her already too small suit, with tears forming at her fattened upper arms, and thighs. Her belly began to push against her belt heavily causing a visible strain on the material with a decent sized roll poking out from beneath the shirt that was beginning to ride up on her now prominent gut. \u201cGood thing that suits strong otherwise she\u2019d have popped out of it ages ago, and we wouldn\u2019t want that now would we?\u201d Jack thought smugly. Miranda\u2019s already generous ass cheeks had taken most of the hit again this time with her ass starting to spill over the bench, as well as forcing itself up from the confines of her too tight trousers causing a large spill of fat from the trousers giving her muffin top a turbo charge. Her face had not been saved this time either and a prominent double chin formed under the woman\u2019s face, with large chubby cheeks following up above. Miranda\u2019s breasts surged outwards expanding greatly. Despite all of this extra growth Miranda was still stuffing the food down into her ever widening gut seemingly still not able to notice the effect the binging was having on her. Miranda finished with all of the food gone with not a scrap in sight, she had a very content look on her face as she let out loud sigh and leaned backwards, when she did so a loud snap was heard as Miranda\u2019s belt burst outwards letting a tidal wave of flab pour onto Miranda\u2019s lap, as this happened the lower buttons on her top popped, which was quickly followed but the buttons on her trousers popping as well, this served to let even more of the now large fleshy gut pour out, exposing her pale perfect flesh to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to snap Miranda back into the real world she stared wide eyed at herself. Miranda went white and then very red, \u201cno\u2026. no no no, NO! What have I done! What\u2019s happened to me!\u201d Miranda screamed. She stood up, slower than she normally did and with a lot more jiggling than should be there on the \u2018perfect human\u2019. Jack got the perfect view of Miranda \u2018the lard arse\u2019 Lawson\u2019s new frame as Miranda frantically tried to push the fat back into her body, Jack guessed that she must of put on a good 70 pounds from this binge. Jack was glad to see the full extent of her work, Miranda had definitely got a pear shape now. Miranda\u2019s jacket flapped open exposing her gut, which now hung slightly from her frame with her soft pale flesh jiggling as she moved to close her jacket, Jack noticed her fingers and hands had grown thicker giving her the beginnings of sausage fingers. Miranda\u2019s arms had grown beefy as well, looking like she had once large muscles which had now turned to fat. Miranda\u2019s new double chin jiggled and swayed from her face as she continued to try and push away her fat. There was now no semblance of tone anywhere across Miranda\u2019s body with her hips and ass having grown large, fat and soft, however her ass still had some perkiness to it as well as its original curvy shape. The same could be said for Miranda\u2019s breasts which had not lost their perkiness at all and now began to push out of the top of her white jacket looking squashed against the confines of her ridiculous looking ripped jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda seeing her predicament began to make a hasty retreat, red faced out of the crew deck still trying to cover herself as she left through the doors to go back to her room, stealing another slice of cheesecake from the side before she left. Jack was just stunned she had no words for what she had just seen. As the shock began to fade a smile crept onto Jacks face which quickly turned into full blown laughter \u201cHAHAHA OH MY GOD SHE\u2019S SO FUCKING FAT HAHAHA!\u201d Jack sat their laughing at the memory of the high and mighty princess brought low. Eventually Jack calmed down and wiped the tears from her eyes. \u201cThis is perfect! She\u2019s turning into a blob and she can\u2019t even control herself!\u201d Jack exclaimed to herself, \u201cShe\u2019s only 100 pounds heavier and that door frame seemed awfully far away from those wide hips of hers! I still have 200 pounds to go to truly teach that fat ass a lesson about messing with me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack leaned back and smiled \"200 more pounds. That seems fair.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a few weeks since the incident on the crew deck and Jack had been enjoying Miranda\u2019s misery, she had been watching Miranda around the ship, wearing sweats as none of her old suits fit her expanded frame anymore. Thankfully for Miranda her new suit was eventually designed and made, it had been specially designed by Mordin to stretch extensively along with Miranda\u2019s ballooning frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Miranda, Mordin was still working with Jack on her revenge, meaning the resulting suit although expandable enough to contain Miranda\u2019s growth, was also ridiculously skin tight and contained nothing to support the fatter body the suit contained. Jack had also asked that it be designed to be low cut, to expose her growing cleavage as much as possible. The suit having little support, while also being skin tight meant Miranda\u2019s body sagged and jiggled freely when she moved, while also having every curve, fold and dimple prominently on display when she was still, this made the once trim cheerleader look ridiculous flaunting her oversized body to the crew as if she still retained her old figure. <br>\r\nMiranda had questioned the need for such a large gap in the top of her suit but to Jacks delight Mordin gave the excuse that he didn\u2019t have enough fabric to cover Miranda\u2019s \u2018expanded frame\u2019 Jack had laughed for a solid 10 minutes when Mordin showed her the clip of Miranda\u2019s reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t have enough material to cover my \u2018expanded frame!\u201d Miranda had yelled at Mordin. Mordin to his credit had stayed perfectly calm \u201cMaterial is rare\u2026 hard to produce\u2026 limited quantities. Available\u2026 no offence about size increase intended.\u201d This had enraged Miranda even more \u201cIs there something wrong with my size?! Are you saying I\u2019m fat?!\u201d screamed Miranda, \u201cCrewmate Miranda has experienced sudden adipose build up no? requires investigating no?\u201d said Mordin. \u201cNo it does not! i had a slight wardrobe malfunction that\u2019s all!\u201d said Miranda continuing to be angry. \u201cCertain? Weighing takes little time\u201d \u201cFine!\u201d Miranda had said begrudgingly Mordin produced a set of scales. \u201cremove clothes for accuracy\u201d Miranda shot Mordin an angry glare but did as she was told exposing her newly rotund figure and plump rear, jiggling as she shimmied off the too tight sweats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, excellent. You are currently 243 earth pounds, an increase of 108 pounds since last visit nearly 100% increase in weight, via adipose, if you are attempting to attract a mate you are doing an excellent job\u201d Mordin said cheerfully. Miranda had gone pale, \u201c243 pounds! The machine is wrong, it must be!\u201d said Miranda angrily \u201cNo, machine is accurate, human expression apt for this scenario \u2018Lay off the sweets fatty\u2019. Is this correct usage or is human football chant \u2018you ate all the pies\u2019 more suitable?\u201d Said Mordin clearly lost in his own train of thought comprehending human social interactions. Miranda stared at him with a sheer look of anger on her chubby cheeks too angry to shout at him. Mordin handed Miranda the suit \u201cPlease attempt to fit mass inside suit, must check if correct measurements due to your increase in mass\u201d Miranda still angry, did as she was told and with lots of tugging, shimming and jiggling eventually fit herself inside the suit. \u201cIt\u2019s too tight Mordin!\u201d Yelled Miranda \u201cNo, suit intentionally tight, designed for expansion\u201d Replied Mordin. \u201cExpansion?! You think I\u2019m going to get fatter than this?!\u201d \u201cobservation of crewman Miranda\u2019s high fat dietary model indicates 99.9% chance of continued adipose build up\u201d He poked Miranda\u2019s gut \u201cThis likely to be permanent addition\u201d \"But much larger\" he added. <br>\r\nMiranda batted his finger away and stomped out causing ripples and waves to move along her \u2018adipose build up\u2019. When the video had finished, Jack was in tears of laughter \u201coh Mordin you are the best!\u201d Exclaimed Jack as she hugged him \u201cthank you!\u201d \u201cNo trouble crewman Jack, addition, suit, designed to increase effect of powder on wearer\u201d Replied Mordin \u201cwait so Miranda is going to get even fatter?!\u201d Jack squealed in excitement \"Yes, i thought going the 'whole hog' with crewmen Miranda was helpful\" replied Mordin \u201cThank you so much for your help Mordin!\u201d. Jack practically skipped out of the office with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few weeks since Miranda got her new suit and it appears Mordin\u2019s calculations were correct, even though Jack had not been applying any of the powder to Miranda\u2019s meals she had continued to plump up from the residual effect of the powder increasing her appetite, an extra 30 pounds had crept its way onto Miranda\u2019s fattening frame. Frustrating Miranda to no end and giving Jack no end of glee.<br>\r\nA few weeks later when she thought Miranda had finally gotten used to her new size and Jack had gotten bored of her being this size she decided now was the time for the next \u2018great expansion\u2019 \u201cLooks like princess piggy needs a top up to keep her properly fat and hungry\u201d Jack thought to herself a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days passed and Jack was reading a book when Miranda came in for lunch, a big smile on her fat face, her gut swaying as she walked in seemingly trying to own being fat \"Oh, always the princess, even a morbidly obese 275-pound princess\" Jack thought angrily. Miranda had immediately walked past the salad and fruits on display and made her way to the more fat laden items on the menu, piling up her plate with large pastries, savoury pies, cakes, thick cut bacon sandwiches pizzas, and 3 sticks of butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously, she\u2019 not taking Mordins advice to \u2018cut back on the sweets fatty\u2019\u201d she thought with a grin. \u201cDo you really need 3 whole sticks of butter along with all that food!?\u201d to Jacks surprise she did, Miranda covered all of the pastries and cakes with thick slabs of butter as she prepared her food \"That's right Miranda cover your food in lard so it matches your fat gut\" Jack thought to herself while Miranda absentmindedly continued to spread the butter on her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack used to wonder how one woman\u2019s stomach could possibly have room for so much fattening food, but she was no longer surprised when Miranda sat her fat butt down on the bench with her piles of food overflowing the tray and her oversized \u2018Bulge\u2019 drinks that comically matched the overflowing of Miranda\u2019s gut onto her lap. Jack knew she couldn\u2019t play the ploy of her distraction again it would be too obvious that the distraction was just a diversion to spike her food, and that Miranda didn't need to pay any attention to it \u201cBesides with that hungry look on her face I doubt she would notice it anyways\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Jack had decided that she would use her biotic powers to \u2018pause\u2019 Miranda while she applied the powder to the food. Miranda reached out to grab her first item of food and Jack exerted some mental effort and familiar blue aura surrounded Miranda's frame, freezing her in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack needed to be quick it was very hard work keeping Miranda \u2018paused\u2019 for so long while she applied the powder. Jack sprinkled a large amount of the powder all over the food and into her drinks. Jack also decided that this was not nearly a big enough amount of food for such a large 'princess' so she grabbed a couple more, large pieces of everything fattening and placed it on Miranda's tray with a nice heavy sprinkling of powder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time, she was done Jack was suffering a severe nose bleed from the effort of holding Miranda in place for so long. Jack made her way back to her seat, she sat back down regained her original position and released her control giving a sigh of relief as she did so. When Miranda was released she swayed back and forth on the bench causing her suit and the bench to give a loud creak as she moved \u201cCrap, my head. Ugh I feel so dizzy, my blood sugar must be low or something, I haven\u2019t eaten in ages\u201d said Miranda, this was clearly far from the truth as the many chocolate smears on Miranda\u2019s suit could attest to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is there more food here?\" \"crap\" thought Jack \"I overdid it\" but right as Miranda had a puzzled look on her face her stomach gave an audible growl \"Bah who cares I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just imagining it, besides its health food apples and what not\" said Miranda poking an enourmas slice of apple pie as Jack breathed a sigh of relief.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda happily reached for her food once again, the smile on her face growing wider as she began to shovel fat laden treats into her waiting mouth, as she seemingly inhaled the spiked food, Jack began to video Miranda\u2019s binge as she always did, it always helped to lift her spirts to rewatch Miranda\u2019s descent into obesity whenever she was down. Once again Miranda\u2019s body began to surge outwards becoming rounder with newly formed fat, causing her new suit to creak under the strain of holding the already over weight woman. Her lower half was the main site of expansion again, her thighs started to fatten drastically, and began to push into each other forcing Miranda\u2019s Legs to open wider as the thighs grew fatter and fatter as more food was being turned into fat. The new skin tight suit let Jack see the new dimples forming all over Miranda's thighs as she expanded outwards on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda\u2019s legs were quickly followed by her enormous ass cheeks, once the pride of her perfect body each of her cheeks were now as large as her original butt, however there was no longer any semblance of the tone which helped make them the jewel of her figure. Her ass was now 2 very large balls of sagging fat which hung heavily from the main bulk of Miranda\u2019s body, there were dimples all over her giant ass which was only growing bigger from her continued gorging. As she ate her ass continued to spread heavily across two seats of the bench as it wobbled its way from Miranda's main body. While the back half of her fat ass had grown so large that half of it sagged off the edge of the bench as her ass grew even fatter and wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next place to bulge outwards was her gut, the already large band of fat surrounding her mid-section pushed outwards from the centre of Miranda\u2019s body, pumping up her spare tire heavily, going from Car tire to Bus tire. Her gut which had been gently resting on her thighs began to quickly grow wider and fatter as she ate, the added weight started to push down on Miranda's widening thighs. Her stomach was stretching against the sides of her suit, growing outwards to form a mountain of fat in her midsection. Her growing gut started filling in the multiple small fat rolls on her side into 2 large thick and flabby ones, making a crease in the middle where her waist used to be. The lower half of the fat hung heavily on the fat which was overflowing from her legs and ass, giving Miranda\u2019s side the appearance of an oversized triple layered wedding cake. \"No doubt she'd eat an entire cake like that herself\" Jack thought with glee watching the fat woman gorge herself. <br>\r\nThe front of her stomach which when she had sat down was already a third of the way down her fat thighs was quickly pushing itself closer towards her knees, as it grew fatter, a smaller band of fat started to form above the main bulk of her gut pushing outward more slowly than the main gut, giving Miranda one large solid gut and a smaller spare tire sitting heavily above it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda\u2019s upper half had not been spared this onslaught either, her arms which were already starting to sag before, had truly become meaty, her upper arms were fat enough to rival large haunches of meat, jiggling, bouncing and swaying as Miranda filled her fat face with even more food, her hands which were once lithe and dainty were now fat and sausage like, even covered in grease and melted butter from the food she had been stuffing down her gullet. Her lower arms too had become fat, they were as fat as Miranda\u2019s upper arms just a few short weeks ago, but with far less definition and much more flab hanging from them \u201cBingo wings, from chicken wings\u201d thought Jack happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts eventually started to grow and when they did they started to grow fat, heavy and saggy from the new large amount of weight being piled on them, Miranda\u2019s prize breasts had become oversized sagging watermelons stuffed in a suit. Although they still maintained most their shape, growing much larger, rounder and fatter they would not for long if the woman continued to gorge and overfeed herself. Miranda\u2019s breasts started aggressively pushing against the new fabric which contained them fighting to break free from their too small confines but slowly the fabric gave way expanding with the lardy woman. This added weight made each of Miranda\u2019s breasts much larger than Jacks head, the new fat on Miranda\u2019s breasts was also spilling out of the top of her suit pushing its way to her grease stained mouth and chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda\u2019s neck had become much thicker and had started to become one with Miranda\u2019s jawline which was slowly giving way to the fat enveloping her face erasing her once defined jawline and replacing it with fat jowls. Miranda\u2019s double chin started growing wider and deeper as more and more fattening food passed Miranda\u2019s plump lips, eventually a third chin began to develop beneath the second, with all three chins quivering as her jaw worked on chewing her food. Her cheeks had not been spared either they had grown fat and puffy and covered her once prominent cheek bones, removing the last traces of her once sharp and angelic features and giving way to the fat which covered her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as the feeding frenzy had started it finished, the last slice of pie passed Miranda\u2019s fat lips and a calm came over the morbidly obese woman. Miranda leaned back with a contented look on her face, sighed and gave her fat stomach a rub, even Miranda\u2019s gentle rubbing was able to produce wobbling from the rest of her body. Then suddenly she seemed to snap out of it as she realised, her stomach had not been anywhere near this large when she started her meal, she poked it as if in disbelief that it was actually her. \u201cNO! no this crap again! My beautiful body covered in lard!\u201d Miranda said angrily, she grabbed a nearby reflective tray and looked at the damage, she slowly poked a fat finger into her face, and it sunk deeply into her fat pale flesh, she then gripped her fleshy chins and gave it a shake, \u201cI\u2019m a whale!\u201d She yelled. \u201cHeh if you think you\u2019re fat now wait until I\u2019m done with you\u201d thought Jack smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda then tried to stand with far more effort than she should of needed \u201capparently she\u2019s been skipping her workouts as well as becoming a big fat piggy\u201d thought Jack. When Miranda finally stood up with a loud grunt that was when Jack got the full picture, Miranda was a real sight, Jack imagined she looked similar to the spirit of gluttony as Miranda stood their panting from the effort of standing. She had grease and butter all over her hands, face and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was now easily more than twice as wide as Jack, her stomach hung heavily over her groin, her belly button which was clearly outlined against her suit had become a crater in the middle of the big fat dome that was her stomach. Her fat face gave away the fact she was winded from standing \u201cbloody hell she looks like Mrs Claus let herself go, she must have put on a good 150 pounds the fat pig\u201d thought Jack. Miranda started grabbing folds of her new fat and letting it drop causing a loud slapping sound and ripples all over her body. Miranda opened up her suit slightly and stuck her finger in her belly button and it swallowed her fat finger whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda still in a state of shock and disbelief continued to play with her fat, she lifted up her new huge gut and dropped it letting it hang off her as a big fat weight, she squeezed her butt cheeks to try and find the muscles underneath the fat and pulled away when she couldn\u2019t find them. Miranda squeezed and shook her arms watching her new flab hanging off her shake and wobble. She tried lifting her leg up and found her gut and the new-found weight was stopping her from lifting it very high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was when Miranda started to walk off angrily towards the door that Jack felt truly happy, \u201cShe\u2019s waddling!!!! She\u2019s too fat to walk properly!\u201d she thought to herself with glee, Miranda\u2019s normal long powerful stride had been replaced by an awkward waddling stride that made Miranda\u2019s new fat sway, bounce and ripple as she lumbered towards the door. Halfway to the door she stopped suddenly, the movement causing her fat to bounce as her large stomach growled loudly, \u201cokay one last thing but something small, I\u2019m fat enough already!\u201d said Miranda she said through loud pants \u201chardly\u201d thought Jack snidely, as Miranda\u2019s fat body back tracked towards the food cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!? You\u2019ve become as fat as a small whale and you still want more you big fat tub of lard!\u201d. Miranda waddled over the cart took a couple of large apple pies and a tray of hot dogs, munching on them, with an angry look on her face as she made her way out of the door panting heavily from the effort her fat hips nearly brushing the door as she waddled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god she eats and eats and eats! She\u2019s become a true glutton! That doorway is looking awfully small for such a fat whale of a woman, once or twice more with the powder and she will stick in that doorway and not even that butter you\u2019ve been filling yourself with will be able to slip you out of it, then we will see if that\u2019s enough fat on her to be even with me\u201d Thought Jack with a grin on her face as she watched Miranda\u2019s engorged backside exit the crew deck.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda stomped as fast as her new waddling stride would allow towards the medical bay, shoving the last pieces of food she had taken from the mess hall into her mouth, making her newly formed blubber jiggle, but she didn\u2019t care she was angry. She had just put on a good 150 pounds in under an hour, and she wanted answers. She stomped her way through multiple baffled crewmen who stared at the previously slim, woman who was now 3 times her original size, covered in various food stains, wearing a suit which showed off her obese frame and barrelling quickly past them. Miranda heard a few comments along the lines of \u201cwow she has gotten fat!\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t believe I used to fantasise about that whale\u201d \u201cSomeone let themselves go\u201d. Miranda ignored them all she had more pressing matters than people talking about her enlarged rear end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the medical bay red faced and winded her body covered in sweat, unused to carrying such a large amount of fat. She leaned against the door as she composed herself and tried to catch her breath back and the door suddenly opened, causing her blubber to give a loud smack as her body hit the floor causing her to wobble as she hit the floor causing a few female crewmen walking by to giggle. She got up on her hands and glared at them and they quickly walked away, she noticed that her gut and breasts were still dragging on the floor when she was on her hands \u201cDammit how could this happen!\u201d Miranda thought to herself, she turned her head and looked behind at her back, it had once been smooth and taught now she had multiple fat rolls folding into each other and fat was spilling out from the main bulk of her body onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda put her head into her hands and groaned, she was undeniably fat now no point denying it, she needed to diet and exercise to get back her old body, if that was even possible now and she needed help to do it. Miranda got up onto her feet again, taking much more effort than it should of winding herself in the process. \u201cBloody hell this is just embarrassing\u201d she muttered to herself as the door closed behind her. She had never had any reason to be embarrassed before, she had always been perfect in every regard she had been graceful, toned and sexy with not a hint of excess fat anywhere on her body that was a world away from the fat, lumbering and flabby woman standing in the sick bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMordin! Mordin I need assistance!\u201d she called into the medical bay, a moment later Dr. Karin Chakwas walked through a door, \u201cah Miranda, Mordin is currently busy at the moment, but he told me to expect you, I\u2019m guessing this is related to your weight?\u201d she asked giving Miranda\u2019s flabby body a long look, \u201cWell for your information doctor Chakwas I need Mordin\u2019s help devising a diet and exercise plan to work off this unseemly fat, and Mordin is the best doctor on the ship by far\u201d Miranda said impatiently waddling further into the sick bay as Karin\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cPlease Miranda call me Karin, and I\u2019m afraid that Mordin cannot be disturbed. So, take a seat, one of the stronger ones please\u201d Karin said with sickly sweetness. Miranda shot her a look but sat on the chair usually designed for Krogans her extensive butt cheeks spilling off the edges. Karin\u2019s look became amused when she sat on the reinforced chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Miranda what precisely do you want for me to do to help?\u201d \u201cI need help creating I diet and exercise programme to quickly lose weight, I know it may be hard for someone like you to understand but I actually take pride in my body.\u201d Miranda said haughtily Karin smiled and started to take a scan of Miranda\u2019s body, \u201cMy my Miranda, my scan shows you\u2019ve been certainly packing it away since your last visit, haven\u2019t you?\u201d She poked Miranda\u2019s resting belly. \u201cJust tell me what the damage is and what I can do to get rid of it\u201d \u201cWell since you\u2019ve asked so nicely Miranda. Your weight has increased by 187 pounds since your last visit, to a total of 287 pounds\u2019 gain, to put it bluntly, you\u2019re \u2018a real tubbo\u2019.\u201d Karin smirked as she brought up a before and after of Miranda. \u201cAnother way of putting it is that you are currently 427 pounds and incredibly morbidly obese. Any way you put it you are fat fat fat. As for the cause of your weight gain, you should look no further than your obesogenic diet, you have consumed far, FAR more than what a normal Krogan male eats let alone what a human should consume! My scans show that you consumed multiple full sticks of butter recently, for what possible reason did you consume such high quantities of pure fat?\u201d Miranda\u2019s anger flared under the insults as Karin looked at her incredulously \u201cI was hungry, butter seemed like a good choice especially as it is one of my few indulgences\u201d Miranda said snappily \u201cYes I can see that you were hungry from that enormous rear end that you\u2019re sporting and no, for someone of your size indulging on entire sticks of butter is never a good choice\u201d Criticised Karin \u201cBut it can\u2019t just be overindulging in butter that made me put on this much weight so quickly\u201d \u201cWell it may have been all of the other food you\u2019ve been shovelling down your throat\u201d Miranda\u2019s anger started to fade as she realised what the doctor was saying was true. \u201cCould you at least check to make sure doctor?\u201d she said the last word with thinly veiled contempt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you insist, i suppose it is possible that you may have something else wrong with you. Maybe someone messed up your gene sequence when they were editing you or maybe they did it on purpose to get back at the illusive man, or maybe they thought it would be funny to see the perfect woman a whale, I certainly do. Either way, I need more information on your daily diet to make a full analysis of your situation. You may skip chocolate and butter from your list as I can see you enjoy them quite frequently\u201d Karin pointed towards the multiple butter and chocolate stains smeared across her white suit. \u201cI\u2019ve been under a lot of stress recently\u201d Miranda said defensively, \u201cAs is your brand new suit\u201d replied Karin, as she pulled on the suit around Miranda\u2019s middle, it came away with much less give than there was originally, Karin let the suit ping back causing a large wave to form across Miranda\u2019s flabby gut sitting heavily on her lap, making Miranda\u2019s face turn from pink to red with embarrassment. \u201cEnough doctor! I need help with a diet and exercise plan and pointing out the obvious fact that I\u2019m morbidly obese is not helping!\u201d \u201cTrue, but making fun of someone who hasn\u2019t exactly been the nicest to me is very cathartic. Now if you please, can I have information on your current diet  so I can help you lose some of this blubber.\u201d \u201cSo you will help me lose it?\u201d Miranda said hopefully \u201cYes I will, if only because if you get any fatter you\u2019ll be better as a cannon ball than an operative against the reapers, now can we finally get onto your diet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda sighed and reluctantly used her omni tool to bring up a long list of her extensive food requisitions over the last few weeks \u201cReady to write this down?\u201d Karin nodded \u201cBegin when you are ready\u201d \u201cOkay well it started a few months ago, I was just having something to drink a hot chocolate, it was one of my few indulgences and I just started to get really intense hunger pangs, originally I was able to ignore them but, they kept up for a while and then I was eating a meal one day the hunger got much worse and I started craving heavy and high fat foods, my meals got bigger and bigger and then they stopped filling me up so I started snacking on things only one or two times between meals at the beginning and then I eventually just kept stuffing my face with chocolates, crisps that sort of thing almost constantly and I never felt full\u201d Miranda said sadly remembering her waddle down her current path \u201cInteresting Miranda, your symptoms mimic that of a parasite I once encountered. It causes the victim to constantly overeat, normally high calorie foods, although\u201d Karin paused and grabbed a large handful of Miranda\u2019s fat \u201cit usually absorbs the nutrients from the victim not let them keep them until they turn into, a giant butterball. But I\u2019m fairly certain you don\u2019t have that, I think you\u2019re just a glutton.\u201d Karin said mockingly as she squeezed Miranda\u2019s gut before letting go of it and let it slap back onto her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda gave her an angry look after the word \u2018butterball\u2019 but Karin didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cNow lets get onto obviously your favourite topic, food.\u201d Miranda scowled but started reading from her omni tool \u201cOkay for breakfast I normally have 6 large scones with butter, full fat cream, and jam, usually with a couple of pint glasses of full fat milk, 3 croissants with the same additions as the scones, and a bowl of those sugar frosted flakes also with full fat milk\u201d she said looking down at her gut and wondered how much of it was from dairy. Karin looked part stunned part bemused as she wrote it down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides I thought you were proud of your body?\u201d Miranda winced, she had been arrogant and now she was paying for it \u201cYour mid-day meal?\u201d asked Karin. \u201cThat changes every day, but it tends to be something, greasy and high fat\u201d \u201cObviously, you wouldn\u2019t be here if you overindulged in salads.\u201d \u201cI can do without the snide remarks doctor\u201d snapped Miranda \u201cYou could do without second and third helpings but you obviously ignored that advice\u201d replied Karin shutting down any retorts Miranda had. Miranda grumbled but carried on with her list. \u201cI usually have one or two deep dish pizzas with extra cheese, stuffed crust and meats, a couple pies either pork or chicken mostly, some of those large \u2018bulge\u2019 soda\u2019s, some burgers with cheese and bacon, hot dogs, chips and desserts such as ice cream, cakes, cookies and sweet pies apple, chocolate treacle normally.\u201d  in the end, Miranda\u2019s breathing had grown heavy and her mouth was watering at the thought of all that rich fattening food and the familiar hunger pangs were beginning to make their way back into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour final meal? Or should I say meals in your case?\u201d said Karin handing Miranda a tissue to wipe up the drool around her mouth \u201cMiranda calm please, try to control your stomach, I know that may be difficult for you\u201d as if on que Miranda\u2019s stomach started to growl loudly. Miranda tried sucking in her stomach to stop it growling but, it only served to make her stomach jiggle causing Miranda to turn red with embarrassment again \u201cDinner is usually the same as lunch but it\u2019s larger and there is more dessert involved...\u201d Until now she hadn\u2019t realised just what she had been stuffing herself with daily, no wonder she was finding the ship smaller and more cramped than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Miranda. If you condition turns out to be suitably interesting I may write a paper on it, with your permission of course, I was trying to think of the title for it maybe \u2018Belt busting in space?\u2019 or does that sound too much like a bad erotica? Or how about \u2018Expanding Horizons, Expanding waistlines\u2019? \u2018Pig in space\u2019? \u2018Creating the perfect woman gone wrong\u2019?\u201d \u201cNone of those titles are fair! I have a condition!\u201d Grumbled Miranda sourly. \u201cYes, yes, you\u2019re \u2018Big Boned\u2019 I\u2019m sure but as my medical licence will attest to\u201d She grabbed Miranda\u2019s stomach on either side and gave it a shake \u201cMuscle and Bone don\u2019t jiggle, fat however does.\u201d Miranda was staring daggers at Karin as she let go of her gut and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin walked over to a cupboard and opened it, Miranda saw Karin take out a large chocolate bar of some kind and even though she was furious her mouth began to water,  as Karin handed it to Miranda \u201cHere, sate yourself with this while I work out the damage you are doing to yourself, it\u2019s a battlefield ration, Mordin designed it to provide an entire weeks\u2019 worth of calories in one bar while also making it taste far better than the standard stuff, it also sates a person\u2019s hunger better than normal food, so it should take the edge off even your hunger.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not some sort of addict doctor. I\u2019m just hungry\u201d \u201cMiranda you just told me your diet and it\u2019s hard to see you as anything other than a junk food junkie, especially given your current size and situation\u201d With that she gave Miranda\u2019s stomach a final slap and walked off leaving Miranda scowling at her remarks munching on the chocolate bar she handed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the bar quickly and it did at least take the edge off her hunger, but there was still a large pit in her stomach. She got up grunting at the effort and spent a few minutes walking around the medical bay, trying to distract herself from her hunger, trying to not raid the cupboard. Eventually her willpower gave out and she waddled quickly over to the cupboard, opened it and had a look at the bars, most of them were marked \u2018NOT FOR CONSUMPTION! LETHAL\u2019 apparently Mordin\u2019s recipe had needed some serious tweaking she found only 2 bars which did not have the label on them. Her fat fingers not as nimble as they had been, struggled at the wrappers for a minute. When she finally got, them open she was so hungry that when she opened them, she shoved them both in her mouth at once and quickly chewed and swallowed them she let out a sigh of relief as the bars found their way into her enormous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Miranda was finishing off the chocolate bars Karin walked back in and Miranda turned around chocolate smeared on her fat face \u201cMiranda! Are you completely incapable of controlling yourself around food for five minutes?\u201d Karin said laughing \u201cI\u2026 I can explain! They were mine I was saving them from earlier!\u201d Miranda replied panicked \u201cNo need to lie Miranda. Besides where could you have kept them? The folds of your gut? I think not. However, the results of your thievery should become very apparent shortly\u201d \u201cWait what do you mean? Am I going to die?!\u201d Said Miranda worried. \u201cI mean my dear that those were prototypes, completely useless as a substitute, they had a major flaw you see, far too many calories in them to be of any use, your soldiers would quickly become too fat to fight if they ate those too often, as well as increasing hunger not removing it\u201d Miranda\u2019s face turned pale \u201cIs it much weight?\u201d Miranda said slightly panicked \u201cOh no my dear, well not much to you anyways. You\u2019re already a whale so around 25 pounds per bar, shouldn\u2019t be too much for you unless, you\u2019ve been stuffing you face the whole time I\u2019ve been gone?\u201d \u201cNo I haven\u2019t thank you very much, I only had two\u201d grumbled Miranda angrily but still relived she wasn\u2019t going to burst her suit again. \u201cNo need to get angry Miranda, you\u2019re lucky I\u2019m only mocking you and I didn\u2019t give you one of the fattening chocolate bars to spite you, it\u2019s not like you could of resisted it. So, far no one has eaten these bars before so this is an excellent opportunity to record the effects that it has on humans as well as learning about your weight gain for my paper\u201d \u201cAnd for treating me, right?\u201d \u201cWhat? Oh yes, yes of course. Now waddle over there while I video you, quickly now before you get fatter\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda reluctantly waddled over to where Karin had indicated \u201cIs here okay?\u201d she asked reservedly \u201cYes, that\u2019s perfect Miranda. Oh yes, I forgot to mention by the way I completed my calculations, on average you\u2019re exceeding your calorific requirements by around 7500 calories, that is around two pounds of fat added to your body every day.\u201d \u201cTwo pounds a day?!\u201d Screamed Miranda causing her body to wobble like jelly. \u201cCorrect, however you may find comfort in knowing most of the issues related to weight gain were eliminated years ago so you can continue to pudge up to your buttery heart\u2019s desire!\u201d \u201cThat does not give me any comfort! And my desire is to lose this weight not gain more! Can\u2019t you just give me lipo suction? But maybe leave some in my boobs?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not, I won\u2019t bore you with the details but if we don\u2019t get that hunger of yours under control lipo suction won\u2019t help at all now stand still and hush, you\u2019ve started to grow\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karin was not wrong as a familiar feeling came over Miranda, her expanding body pressed against a tight suit as fat cells formed under her skin. Miranda\u2019s butt as always was the first area of growth, it started to steadily push out from her body jiggling as it did so, causing her new suit to creak under the added stress, it grew tighter on her body showing off her deepening ass crack. It showed her enormous ass becoming larger with newly formed flab as her butt began to sag heavily losing the last traces of its once round shape and forming a much larger mass of wobbling fat. Her hips grew wider with her rear end, adding a couple extra inches to her already expansive waistline as her body surged outwards. Her thickening thighs caused Miranda\u2019s stance to become wider as her legs as more fat piled onto her thighs. The already prominent dimples over Miranda's thighs and ass grew as more cellulite covered her pale flesh as she expanded outwards until the fattening thighs reached the end of the materials stretching point and her leg smoothed out stopping just before her legs burst her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut gurgled and then began to push itself outward, the jiggling main mass of her sloping gut expanding outwards from her body, followed quickly by the smaller, but growing larger band of fat on top. Her stomach began thickening and stretching at the sides which grew into her already prominent muffin top which eventually became too fat for the belt to hold up and began to sag over Miranda\u2019s belt, which although had been made of the same stretchy material was starting to reach its upper limit. Her stomach stretching against the sides of her suit removed the last of the creases that were present on the suit giving her body a very smooth appearance. The fat rolls on her side thickened and grew taller as the fat made its way onto her body pushing her further into obesity.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda\u2019s upper half quickly followed their lower counterparts, her arms which were already jiggling, bouncing and swaying as Miranda\u2019s body filled outwards, were becoming as thick as her thighs had once been, but without the same tone and definition. Her fat face still covered in some of the chocolate grew puffier her third chin grew fatter and sagged from her thick fleshy neck.  Her cheeks puffed up pushing outwards, making her face rounder and softer. Her hands and fingers which were already fat and sausage like grew softer as fat continued to surround her fingers and knuckles making her fist as larger and softer. Her lower arms too had more weight piled onto of them giving her forearms the look of a giant sausage wrapped in a tight white case. Her breasts started to push outwards from their prison in Miranda\u2019s over stuffed suit putting great strain on the buttons on the side of her suit holding in her fat body. To Miranda\u2019s relief her breasts still maintained most their shape, growing larger as the last parts of the fat settled itself on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Miranda that was fascinating, but I fear you may need an even larger suit soon\u201d She said attempting to pull on her suit and being unable to pinch anything but flesh. \u201cIf you want to know I can now confidently say that that you are the proud owner of a 500 pound ball of flab that you call your body. So, congratulations on hitting the big five double o\u201d Said Karin with a wide grin as Miranda\u2019s shoulders sagged realising that she had just made it that much harder for her to get rid of her extra weight all because she couldn\u2019t control herself for 5 minutes. \u201cThanks Karin.\u201d Mumbled Miranda hanging her head as she did so, causing her chins to stick out beneath her head. \u201cNow now keep those chubby chins up we still have tests to do, I\u2019ll even get you some ice cream would you like that?\u201d Miranda looked up and nodded, her chins wobbling as she did so \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit! During your expansion, I was scanning you and I\u2019ve found out its definitely not a parasite or a bacterium, I can\u2019t rule out a virus until we get you doing some physical activity so let\u2019s get you out of that too small suit and onto that treadmill, I think a reinforced one will be called for. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Karin said giving Miranda a pat on her fleshy back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karin with some effort got out a large treadmill from one of the larger upper cupboards and laid it down on the floor letting out her breath when she did so. The treadmill was wide and it had handles on the side to grip onto. \u201cwhew that thing was heavy. Okay Miranda get on, let\u2019s hope you don\u2019t break it.\u201d Miranda at this point was just ignoring the insults as she waddled her way onto the treadmill after she got on a robotic voice loudly announced \u201cWARNING, USER WEIGHT IS NEAR OPERATIONAL MAXIMUM\u201d \u201cWell did you hear that you just about fit onto a heavy duty treadmill, I guess it\u2019s all that pride in your body weighing you down eh?\u201d She gave Miranda\u2019s belly a sharp pinch, Miranda just looked down at her large stomach, defeated. \u201cNot talking to me? I didn\u2019t hurt your feelings, did I?\u201d She asked mockingly asked Miranda didn\u2019t reply. \u201cNever mind then, get off the treadmill I\u2019ve got something for you to exercise in\u201d This provoked a response from Miranda, \u201cWait what? Can\u2019t I just exercise in my suit?\u201d \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed your suit is close to bursting run in it and you will likely just pop right out, besides your movement is restricted in it how am I supposed to get an accurate reading?\u201d \u201cFine\u201d Miranda said with a sigh \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d Karin walked off and started to root through a cupboard and turned around holding a bright pink micro bikini. Miranda blinked \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me! I\u2019m not wearing that!\u201d \u201cWhat? Not your colour? I thought princesses loved pink?\u201d Karin asked innocently \u201cIt\u2019s far to small it doesn\u2019t cover anything, I refuse to wear it!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t throw a tantrum, I don\u2019t see you have any choice, I have nothing else that will fit those flabby watermelons of yours, nor anything that will fit your hippo hips, and as I just explained I can\u2019t use readings you do in your suit they are inaccurate which means I can\u2019t help you so\u201d Karin gestured for Miranda to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda waddled over angrily and took the micro bikini with a pudgy hand and waddled off behind a screen to change. When Miranda undid the top button on the suit her fat breasts came surging forward glad that the pressure had finally been relieved the same happened on each of her other buttons as more and more fat poured out as the suit without the pressure from Miranda\u2019s body shrunk back to its original size. When she got down to her hips she undid the belt and the fat beneath the belt which had been contained came forth filling up the space beneath her muffin top \u201cAt least I\u2019m symmetrical\u201d Miranda thought to herself quickly glancing at her exposed breasts, she had stopped wears bra\u2019s weeks ago as she had grown far too large for any of her old sexy lace black ones. When she tried to pull the suit down off of her legs she lost her balance and fell flat on her ass with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin came rushing round the screen when she heard the noise to find a fat naked Miranda nursing her ass. \u201cOh, you just fell over, I thought you might have had a heart attack with all the butter hitting you heart\u201d \u201cNo doctor I just fell over\u201d Miranda replied sourly. \u201cNo need to be so tart with me, you\u2019ve had enough of those.\u201d With that snide remark, Karin walked back into the main part of the medical bay leaving the obese woman sitting on her wobbling ass. Miranda eventually got into the Micro bikini it was so small it barely covered her nipples and provided even less support than her suit letting her breasts bounce freely. The lower half of the bikini wasn\u2019t much better Miranda was far too large for the bikini bottom to cover anything it just rode straight up Miranda\u2019s ass crack; the sides had found themselves sitting in one of Miranda\u2019s large folds while her hanging gut covered the front part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda came around the screen red faced with embarrassment as Karin started laughing at the spectacle in front of her, she spent a good 30 seconds laughing before finally saying with a massive grin \u201cI never knew I needed something so much without ever knowing it, you\u2019re like a cow in a bikini!\u201d She burst into another fit of laughter and started to take a video as Miranda uselessly tried to cover herself, she had always felt so sexy in a bikini especially in one so small, now she felt every inch of exposed jiggling flesh and cringed. Karin eventually stopped laughing and composed herself. \u201cOkay, whew, let\u2019s get you on the treadmill now shall we, or do I need to roll you?\u201d \u201cno\u2026 I can do it myself\u201d Miranda walked back over to the treadmill and stepped on it and the same message played \u201cWARNING, USER WEIGHT IS NEAR OPERATIONAL MAXIMUM\u201d \u201cOkay Miranda I\u2019m going to video this as well and as you are obviously not in the best physical shape, which is quite frankly an understatement, we will start you off at a slow walking pace and we will speed it up from there okay?\u201d Miranda nodded causing the all too familiar feeling of chins jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin started the machine and the treadmill began to move slowly, enough to match Miranda\u2019s normal waddling pace. Miranda started off with no difficulty but within 20 seconds her breathing increased and she began to sweat, her entire upper half bouncing with each of her heavy steps she gripped onto the sides of the treadmill to help her along \u201cOh come on Miranda this is the lowest setting surely you can do better than this, you are genetically enhanced after all\u201d Miranda was enhanced and she had no doubt that had she not been she would have been unable to of kept going for this long. Another minute passed and Miranda got used to it her breathing settled and she wasn\u2019t so red faced. \u201cOkay good you seem to be getting used to it lets put you up to a normal human walking pace\u201d Karin increased the speed of the treadmill and Miranda increased her waddling pace with it, as she did so the swaying of her fat increased as well, each of her steps sent a large shockwave through her soft pale flesh. Miranda began to pant and sweat, beads rolling down her fat red cheeks \u201cMy god Miranda your fat is hypnotic. Seriously all that flesh bouncing around it\u2019s like you\u2019re human jelly I always dismissed hypnosis as a pseudoscience but your wobbling ass cheeks might just be what they were missing! The only issue is that if they saw the whole of you walking they may wonder if you were going to eat them.\u201d Miranda was too out of breath to reply to her. \u201cYou know something Miranda, that bikini really shows off your curves, I mean you\u2019re so fat your basically all curves but still. Do you not believe me? Here have a look\u201d Karin brought a large full length mirror around so Miranda could see herself. She was a fat mess, there was sweat all over her exposed skin as well as in her many folds her thighs were wobbling constantly, this was not helped by Miranda\u2019s enormous rear end which had already been almost touching the handles on its own and now that she was moving, made it look like her entire backside had been made out of soft jelly. All Miranda could do was stare at herself, wondering how on earth she had become this obese. \u201cWell Miranda your heart rate is up so why don\u2019t we bring that jiggling mass of flesh you own up to a simple jogging pace?\u201d Miranda tried to object but all she could get out was a loud wheeze and suddenly she was jogging and without any support her flesh was bouncing around unrestricted and visible to all, her breasts were bouncing so much they broke the tiny bikini off of her and the material fell to the floor exposing Miranda\u2019s large breasts. Her breasts began slapping against her massive stomach as Miranda\u2019s slow lumbering body tried to jog. \u201cLooking at your body Miranda makes me wonder, do they do sports body suits in the same ways they do sports bras? Because honestly there is enough of you to make an entire business from it!\u201d Miranda had only been going for about 30 seconds of jogging when she began to slow down her chest heaving at the effort of trying to suck in enough air for the gargantuan woman, her legs were cramping and her vision blurring. She stopped and let the treadmill take her off when she reached there she collapsed onto the floor where she lay on her back, covered in sweat flabby body spread widely across the floor with her chest heaving as she tried to suck in oxygen. \u201cPathetic Miranda, how do you ever expect to be thin if you can\u2019t even run for a full minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thing she heard before she blacked out. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda came to when a bright light was being shone in her eyes, she moved her pudgy hand to cover her face, confused about what was happening. \u201cAhh glad to see your still alive, that would have been a terrible ending to my paper if you\u2019d of just died like that.\u201d Karin said putting away a torch. As Miranda began to wake up fully she became aware of more things around her she realised that she was laying on one of the medical beds her ass cheeks spilling off the sides, with a far too small grey sheet barely covering the large span of her stomach leaving the rest of her fat body exposed \u201curgh\u201d grumbled Miranda \u201cwhat happened?\u201d \u201cYou tried to exercise, that\u2019s what happened\u201d Miranda eventually realised the voice belonged to Karin. \u201cIf I\u2019d of known you were that unfit I would of just kept you at a waddling pace, would of saved me a lot of effort, I had to get seven people to help me move you onto the bed! Seven! Even then I was treating them afterwards for strains from carrying your fat ass into bed! Would have been easier to get a crane! But at least Jack seemed to enjoy herself\u201d Miranda turned red at the insults and the thought that so many people had seen her in such a state, especially Jack. \u201cSo... doctor, did you find out what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Miranda said hoping to change the topic. \u201cOther than your constant pigging out on junk foods, lack of exercise and vanity? No, unfortunately I\u2019ve been unsuccessful, however you don\u2019t have any of the normal problems that arise with massive obesity, no diabetes, blood pressure problems nor any other issues and given your immense size and high fat diet that is nearly impossible, true your genetics may be compensating but even so there should be some signs, not forgetting the fact you\u2019ve put on all this weight in such a short time, something must be wrong, but I\u2019m afraid i can\u2019t seem to pin it down\u201d Miranda\u2019s hopes collapsed, she had been counting on her to get back her old slender body but now those hopes were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda suddenly enraged sat up quickly and shuffled down to the edge of the bed causing the bed to bend heavily as she reached the end, her entire body to bounce wildly with the movements, and began to shout angrily at Karin \u201cYOU STUPID USELESS WOMAN! THIS IS WHY I WANTED MORDIN! HE WOULD OF ALREADY FOUND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME AND I BE BACK TO BEING ABLE TO WEAR LINGERIE AROUND THE SHIP AND HAVE EVERYONE DROOLING OVER ME!\u201d The shouting had caused Miranda\u2019s fat cheeks and sagging chins to wobble as she shouted. The effort of shouting had also winded Miranda and made her shouting much less impressive. Karin\u2019s eye\u2019s narrowed at Miranda, and Miranda immediately regretted saying anything. \u201cUseless, am I?\u201d Karin said coldly \u201cI\u2019m not the one who can\u2019t walk more than 10 steps without being winded! I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s fatter than a small elephant! I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s currently wearing a bright pink thong that can only be seen when you lift up over 200 pounds of stomach fat!\u201d To emphasise this Karin tried, and failed to lift Miranda\u2019s gut letting the small amount that she could lift slap back down onto Miranda\u2019s thighs before grabbing another handful of flesh.  Miranda shied away from Karin\u2019s raised voice and tried to move away from her grip on her stomach. \u201cIn fact, you know what? You want people to stare at you? We can arrange that!\u201d Karin walked over to wear Miranda\u2019s suit was crumpled on the floor and picked it up and walked out of the room with it leaving Miranda sitting on the medical bay attempting to cover her flabby naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Karin walked back in with what looked like Miranda\u2019s uniform and a huge tray of ice cream. \u201cI promised you ice cream I believe? Besides you must be famished, you haven\u2019t eaten in an hour you\u2019re practically wasting away\u201d Karin\u2019s voice was cold and sarcastic. She put down the uniform and handed Miranda the huge tray of ice cream and a spoon \u201cEat.\u201d The way she phrased it was not as an offer. Miranda gingerly took the tray and the spoon. The tray was heavy easily 3 or pounds worth of ice cream. \u201dI... I\u2019m not hungry\u201d Miranda was able to stammer out. \u201cOh, come now Miranda you love ice cream, its your favourite type even, cookie dough. Now, eat\u201d Karin grabbed a handful of Miranda\u2019s flab and squeezed hard, causing Miranda to yell out in pain. Miranda quickly began to shovel ice cream into her mouth as quickly as possible as Karin relaxed her grip a few months ago Miranda could have easily broken her grip and won in a fight but that was months ago now she was a fat cow of a woman shovelling ice cream into her fattening face because she was told to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda however, couldn\u2019t lie that she was loving the ice cream she was so engrossed in feeding herself she hadn\u2019t noticed the creaking coming from the bed nor that Karin had started to video her feeding making snide comments as she did so \u201cAnd here we have the feeding ritual of the great white fat woman known as Miranda or \u2018Obesus Obesus\u2019 in scientific circles\u201d Karin said sneering Miranda took little notice trying to shove as much of the ice cream into her face as quickly as possible. As Miranda shoved the food into her mouth the bed began creaking more and more as more and more of Miranda started to spill outwards \u201cMy my Miranda, 515 pounds and rising are you sure you shouldn\u2019t be watching what you eat?\u201d Karin said laughing to herself. Miranda could see the counter slowly rising as she continued to eat in a frenzy, she kept trying to pull away but the ice cream was just so good and she was just so hungry, Miranda was eating very messily with ice cream all over her face and dripping down her chins on her growing breasts, the ice cream was so cold on her skin her nipples began to harden as the rest of her softened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was halfway through her ice cream when suddenly, the bed which had been slowly getting more bent as she fattened herself up, gave one last creak and then a large SNAP as Miranda\u2019s body broke the bed sending Miranda\u2019s body plummeting down to floor. In her surprise, Miranda dropped her tray of ice cream sending it skidding on the floor as her flabby body hit the floor with an enormous thud. The fall placed Miranda on her back as Karin began laughing loudly, Miranda tried to sit up to go find her ice cream but due to her new found size could barely get her upper body off the floor leaving her red faced and winded from even trying. Miranda resolved to crawl to her ice cream as the last vestiges of her dignity were screaming to control herself, but it was no use, Miranda began to rock back and forth causing her immense belly to sway with her rocking, she eventually got up enough speed to get on her front and began to crawl on her hands and knees her, sagging breasts and enormous gut dragging along the floor as she crawled to her ice cream her dimple covered ass stuck out far in the air jiggling as Miranda\u2019s knees moved, the top of the pink thong barely visible behind around all of the fat that swallowed it. This caused Karin to laugh even harder as she doubled over in laughter at the sight of the morbidly obese woman who had been so vain and proud crawl on her hands and knees to stuff her fat face with ice cream. Miranda was thankful that her hands and knees had become so fat as it softened the blow as her immense body hit the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I never thought I\u2019d see Miranda Lawson become such a fat pig that she breaks medical beds!\u201d Miranda was only stopping to breathe in-between bites, with ice cream dripping all down her face and breasts as she ate more and more. Eventually Miranda finished the tray, still hungry she started to lick the bottom of the tray, her face and breasts to get the last vestiges of the ice cream into her stomach. Finally, Miranda got all the ice cream she could get and turned around to see Karin wiping a tear of joy from her eye, \u201coh, god, my sides! That was the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen! That has more than made up for your rudeness earlier! A naked morbidly obese tub of lard crawl on her hands and knees to feed her fat face, it was hilarious! I\u2019m so glad I videoed that! You\u2019ve earned this tubby\u201d Karin threw Miranda\u2019s uniform towards her \u201cBy the way I took some liberty and altered it, one to reduce the pressure on the material I mean my god woman you almost burst that thing with your gut! And two because you wanted people to look at you.\u201d Miranda lifted the suit and saw that Karin\u2019s \u2018liberty\u2019 had cut the entire middle section from the suit as well as removing the arms and making the suit far lower cut at the back and the front, meaning it would cover only the bottom half of her breasts leaving her, gut, back fat and most of her breasts exposed with the material likely to barely cover her nipples making it look like a too small sports bra rather than a top. The lower half of the once suit wasn\u2019t much better most of the leg coverings were gone leaving the lower half looking like they would barely cover 3 quarters of Miranda\u2019s generous backside and would dig in heavily to Miranda\u2019s fleshy sides with the front being covered by her large hanging belly. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?! What happened to my suit?!\u201d asked Miranda panicked, hoping that she was joking and that a new larger suit was just waiting in the other room, \u201cNo no that\u2019s your suit all right, I needed to rearrange some of the material for it, to fit your expanded body, and besides you wanted people to look at you, well now they won\u2019t be able to stop looking, I mean sure they\u2019ll be laughing as well but still\u201d Karin said with a grin and a shrug. \u201cBesides you know we don\u2019t have any more of the material left to make your suit big enough to encompass you, so the only option as to cut down the material to cover your urm\u2026 now\u2026 what was your recent body weight again\u2026 AH yes five hundred and fifty-four pounds\u201d Miranda\u2019s mouth dropped \u201cFIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR POUNDS! I was only five hundred 20 minutes ago!\u201d Miranda yelled, \u201cOnly five hundred?\u201d Snorted Karin \u201cOkay yes I admit it, I may have spiked the ice cream with some of the formula for the chocolate bars, little bit of payback for being so rude to me. Maybe it will teach you to be nicer in the future, besides fat people are meant to be jolly no? Now put on your suit and get out I\u2019m done with you I need to clean up this mess you\u2019ve made fatso.\u201d Karin said the last part as firmly as Miranda had ever heard and decided not to try and argue with the doctor. <br>\r\nMiranda tried to rise from her front to little success \u201cUrm.. Karin\u2026 little help\u201d Miranda said going red faced as she asked, \u201cOf for god\u2019s sake you incompetent tub of human suet!\u201d Together with Karins help Miranda was able to get back on her feet after a couple minutes of trying. \u201cNow if you\u2019re done put on your suit and go.\u201d Miranda didn\u2019t argue she put on her \u2018Suit\u2019 glancing at herself in the mirror and realising how ridiculous she now looked.<br>\r\nThe top half of her suit barely covered her nipples with the tops of her areolas clearly visible above the line of the top, the top also dug in heavily to her back fat accentuating her back rolls, the lack of material also showed off how meaty her arms had gotten, her upper arm was now nearly twice the size of her original thighs sagging heavily off her arms. The suit also didn\u2019t help hiding Miranda\u2019s gut the lowest part stuck out nearly a full foot from Miranda\u2019s face the fleshy dome jiggling at the slightest touch. She was also rapidly approaching having her enormous gut reaching her knees when she stood, with her gut brushing just below the middle of her thighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been right and none of the fat too small bottoms could be seen behind the curtain of fat that hung before them. The sheer fatness of her stomach not helping the rest of her body either, what had once been a muffin top had become the spare tire to a large four by four with the fat eating into the bottoms she wore. Her ass had continued its journey of expansion in all directions she was now visibly wider than she had been when she got out of her suit. Her ass had grown upwards into her back, giving Miranda a very large soft shelf pushing up her back fat and going around to join the sagging belly at the front. The shorts did barely cover Miranda\u2019s backside barely half of it from Miranda\u2019s view, with a large portion of the shorts getting stuck in her ass crack. Miranda\u2019s legs had not been missed by the fat either, each one was now easily twice as wide than her waist had been and 3 times as big around, cellulite and dimples clung all over the flabby pair of legs than began to take Miranda slowly out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you leaving without thanking your doctor?\u201d Karin asked mockingly \u201cThank you Karin\u201d Miranda said begrudgingly. \u201cOh come now you can do better than that, now I want you to say \u2018Thank you Karin for looking after me even though I\u2019m a jiggling ball of cookie dough\u2019\u201d Miranda opened her mouth to argue but thought better of it repeating the words and adding in some extra\u2019s to make sure she could leave \u201cThank you very much Karin for looking after me even thought I\u2019m a morbidly obese, jiggling ball of flabby cookie dough that can\u2019t control herself, and I\u2019m sorry for stuffing myself with your chocolate bars and being so fat I broke your bed\u201d Miranda was surprised how easy it was being this submissive to someone. \u201cThat\u2019s a good little piggy now waddle along now\u201d Karin said happily. Miranda nodded causing her chins to jiggle as she made for the exit.</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t believe I ever wanted to be like you!\u201d Part of Miranda\u2019s brain told her not to take such insults from a subordinate and fight back but that was the old thin Miranda talking, this fat Miranda was weak and submissive so all she offered was a weak \u201cI'm sorry\u201d \u201cGod you\u2019re a pathetic mess, come on girls lets go, this whale isn\u2019t worth our time\u201d With that she gave Miranda\u2019s belly a hard slap and walked on. As Miranda made her way back even though it was only a couple minutes\u2019 walk Miranda was so unfit she had to stop multiple times for breaks leaning against the wall as she tried to get her breath back, this elicited multiple comments from crew members \u201cOi fatso! Want me to turn off the grav plating for you! Might make it easier to walk 10 feet!\u201d \u201cOi Miranda maybe spend more time at the gym and less time at the dining hall!\u201d \u201cWant me to roll you to where you need to go Shamoo? Or how about a fork lift? but then again you\u2019d probably break it!\u201d A few crew members actively displayed their disgust at the slow waddling obese woman, and she was fairly certain she saw arousal from one or two of the crew members she passed. Some of the crew seeing her state took pictures or videos of her laughing as they did so, a few grabbed parts of her flesh and jiggled it shouting various insults at her face, and all she gave them in response were agreements that she was a fat pig or whale or cow. One wanted a photo of her to stop their girlfriend worrying about their weight, claiming \u201cAfter she sees you she\u2019ll never think she\u2019s fat again!\u201d another wanted a photo to show all his friends back home that he met \u201cThe fattest woman in the galaxy\u201d. A few of the women she saw commented on her outfit, \u201cDo you really think you should be wearing that at your size?!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m seeing more exposed flesh than at an Asari strip club!\u201d one of the male crew laughed. Finally, Miranda made it back to her room red faced, winded and soaked in sweat from the sheer effort of moving her obese frame. She sighed as she opened the door and looked into her room, it was filled with empty chocolate bar wrappers, boxes stained with remnants of food, greasy plates and pizza boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda sighed heavily and entered the doorway only to encounter a problem she was stuck. The front half of her body was in but her generous hips were too wide for her to enter the door, she tried shuffling around to loosen herself but there was no luck, she tried pushing off against the wall to no success she was well and truly wedged in their tight. A few minutes past and she heard a couple female crew members walked past, she quickly asked for help only to receive mocking laughs \u201cExcuse me! Could\u2026 could you help I\u2019m stuck\u201d She said \u201cWell what do we have here? A morbidly obese Miranda Lawson stuck in a doorway? Do you think we should get some butter and loosen her up?\u201d asked the first one with a tone that implied they had no intention of doing anything \u201cWell I don\u2019t know about that. Don\u2019t you think she\u2019s had enough butter? I\u2019ve seen her in the mess hall, she puts butter on everything! Even her coffee! If we gave her butter she probably just eat it and be even more stuck than before! I\u2019m afraid all we can do is take pictures and walk on. Besides didn\u2019t she pass you up for that promotion for \u2018Being too unfit?\u2019 and Showing too much skin?\u2019\u201d asked the first one with feigned ignorance \u201cOh yes! that\u2019s true, I mean I must be terribly unfit if this peak of human fitness thinks I\u2019m unfit!\u201d Miranda could see the girl showing off her exposed flat, taught stomach, pressing it against Miranda\u2019s fat backside \u201cIs this too much exposed flesh for you? Am I dressed too slutty?!\u201d \u201cI... I\u2019m sorry. I\u2026 I appreciate the irony here. Could you please help me?\u201d Miranda said offering an apology in hopes they would help her out of this situation. \u201cNow what irony is that ay\u201d the second girl said mockingly \u201cIs it the fact you called me unfit and now you\u2019re as round as moon, tubbo?! Or is it that ridiculous outfit you\u2019re wearing? What on earth made you think you could wear something like that at your immense size!\u201d The girl started laughing and grabbing large handfuls of Miranda\u2019s ass cheeks and playing with her doughy flesh, \u201cIt was the only thing that fit me\u201d Miranda replied desperately trying to play off her size \u201cWell that\u2019s hardly true, now is it?\u201d The girl said with mocking glee \u201cThere are plenty of survival tents on board put a couple of those together and that should fit your ass at least! God I always wanted to touch your ass, it was always so pert and sexy, and I could never get mine to be anything like yours. But now look at it! It\u2019s so fat its stuck in a doorway!\u201d She gave Miranda\u2019s ass a hard smack and laughed \u201cHa! Look at it jiggle! Take a picture of me with it! Is there any muscle left in there or is it all fat! Who\u2019s fit now queen piggy!\u201d The second girl said grabbing handfuls of fat. \u201cTell me who\u2019s fit now!\u201d  Miranda eventually blubbered out \u201cYou\u2019re fit, you\u2019re fit I\u2019m just a big fat unfit blob!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right you\u2019re a fat blob and that\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever be fatso. Unfit forever\u201d. The second girl with gleeful malice, as Miranda nodded causing her body to jiggle to the girl\u2019s obvious delight \u201cWell now come on that\u2019s not fair at all! Ms Lawson appears to be a perfect fit! For the doorway, I mean!\u201d The first girl chimed in to a fit of laughter from the other \u201cHeh\u2026 good one\u2026 I am very fat\u201d replied Miranda submissively hoping to win them over \u201cGlad you realise it pig.\u201d The first one said. \u201cBeg us, and we might help you out\u201d Miranda weighed her options and decided submission to these women was better than staying here all night, and Miranda began to grovel. \u201cWill you please help a fat pig and get me out of this doorway as I am too fat to do it on my own\u201d Miranda said hopefully, hoping the self-deprecation had won her some points. The girls looked at each other laughed and at the same time, as the second girl said \u201cNah! See you around titanic tubbo!\u201d  and the girls walked off giving Miranda\u2019s backside hard slaps leaving a bright red mark on Miranda\u2019s exposed ass cheek laughing to themselves at Miranda\u2019s misfortune.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve got to help me! I\u2019m stuck!\u201d Pleaded Miranda. \u201cOh, I can very much see that\u201d Jack said with pure glee in her voice \u201cSo, this is what happens when cheerleaders become benchwarmers. And at your size I\u2019d imagine you\u2019re warming up the whole bench yourself!\u201d  Miranda turned red faced at Jacks comments, Jack had been the one person she\u2019d been avoiding for fear of the humiliation from her once rival especially as Miranda had always been so cruel to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack reached round and grabbed Miranda\u2019s exposed stomach, \u201cLook at yourself Miranda! You\u2019ve become a big fat whale! You must almost weigh more than most Asari families! And you always had a fat ass but holy crap now it must take a fork lift to get you around now! Don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve over done it with your eating princess pig?\u201d Jack began to play with Miranda\u2019s stomach fat \u201cThis outfit sheshh! Where did you find it? A chubby chaser\u2019s gentlemen\u2019s club!? When I started this little scheme of mine, I had no idea you\u2019d get this damn fucking fat!\u201d Jack began to pinch and prod various places on Miranda\u2019s body \u201cLook! I can pinch an inch anywhere on this bloated body of yours!\u201d Miranda interrupted her insults \u201cwait! What did you mean \u2018When you started this\u2019? Did you do this to me!?\u201d Some of Miranda\u2019s original spirit coming back on learning this revelation. \u201cYou\u2019re the reason I\u2019ve become this morbidly obese whale woman!\u201d Miranda said shrieking. Jacks voice went cold, \u201cNow, is that anyway to talk to your friend? Especially one who\u2019s going to help you get into your room\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?! Why did you do this to me?!\u201d Miranda caught the last bit of the sentence with some surprise \u201cWait you\u2019ll help me?!\u201d Miranda said forgetting her anger as hunger began to sink its teeth into her again. \u201cWhy of course my piggy, all you need to do is ask your good friend Jack for help and then thank me for turning you into this fat jiggling mass of flesh and I will pop you right out of the doorway. Oh and tell me how much you weigh now. When I left you in the mess hall, you weren\u2019t this fat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda paused for a second the last vestiges of her pride, vanity and dominance going out of her as she complied with Jack, \u201cPlease Jack can you help me? I\u2019m too far fat to fit through the doorway on my own and I need help\u201d Miranda said the words as mean fully and as weakly as she could to please Jack. \u201cNow that\u2019s a good pig, but you still need to thank me for making you this fat, and tell me your weight I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d \u201cThank you for making me so fat, thanks to you I\u2019m five hundred and fifty-four pounds\u201d replied Miranda defeated as she fell further into her submissive role hoping that Jack would at least help her. Jack whistled loudly \u201cFive hundred and fifty-four pounds, my my what a biggen I think it\u2019s a very big improvement, don\u2019t you? You\u2019ll make an excellent prize hog.  But you\u2019d like to be fatter wouldn\u2019t you piggy?!\u201d asked Jack in a tone that implied that this wasn\u2019t a question \u201cYou\u2019d like to apologise for being so rude to me all this time and making fun of my poetry? And you know the only way to do that is to fatten you up to say\u2026 650 pounds, yes that seems fair!\u201d With that Jack used her biotics to lift and push Miranda through the doorway and into her apartment sending Miranda\u2019s flab wobbling in all directions as the blue energy covered the woman\u2019s immense body lifting her up and forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force pushed Miranda flat on her face amongst the discarded food containers, the impact caused Miranda\u2019s backside to bounce \u201cBloody hell you\u2019re heavy to lift! What have you been eating! Oh wait I can see it all over your floor!\u201d remarked Jack as she looked around Miranda\u2019s room \u201cYou even live like a pig! Now get up and lie on the bed fatso\u201d Miranda attempted to get up but again she was just too fat and too weak to be able to lift herself up. Jack sneered at her \u201cIf you can\u2019t get up, then I will lift you.\u201d \u201cThank you Jack\u201d Miranda said with genuine gratitude. \u201cHeh you\u2019re getting more submissive by the minute where is all that fire you had? Quenched under six tonnes of blubber no doubt\u201d Said Jack as she lifted Miranda up into the air and onto the bed like an enormous ball of jiggling fat. \u201cNow my fatty, I\u2019m going to go get you some food, would you like that piggy?\u201d Jack grabbed a handful of ass fat and played with it watching how playing with it made Miranda\u2019s whole body jiggle \u201cHeh you\u2019re like one of those old-time water beds! Now lemme take a good look at my prize hog\u201d Jack started to circle Miranda taking photos of her from multiple angles. Jack walked over and stuck her finger in Miranda\u2019s deep belly button swirling it around, forcing her way to the bottom of her belly button \u201cMiranda my dear, your belly button is deeper than my chest is!\u201d Jack pull her finger out a lifted-up Miranda\u2019s chins, exposing her fleshy neck \u201cWell your face certainly hasn\u2019t been spared. That\u2019s good I was worrying you might keep that pretty face of yours, but it is good to see your lacking most of your neck now\u201d Jack smirked to herself.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I will be gone for a few minutes while I get the food you\u2019re going to eat to become nice and fat for me. Now take off those ridiculous clothes and don\u2019t go anywhere!\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t, I promise\u201d replied Miranda in a weak tone. \u201cThat\u2019s a good piggy\u201d and with that Jack got up and walked out leaving Miranda on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda took this time Jack was away to fully look at her situation, her king-sized bed that once seemed far too large for her, now her sitting in the middle took up over 2 thirds of her bed, her pale flesh spread lazily outwards and away from her body sinking deeply into the mattress. Miranda looked down to see the huge mass of flesh that was her body, a few months ago it had been toned and slim, and now there wasn\u2019t a square inch on her not covered in multiple thick layers of jiggling fat. Miranda grabbed her gut and shook it, causing her entire body to ripple and sway. She sighed deeply and began to undress, struggling to get the far too tight material off of her engorged body, she managed to get the top off within a minute of tugging and shaking her body out, as soon as the top was lifted Miranda\u2019s enormous breasts spilled outwards sagging to the sides as gravity caught up with them, Miranda\u2019s shorts took much longer the size of her hips and the way the shorts had dug into her body made the shorts impossible to take off quickly the soft pale flesh covering Miranda\u2019s meaty legs making the job much more difficult, eventually Miranda got them off, her immense body panting from the effort. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda was trying to think of a way out of her situation, sure she didn\u2019t want to be any fatter but choice did she have? She could barely walk, let alone fight off her powerful biotic rival, her own biotic powers had deteriorated as her weight increased leaving her unable to use them at her current size taking away that option of escape from her. She couldn\u2019t try and run away from it she\u2019d get stuck in the doorway again only to have Jack laugh at her again and maybe other crew members as well if she was unlucky. And even if she did make it out the doorway she doubted anyone would help her. No, she\u2019d have to stay on her bed getting stuffed and made even fatter than she already was by the woman who had made her this fat in the first place. Besides submitting to Jack can\u2019t be that bad, maybe she had a cure and when she was done with her revenge she would bring her back to normal and everything would be right again Miranda could go back to being thin and beautiful, she gazed downwards and doubt began to creep back in that, it would ever happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Jack came back into the room a wide grin on her face \u201cWell how my favourite piggy doing? I hope she\u2019s hungry because I have a treat for her\u201d Jack said as Miranda\u2019s gut gurgled at the thought of food. Jack walked out of the room again and walked back wheeling a trolley with a small mountain of cake on it. The cake was covered in thick pink icing with white frosting decorating the edges of the cake. There was blue writing on the cake, Miranda craned her neck past her mountainous breasts and read the writing \u201cTo the fattest cheerleader of them all!\u201d. Jack began stripping off her clothes leaving herself dressed in a bright white micro bikini similar to what Miranda had worn but many times smaller, leaving very little of Jacks body to Miranda's imagination. \u201cWhat... what are you doing?\u201d Miranda asked confusedly \u201cI would have thought it was obvious piggy, I\u2019m going to be feeding you and I hardly want to get cake on my clothes now do I? Besides the constant reminder of my slender toned body should be more than enough to remind you you\u2019ll never be this way again.\u201d Jack pushed the cake over to Miranda\u2019s side, the cake crested nearly above Miranda\u2019s stomach when compared side by side. Jack pulled out a camera and tripod from under the sheet panther trolley and set it up so Miranda\u2019s feeding could be recorded. \u201cYou\u2019re videoing this?\u201d Miranda asked shyly, \u201cOf course I am, I video all of your big growth moments. If I ever feel upset I can watch you waddle down the fast track to fatso town and instantly feel better. Remind me to show you afterwards, Besidies i like watching you submit to me.\u201d With that Jack pressed the record button and walked seductively over to Miranda climbed onto the bed and then mounted Miranda sitting on her large stomach sinking in a few inches as the fat gave way to the slender woman. \u201cMiranda! I had no idea I could see my house from your gut!\u201d Jack said faking covering her eyes from the sun as she looked into the distance. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t come here for the view now did I? I came here to finish my work and finally show you our rivalry is at an end, I\u2019m going to prove that I\u2019m better and all you are is just some fat as all hell Cerberus cow who used to be pretty.\u201d With that Jack grabbed a huge chunk of the cake with her hands and brought it to Miranda\u2019s face \u201copen wide tubso\u201d Miranda did as she was told, as soon as she did the cake came flying into her mouth. It was the most delicious thing Miranda had ever tasted, so sweet, moist and soft that Miranda forgot that she was about to fattened even more and all she could think of was having Jack feed her more of that cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike it do you?\u201d Jack said putting her fingers in Miranda\u2019s mouth for her to lick the cake from. \u201cI\u2019m glad. It\u2019s my own special recipe, it\u2019s filled with all sorts of good things for a growing girl like yourself, and not to mention my own secret ingredient. The weight gain powder that I\u2019ve been putting in your food my favourite little piggy. But hey you don\u2019t care, you just want more of this cake don\u2019t you\u201d Jack picked up another hand full of cake and teased it around Miranda\u2019s chubby lips, as Miranda strained to get the cake in her mouth. Jack shoved the cake in the fat woman\u2019s waiting mouth and watched in glee as Miranda gorged herself on the cake swelling every last crumb Jack shoved in her mouth, cleaning Jacks fingers with her tongue to get all the cake she could. \u201cYou\u2019re such a well-trained piggy aren\u2019t you. You know your place as my bitch don\u2019t you\u201d Jack said shoving antigen hand full of the cake into Miranda\u2019s fat waiting cheeks. Jack continued to shovel cake into Miranda\u2019s flabby face as she felt herself slowly rise. \u201cwell now looks like the weight gain has started at last I was beginning to think I\u2019d have to keep stuffing you with cake forever\u201d Jack said with glee. Jack began stuffing the cake faster into Miranda\u2019s waiting maw giving her larger chunks of the cake watching as Miranda\u2019s face lit up with ecstasy every time cake passed her fat red lips, \u201cGod you\u2019re such a glutton\u201d Jack began to trace her finger around Miranda\u2019s nipples as she fed her. Miranda began to moan softly as Jack played with her hardened nipples. \u201cLike that, do you? God you\u2019re pathetic. You\u2019re already a fat cow and all you seem to want is your nipples played with and have even more food stuffed into your gut\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost all the cake was gone now and Miranda\u2019s body showed every inch of it, Jack had been pushed even further upwards as Miranda\u2019s stomach had more and more fat deposited on it, Jacks stance widened at Miranda\u2019s stomach grew outwards and downwards finally reaching below Miranda\u2019s knees. Miranda\u2019s face continued to fatten with the last of her neck disappearing under the wave of fat flowing into her body. Miranda\u2019s hips were now almost reaching the edges of the bed the fat flowing free and quivering at the slightest movement from Miranda or Jack, Miranda\u2019s immense thighs pushed against each other forcing Miranda to move her huge legs wider and away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack reached for another hunk of cake and found only air Miranda had eaten it all leaving only a small amount of the cake left, Jack removed her bikini top exposing her small perky breasts and small dark nipples Jack took some of the last remnants of the cake and put it on her nipples, Jack leaned over Miranda\u2019s mouth with her tits \u201cSuck it off. I want you to know that you will always been subservient to me. Besides no reason for you to have all the fun\u201d She said tugging at Miranda\u2019s nipples. Miranda did as she was told happily sucking hard at Jacks tits to get the rest of the cake, causing Jack to let out a soft moan \u201cYou have no shame do you my piggy\u201d Jack said almost lovingly stroking Miranda\u2019s hair as Miranda continued to suck the cake from Jacks tits. Jack kept putting more of the leftover cake onto her tits to have Miranda lick it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacks enjoyment was cut short when she heard a loud sharp voice behind her, one she immediately recognised. Standing in the doorway was the red-haired commander Shepard. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Picking up the pace despite how much her flabby form wobbled at high speed, she breezed right by Garrus Vakarian, who looked in disbelief at the Cerberus operative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Miss Lawson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later!\" Miranda snapped, barging into her room and briefly catching her hips on the door-frame before it slammed shut. Confused, Garrus started heading back to the guns to finish the calibrations when the sound of clinking glass echoed from the labs. The Turian detoured into Mordin's lab on a whim, finding not the verbose Salarian but someone snooping through one of the lower cabinets. Unimpressed, Garrus loudly cleared his throat, and the figure immediately removed herself from the shelf in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear I only looking...oh, it's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasumi Goto, isn't it?\" Garrus recalled. The thief adjusted her hood without saying anything. \"Don't you have better things to do then raid Mordin's lab for glassware?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it shock you if I said no?\" Kasumi admitted. \"Gotta do something to keep my skills sharp, and it feels like all I do here is sit around until Shep wanders in and I tell 'em about all my things.\" Garrus couldn't really argue with that. He considered admonishing the thief before remembering how he nearly got bowled over by Miranda earlier and decided to broach that subject instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Kasumi...did you notice Miranda-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turned into a land whale? Yeah, who hasn't?\" Kasumi interrupted. \"Me and the Quarian are taking bets on how big she's gonna end up being. Course I have a secret advantage there; Miranda's fattening isn't even natural!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it's not? How do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Master Thief here?\" Kasumi said with a tone of disappointment. \"I know everything. It has to be some sort of chemical blowing her up like a balloon, we humans don't blob up that fast. Mordin probably made it, but I don't think you even need to be a master like me to know who's really behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack's fattening her up?\" Garrus said, recalling how pissed the crazy biotic was when Miranda recited her poetry to the crew the other day and generally how pissed the crazy biotic was when Miranda and/or Cerberus dared to exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh,\" Kasumi replied. \"Who else has a bigger hatred for Cerberus on the ship then her?\" The thief flounced off on that revelation, leaving Garrus to consider his options. He felt like he should say something, but decided against it and returned to his station to finally finish those damned calibrations. Miranda could handle herself, even if there was admittedly a lot of herself to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi, however, had different plans. As the Turian made his exit, the master thief revealed the small pill bottle that Mordin stashed in the back of his cabinets and a small sample of powder, the same pill and powder that Jack used on the flabby Cerberus operative, according to her intel. Kasumi may have had no love for Cerberus or their tactics, but they still hired her, and didn't honor demand that she get back at those who would hurt the people she worked for? Of course it didn't, she just thought it'd be funny to watch both of them turn into whales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering innocently into the dining hall, a pill tucked up her sleeves, she easily found Jack in her usual spot, happy as a clam thanks to Miranda's involuntary bulking up. To Kasumi's delight, Jack was celebrating her impending victory with her own modestly sized meal. This was going to be too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem happy, Jack,\" Kasumi said innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ecstatic,\" Jack replied with a wide grin. \"Haven't felt this good since I shoved that Cerberus operator's head up his buddy's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" the thief interrupted, letting out a well-rehearsed sigh. \"Shame about Miranda, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Jack said, looking eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the poor dear got caught in the doorway to her room,\" Kasumi lied. \"Grunt was helping her to get unstuck, so hopefully she gets pushed out soon.\" Kasumi looked on in triumph as Jack rose to the bait, getting up to run to Miranda's room to see the spectacle, leaving her food wide open. Glancing around to make sure no one was snooping, the thief dropped the pill into a dollop of mashed potatoes, disguising it with a fork and a bit of that powder for good measure before slipping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack returned in a rather foul move, having just missed Miranda getting her big fat cheerleader butt caught in her own door. Grumpily sitting down, Jack didn't even notice the slight difference in her food as she took a big glob of her mashed potatoes and shoved them into her mouth. Alas, she would have to be a little more patient, it seemed. Miranda was going to blow up like a balloon one way or another, there was no harm in waiting a bit and enjoying her mashed potatoes right? Jack took another bite of her food, and indeed they were rather tasty. Delectable even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in a good mood, Jack pictured in her head what Miranda would look like jammed in her door, enjoying the image and, for a brief moment, wondering why her waistband was a little tight today...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Determined to catch the morbidly obese Miranda in a compromising position to humiliate her, Jack began trailing her in the hopes of finding that elusive moment, with Miranda either not caring or not knowing she was being followed around. This of course meant Jack spent a lot of time in the mess, and a lot of time eating as well since even without the stimulants Miranda had started eating like a hog failing on a diet. Eventually Jack just decided to spend most of the day in the mess hall, since following the blob around was sort of tiring and she'd mostly be in the mess hall anyway, right? Jack could still watch Miranda like a hawk, waiting for that perfect moment, and she could enjoy a good meal in the process. Or a couple meals. Maybe even several...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Keelah</i>...Miranda's gotten rather big, hasn't she?\" Tali observed as Miranda waddled by the table where she was having her breakfast. The Cerberus cheerleader had blown up even more since the last time she gorged herself into an enormous size; her bare belly hung out the front of her giving a great round shelf for her massively fat boobs, both of which refused to be contained by her clothes and simply hung out in the open, displaying ample gut and cleavage. That was to say nothing of her massive rump, resembling tires in their size and shape and bouncing with every waddling step Miranda took. \"Is this some disease endemic to humans or something?\" the Quarian said quietly as Miranda ponderously lowered herself onto a bench. \"Because I don't want to get sick and blow up like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think you'll be fine, actually,\" Garrus told her, taking a bite of his rather lumpy \"scrambled eggs\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so sure?\" Tali asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call it an instinct.\" Garrus glanced over at the master thief, milling around in the back of the room like she was keeping an eye out for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope your instincts are right,\" Tali admitted, taking a sip of her nutrient shake. \"I don't mind a little padding, but I don't want to burst out of my suit when I'm having lunch.\" Garrus made to ask her what she meant by that when the door to the mess hall opened and someone walked in, their hips briefly catching on the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch!\" Jack swore under her breath. \"Stupid tiny doors.\" She knew it wasn't the door though, she just wanted to vent at something that wouldn't try to vent back for once. Things were off recently and Jack couldn't put her finger on why, meaning she was angrier to a higher degree then normal. One of the few times she was not angry though was when she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was eating a lot. About as much as Miranda was lately, and it showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack may not have been fully aware of it, but she was fat. Really fat. So much so that she had to swap out her string top for a tank top at some point to contain her new breasts, and even then they pretty much covered her as well as the string top did. Her toned stomach turned into a flabby mound which in turn morphed into a tremendous cauldron of a gut, wobbling with every ponderous step as it hung off her in rolls. Her pumpkin-sized breasts were struggling to burst free of her tank top as they grew larger then her head, which was saying something considering how her angular features had melted away into a round, globular face with tubby cheeks and three tremendous chins sitting on her fat neck. Her hippo hips and thunder thighs supported her immense bulk with some immense bulk of their own, though they forced her to waddle with every step and made finding chairs that would support her a bit of a chore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali, wordlessly, pushed her nutrient shake away and made her exit, mumbling about getting too big for her suit, while Garrus stared in disbelief at the massively obese Jack, now almost equal in size to the land whale Cerberus operative. Giggling, Kasumi emerged from her corner and sauntered by Jack, giving her hips space to squeeze by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sausage and waffles are delectable this morning,\" the master thief said innocently. Jack's mouth immediately started to water as she made her way into the food line. She forgot exactly why she hung out in the mess hall all the time, something about revenge, but it slipped away when her stomach growled at her, demanding sustenance. Getting her own plate absolutely full of waffles, Jack lumbered back towards the tables, plopping down heavily next to, of all people, Miranda Lawson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' Jack,\" Miranda said through a heaping mouthful of scrambled eggs as their fat hips squished together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Miranda,\" Jack replied back, causing a few nearby people who knew about their relationship to double-take. Indeed, as Jack tucked into her plate of waffles, any and all animosity seemed to melt away as they ate together. There wasn't anything wrong with two big friends enjoying a big meal right? As the two women with a combined weight of over half a ton tore into their meal, Jack wondered if she was forgetting something, something that she was supposed to be doing here. Like trying to get revenge on...someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, try some of the home fries,\" Miranda said, lifting a forkful of the stuff towards Jack, who eagerly opened her mouth to hork it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...tasty!\" she said happily. \"Have you tried the waffles yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't,\" Miranda said, her eyes lighting up as Jack took a chunk of her waffles and fed it to her. Giving a satisfied little sigh, the feasting continued with them kindly sharing samples of their meals with one another. Garrus watched the scene of the former enemies feeding one another and having a good time with a mixture of disbelief and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans are strange,\" he concluded, getting up to leave the two ultra-flabby women to their feast.</span></div></div>",

Boy it's something, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should talk to them,\" Shepard decided, getting to her feet. \"If this keeps up, they're not going to be able to move, let alone fight.\" Kelly's face faltered as Shepard strode over confidently to tell the two women off. She tried to call out but was muted when Jack let out a loud belch that drowned her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you always have to be so rude?\" Miranda said snootily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I'm making room!\" Jack said with a knowing grin, reaching over and pressing against Miranda's globular belly to loosen up a belch that escaped from her lips before the Cerberus operative could clap a hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I at least have room too,\" Miranda quipped, and the two massively overweight squad members shared a light-heated giggle, which gave Shepard pause since the two were almost never this chummy with one another. \"By the way,\" Miranda continued, her expression faltering a bit. \"I meant to tell you something about your...ah...poetry book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm?\" Jack grunted through a mouthful of bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...just wanted to say I'm sorry. Looking back, it was wrong of me to share that with the crew when it was so personal for you, and I should have known better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard's jaw dropped, unable to comprehend what she was seeing. Miranda, sincerely apologizing to Jack? That was almost as impossible as Jack calling Miranda her friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...thank you, Miranda,\" Jack said, looking genuinely touched. \"It means a lot that you would say that to me.\" She set a chubby hand on Miranda's thick shoulder. \"You're a great friend, Miranda, I hope that doesn't change anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smiled as Shepard nearly had a heart attack. \"Thanks, Jack.\" The two shared a hug and returned to their meal while Shepard, thoroughly and utterly shell-shocked, meandered back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're friends!\" Shepard said quietly to Kelly as she sat back down. \"I don't believe it, they're FRIENDS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, Jack and Miranda?\" Kelly asked, incredulous. \"No, can't be. They hate each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not any more, I've seen enough of both of them to know they aren't faking it,\" Shepard explained. \"And I thought coming back from the dead was an impossible feat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did they react to you telling them to lose weight?\" Kelly said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't, but I don't think I'm going to let it slide for now. Them being out of action is frustrating but not as much as them tearing the ship apart to get at one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd think Jack was the one who did most of the tearing apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's beside the point, which is that I'd rather have them as fat friends then skinny enemies,\" Shepard decided. \"I'll pull them from away missions and talk to Chakwas about putting them on a diet regimen, but for now I'm going to let this friendship grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Shepard's relative inaction and their friendship cemented, Miranda and Jack's consumption continued in earnest, so much so that even Chakwas' attempts to get them to diet were fruitless. They were too in love with eating to go back now, and it was really showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack let out a soft moan as her roaring stomach woke her up, demanding to be filled. Ponderously lifting herself up to a sitting position, Jack swung her tree trunk legs around and, with a biotic shove, lifted her porcine form off the bed, which at this point was bent in the middle from her massive weight despite its sturdy construction. Putting on some fresh clothes, Jack lumbered out of her room and down to the elevator, her mind set purely on one thing; food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knew Jack was coming by how the ground shook from every step she took and knew to get out of her way when that happened. Emerging from the elevator, Jack swung her tree trunk legs at a high speed waddle to get to the automated food line, every inch of her jiggling constantly. While her pants remained skintight against the onslaught of her monstrous ass and thigh meat, she had since given up on trying to find a shirt to cover her stomach, settling instead on keeping her massive breasts contained and letting her massive, multi-rolled gut hang out and over her crotch, and had even abandoned her boots after finding herself unable to tug them over her fattened feet. Her ham hock arms were similarly porcine, leading up to a immensely fat face with a neck covered in multiple flabby chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry!\" Jack said thickly as she piled on two trays full of food, making her way to the table and settling herself down on a bench, which groaned painfully under her immense weight. Before she could get started, Jack felt the ground start to shake again, her flab jiggling with every loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda...hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Jack...\" Miranda said heavily, a smile crossing her immensely thick cheeks. Unlike Jack who at this point was a gargantuan belly with a woman attached, Miranda had blossomed into an ultra-sized hourglass, with breasts the size of beach balls and a rear that needed four chairs to support, and even then still sported a massive gut that poured out from her front. Amazingly Miranda's outfit still managed to contain her incredible girth, evidently being made from a super stretchy compound that naturally left little to the imagination on a woman of Miranda's size, though like Jack she was waddling around barefoot since she could no longer hope to get her own boots on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mess hall bench groaned in agony as Miranda sat across from Jack and the two began their feast in earnest, two elephantine eaters gorging themselves ad infinitum, and as they ate and their bellies swelled with brand new calories...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, while she was limited to striking those on the Normandy, she now had a great method for getting revenge. After removing a single dose of the powder, Jack hid the rest of the stash away in a random compartment in her little hide-y hole in engineering for later use. All she needed now was someone to test it out on. She couldn\u2019t just put all her eggs in one basket, and needed to know if it would even work before potentially alerting Miranda that she was out to get her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the ex-con headed up a floor to the crew deck, where she waited for a cup to go unattended. When she saw a still full mug of coffee, she stealthily sprinkled the powder into it, and waited for the owner to return. When Shepard came back from talking with Chakwas and taking a sip, Jack immediately regretted her decision. Jane was one of the very few people Jack had met that she didn\u2019t put on her shit list, and was the closest thing to a friend she ever had, and definitely didn\u2019t want to use the drug on Shepard. Unfortunately, Mordin was right about it working fast, as Jane\u2019s figure slowly bang to creep outward after one sip before Jack could stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new weight appearing on her body from the ingestion condensed calorie dust (or whatever exactly it was Mordin had gave her) was to lazy to move up, as it all seemed to go to Jane\u2019s lower half. A small belly began to protrude outward, fighting for space against Jane\u2019s shirt and belt, while her thighs thickened, and her rump became more plush. Even with a more then generous portion going to her lowe half, some still went upward, softening her freckled face, and plumping up her average bust. Though Jack had never been good at telling weight, she guessed that the Commander had put on twenty pounds over the course of five minutes from a teaspoon of the powder alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, even after absentmindedly patting her belly when her growth was done, Jane didn\u2019t seem to notice how much large she was. Jack breathed a sigh of relief when she realized that Shepard wasn\u2019t going to reprimand her. Jack would gladly have taken a bullet over the disappointed look the ginger gave her whenever she did something wrong. So, Jack fled the scene before Shepard saw her there to avoid Jane\u2019s scornful gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they may not have been the exact results she wanted, the test proved the powder was exactly what she wanted to make Miranda miserable. As for what happened to Shepard\u2026 Well, she chalked it up to a casualty of war. Now she only needed to test the pills, and she could move forward with her plan.</span></div></div>",

If I want to work on filtration I'd be a...filtrationeer or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hurry and find the things we need, okay?\" Gabriella said in an annoyed tone. \"I have all the equipment I need but...Kenneth, did you see the purifiers anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Purifiers, remember we got them on Illium?

As he got up from next to Jack's sleeping spot, he spotted a little hiding spot, one that would have been blocked from view if he looked in from around the corner. Digging his way through the small pile of junk, Kenneth spotted a large bag filled with blue powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Kenneth called out, stuffing the baggie into his stack of objects. \"Jack was hiding it back here, and I'd rather not find out why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Gabriella said with a shrug. \"Hurry up, we gotta get that powder into the filter before it cycles again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming!\" The two engineers gathered all their things and made their way to the elevator, just as Jack was passing the other way at a brisk pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack, can you not hide-\" Kenneth began, but was cut off when Jack flipped him the bird and kept walking. Rolling his eyes, he and Gabriella entered the elevator just as Jack turned the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack picked up a crate with her biotic powers and smashed it into the wall to vent her frustrations. She was so close...SO CLOSE...to getting back at that goddamned cheerleader, and she went and put Mordin's pill in the wrong goddamned plate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small comfort that Garrus spotted the pill before he ate, since Jack didn't want to fatten up another crew member, but it still meant Miranda got a fresh plate and took it to her quarters to be safe, citing concerns about \"someone's medication being in the food\", meaning the oh so perfect cheerleader wouldn't risk eating in public for the next week, if she was lucky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continued to vent her frustrations by beating the crap out of more storage crates until she was burned out, her mind left to stew on all the things she'd do to that stupid Cerberus flunkie when she got the chance. Left utterly exhausted by her explosion of rage, Jack closed her eyes and fell asleep dreaming of vengeance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day shift on the Normandy took over, Jack at last stirred from her sleep, her stomach growling at her for subsistence. Rubbing the sleep out of her eyes, Jack got unsteadily to her feet, rubbing a sore spot in her neck from falling asleep propped against a wall. Jack wondered if she could sneak those pills into Miranda's breakfast as she went for the elevator before she heard the unwelcome sound of Gabriella Daniels coming up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jack, you got a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack spun around to tell her to fuck off, but was stunned into silence at the sight of the engineer, who seemed to have grown a prominent belly since Jack flipped her friend the bird last night! Jack's eyes flickered from the gut hanging in front of her to Gabriella's plush hips and plump thighs, not unlike what Shepard grew when Jack tested her powder the previous night. Daniels didn't seem to notice and kept on going like nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kenneth said you were hiding his things last night,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what things?\" Jack asked, shocked into politeness at the sight of the now portly engineer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a purifier compound we needed to introduce into the air and water filters, Kenneth said he found it in your stash,\" Daniels suggested accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...it was a blue powder in a bag wasn't it?\" Jack said, though she was pretty sure she knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's the stuff we circulated into the air and water,\" Daniels said, lifting a bottle of water to her lips. As she took a long swill of water, Jack opened her mouth to speak but was again stunned to silence as the engineer began to grow in front of her eyes, her growing gut pushing her shirt up and her big butt straining the confines of her pants. Watching Gabriella's thighs puff up, Jack couldn't help but guess that the water had pushed her to fifty pounds above her old weight, maybe even more. \"Ahh,\" Daniels sighed, smacking her lips in satisfaction before turning back to Jack expectantly, her face wider then before and joined by a new double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah,\" Jack said, easily putting two and two together at this point and not willing to broadcast the little mix-up. \"Sorry about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniels looked at Jack suspiciously, not used to her caving so fast on an argument but deciding to go with the flow. \"Just try not to do anything weird with the equipment, okay? I get that Kenneth can be an ass sometimes, but don't hurt the rest of the crew just to get to him, okay?\" Seemingly satisfied, Daniels waddled back towards the engine compartment to leave Jack to stew in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo apparently the powder had gotten into the filter system, and the water was going to fatten everyone up. Even the food cooked with water from the Normandy's water supply would be effected like Shepard's coffee was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in so much shit right now,\" Jack said forlornly, only for her stomach to growl angrily at her. It was then she realized that Shepard and Daniels didn't notice that they had fattened up from Mordin's powder and ran to a nearby coolant tank, polished so that she could see a reflection in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't recognize the girl staring back at her for a moment. For starters, she had tits; not large ones mind you, but she was no longer flat-chested, and she definitely wasn't flat-stomached either. Looking down, Jack grabbed a handful of belly fat and shook it gently, letting her flab wobble like jell-o across her legs and lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell am I fat now!?\" Jack snapped at her reflection. \"I didn't even drink the powder! Did Mordin freakin' make it <i>airborne!?</i>\" Storming towards the elevator, trying to ignore her heavier footfalls, Jack tried to plan out her next move, idly weighing her belly in her hands.</span></div></div>",

But you can fix this..\" The door slid open suddenly and Jack immediately dropped what she was doing, her belly falling back against her legs with a soft <i>plop</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, you're up early!\" Tali remarked as she entered the elevator, a brand new belly wobbling in front of her too. Jack bit her lip slightly, trying not to betray the Quarian's new size to her just yet. It looked like she had squeezed her thighs and belly into that suit of hers and it was just barely holding on. In any other situation Jack would have been laughing her ass off at the impossible sight of a fat Quarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, couldn't sleep,\" Jack responded, trying to sound casual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Keelah</i>, tell me about it,\" she said, moving next to Jack as the doors slid shut again. \"Feels like the temperature on the ship is too high, but the regulators are all functioning. Maybe I'm getting a slight fever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should see the doctor,\" Jack said tersely, trying to tune out the sound of Tali's suit creaking from the strain of holding in a lot of Quarian blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea,\" Tali remarked. \"Though Chakwas' last treatment just gave me a stomach ache. Maybe the Salarian knows something that can help...\" Jack's eyes lit up at those words. Mordin, of course! Who else to go to for helping to get rid of the fattening issue but the guy who made them in the first place? Maybe if she was lucky he wouldn't even tell Shepard about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator came to a stop and Jack and Tali departed together. It took every ounce of willpower to keep going like nothing was wrong, though; since last night, everyone had gotten fatter. All across the bridge, the Cerberus dogs who milled about sported big bellies at the very least, with some already forced to waddle at a glacial pace between their stations. Nearly everyone seemed to be eating or drinking something, meaning of course that a lot of people were growing fatter before Jack's eyes, with no one other then her seeming to notice. Jack tried not to stare, but let out a grunt of pain as a small plastic button hit her in the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp...sorry Jack,\" Kelly Chambers said through a mouthful of what looked like a chili dog, holding up her pants with her free hand. Muttering something noncommittal and breezing by her, Jack noted Kelly was easily one of the biggest crew members on deck, her belly already blooming into rolls and a thick second chin appearing on her face, to say nothing of the ass big enough to pop off pants buttons. And considering a lot of people were currently closer to her size then Jack's, a paranoid thought crept through her mind that when the realization broke that everyone was turning into a lardass, everyone would also notice how comparatively tiny Jack was compared to everyone else. She wanted to fix this, but she didn't want to get caught either, meaning she'd have to do something drastic to blend in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping off to the side so she wouldn't be seen, Jack took a look around and spotted a bottle filled with a fizzy drink in a thermos of some sort left unattended on an open wall panel, no doubt a mechanic's abandoned pick me up. Regretting every life choice she made that led up to this moment, Jack took the thermos and guzzled it down. Feeling herself blow up like Daniels did was a surreal experience, from the new strain on her clothes to just the feeling of being far heavier then normal. From the heft of her boulder belly, she had to guess that she was probably around Kelly's size, maybe a little more. Setting the empty thermos back where she found it, Jack ponderously turned around and made her way towards Mordin's lab at a waddling pace, hoping that creaking sound wasn't the floor underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so..urp...dumb,\" Jack said aloud, realizing that the fat accumulating around her face was starting to deepen the tone of her voice. Keeping her hands around her gut to stop it from wobbling so much, Jack finished the ponderous journey to the lab, where Mordin was working on some sort of gun. Surprisingly enough, he was still as thin as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thermal resonance compound too unstable, will never be effective in combat situation,\" he mumbled. \"Perhaps coupled with an effective coolant delivery system will be more feasible as weaponized substance...hypothesis states this is unlikely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mordin!\" Jack shouted. The good doctor looked up, smiling despite Jack growing into a land whale since the last time they spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject Zero, expected visit!\" he said at a breakneck pace. \"Judging by rapid collection of adipose on crew, harmless attempt at tomfoolery has been extended to other members of crew. Vindictive comeback over poetry incident, perhaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no!\" Jack hissed, eyes darting from side to side to make sure no one was listening. \"Someone else put that powder in the filter system, not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hypothesis was mistaken,\" Mordin said, sounding pleased. \"Was forming negative impression of you based on incident. Good to know Subject Zero merely careless and not malevolent. Still, desirable outcome that high calorie compound ineffective on Salarian physiology. Otherwise too preoccupied with growing into morbid obesity to do research.\" Mordin inhaled, leaving Jack room to breath at last. \"Terrible outcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, but you can fix this, right? Reverse engineer a cure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, understandable not to turn others and self into immobile collections of fatty tissue before collector mission is finished,\" Mordin pondered. \"Compound must be purged from filtration systems.\"</span></div></div>",

Have told Commander Shepard white lie about Juniperian Flu outbreak, convinced her to dock for a week at nearby colony. That way any risk caused by excessive body weight will be avoided. Timed it so that closest planet would have plenty of food available, as well as materials and fabrics for new wardrobes. Should alleviate supply concerns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack crossed her arms, unused to the feeling of breasts pressing against them. \"Alright, so you planned this out. How long do I need to sit around and get fat before you can reverse all of this? A day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...One Week Later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stirred from her sleep as her stomach demanded sustenance with some rather intense hunger pangs. A jumbo-sized box of candy slipped from her fingers, joining the dozens already littering the floor as she began to move herself off of the bed. She was surprised that her rest was satisfactory considering that she had to sleep sitting up...mostly because her old bed was entirely too small for her and just about the right size for her new posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, the Cerebus hating biotic shoved hard, propelling herself off the bench and nearly losing her balance as her grand, many rolled gut flopped heavily onto her lower legs. Swearing under her breath, she ponderously made her way to the corridor outside, crushing candy boxes and takeout containers under her ham-sized feet as her hips bumped into the walls and sent her whole body into a jiggling frenzy, powerful enough to force up a pocket of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUURP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo, nice one Jack,\" Tali complimented as she lumbered into the hallway a few doors down. Or rather, tried to lumber, but immediately got stuck at the hips. Backing out, she turned her bulk sideways and lifted up her belly, managing to squeeze it through before dropping it down again and going to join her massively obese compatriot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't drop my shake!\" the Quarian said, revealing a large drink container almost as big as one of Jack's thighs. As she sucked down on the fattening shake through a straw, Jack couldn't help but feel bad for her. As the crew rocketed into higher ranges of obesity and clothing became an issue, it was often simpler just to go without it to some degree, like how Jack was wearing just an extremely taxed pair of shorts and a wrap top to cover her decency. Tali on the other hand couldn't take that shortcut and had to keep ordering bigger suits over the last few days; making it look like the old Tali had massively inflated her classic outfit. That being said, it looked pretty good for a suit that needed to fit a half-ton Quarian, just as intricately designed with space to store belly, butt, and thighs galore. Even the helmet looked to be twice as wide, making Jack genuinely curious how her face had filled out under there. Last time Jack looked in the mirror, her own face was dominated by garantuan chipmunk cheeks and sinking into the ring of fat that made up her neck and multiple chins. Maybe Tali had the same look to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack obviously had plenty of time to think about this stuff, since she was so slow nowadays. The two girls, collectively weighing a ton, took slow ponderous steps, their outfits creaking in agony and threatening to split at any moment, or at least Jack's was. Even the lift groaned under their weight as Tali struggled to press the floor button with her fat fingers. Jack hoped that the weight limit on this thing was high.</span></div></div>",

Either way, when the doors opened up to the crew deck she wasted no time and hustled out, which is to say she lumbered out of the elevator at a slightly faster pace than was typical for her now, which was still slower than what her normal waking speed used to be. Once she created some space between herself and the half ton of waddling Quarian blubber Jack was freed from the feeling of claustrophobia and refocused her mind to the task at hand. Which was\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wracked her brain trying to remember. Didn\u2019t she want to talk to Mordin about something? She couldn\u2019t imagine what that could be. Besides, if she wanted to talk to the Salarian why did she go to the crew deck instead of the lab where he could always be found? Maybe she wanted to pick a fight with Miranda, but that seemed like too much trouble for her now. It must have been food she had come for. Yes, that made sense, she was always so hungry, she must have wanted to come fill her empty belly. Why else would she have bothered getting up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging one meaty leg around the other Jack slowly shuffled her way into the mess hall, where the rest of the crew was already helping themselves to a healthy breakfast. The blubbery biotic couldn\u2019t help but wonder to herself how they all remained so oblivious to their weights as she pilled a tray high with greasy strips of bacon, plump breakfast sausages and crispy hash browns. Surely they all had to know they were growing, at least on some level, otherwise why would they keep getting themselves bigger clothes? They also had to have noticed that everyone around them was getting bigger as well, didn\u2019t they? Yet despite what had to be some subconscious acknowledgment of their growth, there was otherwise no real manifestation of that knowledge in their conscious behavior. It must have been some quality of the powder and pills that kept them all clueless, Jack reasoned, and the reason she herself was aware of her weight was because she knew about the powder and pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand precariously balancing her heavy tray, Jack grabbed her lowest belly roll with her other hand and lifted it, pulling her gut up and onto one of the cafeteria tables so she\u2019d have room to sit down. As she lowered her weight down onto her seat, the metal bench bent under her weight, almost far enough to touch the floor, however her mind was too focused on her meal to notice the affects her weight had on her environment. Now seated she rested the tray atop her gut, using the multi-rolled mass instead of the actually table, and began shoving potatoes into her greedy maw with her spoon. A soft moan escaped her with the crispy, ketchup soaked hash browns touched her tongue. If she had to eat a shit ton of food at every meal to keep her belly quiet, at least it tasted good. It must have just been her imagination, but she could have sworn the food in the mess actually tasted better since the powder and pills got into the air and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack soon got into the rhythm of eating, downing close to a pound of meat and potatoes a minute as she lost herself to her gluttony. The taste of the food passing over her tongue and sensation of it filling her belly up were her sole focus. Her single minded desire to eat was almost enough to keep her from noticing someone approaching out of the corner of her eye. Turning her head, she saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

Dodging past Kelly Chambers falling off a collapsed chair and literally rolling towards him like a flabby, belching boulder, Mordin finally reached Jack and prodded her in her neck flab to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrph!\" Jack grunted, flecks of hash brown spewing from her mouth as she flinched. \"Whatchuwant?\" Smiling, Mordin pulled out a test tube filled with a solid green, viscous liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent news! Managed to isolate the lipid multiplication compound and neutralize its long term effects!\" Mordin announced proudly. Jack's heart leapt in her flabby chest as she put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that.....hufff....burrrp....cure?\" Jack grunted, returning to her meal quickly after such an agonizingly long wait to let her speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Upon introduction to doctored water supply will seek out and neutralize multiplying compounds still present, spreading to afflicted hosts shortly thereafter and shutting down its effects.\" Mordin inhaled deeply. \"Process will take less than a day, at current projections.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack almost wanted to sing she was so happy to hear that. She tried to tell Mordin to hurry and put it in the water right away, but her stomach roaring distracted her. She hurriedly moved to stuff herself with more potatoes and sausage, kneading the expanse of her stomach to sooth its urges. It was a last meal of sorts; after all, Jack wanted nothing more then to get rid of this fat, this ugly, misshapen, lumpy...bulging...wobbly...endearing...exciting....sexy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait what? No, that's...no way, Jack thought to herself. She was a half-ton whale, this wasn't hot or exciting to her! Angrily, she stuffed more of her meal into her mouth, letting out a little moan of pleasure as her belly was sated. What...what did Mordin want with her? Could it maybe wait until after breakfast? Because...this was good. So good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so good,\" Jack moaned out loud, dropping her fork entirely and eating with her bare hands. \"I...I want more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, was worried about this side effect,\" Mordin mused. \"Must apply cure immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack licked her greasy fingers clean, she watched the Salarian pointedly turn on his heel and begin his escape to go and fix this. No...was this fixing it? Because this...this was really really good. And she wanted more...much more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyes widened with panic as she suddenly lumbered out of the chair, her belly flopping hard onto her crotch and knocking loose a bellowing belch that successfully drew the Salarian's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Did Subject Zero need something?\" Mordin asked as he turned around, distracted by the noise. If Jack wanted to stop him from leaving, this would be the only chance to lumber over and try something. Jack's mouth went dry and she sweat like a pig as she pondered her options, her belly slowly digesting the food and dropping pounds onto her ridiculously obese frame. She could almost feel herself swelling larger every second she stood there, and for the first time...it felt heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she really want this to end now?</span></div></div>",

Mind racing as panic took over, Jack closed the distance between herself and Mordin with a speed one would think impossible for a woman so corpulent. Acting solely on instinct, any higher thought function abandoning her in the moment, she grabbed the Salarian\u2019s scrawny arm and squeezed it with all the strength she had left in her long unused muscles, forcing him to drop the cure onto the floor. It landed with a clink, the glass unbroken and the stopped still keeping the contents inside the vial. There was a brief moment silence moment of silence as Mordin and Jack stared each other down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVial still intact.\u201d Mordin was calm and composed as ever, even while a half ton psychotic biotic was crushing his arm in her iron grip. \u201cNot too late to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>CRUNCH</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a decisive stomp Jack had crushed the vial with her boot, and ground it under her heel for good measure.

Will take some time to synthesize more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his other arm just as tight, Jack pulled Mordin into her flabby front so that she was right in his face and he could feel the heat of her anger radiating off of her. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 not going to make more\u2026\u201d The sudden bursts of movement left Jack both sweat and out of breath, forcing her to pant heavily as she spoke. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019re\u2026 going to make more of is the powder and pills\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances Mordin would not take kindly to being threatened, but this was a different. Jack wasn\u2019t thinking, so she couldn\u2019t realize it, but she was holding all the cards. Not only could use her biotics to tear him apart if he tried to retaliate, or dominant him with her sheer physical presence if her refused to make more of the pills and powder, but she could also drag him down with her if she revealed the situation to anyone else. There were too many variables if he was implicated in the fattening of the crew for him to risk it. So, with Jack both figuratively and literally twisting his arm, he had no choice but to give in to her demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Will recreate substance meant for harmless prank. Will take an hour at most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her demands seemingly being met, Jack cautiously let her prisoner go, but remained ready to grab him again if he tried to make a run for it. \u201cGood. And don\u2019t you even think about\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin held up his hand. \u201cPlease. Further intimidation not required.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Mordin turned and weaved his way through the crowded cafeteria to get back to his lab. As he left, it suddenly hit Jack that she had just very blatantly manhandled and threatened someone in said crowded cafeteria. Her panic returned and she looked around, fully expecting everyone to be staring at her\u2026 only to see that no one had so much as looked up from their meals. Much to Jack\u2019s relief, they were so enthralled with filling their demanding guts that they were just as oblivious to the altercation as they were to their skyrocketing weights. With the crisis averted, the adrenaline faded, and Jack felt even heavy than she really was. She shuffled back to her pile of food, diving back into her meal to regain her strength. She would go to Mordin\u2019s lab to collect after breakfast; right now, she needed to eat. After all that time she wasted waiting for the cure, curbing her appetite, she was now free, and she could finally fully enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast went on for so long, it blended into lunch, and lunch went on so long it became dinner, which itself became three desserts. Jack spent so long eating that the day cycle was almost over by the time she finally made her way to Mordin\u2019s lab, but that whole time she had been thinking.

Shepard's breasts somehow retained their perkiness despite blocking her view of anything beneath them, including her gigantic sized belly. Jack doubted Shepard's thighs would never be separate again, even if she were to split her feet apart, as they touched down to the knees, and looked like they were pushing against each other.

Uhhh just feeling sick, right Mordin?\"  The scientist nodded quickly, just as surprised as Jack. She wondered how it was possible for Shepard to gain what looked like 400 pounds so quickly before realizing the powder she accidentally  put in Shepard's drink. Jack became much more concerned about this powder. She wondered how fat everyone was going to get, how fat was she going to get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Jack? I hope it's not that flu Mordin told me about?,\" Shepard spoke with concern. Mordin stepped in. \"Jack is merely feeling queasy, recommend a lightweight diet, her stomach can only handle small meals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad Jack. Think you can still join me and Miranda in the cafeteria later?\" Shepard asked as she sucked on a straw which was connected to a large chocolate smoothie that was tucked between her breasts. Shepard was standing right in front of Jack so she was privy to the sensation of her belly rapidly expanding, seemingly reaching out towards her before making contact with Jack's own chubby belly. Shepard's much larger stomach spreading across Jack's plump torso. Jack didn't want to give herself away so she allowed the stomach fat to cover her own. Shepard let go of the straw with a pop and let out a satisfied 'ahhh', \"Tali's also going to be there,\" she added.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Overconfident. Self-absorbed. Not as clever as she thinks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pondered carefully the nature of her rival. Miranda was certainly clever, but she'd never had to worry about half the shit Jack had been through. Jack's experiences had hardened her and made her strong, but they'd also taught her a lot more about the nature of people than Miranda could ever have hoped to learn from her high-stakes power plays. Miranda had written her off as dumb muscle, only fit to throw onto the front lines. Powerful sure, but not a serious threat to someone of her \"intelligence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled. \"Let's see how much of a master manipulator you are when you haven't got every guy falling over himself to get a look at your ass. We'll see who's the whiny one when you start having to lift a finger to get people to do things for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfect. Miranda's famous curves made curvier. That catsuit she wore might be sexy now, but it would serve to advertise every added pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her method of fattening the femme fatale, her approach would be elegant and discreet. She'd feed her a fuckton of food of course. All the while playing to her vanity and love for control. Yes this would require spending more time in her presence than would be ideal, and yes this would even require playing nice, but it would be worth it. Outsmarting Miranda this way would be more satisfying than even splattering her against a wall would be, if only by a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack made her way to the mess hall. The mess sergeant was nowhere to be seen, probably off fixing something or slacking off just as likely. She'd have to see if there was anything around she could prepare without much difficulty. She opened up the fridge to find a chocolate cheesecake with caramel drizzled over the top. Clearly Rupert was having fun with those new ingredients Shepard had picked up. She knew the cheerleader had only finished lunch an hour or so ago, so a full meal was probably out of the question, but it's amazing what can be construed as a \"snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poured out a cup of coffee that was mostly cream and sugar and placed it on a serving tray along with two generously sized slices of cheesecake each on their own plate. One was a bit bigger than the other, she was curious to see which one Miss Bubble Butt would pick. She poured herself a cup of black coffee, for appearances' sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to Miranda's office was only a few steps. The bitch probably doesn't get much exercise going to the mess hall and back, and it shows. She was soft. And Jack was going to make her softer. Jack barged in and set the tray down with a bit more force than necessary. Miranda looked up from her work with a sickeningly calm expression. \"What's all this Jack? Did you want to talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I want to talk, about what happened by the elevator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, I'm sorry I read your poems to the others. That was over the line. But you must admit the idea of you as a poet was quite amusing. Imagine how you'd react if you found out I was secretly wrestling varren or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, emotional people never write poetry as a way to deal with shit. I'm hilarious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to say I'm sorry, but you're making it very hard for me.\" Miranda had not hesitated in digging into the cheesecake and was taking sips of coffee between bites. Yeah, eat it up bitch, you've earned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I wanted to say sorry too, I overreacted. But next time, fucking ask before you go spreading my private stuff around like that. You know, I've got poems with you in them too. Get on my good side and I might let you read them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jack's amazement, Miranda had finished her slice of cheesecake and was starting on the other one! Rude and gluttonous, no manners whatsoever. Perhaps she was trying to \"show dominance\" or some shit. Well, we'll see who's dominant when you've resigned to desk duty due to not fitting in your armor. Maybe the XO just had a sweet tooth and no sense of propriety, time would tell.</span></div></div>",

She even picked up a pre-fabricated cake and Jack shoved the a whole slice from the cake into her mouth; she picked up the cake with her hand, getting icing and cream all over her fingers, but she casually licked each digit clean one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, am I stuffed...God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to eat, or else she wouldn't be eating, and she certainly couldn't have that. Emil pushed the food onto her and helped her get even fatter. Completely nude, covered in sweat and crumbs. She had gained almost 65 pounds of fat within a few hours, after gorging on little else but butter, bacon, cake and ice cream. The most of the fat have turned her more to a pear, before all wnt to her belly, but it has shifted downwards by some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmil leaned down and began kissing Jack on the lips, tasting that sweet chocolate residue clinging to his tongue.

She pulled out the nuggets and started shoving them all in her mouth, one by one, swollowing them in one large gulp. As she was eating her fries, she got a large cup and poured both the soda and milkshake in together, and gulped it down, only stopping to take a breath or to burp. As she finished her meal, she noticed her belly stuck out 2 feet out of her shirt. As she saw this, she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon, her stomach was pushing out of her shirt, becoming flabbier and more rotund. Her breasts were rounding out and growing slightly. Her butt was becoming a bit more jiggly, as well as a bit bigger. But this was just the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She went right into the pastas. She decided to eat them without utensils, as she just used her hands, scooping them and swallowing them, then immediantly pouring them in her mouth, maknig her larger attributes grew bigger with each bite of the pastas. Soon, she ate all the pastas, and then she saw that the three root beers haven't even been touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her stomach was slightly full, but she though she could have a bit more. So, taking off all the caps, she drank the entire first bottle, gulping down the carbonated beverage. As she continued her soda binge, her stomach was bloating up from the soda, and the carbonated bubbles from it. as she finished the last bottle, her stomach was full to the brim, as if it was about to explode with just one pinch on her pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And was it a big belly! It looked as if it was over 9 months pregnant! Jack saw the enlarged stomach, and was astonished and enlighted to see it, as it was the beginning of a wonderful start to her weight gain. She rubbed it, moaning and groaning in both delight, and in a small amount of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She continued to rub her stomach, until she saw a few pieces of pasta remaining from one of the pasta dishes. She was a bit reluctant to eat them, but since there was only six pieces of it, she grabbed them all and ate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!!\"she thaught. \"I love being so stuffed up and not even be full yet!\"Jack grabbed another 2leter beer and drank it.her stomach was stretched to it's limits and carly was getting full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged herself on her bloated belly and sat in a beanbag chair.looking around she saw that she still had brownies,lots of burgers and 7 2liter beers. she grabbed all of the beers and sat down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one she pulled off the caps and she puled the first one up to her mouth and chugged it down.her belly was expanding and she was half done with the 4th 2liter beer when she felt her stomach moan in protest of the 5th beer.Sh smiled and let the 5th beer pour down her throat and into her large full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clutched her stomach and moaned her stomach felt so good!!!I\" wanna eat more\".she moaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Ate until her bra burst from the stress of containing her D cup boobs she was now considered fat amongst most people but she continued until all that was left on her was her underwear she went from 180 pounds to a whopping 230 in just one sitting then the Asari student ilara walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, the longer she stared at it all, she began to notice the lack of green, that is, anything potentially healthy like vegetables, and even every other color was meant to represent something succulent and delicious but ultimately unhealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were entire cakes sliced up into numerous pieces, there were barrels full of bagels, tables covered with piles of croissants and donuts, family-sized bags of potato chips, cupcakes of every size and color, muffins ranging from chocolate to blueberry, a giant wheel of cheddar cheese, numerous milkshakes kept in bottles in a bucket of ice, and even a mini-fridge packed with every ice cream flavor, all 470 of them currently known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sneered, and she licked her lips, running her tongue along the surface of her round lips in the most sensual way possible. She reached over to the table and grabbed herself a bowl of mayonnaise, a butter knife, and some slices of cinnamon raisin bread.<br>\r\nShe ate and ate until it was nothing left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nher once delicate and intricate tattoos were stretched and distorted over her skin, each of them moving like waves as she moved her fat jiggled. When that\u00b4s said her body caught up to her feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began to expand as her own body began to surge outwards, growing rounder with newly formed fat, causing her finely etched tattoos to stretch and become distorted over her expansive new body. Her lower half was the first site that began to grow fatter, her thighs started to widen, and pushed each other forcing Jack\u2019s legs to open wider as the thighs grew fatter and fatter as more and more fat found its home in Jacks expanding body. The lack of clothing Jack was wearing allowedher to see the new jiggling flesh forming all over her thighs as she expanded outwards on the bed, Jack was thankful that her fat was forming solidly over her body rather than loose hanging cellulite flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack\u2019s legs were soon followed by her once small but firm ass cheeks, as they very quickly swelled larger and larger surging past 2 times their original size in a matter of hours, her ass slowly starting to look like two large balls of solid butter spreading out heavily from Jack\u2019s body and across the bed. Jack\u2019s legs followed suit, no longer was there any semblance of the once petite tattooed legs as meaty thunder thighs replaced them. As the fat continued to flow into her, Jacks ass continued to spread heavily across the bed as it wobbled its way from her main body. Her fat ass having grown so large that that it started to form her love handles as her ass grew fatter and wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next place to bulge outwards was her gut, Jack slowly lost view of her fattening feet as a large band of fat surrounding her mid-section pushed outwards making its presence known, looking to Jack like tattooed mountain of fat rising from the centre of her body. Her gut which had been gently rising on her thighs began to quickly grow wider and fatter as Jack filled up, her stomach quickly becoming as large as her ass, the added weight settled as 2 thick rolls of fat with a smaller roll just above it, giving Jack a double belly. Her stomach started filling in the small fat rolls that were growing on her back forming into multiple thick rolls, making a crease in the middle where her waist used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts eventually started to grow and while they were not the focal point of Jacks growth they did they started to grow fat, heavy and saggy from the new large amount of weight being piled on them \u201cAt least I\u2019ve finally got some decent sized tits\u201d thought Jack glumly as she saw her new fat breasts spilling out of the tiny cloth strip. Although they still maintained most some of their original perkiness, despite being far larger than their original shape. Jack felt it getting much harder to breathe as the fat began to weigh down her chest. Jack has gained 60 pounds in a manner of hours, putting her total weight on 240 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Creases were developing on her sides, love-handles were gushing out of her jeans, and her butt wouldn't stop getting flabbier. Jack quickly put on a blue two-piece (she didn't have many other outfits to choose from), got everything else together, and rushed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She ran the entire way to the recreation room. She was already out of breath and sweating by the time she arrived. She had once been able to traverse hectic battlefields without so much as breaking a sweat. Now she couldn't handle going down 6 decks. Jack had thought herself better than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a hand on her stomach. She shook it and watched it wobble. She suddenly felt hungry, but tried to ignore it. 'fucking hell, just how much work do I have to do to lose this porky gut of mine?

She began by a making a simple, but large sized and very fatty breakfast with huge piles of buttery toast, fried bread, bacon, sausages etc and several large pints of an extra fatty chocolate milkshake she'd made especially for her bingeing days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sat at the breakfast table and eagerly began wolfing the food down with joy, taking immense pleasure at all of the wonderful fatty tastes she was experiencing. She was enjoying this so much that she actually began to moan quite loudly and almost orgasmically with each bite of food or each gulp of her fatty milkshake, allowing food to fall from her mouth or the melted butter to drip down her chin and into her ample bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack also noticed that as she was eating, her belly was growing even bigger and even softer, now taking up the majority of her lap after just a few minutes of bingeing; placing a hand on it to feel it grow whilst she ate, feeling it spread her fingers apart as it expanded more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this feels so fucking good!\" Jack moaned with her mouth full of food as she eagerly shovelled more and more into her mouth, loving the feeling of being big and full. At the rate she was gorging herself, she'd finish this huge breakfast in a matter of minutes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd polished off the last of that breakfast, Jack heaved her fattened self up from her chair and waddled into the living room, where she plopped herself down into her favourite chair, where she'd fitted a secret milkshake dispenser. She then switched the TV on and sat back, milkshake in hand to let that meal digest a bit more before one or two of her 'between meals' brownies she'd stole the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bigger, so therefore I must be!\" She reasoned as she stepped onto the scales, hearing them creak slightly under her new weight. After a few seconds they finally made up their mind and settled on 210 pounds. 10 pounds gained from just that 'small' breakfast binge. Shepard double checked and was amazed she'd gained so much from seemingly so little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I've been such a porker today, fucking great!Said Jack while she remembered she was suppose to lose her pork not gain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Between all the abductions and Collector attacks and suicide missions, it was a welcome relief when the base was finally blown to bits and they could all put this chapter behind them. There was still work to do of course given the coming threat of the Reapers, but that didn't mean the crew didn't deserve a break from all the action and peril. Thus when Shepard put a skeleton crew on and sent everyone away for some R+R before the next assignment, it was a welcome relief. While she and Garrus stayed behind, no doubt to perform some \"calibrations\" on the nearly empty ship, the other crew members all went to see their families and friends to spend a nice week or so together before reuniting for the next mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone exception to this was of course Jack, whose idea of relaxation was to track down a tiny cell of Cerberus grunts and level the place. It was a lot of fun, but the ruckus attracted the attention of the local militia, and she was only saved from another long jail sentence, or perhaps worse, thanks to the intervention of an old ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for pulling my ass out of the fire back on Jiro, by the way,\" Jack said to her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble at all,\" Liara replied with a knowing smile. \"I was owed a couple of favors, saving one of Shepard's friends is well worth the cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you two anything to drink?\" the waitress asked the two ladies politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...I'll have the White Akantha tonight,\" Liara decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, same thing,\" Jack said quickly, not making heads or tales of the drinks menu. The waitress shot her a suspicious look before obediently trundling off. Jack couldn't blame her; she put on a nice shirt for this place but Jack still looked a little out of place in a fancy sunlit restaurant on the nicer side of Illium. A little too punk rock for all these stuffy blue aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would think that after the Collector mission you'd be taking a break,\" the Asari information broker said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to those bugs, turning Cerberus goons into hamburger is a break,\" Jack laughed, drawing more annoyed gazes that prompted her to lower her voice somewhat. \"Besides, now that the Pragia facility is a hole in the ground, I have nothing else to do, unless I want to spend the next few weeks trolling for a good lay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Liara replied, her tone rather impenetrable. \"I imagine after a while though even tearing through Cerberus facilities may get a little boring, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no shit,\" Jack grumbled. \"But what the hell else is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you are in need of something to do, I may have...an option,\" the Asari mused, a slight smile forming on her lips as the waitress arrived with the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's helping you deal with some dirty laundry or whatever information brokers do, I'm not interested,\" Jack said coolly, giving her wine glass a suspicious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it's an experiment of sorts,\" Liara explained. \"One of my colleagues is running a study on how to enhance the power level of biotics, independent of increased focus or implants to help augment powers and abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my attention,\" Jack said, sipping her drink with a rather puzzled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be blunt,\" Liara said, choosing her words carefully. \"She wishes to study the effect of...excessive adipose tissue on biotic energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was never one for an education, so it took a moment for those words to process. When they did, she nearly choked on her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excessive adipose...you mean, like, fat tissue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the Asari said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it's not as ludicrous as it sounds,\" Liara said defensively. \"Asari with health defects that cause them to be a little heavyset can sometimes push their biotics a bit further, my friend is only pushing it to its logical conclusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, your friend wants to fatten me up and see if I throw shit harder?\" Jack said. \"Yeah, no thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it doesn't amount to anything I'll help you get back to normal, I promise,\" Liara pleaded. \"And if it does...well, just imagine the possibilities that it could have for you. Not even a human bred to perfection could hope to match your power, to say nothing of the Cerberus agents you're so fond of assaulting.\" The Asari may have sounded desperate and hopeless, but she was far from it. She really wanted Jack to be in on this project, and if there was anything that could convince Jack to come along, it was the idea of beating up on Cerberus and potentially being better then Miranda Lawson at something. And that one-two punch caused Jack's expression to soften considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and if it doesn't work you'll help to fix it?\" Jack asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack Zero, so nice to meet you!\" the overenthusiastic Quarian in the red, stripey suit said, violently shaking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too. And uh, it's just Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Jack, sorry!\" the Quarian said, rubbing her wrists awkwardly. \"It's just...wow I've heard so much about you, I'm excited to meet you at last! Wow! I'm Mana'Vafin vas Needir, by the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Jack said noncommittally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I've never been called cool before!\" Mana squealed giddily. \"So, you've been briefed on the experiment, I have your biometrics...right! I'll get the first meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought Tali was a dweeb,\" Jack muttered to Liara as the little Quarian dashed off into the corner of her lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just excitable, real sweet when you get to know her,\" Liara said encouragingly. \"You're doing a really nice thing for her too, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so long as it makes me a better biotic then Miranda,\" Jack shrugged. \"I think it will be worth the...what the actual shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" Mana asked, struggling to lift up a salad bowl full of some sort of mashed potato dish. It looked tasty, but it was huge! A tubby varren could have curled up in the bowl if it wanted to! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not making me eat all that, are you?\" Jack said, biting her lip as she slowly lowered herself into a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a drink to go with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shot a look at Liara that was a desperate cry for help as the Quarian dropped the bowl in front of her with a heavy thud as she produced a massive cup with a thick looking beverage. Subject Zero resolved to herself that she would never again be bored turning Cerberus troopers into hamburger ever again, if she survived this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maybe it was because she was so used to Mordin and Chakwas, but Jack was pleasantly surprised by the time spent with Mana'Vafin actually being sort of fun, when she wasn't gorging herself on protein-heavy foods of course. Obviously Jack had an issue with being a lab rat given her past, but the time spent with Mana felt less like a crazy mad scientist performing an experiment and more like moving in with a new roommate that occasionally took measurements. Sure she put restrictions on how much physical activity she could do and regulated her diet, but otherwise the pair of them just did whatever they wanted in Mana's Illium-based laboratory/apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mana had come prepared to entertain a guest long term. She absolutely stocked up on every movie and tv-show that Jack could watch, from the new Blasto flicks to the classic human films from the twentieth century. Jack barely even heard of any of these movies, let alone saw them, and she had to admit they were a blast, and when the movies got stale Mana broke out an extensive collection of games, from the video to the board variety, none of which Jack had even heard of, growing up the way she did. All of which, she later found out, was an attempt by the Quarian experimenter to make her feel comfortable being tested on, since she knew about her particular history involving being a test subject. Swelling with affection at the idea that someone, practically a stranger, cared enough about her feelings to make her comfortable, it didn't take long before Mana had gone from a strange, odd Quarian with a strange and odd idea to someone that Jack could consider a friend, maybe even a best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe downside, admittedly, was the experiment itself. Not the testing, which Mana was making as comfortable and unobtrusive as possible, but rather the relentless stuffing. Mana had been especially eager to get to proving her theories about biotic power, and was relentless in keeping Jack full, gifting her with snacks and thick beverages when she wasn't stuffing herself full of specially made bulking foods. It wasn't enough to make Jack feel resentful towards her new friend, but it was irksome at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Jack!\" Mana chirped from outside the door to her room as Jack's alarm clock went off, rousing her from sleep. \"It's a testing day, how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I'm retaining butter,\" Jack grumbled sleepily, tossing the sheets off of her bed and forcing the shy Quarian to turn away with a small 'eep!', since she slept naked. Getting hurriedly dressed, she winced at the feeling of tightness in the sleeves of her shirt, and the feeling of a small breeze on the bottom of her belly no matter how far she pulled it down. Mana's meals had done their job quite well, and because of them Jack had put on a good fifty pounds of blubber, caked all around her body and protruding from her middle reaching the point where she could begin to feel the weight taking its toll. Everything was a tighter fit on her, she had started feeling heavier and bulkier walking from place to place, and perhaps more alarmingly, she wasn't as averse to Mana's stuffing sessions as she used to be. In fact, sometimes she started to like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack put those thoughts out of her mind as she walked, or at least tried not to waddle, behind Mana as she led her into the laboratory segment of her house. Going through all the motions, lifting this object with her head, touching this sensor with a charge, yadda yadda, Jack got bored enough to begin thinking of blasting apart some Cerberus agents. Slightly smiling, her focus slipped and Mana shrieked as a heavy weight suddenly flew across the room, crashing into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, sorry!\" Jack shouted. \"Are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Mana shouted. \"I KNEW IT, I KNEW THIS THEORY HELD WATER!\" The Quarian practically bounced as she showed Jack a graph on her omni-tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty picture,\" Jack commented sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you fluctuated the dampener ME field on your implant chip by 0.2% with that burst of biotic energy that threw the weight! And that increase is in line with the eezo average that you're emitting across all levels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack flinched as Mana grabbed onto Jack's fleshier arms and looked her dead in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You surpassed the limits of your implant!\" Mana practically screamed. \"You're getting more powerful thanks to your excess weight! It's exactly as I said it was, adipose tissue enhances the output of biotics! I finally have the proof I need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was stunned to silence. Looking at her hands in amazement, she let loose a little biotic energy to make her hands glow with power. Maybe it was just because Mana put the idea in her head...but she actually did feel more powerful. Almost like when Shepard finally upgraded her implant to the higher level, back before they beat the Collectors. She couldn't believe it, fat actually DID make her more powerful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she liked feeling powerful. She liked it a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for phase two!\" Mana announced, rummaging through her equipment. \"We keep going and see if there is an upper limit to how much power can be gained by, well, gaining. I'd love to know that idea out as well, but I can understand if you want to back out now, since you probably-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back out? Fuck that!\" Jack said, making Mana even more excitable about her experiments. \"Let's see how badass I can get with this crazy idea!\"</span></div></div>",

Kasumi goto toked an another bite and so on that she has eaten serval of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...hungry.\u201d she groaned,  she merely continued to glut her way through so Kasumi was beginning to gain weight, in real time.<br>\r\nHer stomach was a cacophony of gurgles and churning, as calories were processed and fat began to be spread across her body, her stomach softened from a bloated, solid lump into a slightly sagging, squishy mass, that only got bigger as she ate, Her already large breasts began to fill out more, bouncing as she moved. Her rump swelled out too, a loud creaking sound from her outfit betraying the strain those increasingly blue moon like orbs were putting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe began to come back to her senses somewhat, blinking and looking down at her expanded body. Kasumis stomach rumbled again and she laughed a little. She noticed her large backside, breasts and belly jiggling as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe composed herself to Get out of there before those who owns these bars, She used a gravity plate that shot her up to the vent hatch and it retracted it self up verticaly to Kasumi, much better than a traditional rope, comon it\u00b4s 2186 who knows what tech there is lying around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a large potbelly, which was perfectly round.  You would mistake her for being pregnant if it didn't hang over her waistband.  Her breasts were perky, and rested nicely on top of her belly. But when crawling back to the docks in the ventilations shaft proved much more difficult now she have gotten fat just under 1 hour. She got stuck sometimes of course, So when she finally came out through the end of the senor grid she could stand up in a corridor that lead to the comons and the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked while her uncomfortable fat dingling around, her suit had cracked open so everyone she passed turned their heads around to look at her bare back. Kasumi could just blush and walk un-suspiciously normal paste towards the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors cloased While Jane Shepard jumped in just in time and not so comfortable for Kasumi who could just face palm.<br>\r\n\"Hold it\"! Said Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile up to the Normandy Shepard smiled at her, \"Want to uplighten me what you have been up too?\" Asked Shepard.<br>\r\n\"Nope\" Said Kasumi Smiling at Jane Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, But what\u00b4s in the bag?\" Asked Shepard with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supplies\" \"I been Shopping\" Responded Kasumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont think so, Whatever it is it must be responible for this\" Jane said while lifting up the upperpart of Kasumi\u00b4s body suit that had barly contained her girth. Shepard slaped her breast\u00b4s and ass and gave it a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!\" \"I\u00b4ll explain Later.\" \"Please!\" Said a scarlett faced Kasumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard picked up a bar and unwrappled it... \"Shepard!\"\" Dont Eat it!\" Shouted Kasumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Do as I please, im gonna try it to determine why you should steal again for what.. Some bars!\" Said Shepard.<br>\r\nShe took a bite and was ``Hooked`` at the taste.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was sweeter, bolder, tangier - All the flavors were overpowering to the one used to a subtle palette of tastes. That made it hard to stop at just one donut, just one bag of chips, just one burger.

Her belly were her largest part, still somewhat shapeful, it was still a singel mass, no rolls, only by sitting. Her huge breasts was impressive despite them being heavier than Liara's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They were large enough that she could reach all the way around them, and were wide enough to press into her still normal sized arms.  Her hips were also rather wide, and would probably need two seats to support it.  It jiggled as she moved closer to John Shepard.<br>\r\nJust then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Although the sweat accumulated during her exertions earlier and sudden movements helped to create new stretch marks over her legs, there was no way that it would stretch to cover that massive gut. but it did. Lovely purpule lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The sudden shocked motion made her breasts swing, knocking her off balance.  She fell into John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lay like that for a minute, with Samara sinking into John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that this is unpleasant, but could you move your breast from ALL my breathing holes, please?<br>\r\n  Your breasts are nearly smothering me.\" Said john.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Samara's chest had landed almost completely over John's face.  Hurriedly, she moved the tits off, making her breasts sag to her sides and touch the bed.  Samara started to heave herself up.  As she did so, she heard a crack along the backside.  Samara blushed, but John merely laughed and said:<br>\r\n\"I think we should get some skin lotion for ya to handle your sexy growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4d like that\" Said Samara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 min later after Samaras skin.. problem was taking care of, they could resume their love making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard could use his hands to explore her body under him. He felt around her soft thighs and made his way up to her crotch, while slowly massaging his cock around her pussy. The fat of Samara's gut softly covered her cunt at the front, so he just fingered the slit for a while, sending confusing shivers through Samaras body, and then moved up her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard's hands had handled her large boobs. He started groping the soft, bare mammaries vigorously with both hands.<br>\r\nSamara felt as if her heart was on fire, So fucking horny and it didn't help that Shepard was squeezing her boobs so gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Shepard!\" Shouted Samara suddenly exposing a bare blue cunt. Shepard stared at the asari's lovely hairless slit with saliva building up in his mouth. His cock was growing harder. <br>\r\n...........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara noticed that her cunt was getting wet. Samara felt her mood sink. \"Shepard, I understand that penetrating my anal passage is enjoyable for you, but it is very painful for me. I assure you that my azure, or pussy as you would call it, is quite tight, so could you instead...\"<br>\r\n While saying this, Samara had taken her hands to her pussy and was spreading its folds with both hands to offer Shepard a view of the tight-looking, moist hole. She felt deeply embarrassed to be doing this, but she saw no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard didn't say anything. He grabbed her by the hips with both hands and plunged his hard cock into her wet, hot cunt in a single movement. Samara yelped with surprise, and he started thrusting his cock in and out of the tight but slippery twat. She began to moan with pleasure as Shepard continued fucking her snatch like a piston. Soon she was screaming, but not out of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, oohh...\" she moaned loudly. Her whole body trembled with the orgasm, but Shepard kept slamming his cock deep into her pussy. Her soaking wet snatch was tight but yielded quite easily to his powerful thrusts. He kept burying his cock to the hilt in her. He reached under her and grabbed her big soft belly in his hands. She kept moaning with pleasure and was soon hit with another orgasm which all but incapacitated her. Shepard flipped her around onto her back, plunged his cock in again, and kept mauling her hole at a rapid pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started kissing Samara's neck and then her mouth. She kissed him back, and wrapped her arms around him. She orgasmed once again before Shepard started shooting his seed all the way to her womb.<br>\r\n......<br>\r\nShepard lied next to Samara and amusedly watched her coming back to senses. \"By the Goddess, Shepard,\" she said finally, smiling and rubbing her warm fat naked body against his. \"I have not felt such pleasure in a very long time\"... <br>\r\nHe tried to pull her towards him and gave a long kiss on her lips, which she returned, sticking her tongue in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard,\" she said, \"I hope you do not intend to tell others about our, uh, love making.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll only tell Garrus and Joker,\" Shepard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! You can't tell them anything!\" Samara screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the sadist in Shepard wanted to keep tormenting her, his better side won this time. \"Samara,\" he said and looked her in the eye. \"I apologize for a bad attempt at humor. I won't tell anyone about us.\" Said Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"They'll have to decide for themselves why you're spending so much time in my cabin.\" Said John Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara thought about it. She had to admit that the stories about Liara's unusual sexual cravings Shepard told her during their sex,  could as well be another one of his odd jokes. She was usually good at discerning if people were telling the truth, but it was different with him. \"Damn you, Shepard,\" she said. \"I can never be sure what you're really thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We humans tend to joke and sometimes tell a story with some Jokes in it.\" Said Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I See\" Said Samara. While rubbing her bloated gut that was overfilled by Johns sperm from the Love making Hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for round 2?\" Asked Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara Nodded while heaving herself up, at least tried to, her gut was in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She whimpered at how tight the thick cock made her cunt feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara started rocking her hips slowly, making Shepard's cock move back and forth and push against the walls of her pussy. Her large boobs swayed with the movements of her hips, grazing against his body now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowed down to lick her hard and erect dark blue nipples and then kissed her neck. Samara, who continued bouncing on his cock, purred in response. \"Shepard,\" she whispered in his ear between moans of pleasure, \"your cock is amazing. I love it inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard answered, without exaggerating much, that her pussy was the best he'd ever fucked. This compliment pushed Samara over the edge. She had another one of her body-shaking orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goddess! Oh yes!\" Samara kept repeating between moans. Lying on her ass on the bed, she clutched onto the bedsheets as Shepard ravaged her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Shepard sensed that Samara was having another orgasm.

Her fat gut hanged so it covered her pussy hand her new HH breasts were hanging even further down. Her assets have lost their shape, they were now blue jelly bags like her ass cheeks. But no part of her rolled, despite her age she was a goddes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the bathroom and placed the weight scale below her, she stepped up and down and up again until the numbers gave an accurate number on her weight. She could not see pass her boobs so she bent down to feel her gut in the way so she putted both hands on the gut to press it towards her. The readout on the scale red 120 KG ( 225-230 pounds ), well Samara was tall for an Asari 192 cm (6foot2) So a fat ball she was not, still an hourglass, big boobs and ass as the biggest features and the gut on 3rd place.

She waddled over to the door to leave for the bathroom, stopping by the mirror to examine herself. She still had trouble believing this was her now. She was still wearing her usual outfit, but it was tight on her. Her breasts were almost the size of her head and quite heavy, ready to feed the children when born. Her hips and butt had also filled out, giving her a motherly shape. But they couldn't compare to the globe that was her belly. It was slightly bigger than a medicine ball and very heavy with the twins.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she has managed to lose weight, down too 210 to be exactly but she actually weighed 221 pounds because of the babies she carried.<br>\r\nIt\u00b4s been 8 months ago she gave up her justicar title and became shepard\u00b4s mate. In recent months, both collectors and reapers have been defeated in a green light from the citadel above the earth. But that was a month ago and now.. rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara walked out from her cabin of the refitted Normandy to catch up with Shepard in the shuttle bay and they expected no company at all, maybe.<br>\r\nHowever, they took the shuttle down to Miami spaceport to rent a skycar who would take them to the beach where sun and water were present and some reaper destroyers in the distance who cleaned up the rubble from land areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>( I chose synthesis ending for ME3 and timed skipped from ME2. In that green ending Shepard is vaporized into digital code inside the catalyst above Earth, Those who haven't played that game I suggest you do that. However, they found traces of Shepard's blood from the time right after his jump down to the green energy spiral who dissolved him into the digital code. They took the Blood into a cell that was targeted for a rapid growth acceleration into Shepards form right before he was dissolved. Memories and intelligence are just like the original Shepard. However, some genetic manipulation was performed by Miranda to increase Shepard's life span to 600 years or something.) </i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen samara went out of the shuttle doors she saw journalists who had cameras and kids who held their Omni-tools and papers towards John Shepard. Probably his autograph. She could only smile for the scene when shepherds gave them all that they wanted.<br>\r\nThey left for the skycar who was red to color and John gestured to Samara to sit first, she was trying with her fat and pregnant belly but her ass was still firm, it didn't hang at all. She was helped by John of course and he was then seated in the driver's seat and they kissed each other's lips and clunge their hands together as the car went up in the sky for the sunny beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2 Hours later.</b><br>\r\nBefore Shepard took the skycar down to the designated parking lot just outside the clean beach area, he took a look at Samara. She had fat cheeks,  a second chin, her boobs pressed out against her red suit almost making it unfit to wear in public, and her ass had grown out quite a bit too. But it was her belly that took the cake. But was 8 months pregnant as well.<br>\r\nShepard was having trouble not staring at the big blue breasts.<br>\r\n\" Samara\"? \" I brought this black Bikini with me, the top is designed to keep in your brests,\" John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara looked down at her boobs that hung downwards at the side of her huge belly. \" They are 40DDD Natural,\" She said and groped her tits and let them smackdown again to her belly.<br>\r\nShepard Gulped at the sight.<br>\r\nBefore he could say anything she began to undress in her seat to the bikini Shepard brought along, and he did not forget towels as well and body lotion that lied in a duffle bag in the backseat.<br>\r\n\" Common,\" He said and rubbed her gut that perfectly covered her pubic area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard Dressed in his shorts and showed off his abs and muscles as he put on some sunglass as he walked out of the car when he has changed his clothes.  He walked around the skycar over to the passenger seat was Samara sat and he opened the door to lend a hand to Samara. He smiled as she took his hand and he felt he had to really pull her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara felt horny with lust and hunger only in the sight of Shepard's muscular body, she really felt like jumping on him right there and now, but it was a public place, children and parents and young couples walked around over to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked over to the beach and John flung out the large towel for him and Samara to lie on before hitting the water. It was indeed 35 Celsius in the air, but in the water, it was 25. <br>\r\nSamra carefully sat down as her huge boobs smacked against her belly as her ass wobbled by the act of sitting down, she pulled out the lotion on her body and Shepard smoothed it over with his hand as she flung her head back in pleasure as Shepard lustfully did his part.<br>\r\nHe began to withe her boobs and went to her back and belly, later her love handles and muffin top. Her tights and hips and legs later, when he was done her cyan blue body glanced in the sun like a beacon in the dark even though it as bright as the sun itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>But some footsteps came closer and both Samara and Shepard looked and saw...</b></span></div></div>",

Kasumi, jack and James went along and was later joined with Liara, Tali, Samantha Traynor, Joker and EDI, Kaidan, wrex and his pal Grunt with his pet warren and at last Javik who only came because Liara begged him to come along. Shepard only planed his vacation with Samara alone but didn't mind his squadmates and friends and allies to join him, and he could shake the memories of Miranda's ass!

Now. Imagine a European Royal palace, ok? The floor is Marmor stone like the pillars placed around the walls of the room, Large glass window against the Hotel Exterior. Very fancy to be 2186-2187.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter a while when everyone was gathered around the table they received wine, beers and some pieces of bread before the \u00b4\u00b4all you can eat food\u00b4\u00b4 has been prepared. So Tali, of course, had a straw into her induction port so she could Consume the Beer she was so fond of, after a while, she was drunk as fuck and made her belly bloat out 10 inches. Kasumi did the same but not at the same extent.<br>\r\n Javik became intoxicated pretty quick while James was unaffected he pulled of his bad jokes to javik that would\u00e9nt have made him laugh but he did. Next to him sat Liara facepalming at Javik\u00b4s and James bantering and munched on a couple of bread with butter, a lot of butter. Samara did the Same but she drank no alcohol, she is pregnant but asari\u00b4s are not affected the same way human females would but Samara is a person of self-control.<br>\r\n Next to her sat John Shepard, the galactic hero, he sat with Wrex and Grunt who had had already drunken a barrel of ryncol. Stronger than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food was ready with dishes from all corners of the galaxy and some unknown food that was brought by the reapers. They were supplying every single world and colony so food was abundant. no food shortage, only widening waistlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen everyone has taken their share of food and plates or made several trips to the food benches and took another plate of food to their chair around the table. Samara had about 10 Kilos of food in front of her, most of them were human delicates that she was now used to thanks to Shepard. Liara was most fond off the prothean food javik had been cocking for her and the others, for a none prothean the food was quite fattening and it is shown on Liara'ss body, her belt just snapped and her boobs have increased in size in just a manner of minutes. Kasumi ate some Asian food like rice and noodles with soja sauce. quite salty and unhealthy, but did she care? nope. None of the males has overdone it. They just chatted about how many kills they have scored in a day, but later thought it was more entertaining by watching the females gorging in food, and witness how their clothing is ripping by the fierce force of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda had a reason for not getting up from her seat. Reason why? She was stuck. Her ass and hips have flared out but leaving her waist and bust untouched by adipose build up. She was a beauty to behold even if she didn't think so.<br>\r\nHey, I forgot to mention our tattoed badass Jack, did I?<br>\r\nwell, she laid under the table and giving James a blowjob. Just kidding.<br>\r\nShe was sitting cramped between Kaidan and Miranda, she was asleep because of food coma. She was stuffed and fat, her belt was gone and her belly was 42 inches around. At the opposite end of the table sat Samantha with a muffin top and a beer belly that she was massaging. Next to her was Tali with similar features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext....</span></div></div>",

With generations of nutrient paste and small diets onboard the Quarian flotilla and the war, she was happy and fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Samantha</b> looked more like Kasumi. Just a 32 inches belly exposed so her lovely dark skin showed the rest how stretched it was, and her love handles are so inviting. she tried to unbutton the last button at her jeans but realized she held her breath. so she relaxed and so the bottom snapped off and the gut rode down in a wobble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jack,</b> the ultimate jackass and badass have eaten the second-most by the group just beating Liara and fell behind Samara as the number one.<br>\r\nJacks boobs and ass finally took a hit from the adipose build-up from her stuffing. It all started with a pair of bread and then a bunch of steaks. Later Pizza and some unknown Prothean dish that was quite fattening which caused a rapid expansion of Jacks skinny frame. Her belly was huge, I mean it is ca 50 inches around and it was not tight, it was jelly, and it hunged down to her knees. ( Mature Content Warning) She sat naked. no clothing she brought fitted her now, she just sat shamelessly and forced James to rub her belly and made Kaidan finger her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Miranda</b>, The raven-haired beauty. Genetically engineered to be perfect, but to defy perfection, it all comes to a certain point of view. Me and you of course.<br>\r\nthe fat followed her body shape. Ass 55 Inches around and each tight is 40 and hips similar to her ass. she had a belly of course and a pair of melons which had burst her top long ago. She decided to leave and go to her hotel room but was helped by  Shepard to her Room, he excused himself and made sure Samara didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>after tha</b>t, he came back and sat next to Samara. Also naked because her dress could not contain a 60-inch belly and a monster bust. Her ass and lower parts were like Mirandas but her belly took the brunt of it. it could have been smaller if Samara wasn't 8 months pregnant but still... She was huge. She probably weighed 225 pounds before the buffet, but know she regained some lost weight to put her back on 290 pounds.<br>\r\nHe helped her to finish off her leftovers, like a feeder. after that her belly noise-like. \u00b4\u00b4 Grrrrrrrrrrruuuuuuu!\u00b4\u00b4 several times. But some rubbing made her digestion better and even better when she decided to make out with John. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One hand alternating with the other, her mouth was never empty, even for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Plateful after plateful of chicken pieces went down her throat, but she had no hunger left, it was only waste to not eat everything up. Her hands amazingly sped up even faster, now cramming whole pieces into her maw. Her tongue and teeth worked feverishly, peeling off every scrap of edible material and she spits out the bones and picked clean. After about half an hour, she needed a change, and pushed the finished plate of chicken away and grabbed a bucket-sized bowl of potato salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Instantly starting to use both hands to shovel huge spoonfuls of the potato salad into her hard-working mouth, Samara alternated one hand after the other, never letting her mouth empty, often forcing the current mouthful down her throat by stuffing in the next one. The spicy bite of paprika overwhelmed her tongue, coming so fast with the speed of her stuffing and Shepards massaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Driven by the sheer will, Samara barely paid attention to anything beyond the massive pile of food before her. She barely glanced upward when Liara arrived at her side and gasped aloud when she saw Samara's progress, her speed, and she massively stuffed the swollen belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned dazed eyes to the table; it was still covered completely, but it seemed the food was down to the last layer. With her head back and Samara managing not only a steady but a continuous stream of food into her, Samara couldn't look down far enough to see her belly inflate (not yet, anyway; she was sure that before long, at this rate, she'd be able to see her belly without looking down at all), so she let go of the chair and reached her hands towards her midsection. <br>\r\nThey ran into blue flesh, much sooner than Samara expected, and she climaxed immediately from the realization of just how enormous her stuffed belly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Leaving her hands resting on her growing belly, she could actually feel it swell with each morsel forced into it. Each jolting increase sent another wave of pleasure through her, keeping her climaxing non-stop until the last drop of food went into her mouth and she could finally empty it.<br>\r\n Exhausted and panting, she forced the last bits of her meal down into her belly herself, with john standing over her and grinning fiercely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" john?.....Burp!.. hick.. oooohhhh... Can you assist me too our room?\" Samara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Of course!\" He said and looked over who was left to help. The girls were out of the question so he saw James, Joker, EDI and Javik as well as Kaidan who was returning from the elevator after he carried Samantha Traynor to her room. So he gathered them around a circle to discuss how they should move Samara, she was too stuffed to move right now, she\u00b4s probably 320 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What about biotics?\" Said Shepard but Kaidan and javik said no.<br>\r\n\" a biotic field could do harm Shepard.\" Said Kaidan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"move the Asari on a cart.\" Said Javik bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Or we just ask Wrex and Grunt to help.\" Said, James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can just.....</span></div></div>",

But with the Normandy kinetic-barriers and hull plating with Trinium alloy it was a safe ride back through space all the way to the mass relay was they were going to load up some more supplies at the other side. All for the next mission and next dinner and shooting contest with Garrus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hangar on the Normandy:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Joker`Are we clear yet?\" Asked Shepard.<br>\r\n\" Yep, all done commander.

She recognized the voice as the Asari Justicar, Samara. \"I need to speak to you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that something be?\" The doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed an odd increase in my weight.\" Samara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the point, Dr. Chakwas finally turned to see Samara. She looked like she normally did, so the doctor was confused, until she saw Samara's stomach. There, in place of Samara's well toned abdomen, was a small but still noticable pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've probably just been eating too much.\" The doctor suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it. I haven't been eating much for the past two days since I've been focusing on finding my quarry. And yet, I'm still gaining weight.\" Samara explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. That is odd.\" The doctor replied, rubbing her chin. \"Why don't you come over here and step on this scale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara nodded and walked over to the scale. She removed her boots and stepped on. After a few seconds, the readout showed \"152 Ibs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was 140 three days ago.\" Samara said while putting her boots back on. \"And as I've said, I've haven't been eating as much, so why am I gaining weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take a blood sample and run some tests. That might yield some answers.\" Dr. Chakwas replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara agreed and, grabbing a needle, Dr. Chakwas took the blood sample from Samara's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll run those tests.

Fortunately no one else on the bridge seemed very much interested in Samara and her rather delicate position, outside of Kelly Chambers giving her a curious glance before quickly turning back to her console as Miranda Lawson approached her with data-pad in hand, no doubt going over some Cerberus intel. The Asari Justicar gave the operative a polite nod as she walked by, and couldn't help but notice that Lawson seemed a bit on edge. Almost....strained. Samara started glancing downward towards her supposedly perfect figure before an offhand sigh demanded her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki Shepard leaned on the railing overlooking the galaxy map, manipulating the projection with one hand in between twirling a strand of her black hair around her finger, a large indicator of her incredible boredom at her current task. Samara was endlessly puzzled by a paragon such as her not dedicating herself fully to even the most menial tasks, but then again a lot of things about the Commander endlessly puzzled her. She was an able commander and a decorated hero, but loved to sketch and tinker with electronics, she worked with human supremacists and criminals yet treated everyone regardless of race with the utmost respect, and she was one of the best fighters she had ever known yet preferred to resolve battles with words rather then violence. Above all, Samara decided, she was an enigma, but even so the Justicar felt she knew her well enough, perhaps even enough to call her a friend, that even after the Justicar gently turned down the Commander's advances...there was still just a hint of yearning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment though, that feeling just made her hyper-aware of the extra twelve pounds she carried on her, Samara realized as she tried to suck her gut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter, Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara looked up at Yuki, mildly perturbed that she was still using that pet name for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to intrude on you, Shepard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means, I'm <i>begging</i> someone to intrude on me,\" Shepard groaned. \"Prospecting for palladium is such a drag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do need it for the ship's armor,\" Samara pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, why do you always have to be right,\" Shepard complained jokingly, stretching out her back. \"Seriously though, you do look like something's troubling you. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara paused, unable to shake the feeling that the commander was trying to flirt with her again. Well if she was, Samara reasoned, it didn't mean she wasn't being sincere. She knew her well enough to tell otherwise, if anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merely some health concerns,\" Samara said delicately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're not still aching from that sniper shot you took on the last mission are you?\" Shepard said. \"Mordin said the Blue Suns may have been using some experimental ammo. Even Grunt was feeling weird after tanking one of those shots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that,\" Samara said reassuringly. \"It's...well, I seem to have put on some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara tried not to wince as Shepard's eyes shot towards her protruding potbelly. Something seemed to flicker behind her eyes before looking away with a polite smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really that noticeable,\" Shepard insisted. \"Maybe the mess hall's been putting something weird in the food. It has been a little hearty the last few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't noticed,\" Samara said coolly. \"The doctor is running some tests to make sure nothing is wrong, naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just what I was going to suggest, actually,\" the Commander said. \"I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Everyone gets bloated once in a while, right Miranda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara looked over in time to see Miranda snap up from her conversation with Kelly Chambers, her face turning slightly pink as her hand drifted towards her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...y-yes of course...\" she replied shakily. \"Nothing at all to worry about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uncertainty about the situation somewhat soothed, Samara quietly excused herself to return to her chambers. Taking her usual position looking out to the stars, she put the stomach resting gently on her waist out of mind, beginning her meditations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...why must this be so difficult...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara grunted as she tried to tug her uniform on over her prominent paunch, her controlled emotions slipping somewhat due to her frustration. Since her talk with Shepard, she'd been spending the last few days in meditation and fasting in the hopes that her bloating would go down, and now suddenly her clothes weren't fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFasting hadn't made her lose the weight; the weight was coming anyway. Clearly something was not normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a feat of impressive strength, Samara finally managed to pull her outfit all the way on, snapping the straps closed. Her reflection in the window glass was....not that impressive. The pot-belly had swollen in size, slightly larger and becoming part of a ring of flab that wound its way around her hips; a love handle, the humans liked to call it. Revolting was the word she would prefer to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, the results of the blood work would be in today. Then she could find out whatever was afflicting her and that would be the end of this embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, your blood work is perfectly fine,\" Chakwas announced proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Justicar fixed her with a steely look, somewhere between deep concern and irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...the other tests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as medicine is concerned, Samara, you're a perfectly healthy specimen,\" the doctor confirmed, handing her the results of the test as she went to clean up her equipment for the next patient. \"Aside from...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something must have been missed then,\" Samara declared sharply. \"There's no other reason this can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outside of a poor diet?\" Chakwas interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara, glaring, decided to wordlessly remove herself from the situation. The human doctor was clearly not going to be any help in finding out what was wrong with her. Perhaps another expert was needed. The Salarian seemed knowledgeable about medical happenings and genetic defects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could implore Mordin for answers, in her haste to exit the doctor's office on the ship, Samara nearly walked right into...</span></div></div>",

Both fell to the deck with soft thumps, the Justicar releasing her held in paunch in surprise. The Asari heard a faint pop from as a seam ripped and her blueberry fupa was suddenly pouring free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018So sorry, I have to go,\u2019 Samara stammered, \u2018I\u2019m...not feeling well.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Justicar stood up with less grace than she might once have and hurried off with her hands pressed over her lower midrif. Miranda looked at the fleeing alien, who\u2019s thighs had begun brushing in her red uniform and knitted her perfectly shaped brows in annoyance. Normally the brusque brunette would have objected but she had bigger things to worry about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Miranda was clad in a skintight body suit that showed off her jaw dropping curves: 36DD X a chiseled 24 inch waist X a 38 inch booty. And she still was, but her upper body was hidden by an XL black hoody depicting the Terra Firma twins, athletic blonde models known for their extremist pro human political stances. It was large enough to deny a glimpse of her thighs and hips, to the sadness of most of the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Ah Miss Lawson,\u2019 Dr. Chakwas said, \u2018what\u2019s the issue?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This is a little embarassing but i\u2019ve had a bit of a bloating issue lately,\u2019 the genetically perfected spy said with none of her usual firmness, \u2018and I need to make sure its nothing serious\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, i\u2019ll need to examine it,\u2019 the aging doctor said, \u2018off with the hoody please.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda wasn\u2019t a modest woman but she was unusually reticient in revealing herself today. The hoody was peeled off and the biotic was revealed, her body suit hanging open from chest to navel, the zipper unable to rise up even an inch past her hip bone. Chakwas prodded the brunette who winced as the doctors fingers went deep and then began to pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, there\u2019s no bloating issue at least,\u2019 Chakwas said, \u2018onto the scale please.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018No bloating?\u2019 Miranda asked, following her like a child, \u2018then what\u2019s wrong?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh nothing\u2019s \u2018wrong\u2019 per se,\u2019 Chakwas said, \u2018you\u2019re just too chubby for this catsuit.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda blinked a few times, poleaxed at the frank words, \u2018I...no...I can\u2019t get chubby\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, you did,\u2019 Chakwas said, \u2018you\u2019re clocking in at 159 pounds. Up nineteen since your last physical four weeks ago and only six away from overweight by BMI standards.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Nineteen pounds!\u2019 the biotic yelled, making some crewmembers on the same level stop as the voice cut through the soundproofing, she looked around sheepishly, \u2018that\u2019s not possible! I can\u2019t have gotten that fat that quick!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well this scale is correct,\u2019 Chakwas said, pinching Miranda\u2019s no longer toned waist with a caliper, \u2018Hmm, your body fat percentage has risen while your muscle percentage is rapidly declining. I don\u2019t think I need to measure your lung capacity to guess that you are quite out of shape.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawson\u2019s pale face flushed, highlighting her softened jawline and fuller cheeks, \u2018this isn\u2019t possible...I\u2019m...I\u2019m perfect...my genetics\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well everyone\u2019s can fail,\u2019 Chakwas said, \u2018I\u2019m sure that most of the women who\u2019s genes made you would have gained weight if they sat in their office all day\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019ve been stressed out getting our paper work together after breaking from cerberus,\u2019 Miranda admitted, idly trying to tug her outfits zipper up and completely failing, doing nothing but making her very heavy looking breasts bounce, \u2018and I might have snacked a bit\u2026but I wasn\u2019t just eating\u2026 and shouldn\u2019t my nanites have fixed that anyway?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Let me run a diagnostic,\u2019 the doctor said, taking a minor blood sample and examining it, \u2018oh, this is interesting. Your nanites are...damaged.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Damaged how?\u2019 the not quite perfect woman asked, \u2018can\u2019t you fix them?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh no, its stemming from your biotic implant. It appears to be altering the polarity of the nanites, any nanites exposed to your elemental zero field will be reprogrammed to not burn extra fat. Well have to test more but it might have come from those special rounds the Blue Suns were using last mission might have reacted badly with your implant.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked at her horribly unfit body, swallowing, \u2018what are my options?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well the first option is a strenuous exercise program and a strict diet should see a weight loss of one pound per week,\u2019 Chakwas said, \u2018although it will be difficult, you are very out of shape.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of long days at a desk with a bag of candy in one drawer and chips in the other, with dessert breaks after every meal came to Miranda. The perfect woman had let herself go and knew that forcing herself back into shape would require a lot of sweat and effort. Sweat and effort she wasn\u2019t sure she could make...although the thought of being so awfully unperfect was intolerable. Being let on fire wasn\u2019t quite as bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018And is there a second option?\u2019 Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Invest in larger uniforms,\u2019 Chakwas smiled, \u2018because without a serious life change you\u2019ll only keep getting bigger.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her hoody, the chubby operative stormed out, big hips sashaying. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda, much like the Asari Justicar, had the same reaction to Dr. Chakwas' prescription of diet and exercise to reign in their waistlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely that the advice was largely bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Miranda had snacked a little recently, but snacked enough to gain so much weight in such a short time? That wasn't just unlikely, that was physically impossible. Even if her nanites were working improperly and not doing their job, that still wouldn't cause her to gain so much. Miranda would have to have been hooked up to a tank full of heavy protein nutritional paste to consume calories long enough to grow a gut this size, and while she may have been snacking extra lately, she certainly wasn't doing THAT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo just as Samara rejected that advice in favor of a second opinion, Miranda took the same action, pausing in surprise when she once again encountered the Asari talking to Mordin in his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lawson?\" Samara asked, tightening her grip on the front of her outfit, lest more of herself spill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samara!\" Lawson said in response, tugging her hoodie a little further down her rather wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are YOU doing here?\" they both said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, most likely hypothesis...seeking answers for sudden collection of adipose tissue on figures, after finding answer from medical doctor on staff unhelpful,\" Mordin pondered in his usual rapid tone of voice. Both girls blushed furiously at being called out on their actions in such a blunt manner, though Samara, ever the stoic, decided to press onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...do you have any suggestions, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several...though many disproven upon new knowledge gained of similar infliction upon Miss Lawson. Flawless genetic code rules out gene deficiency, diseases known to cause symptoms of bloating non-transferable to humans, environmental hazards unlikely considering Lawson did not frequent locations on Illium you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin sniffed before laying out his conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypothesis uncertain, but affliction may possibly be linked to biotic field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor did say my nanites were being affected by the element zero in my field,\" Miranda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I don't have nanites,\" Samara pointed out. \"And if it was machine based, Shepard would have figured it out a week ago. You know how she is with her...tinkering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken,\" Miranda grumbled. \"But can you fix it, Mordin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to fix when you don't know what the problem is!\" the scientist Salarian said brightly. \"Will need more research, calling in a few experts on biotics. Might be wise to limit calorie consumption as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I have been doing the last few days,\" Samara said glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have experimental nutrient paste on hand, quite filling, bland tasting, but zero calories and unhealthy substances. Tested for human and Asari consumption, should allow you to remain functional while consuming as few extra calories as permitted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls groaned, not looking forward to the coming days. But at the very least, the bland paste was better then the exercise neither of them needed. Samara could meditate while Lawson buried herself in paperwork and soon this embarrassment would be behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knock knock</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's me Shepard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" Miranda Lawson snapped, sinking down in her chair further. \"I need to talk to Samara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why can't I come in?\" Shepard pleaded through the door to Miranda's office, which hadn't been opened in the last week or so. \"If something is wrong I can help, honest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can, but Samara...well, it's a delicate matter!\" Miranda mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...fine, but I'm checking back in an hour. Making sure you're not doing anything kinky.\" Miranda swore she heard a giggle as the Commander made her leave. What the Illusive Man saw in her, she would never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, another pair of footsteps approached. Miranda could tell they were the right person this time...more weight to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miranda?\" Samara said through the door, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open and Samara sauntered in, trying to look dignified even as the towel wrapped around her middle swished against the door frame. Miranda, for her part, sat low in her chair, draped in what looked like one of her bed sheets. There was a moment of silence between the two until the door closed behind the Justicar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The paste isn't working, is it?\" Samara said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....no....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall drop the pretense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr more specifically, dropped the towel around her waist. And it became clear immediately why she needed it; she had entirely outgrown her original outfit. The red top was long gone, with her dignity preserved by a bra straining to hold larger then expected cup sizes and a pair of stretchy leggings, already splitting down the sides. Her potbelly had blossomed into a full-blown gut, bloated and drooping over her widening waste, with love-handles surrounding her widening flanks. Her toned form had long ago vanished under layers and layers of fat; even her legs had started to swell with adipose, and her arms were starting to droop with blubber that swallowed up her musculature. Even her smooth, well-defined face had grown a pair of jowls and cheeks to round it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda let out a deep sigh as she tugged off the sheet covering her form. The Cerberus operative had finally given up on her old outfit and just worked in her bra and panties, which even now strained to contain all of her new girth. Her bulging belly was racing towards her knees across her lap, and thickening thighs gave it a nice platform to lie across. Her athletic perfect form was a distant memory at this point, and as she scratched under her neck, her extra chin wobbled slightly from the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...fell asleep in the chair. Woke up, and I was....stuck.\" Miranda revealed. Indeed, as Samara turned to look, Miranda's famous rump had gone from comfortably perching in the chair to dramatically overflowing it, her flab pushing against the arms and holding her tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've both become obese at this point. At least two hundred, each,\" Miranda calculated. \"This needs to end, now before we become unable to move. I should have went to Mordin immediately when my suit no longer fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think if it's getting this serious, Shepard needs to be informed,\" Samara reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-gaah, how do you work this thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two obese ladies looked at Miranda's intercom system with mild surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grunt? What are you doing on the comms system?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calling you about a problem. Jack's not leaving her cave thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not leaving her room?\" Miranda asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the Quarian's gettin' upset with her because she can't get to the wiring in there. Think you can do somethin about it before she starts a fight? Head's still hurting from that last battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara and Miranda exchanged a look. Could it be..?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A bit of uncharacteristic indecision hit Lawson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated the psychotic biotic Jack for a lot of things. Being a back talking shit head, having her head shaved, all of those awful punk rock tattoos, being technically right about Cerberus, being unconventionally attractive in a way that Lawson couldn't help but find appealing. The thought of seeing the spiteful subject zero with chubby legs, two chins and a big flabby ass was impossibly attractive to her...in a couple ways, one she didn't want to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was a long way down to the storage area where Jack lurked. Both because the once athletic Miranda, who'd had an olympian's body along with her super model curves, was pathetically out of shape and because the now bottom heavy brunette would have to be seen out and about. She'd been proud, perhaps overly so, of her perfect figure, still flawless in her upper thirties and had flaunted it in a skin tight, cleavage bearing cat suit for a reason. That everyone would see she'd become an obese chubbette with hips in the upper forties and chafing thighs and a second chin...it would be mortifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she realized with a tingle, slightly arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...let's check on Jack,' she told Samara, 'she'll probably need some help getting used to...being like this. Just let me get some clothes on first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda tried to stand up, a basic movement any human over the age of 1 should be able to do, but her ass was still caught fully in her chair. The pear shaped cerberus operative struggled, rocking back and forth but going nowhere. She was wedged tight and her muscles were too weak to move herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A little help,' she asked Samara in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blubbery Justicar was less help than would be thought. Samara had once been one of the most muscular Asari ever seen, statuesque figure and chiseled face free of fat and full of muscle, but that was at an end. Weeks of attempting to meditate her increasing bulge away had only made the fat multiply and her muscle vanish, she was just as awkwardly heavy and out of shape as Miranda, even though she'd tended towards apple instead of pear shaped.She'd lifted nothing heavier than one of Mordin's rationbars...or tastier snacks that she'd rewarded herself with every night. And even those were far lighter than two hundred pounds of genetically perfect pudge wedged cork tight into space age polymer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat bunched up on the Asari's arms and sweat broke out on Miranda's fore head as they tried to pull the brunette human out. They went nowhere of course, both were so out of shape that they'd forgotten the old axiom of lifting with their legs and not their backs. Samara had to stop pulling and put a hand to her pained back, which had begun screaming at her as her F cup azure giants flopped in their deeply too small bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's use biotics,' Miranda panted, 'I'll pull myself up and you pull down the chair.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither woman had exercised their biotic powers beyond drawing a snack across the room for that time either. Powers strong enough to crush a tank had atrophied at the same rate as their running speed, it took both of them pushing their biotic power to the max until Miranda popped like a cork out of the chair and slammed gut first into her desk. She whined in pain, her enormous ass hanging out with a red ring from the chair's arms around her milk pale, cellulite studded, stretchmark striated derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda had gone from super fit hour glass to a pear made out of marshmallow cream. Eighty pounds of adipose translated to a nine inch gain to her hip measurements, blowing up each firm sphere into a deflated basketball that wobbled and wiggled with every small movement. Clothing it proved difficult to say the least, especially as the spy\u2019s closet was full of size four cat suits, skimpy cocktail dresses, workout gear and lingerie and she was about twelve sizes too big for any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spy was lucky that she had a large men\u2019s work shirt that a one off fling had left behind and the elation of finding something that sort of fit masked the embarassment of her stomach bouncing up and down as she walked to the closet. She was double lucky due to her cup size not going up even a hair, although her rapid accumulation of back fat and chest fat had made the DD eezo tanks fade quite a bit compared to the rest of her, so while the buttons over her gut were gaping mightily, the ones over her breasts were actually slack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering her ass was harder, she had to settle for a pair of spandex workout shorts stretched to complete transparency over her hippo hips and elephant ass. Meaty thighs mushroomed out of the sausage casing legs and the spy\u2019s graceful calves were now clumsy cankles. Her stylish heeled boots wouldn\u2019t fit up her legs, she had to settle for a pair of flip flops worn humiliatingly with socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Do you mind if I borrow this?\u2019 Samara asked, holding up the hoody, \u2018my uh...top isn\u2019t up to it.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the Justicar\u2019s blueberry Fs looked a deep breath away from popping out of her overloaded bra. And beneath them her beach ball gut sagged down to cover her sex, purple stretch marks covering her pale blue skin. She squeezed into the hoody, her unmatched belly and massive boobs stretching the black fabric out until the two terra firma twins emblazoned on it were just as wide as the two she hulks filling up Miranda\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the operative\u2019s office took more gut than raiding the collectors\u2019 base. All activity stopped as the two bloated beauties waddled out, thighs\u2019 chafing and bellies bouncing. Eyes stuck to Miranda\u2019s swaying ass, every dot of cellulite visible through her transparent shorts, and to Samara\u2019s tits which threatened to hit her in the face as audible pops and rips sounded from her breaking bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waddled through the ship\u2019s second deck, face\u2019s reddening as everyone realized what these two paragons of feminine might had been reduced to. Snorts and giggles broke out as soon as they got into the elevator, of course they\u2019d avoided the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator ride was long and uncomfortable. Its mirror polished surface showed their blimped out forms from every angle, every flabby roll and bulbous angle, everything that used to be firm that sagged, everything that used to be flat that bulged. The way that Samara\u2019s angular face had a meaty jowl to it. The way that Miranda\u2019s shorts were beginning to rip apart. How the Asari\u2019s hoody didn\u2019t quite cover her apron belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opened it was a mercy, even though the two had to traverse every fat girl\u2019s worst enemy: stairs. They got to the bottom with only a minimum of sweating and just three or four seams popping. Samara\u2019s bra was hanging by a thread and Miranda lost one of the lower buttons as her stomach violently bounced when she missed a step by the time they reached the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali and Grunt were waiting at the bottom, the Quarian waiting with arms full of tools until she saw the two blimps in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What the hell happened to you two?\u2019 the still slim alien asked, eyes widening inside her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I dunno, they look pretty good,\u2019 Grunt grunted, the blue eyed Krogan looking the two obese women up and down, \u2018all healthy and wide.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Minor medical issue, there\u2019s already a cure on the way,\u2019 Miranda tried to reassure her, \u2018it might have happened to Jack. So we\u2019re here to\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee how a hundred pounds looks on that bitchy biotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Check on her,\u2019 she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018By all means check, the crazy\u2019s put some sort of biotic seal on the door,\u2019 the Quarian finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether the two weakened biotics got the door open to find\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was darkened in the room, as per usual, so the two had to delve deeper to get a look around, bumping their engorged bellies into the walls when they got too close. Miranda led the charge inside, eagerly looking for a hint of adipose or cellulite on her bitchy biotic rival, only to find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara and Miranda turned sharply around, to the figure covered in shadows leaning against the wall. Stepping forward into the glow of the reactors, Lawson felt her heart flutter in anticipation, and with baited breath watched as Jack strode forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...looking completely normal. Granted it may have been hard to tell, since she was wearing a jacket from the infiltration mission Shepard sent her on for the last few weeks, but it was clear under the garment that she seemed to be as light as ever. Miranda experienced such a mood whiplash that it made her feel disoriented, while Samara merely looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were in trouble?\" she asked coolly. Jack didn't seem to care much about the Justicar however, refusing to take her eyes off of the Cerberus cheerleader. Slowly, gradually, a grin broke out on Jack's face, and she reached out and poked a finger into Miranda's protruding belly. Samara looked on with mild concern as she started shaking, her face contorting as though holding something back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....you're really this fat?\" Jack managed to squeak out. Miranda gave a very dire pause, reading the writing on the wall and resolving herself to what was about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wow Miranda,\" Jack said, her voice cracking. \"I didn't know y-you were...retaining butter-pffffttAHAHAHAHA<i><b>AHAHAHAHA</b></i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda turned fifty different shades of red in an instant as Jack burst into unashamed, uproarious laughter. Those on the upper decks probably could hear the wily test subject's howling, it was so loud. Samara winced as Jack doubled over, convulsed with a case of the giggles so hard that she wheezed every other second and banged her fists on the wall to calm herself down. The third-wheeling Justicar waited somewhat impatiently for the girl to calm down while Miranda looked particularly murderous at Jack's wild, rambunctious laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha, hey Miranda I hear after Lazarus your buddies are gonna work on project Jonah, and you're gonna be the whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack...\" Samara tried to intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait I got more!\" Jack insisted. \"She used to be a whole Cerberus cheerleader squad but she ate the other members!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait are you the perfect human specimen or perfect pig specimen, I can't remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to push for human superiority tubby! No other species has a waistline that size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda intervened this time, losing her cool and shoving the skinny girl in the room against the wall. Jack collapsed onto the ground, still choking out laughter and not even angry at the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the....happiest day of my life,\" Jack gasped, stumbling back to her feet. \"When I got back from that recon mission yesterday and heard the rumors...I just had to see it for myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you called us down here feigning some emergency...just to see what I look like?\" Miranda spat out, Jack's taunts of 'pig' 'whale' and 'tubby' still bouncing around in her head. She should have been angry and humiliated and she was certainly the latter, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! And I gotta say...\" Jack said, jiggling a roll of Miranda's belly only for her. \"Totally worth it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" Miranda snapped, slapping her handsy rival's hand away, but not before the feeling of being groped like that caused her to blush, just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rather irresponsible of you to rope me and Grunt into this little prank of yours,\" Samara said, a hint of a scold in her voice that even Jack seemed to quail beneath, if only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no one said anything about you!\" Jack said defensively. \"I only-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud metallic clang, and all three girls turned to look at the entrance, where Tali had smacked a tool into the metal piping to get their attention. Behind her, Grunt loomed like a bodyguard, a cross expression across his craggy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now not to be rude...\" Tali said, clearly irritable. \"But can you PLEASE continue this elsewhere? I need to fix the transition valves before the whole system cooks off and we all die in the cold vacuum of space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So would anyone care to explain why everyone thought a hyena got loose in the engine corridor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki Shepard stood at the center of the briefing room, looking over the three troublemakers, two of which struggled to fit their hips in the chairs. Miranda looked equal parts mortified and murderous, Jack had her feet up on the table and looked rather proud of herself, and Samara just looked as stoic as ever as she methodically went over what happened. Since Miranda was involved and Jacob wasn't on hand to supervise the meeting as Cerberus wanted them to, Kelly Chambers stood in awkwardly, aiming sideways glances at Samara's exposed flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is all true?\" Shepard asked of the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Miranda said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much how it started, yup,\" Jack recounted. \"So when you want a three man squad on missions, is Miranda going to count as two people now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little-\" Miranda started, trying to extract herself from the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off Jack, and Miranda, calm down!\" Shepard ordered. \"Neither of you are helping this situation. Now, have you two seen Mordin or Chakwas about this swelling of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they're uncertain as to the causes of this,\" Samara continued. \"Though Chakwas pointed out that it seems to interfere with nanites via biotic fields, at least in Miranda's case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a biotics related issue, then,\" Yuki considered. \"Until we know what's going on, I don't want to take any risks. When did this start happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few weeks ago, after you and I went on that Blue Suns hunt with Grunt,\" Miranda recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Jacob and Thane are still on assignment?\" Yuki asked Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were planning on heading past Corang to retrieve them,\" Kelly recounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send them a message and a shuttle, we're quarantining our biotics until we find out what's going on, so they're on leave,\" Yuki ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we send Grunt with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard pondered this. \"He's been here the whole time and nothing's happened to him, most likely he's resistant to whatever is causing the bloating. Plus we need him on missions if we're down at least five people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five?\" Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, them, and these three,\" Shepard said, gesturing towards the girls. The odd one out of the triplet immediately sat up, putting her feet back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe my hearing's going because I think I just heard that you were bottling me up here, Shepard,\" Jack said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are, we can't risk you leaving and infecting someone with whatever this is,\" Shepard explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit, you can't keep me here, I'm not infected!\" Jack got out of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you wearing that jacket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's angry expression was betrayed by the color draining from her face. Miranda immediately looked up from the love handle she was squeezing at her rival's sudden silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I haven't gotten the chance to take it off,\" Jack insisted. \"Why the fuck do you care anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a few days hasn't it?\" Miranda interrupted, her pompous smile starting to emerge. \"You should take that off, air out a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack flipped the bird in Miranda's direction and tried to make her escape, only to bump right into Grunt, seemingly achieving the impossible by coming in silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to make an idiot out of me?\" Grunt growled. \"With your false alarm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grunt...ehehe...what's a good joke between friends?\" Jack gave a friendly fist-bump to the krogan's shoulder, which Grunt responded to by grabbing her and and, with one swift movement, ripping the jacket off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Jack cried out, spinning around in a panic...as a prominent pot-belly swung into place, hanging over her straining waistband. There was a stunned silence that hung in the air, not unlike Jack's newly revealed paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...look who's retaining butter,\" Miranda grinned, feeling redeemed at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you!\" Jack stuttered out, impotent rage boiling behind her eyes. \"It's only a little flab, that I got...over a day or two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quarantine, all of you,\" Shepard demanded. \"We'll get this sorted out soon enough. Until then, no more pranks or trouble-making, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack glumly nodded her head, followed by Miranda doing the same, far more cheerily. As the discussion broke up and Samara reported to the medical bay with Jack and Miranda in tow, she prayed for a speedy end to this as well. The sooner this incident...and this weight...was behind her, the sooner she could return to her duties and go back to ignoring the feud between the humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as days rolled into weeks, that speedy end was nowhere in sight, but in the interim...</span></div></div>",

Finishing the taking out her frustrations on the lumpy mashed potatoes, she pushed her tray away with a nauseated expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to be able to fight the Collectors on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you need your fruits and veggies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki looked up as Garrus and Kasumi sat down across from the commander with their own meals, both of them looking rather concerned. Or at least Garrus was, the thief was always a little hard to read at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you two can eat knowing what's going on,\" Shepard grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with how much of the slack I'm picking up I sort of need the extra calories,\" Garrus joked, chuckling a bit. \"Not that I mind of course, I uh, understand that it can't be helped, but-\" There was an awkward pause before Garrus decided to turn focus to his food for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad it's not effecting me, I can't imagine I'd make a very good sumo wrestler,\" Kasumi teased. \"It has something to do with biotics, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much the only think we know at this point,\" Shepard confirmed. \"I have both doctors working overtime to figure this out and they still aren't sure what's going on. Mordin says this might be connected to some Asari cult but that's tenuous at best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think it could be Cerberus connected?\" Garrus suggested. \"Outside of biotics that's the only real connection the victims have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samara isn't affiliated with the group,\" Kasumi pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she caught it from Miranda?\" Garrus offered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a bad idea but I hit a dead end there,\" Shepard said, drumming her fingers on the table. \"Jacob doesn't have any inkling of what this could be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been talking to Jacob?\" Kasumi interrupted excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and the Illusive Man claimed he doesn't know what this is either,\" Shepard continued on unabated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you trust him on that?\" Garrus said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but I know he wouldn't have a good reason to sabotage the mission he brought me back from the dead to finish,\" Shepard pointed out. \"So we're stuck cooling our heels until Chakwas or Mordin can untangle this whole thing, and if they can't figure it out by now, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't lose hope yet,\" the Turian said kindly. \"If there's one thing C-Sec taught me, it's that you never know when and where a breakthrough might come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole table jumped in their seats at the sudden intrusion. Kasumi looked up and visibly shrank under the steely Krogan gaze of Grunt. She didn't really like being around such a big and imposing figure, but it wasn't normally an issue since he usually stayed below deck, until now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something bugging you big guy?\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Grunt grunted, looking off to the side slightly. \"I...I think I may know what is going on with the Justicar and the two angry humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara would have been the first to admit that she was sometimes challenged on her beliefs. Oftentimes the wilder, younger Samara waited in the wings to tempt her, encourage her to stray from her code, indulge in vices, to turn away from the life she chose when times were most difficult. Her faith and determination to bring her daughter to justice were enough to help her hold on, and even after hundred of years her resolve never wavered because of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the things to test her resolve, however...why did it have to be this that was the hardest to deal with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door disturbed her meditation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samara! I have your dinner for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara had given up on her attempts to fast, knowing that her food consumption wasn't to blame. She spent days without food and it hadn't slowed down her growth. If anything, it had gotten faster, and her size had started to become...an inconvenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be...huff...right there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared down at her enormous thighs and thick calves splayed out in front of her, swallowing up her bare knees. One of the many things hampering her meditations had been her legs had grown so thick and heavy that she couldn't even fold them anymore. Sighing, she rolled forward heavily, and arduously got to her feet, flinching as the rolls of fat surrounding her flopped down. Wiping her brow from the effort of standing up (ugh), she started waddling towards the door, trying to move slowly enough that her blubber didn't jostle too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuarantine had been a blessing in disguise for Samara. It was hard to be taken out of the action, sure, but she wasn't prepared for how exhausting carrying all this weight was. It had been manageable even up to the point where Jack had been discovered, but with every passing day she could feel herself getting slower and slower, her strength buckling under the weight of her....well, weight. The Justicar tried to do some minor exercises to keep up her stamina and carry the excess fat, but by the time her weight had doubled she found even that was getting harder to do. She still tried, managing to get out a pushup or at least pace vigorously once in a while, dreading what would happen if she gave up, and what she would be reduced to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by the goddess there was the hunger. It was hard to gauge since she had been deliberately fasting, but Samara wasn't prepared for the gnawing hunger from her growing body. Resuming eating helped, but again as she got bigger, it got harder to resist the temptation for more. She couldn't stop herself from eating quickly or just a little messily, and when she ran out it was an immense struggle to try and ignore her desire for more. She made a vow, and her mission wasn't finished. Samara couldn't be reduced to a blue blob guzzling down the fattiest foods possible, even as she felt the pangs of temptation and vice nipping at her heals when she finished her modest meals or struggled to move quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tragedy of it all was even as she held on, she was still getting huge. Unable to fit into anything but a sports bra and panties donated by a \"secret admirer\" (ugh...another embarrassing temptation), Samara was indisputably obese, waddling around on tree trunk thighs hiding behind a drooping multi-rolled belly in her attempts to try and remain mobile. She could feel her elephantine rear swaying back and forth, a chair crusher that raised her a few inches higher off the ground when she sat. Samara could even feel that her fingers were starting to lose some dexterity because her hands were getting so thick and padded, leading up to biceps bigger then her own head for all the wrong reasons. And her breasts...well, just another thing to sabotage her attempts to hold true to her vows. She didn't really know what lettering they were anymore, just that they were even bigger then her biceps and, when they didn't sag over her belly fat, were bouncing around in her face, much to the delight of the crew. Again, thank goodness for the quarantine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, not all the attention could be avoided, and as the door slid open, putting her full weight on glorious display, Samara found herself face to face with Kelly Chambers, \"helping\" to deliver her meal. She may be thick but she wasn't dense; the Justicar knew exactly why Chambers volunteered for this task. Her excited breathing, darting eyes, and even the way she gripped the food tray told the whole picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got your food for ya, Samara!\" Kelly said excitedly with a hint of obedience. \"Just let me know when you're ready for dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...thanks...\" Samara said, glumly staring at her meal. It seemed this was all she really had to look forward to now, really. All her vows, her mission to stop her daughter and save the galaxy from the Collectors...they were all falling apart around her, and it wasn't even her fault. Part of her still had hope this could be fixed, and that was the only thing that kept her going. But it didn't stop the gnawing hurt feeling inside of her over all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...there was one way she could try to fight that feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes Samara?\" the yeoman said, trying to hide her happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could...could you bring me a second meal please...\" the Justicar asked weakly. \"Maybe...just two from now on...\" She turned away, pretending not to notice the shuddering gasp Kelly let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a disaster.</span></div></div>",

Quickly wiping away the smattering of drool and steak drippings collected on her lips, she waddled over to the door and opened it. No doubt Kelly was still attempting to dote on her, getting another view of this loathsome belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, I don't need-\" the Justicar began, but was cut off at the sight of three people crowded into the hall, Shepard leading from the front. She looked particularly triumphant while Mordin looked rather pleased with himself, both contrasting Grunt taking up the rear who seemed to be averting his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shepard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samara, excellent news!\" Shepard announced as she barged into the room when Samara waddled aside. \"We think we know why you're blowing up like Violet Beauregard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was met with blank stares by the three aliens who never heard of Willy Wonka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, we know why you're getting bigger!\" Shepard restated, not losing her stride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara felt a surge of hope that warmed every inch of her at this news. \"You do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Grunt mumbled from the back. \"You're getting flabby 'cause of me. I'm screwin' with your biotics or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just left the blubbery Justicar confused again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how the Blue Suns had that ammunition that mucked around with biotics?\" Shepard reminded her. \"Well, Grunt got a couple hits of those things and it screwed around with his genetics a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're not a biotic, are you?\" Samara asked Grunt, who roughly shook his head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I was made to fight alongside 'em,\" Grunt said. \"Okeer programmed a lot of fail-safes into me that would keep me fighting the closer I got to death. One of which turned me into a big biotic battery that could power up biotics fighting alongside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunt shrugged. \"It's what I am. Came in handy against the Thresher Maw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that knowledge and Grunt's recent health complaints, reasonable to assume that the collection of adipose is a result of damage from the biotic negating weaponry employed by the Blue Suns,\" Mordin rattled off, stroking his chin. \"And because none of the afflicted crew members are themselves Krogran, safe to assume that this unfortunate building up of fatty tissue is unintended side effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara could hardly believe it. In all her centuries of life, it was the most absurd thing she had ever heard of. Fattened up by her biotics. She'd heard of plenty of strange interactions all matters of life had in relation to biotic and element zero, but she'd never experienced anything quite like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I just need to get away from Grunt and I will recover?\" Samara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Grunt said bluntly. \"The effects of my biotic battery were made to stick around, in case I fell behind or had to split with a team. The effects will keep happening indefinitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't meant permanently!\" Shepard reassured the Justicar when her eyes widened in shock. \"Chakwas and Mordin are already working on a fix for this, and now that we know Grunt is the culprit we can quarantine him so the effects don't spread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunt didn't look particularly happy about this, but he begrudgingly nodded along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hopefully it means we can reach the end of this debacle,\" Samara concluded, patting her taut stomach. \"I was worried I would lose my ability to walk before you figured out what was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No certain timeframe on cure,\" Mordin pointed out thoughtfully. \"Entirely within the realm of possibility that affected subjects would be rendered immobile by the time of cure deployment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara turned slightly paler at that explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in case though, we do want to set you, Miranda, and Jack somewhere comfortable until this gets fixed,\" Shepard said hurriedly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lajhan was one of the first worlds the Hanar ever colonized, yet for most of its history it remained largely undeveloped. A rich cache of Enkindler holy relics necessitated the moon's colonization; however, its habitability for the aquatic race was sub-prime. Though the surface was ninety percent water like their home world, regions where the water was deep enough for proper comfortable habitation were sparse. Even with its religious significance, obstructing features like coral atolls, barrier reefs, mangrove forests, and archipelagos of volcanic islands with vast continental shelves, all teaming with exotic aquatic life, cramped the already small world and made it undesirable. The planet even had an almost entirely cyclical orbit, which combined with a balanced axial tilt evenly heated the globe, creating a constant tropical climate and no polar ice caps to melt to deepen the water. As time went on the cost of maintaining permanent settlements for research and worship grew, becoming a noticeable drain on resource. It was a real possibility the colony would have needed to be abandoned, left only to the truly devout and the Hanar too poor to relocate some place nicer, if the other species of the galaxy hadn\u2019t begun to take note of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsari, Salarians, and later Humans found the environment to surprisingly agreeable, with phrases like \u201ctropical paradise\u201d, \u201cidyllic islands\u201d and later \u201cthe bomb\u201d being thrown around to describe it, much to the confusion of the Hanar. Even the Drell found the bleak world more agreeable to their physiology than lush Khaje. Seeing an opportunity to offload some strain the colony put on them, the Illuminated Primacy entered talks with each of the interested parties to negotiate partial terrestrial settlement. To one degree or another, they all agreed to pay a price to build \u2018luxury resorts\u2019 on sections of the barren lands and shallow, inhospitable waters, on the condition that they did not breach any holy sites in the oceanic trenches. In every case, all parties involved walked (or in the case of the Hanar, floated) away thinking they had scammed the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow no longer the problem child of Hanar colonies, Lejhan has since became the most popular resort world with three of the four Council species. Even the lower-end resorts require reservations eight months in advance, and only the most affluent and influential of individuals being able to get into the most luxurious of them. Yet somehow Shepard, a woman the majority of the galaxy thought was dead, was able to get her three squad mates an entire island all to themselves. It was perfect for their just-in-case quarantine, with no other people their\u2026 condition\u2026 could spread to for miles in any direction, without depriving them of any modern comforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still not entirely clear on how you acquired the funds to provide us such lavish accommodations\u2026\u201d Samara questioned Yuki as the pair entered what was to be her room for the length of their stay. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t appreciate it, she only feared they money to pay for their stay in the lonely beachfront mansion was coming from a source that would conflict with the Code. If it did, well\u2026 Samara really hoped it didn\u2019t, for Shepard\u2019s sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard grunted as she set down the Justicar\u2019s bags at the foot of her bed; they were shockingly heavy considering her austere lifestyle. The bed was an extra wide one, roomy even compared the Spectre\u2019s own back on the Normandy, likely big enough for two Krogan to share without needing to spoon. Even so, Samara would take up more than half of it by herself, and at her current rate of growth she may very well fill two thirds of it in a matter of months. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m really good at Quasar.\u201d Yuki joked, and Samara shot her a dirty look. Probably because of the implication that she had a gambling addiction, or more likely used her tech skills to hack the game machines. Either way, she quickly let made the truth clear. \u201cCerberus always brags about their virtually unlimited resources, so I figured they wouldn\u2019t mind me tapping into it to fund your recovery time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt Cerberus would be happy if they knew their resources were going towards this.\u201d Samara sat her red-clad blue behind down on the bed wincing as she felt the metal frame bend under her weight. She had yet to meet a scale that could withstand her crushing weight, but if she had to venture a guess, she\u2019d place herself unnervingly close to half ton. It was only though focusing her biotics that she could still get around under her own power in any sense. That\u2019s why she required Yuki to carry her bags for her, not because she was lazy. Definitely not that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki flung open the blinds of the floor-to-ceiling window, and placed her hands on her trim hips as she drank in the beauty of the sparkling clear blue water washing over the pristine white sand. \u201cAn island paradise, no chance of this spreading, and I piss of some xenophobic terrorists? Sounds like a perfect plan to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud crash from down the hall, followed by yelling, and Shepard sighed. Almost perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you hip-check me one more time I\u2019ll shove my boot so far up you monster ass you\u2019ll taste leather!\u201d Jack roared with fury, pudgy fists clenched as a blue aura of pure biotic rage swelled around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda scoffed, her butterball cheeks dimpling as she smirked smugly. \u201cAs though you could even raise your tree-trunk legs high enough to kick my shin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was once far behind the other two biotic babes, she was quickly catching up, and she didn\u2019t like that fact being pointed out. \u201cYou bloated, saggy slut! I\u2019m gonna\u2014!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><i>ENOUGH!</i></b>\u201d Both Miranda and Jack froze in place just as they were in motion to slug it out. Slowly, they turned their cherubic heads to face the intimidating presence of their Commander standing at the end of the hall. \u201cI am so sick of having to pry you two apart every two minutes! It\u2019s obvious I can\u2019t just leave you two here unsupervised!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the situation that brought them there, both of the agitated women were actually looking forward to the stay at luxury resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait! We can get along!\u201d Jack insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki crossed her arms and shook her head like a disappointed parent, with Jack and Miranda feeling all the shame a misbehaving child would. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve already made up my mind and got you a babysitter\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Samara was somewhat startled by how self-confident the Quarian appeared to be at this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her?\" Jack said indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you need her on the ship!\" Miranda insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as much as I need you two not trying to kill one another,\" Yuki Shepard pointed out. \"With her containment suit she's the least likely to catch whatever is blowing you girls up like balloons, and she'll be able to monitor your vitals and coordinate with Mordin and Chakwas back on the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was thinking we'd get started right away!\" Tali piped in, pulling up her omni-tool as Chiktikka flew in from around the corner, carefully observing the rolls of fat cascading down Jack and Miranda's respective torsos. \"Now, let's get some dimensions recorded and we'll go from there. Into the rooms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Jack demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to get undressed in the hallway?\" Tali pointed out. \"March!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki smiled as the two hippo-sized humans glumly returned to their respective rooms on opposite sides of the halls, Jack making one last show of defiance by slamming the door shut in the drone's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can't reach my belt buckle!\" Miranda called out from behind her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you surprised?

Wasn't too hard, considering Jack kept hiding her tools and being a pain in the ass and she hates Cerberus as much as I do, so I let Tali go a little hardball on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they won't fight each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki tapped the side of her nose with a knowing wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Samara concluded. Sighing, she stared down at her massive blue belly, folding over her sunken kneecaps and grumbling a demand for sustenance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something bothering you?\" Shepard pried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is.\" Samara put her hands under her thick double chin, wobbling it back and forth. \"This..excessive girth.\" Her hands flowed downward as she took one of her massively flabby breasts in one meaty hand, hefting it slightly. \"It's unbecoming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not your fault,\" Yuki insisted, placing a hand on her shoulder. \"It's a freak biotic accident, you didn't do anything wrong to end up like this.\" Samara sighed, waddling back to her bed and plopping her giant rear on the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My knees ache from standing. Everything seems to move slower. I worry that my next step will crack the floors, or my next seat will fall apart underneath me,\" Samara recounted sadly. \"I am a burden to your mission, and I fear this will not be reversed...\" Yuki crouched in front of her, looking into her eyes with as much sincerity as she could muster until Samara could finally meet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word, we'll do everything we can to get you back in fighting shape,\" Shepard declared, taking Samara's padded palm in both her hands and patting it on the back. \"Just relax and enjoy your time here, okay? Consider it a vacation. God knows we all need one at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara, feeling somewhat soothed by Shepard's kindness, nodded her head. Yuki was truly one of the most fascinating humans she'd ever met, if only for her ability to weave words and say the right thing at the right time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she did need a break...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me a hippo one more time...!\" came a familiar voice from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will get this data if I have to tip you over and leave you there, Jack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, she defintiely needed a break.</span></div></div>",

Yuki would fix this, after all. She trusted her enough to know that. So that's what Samara did; no more meditations on her devotions and duties, no more adhering to the code. She wasn't about to nose-dive into hedonism, like SOME were, but she allowed herself just a moment's respite from her old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a moment's respite from centuries past...how could you ever put that into words?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate well, she slept in, she allowed idleness, she even played some games Tali had showed her with cards, a fascinating game of chance and trickery. Her favorite thing to do was to just go out onto the shore and take in the scenery. It was, after all, a beautiful planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara sighed as she stepped into the wet sand, her tubby toes sinking several inches in. Closing her eyes, she felt the tide flow against her fat calves draping over her ankles, the water tickling the bottom roll of her belly as it dipped into the sea. The feeling was unnerving the first time, but she quickly got used to it touching the ground. Undeterred, she strode delicately along the coast, her knees occasionally twinging under her massive weight, but not as much as they used to. Perhaps she was growing used to her weight as well as...well, growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would explain how after shredding the last one piece she finally graduated to a bikini, red and gold, tied together at her hips and between her breasts with string. They left little to the imagination, riding up her massively double-wide rear end something fierce and openly displaying how her saggy breasts had swelled larger then her own head, but it was comfortable, which is all that mattered to Samara now. That and her toes sinking into the warm sand, and the gentle cresting of the waves, the distant songbirds on the air, the good meal happily digesting in her stomach, the thought of a nice afternoon nap underneath a beautiful sunny sky. She let out a yawn, barely reaching her mouth with a chubby hand, feeling...content? Maybe even happy? How odd that felt after so many years beholden to the Code. Perhaps when all this was behind her, and when her oaths were fulfilled, she would come back here again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd be nice to walk along the shore without tiring so quickly, for starters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting and sweating, the blob of a Justicar waddled back towards the beach, stepping from sand to wooden planks that creaked ominously underfoot. Tali, engineering wunderkind that she was, had spent her spare time between bossing around the two humans tweaking the structure of the resort to better support the growing bodies of its inhabitants, a gesture that Samara greatly appreciated. The less she had to worry about how damaging her extreme size was, the better. Making the arduous climb up the deck stairs (both of them) leading up to the house, Samara braced herself against the railing to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey, Sammy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara turned to see Jack, sunglasses perched on top of her chipmunk cheeks,  raising a glass of some fruity cocktail in her direction as she occupied half of a Jacuzzi meant for at least ten people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she said warmly. \"Where's Miranda, I thought she was with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out for a swim, probably communing with the whales,\" Jack snarked, her laugh sending her whole flabby body bouncing. It was astonishing that she still teased Miranda about that subject considering she was also a massive whale by this point, though not as much as that joking barb being the nastiest thing Jack said to her once-hated rival all month. \"Want to jump in? The water's nice and warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I'd be honored.\" Lumbering over, Samara slipped her feet into the Jacuzzi before plopping in, settling in and splashing quite a bit of water over the edge. It was a cramped fit; Samara could barely move without brushing against Jack's soft flanks or blubbery tummy, but the water was very nice, and frankly the soft blubbery flesh of her companion was a close second. An old urge flared up as Jack leaned over to get another cocktail from an automatic dispenser, her arm fat hanging down and draping over Samara's arm, but she resisted. She wasn't ready to take her relaxing of the Code THAT far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I can't get enough of these fucking things,\" Jack said, taking a sip of her drink, which appeared to be an orange beverage with a slice of an exotic fruit on the rim. \"I always thought these things were too girly, but I kind of love them now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, let me try.\" Samara reached for the dispenser and got her own cocktail, taking a generous sip. It was quite tangy, with a heavy buzz of a strong liquor to chase it down. Jack was stunned by this sudden bout of alcoholism, lifting up her sunglasses to make sure she wasn't seeing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't know Justicars could drink,\" Jack said, impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've relaxed my code somewhat, until our affliction can be resolved,\" Samara explained, taking another sip. \"Mmph, I can feel it working now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long has it been since you had one?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six hundred and seventy two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pulled a face. \"Eugh, I don't know how I'd make it two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just takes some discipline,\" Samara said coolly, finishing off her beverage and going for another one. Another old urge, when Jack laughed, seeing the mass of neck fat underneath her three chins jostle. She could definitely feel the booze getting to her now, clouding her judgement somewhat, and now that she thought about it, there was something about this biotic mess of a woman covered in tattoos and about a thousand pounds of luscious fat that was...intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts banished before they could formulate when the door to the resort opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see we're enjoying our vacation,\" came a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, Yuki,\" Jack waved lazily, tossing her head back to bask in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, you're back!\" Samara said, attempting to turn but being blocked somewhat by Jack's impressive girth clashing with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, and I have something to share with you two,\" Shepard said as she stepped into view, looking rather...</span></div></div>",

I imagine it was not easy to arrange that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAren\u2019t you Justicars forbidden from thinking about sex?\u201d he posed in jest. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be thinking about me and Jack and Miranda screwing around, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted her head to her shoulder. \u201cThe Code cannot possibly moderate our thoughts, Shepard. Even Justicars are still people, as curious as anyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurious, Samara?\u201d he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in that way,\u201d she hastily added while patting her stuffed gut. It was amusing to see her on the backfoot for once. \u201cIt is just not something I have personally experienced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With men? Certainly. But your species made contact with the rest of the galaxy only a few decades ago,\" she said, \"I took my vow nearly 600 years before that. A few decades may be a long time to you, but it is a very short time to my people. I have barely known humanity, much less ever taken a human into my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the ones you\u2019ve known since we showed up are, what, scared of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost,\u201d she replied.. \u201cNot all.\u201d She flashed him an impish grin, and he was actually taken aback by the sight of it. \u201c I recall a certain human who proposed I break my vows in a more enjoyable fashion. Do you remember that, Commander?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVividly,\u201d he said slowly. How had that worked out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cVividly?\u201d Samara repeated, smiling slyly. \u201cI believe it is now you who must keep your thoughts in check, Shepard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a person too, as curious as anyone else\u2026..,\u201d he quipped, firing her own words back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swiveled away and looked out into the night, giving him a nice view of her fat ass as she did and a nice side view of her pregnant looking beer gut.<b> \"It wasent there a week ago Thought Shepard\"</b>. It had to be deliberate. She didn\u2019t have to turn the way she did, or swivel her hips like that, or fold her hands across her DD chest to squash her breasts closer. Her voice didn\u2019t have to sound that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet she was doing all of those things. Just look at that gut pooking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurious, Commander? About me?\u201d She Saw this and stroked her hands up and down her beer belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t care if she got chubby lately. He couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurious about what a night in my bed would feel like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery word out of her mouth was setting him on edge, and he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d gotten up until he was right behind her. They played tricks on your mind, the asari, even the ones that called themselves holy----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must confess to some curiosity of my own, Commander.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then his hands were on her, grasping her by the hips and the tiny love handels as he breathlessly took in every inch of her newly expanded form---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would a human man do to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her close and pressed his mouth against her neck, uncaring of the consequences. A small, subtle gasp escaped her lips, but she made no other gesture of resistance; not when his hot breath grazed her ear, not when his arms wrapped around her now fatter torso, not until his hungry hand shot up to grope one of her breasts that looked liked they were about to break free from his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard,\" she murmured, with just a hint of reproach, but he could have sworn he felt her nestle closer to him. She made no attempt to push his hand away, and he kept squeezing her breast. The loaded silence was punctuated only by her heavy breathing and the sound of seams straning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samara,\" he replied, a low whisper in her ear, \"give me a chance and you won't walk straight for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara giggled --- actually giggled --- and the sound of it put him at ease. Not many men could brag of fondling a Justicar and getting away with it, and he had one giddy as a schoolgirl in his arms. He was hard again (who wouldn't be?) and pressed as close to him as she was, she had to be able to feel it straining against his pants, resting against her rear. Yet there was no more reproach in her voice, and she seemed to be enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara smiled for a second. But even the biggest hard-on in the world wasn\u2019t worth getting killed. Not when he was so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our vows tell us that when we swear our lives to the Code, we are reborn in the eyes of the Goddess. Mind and body are made anew, and we become as virgins, and that is how we must remain. Even one such as I, who has borne children. To the Goddess, I am a virgin now, and I must be a virgin until the day I die. Those pursuits of the flesh that would take my virginity away, I am oathbound to forsake.\" She paused for a second, tilting her head gently to the side, curious to what his reaction would be. \"But.....only those pursuits.\" Said Samara. While she spoked Some seams were torn apart even further so more of the justicars blue skin became in sight for Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, now she was definitely doing it on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact her breasts had swollen too much she\u2019d had  found her suit to be painful to wear when getting dressed this morning. Her ass now strained against her body suit. Despite her justicar training to resist temptation and live a frugal and plain life Samara had become the most gluttonous of the Female crew of Normandy, but not more than Liara and Jack whos gott a chub on her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was the first to the mess hall each morning, the quickest eater, and the last to finish dinner, and her gluttony therefore showed the most. She had chubbier cheeks, the start of a second chin, her boobs pressed out against her red suit almost making it unfit to wear in public, and her ass had grown out quite a bit too. But it was her belly that took the cake. Despite her otherwise mildly pregnant appearance Samara was really starting to develop the gut of a fat woman, so much so it was amazing she\u2019d fit into her justicar uniform, it pushed out a basketball sized lump through the red bodysuit. It pushed out against it, pulling her already impressive v-neck cleavage even further down. Her belly would actually have rested on her lap had she not been wearing the tight suit, and it amazed EDI every time she came to the mess hall just how elastic it must be to fit such a plump and often stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to cut out herself from her tight suit before Samara was ready to make love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck me,\u201d she gasped, once she had fully processed the feeling of the massage of her fat gut. \u201cFuck me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe complied with her request and hammered away, slamming in and out of her pussy like a jackhammer.<br>\r\n The little ring around her pussy was purpule and sore, but the look on Samara\u2019s face suggested she barely even felt that. Her fingers dug deep into Shepards skin as her chubby body convulsed with rampant pleasure. She was really involved in her  fucking; able to match Shepards\u2019s powerful pace, she was also content to be his plaything, lying back and exulting in the pleasures of being ravaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled on top that her fat gut almost squezed out the air from shepard, Samaras ball of new fat was big and heavy but very hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShep-Shepard----\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened his mouth to answer her blurted call, the reason for it became clear. Her pussy tightened around his cock as she came violently, shaking on the bed, and the tightness squeezing down on his length became too much to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Surrendering to the feeling, he came as well, firing a hot jet down Samara\u2019s pussy, flooding her belly with warm, sticky seed so much that it leaked into her blood stream and left it to her belly for digesting. Her belly became bloated and fatter because of this. His hips jerked into her for long seconds as he emptied himself, and when he was done the fluids that he had filled her tight passage with his penis remained in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He\u00b4s penis were still so erect so it was still stuck inside her, and a few drops of his semen dribbled out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara collapsed onto her fat stomach on top of Shepard and His extremly slowly waning erection rased away from her pussy as seed slowly dripped out of her sore rectum. And the only sounds in the room were the mismatched, asynchronous notes of two people struggling to catch their breath.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was somewhat softer these days, even for non-combat personnel. Even when she sucked it in as much as she could, her tummy still poked out a tiny bit.

It was even more surprising considering how much snacking they did during their movie dates\u2026or was that just her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha briefly contemplated visiting the gym later that day like Jane would sometimes do, but was distracted by Shepard stretching, flexing her strong muscles. <i>Holy shit she\u2019s hot\u2026</i> Samantha thought, biting down on her bottom lip as she stared at Jane\u2019s six pack. It wasn\u2019t a new realization by any means, but the raw sex appeal the redhead possessed still caught her off guard on a regular basis. <i>How did I ever get some as amazing as her?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over so that she was on her side and facing Sam, Jane smiles sweetly, and places a hand on her girlfriend\u2019s belly. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d She begins a bit nervously, her smile fading. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dating for a while now, but I\u2019m not sure if\u2026I mean think you\u2019re really great and all, I just\u2026shit I\u2019m bad at this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread flooded Samantha\u2019s body as she feared the worst. \u201cA-are\u2026are you breaking up with me?\u201d She felt like her heart was about to break into a hundred pieces. With dating, Samantha knew you are either going to be together forever or break up. While she wasn\u2019t ready for marriage or anything even half as big as that, not a single part of her wanted to ever break up with Jane. <i>Is this because I put on weight?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Jane\u2019s eyes widened in surprise showed that she didn\u2019t, either. \u201cWhat? No! I would never\u2014I\u2019m not breaking up with you, Sam!\u201d Jane stops to take a deep breath to calm herself. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you that I\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

The poor Commander had her heart broken in more ways than one, beginning when she had to sacrifice her first love Kaidan Alenko on Virmire. In the aftermath of his death, Jane found comfort in the arms of the Prothean expert Liara T\u2019soni. The two grew closer as time went on, with their friendship eventually blossoming into a relationship that ended when Shepard was killed by Collectors. While Shepard\u2019s final thoughts were of Liara, the young Asari moved on, and when Shepard returned, the new information broker was cold and distant. During the suicide mission against the Collector\u2019s she fell in love again, this time with Jacob Taylor, who started a relationship with another woman in the short few months they were apart after the mission\u2019s success. Now, Shepard was offering up her battered heart once again, still believing that one day it will be treated the way it deserves, and Samantha would be damned if she would be the one to ruin that hope for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand on Jane\u2019s face the comms specialist cupped her lover\u2019s freckled cheek and looked into her green eyes. It was an honor to be the object of the great Commander Shepard\u2019s affection; an honor she was all too happy to accept,  \u201cIt means so much to hear those words from you, Jane. I love you, too, and I promise to act like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way her words caused Jane\u2019s expression light up made Samantha\u2019s heart swell. The goofy, elated smile that spread across the redhead\u2019s face was soon replaced by a bashful one, accompanied by a faint blush; it was so cute when she was embarrassed. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for me, Sam. I would have been happy with a simple thank you, but you\u2019re just too sweet for that, aren\u2019t you? Well, I can be sweet, too.\u201d Jane punctuated her statement by wrapping her muscular arms around her lover softened waist to bring her closer, then placed a tender kiss upon Traynor\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha happily returned the kiss, nestling her plush body into that of her hard lover. The kiss lasted nearly two minutes before their lips parted; it was not from a lack of desire to continue that they pulled away, but from a need to fill their lungs with air. Still, they held their damp bodies close together, staring deep into each other\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane intertwined her finger\u2019s with Samantha\u2019s own. \u201cSo, now that I\u2019m done embarrassing myself over what normal people have no problem with, how about we\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

The realization came too late to stop herself, as she chewed the the last few crisps. Angry with herself, Samantha balled up the bag and tossed it into a waste receptacle before hoisting herself up out of her bunk. If she was going to be caught up in her own self-loathing, Samantha figured she may as well be doing it at the gym.

She was certain there was some error in the suit itself, perhaps a false puncture warning causing it to clamp down in areas it believed were exposed to bacteria, or perhaps air filtration was locking up, creating a vacuum in certain parts of her suit. There was no way that it was something to do with her fitting in the suit. How would that even happen? She'd only been able to have snacks that she triple-filtered, and only Dextro-amino snacks.

Quarians were finally able to leave their suits safely for extended periods of time. New agricultural settlements were established on Rannoch itself, with several crops already fit for harvesting. Many of the buildings and ships were re-purposed for living quarters, storage facilities, and other essential establishments. With the two races working in unison, tensions eased a fair bit. It became more apparent to each race that the Geth truly did not wish to continue conflicts with the Quarians, and (most of) the Quarians were willing to let the Geth operate without fear of sudden termination. Things were looking up for the two peoples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After 6 months, it was apparent that where there was once fruits of labor to show for progress, there was now entire orchards to display. While the number of resources and facilities for the Quarians had expanded almost exponentially, there was not enough of a population growth to consume it all. As a result, there was much in the way of excess food and materials for the Quarians. Relationships between the two \"races\" had improved to a point where one could easily call it \"friendship\". Small settlements were now almost-self-sufficient large colonies. Most Quarians were able to live outside of their suits safely, with only the weakest, most frail, or the very young needing to stay in their suits. Many Quarians became tailors, to craft new, more breathable clothing (some in the latest Galactic styles, albeit in Quarian sizes) for those who never wanted to stay in those suits again. Which was a relief for some, as some of the new Quarian \"re-settlers\" were finding their environmental suits a fair bit too snug. With the excess of food and resources now available to the race who lived on strict portion controls for the past several centuries, some of the Quarians were starting to put on a little weight. Some had their suits simply re-fitted for them, as they felt more comfortable in them after wearing them for so long, whereas others had the tailors make larger clothing for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Admiral Daro'Xen vas Moreh was aware of the changes around her, and as the leader of one of the larger settlements on Rannoch, needed to act on these changes. Xen was always a supporter of taking back Rannoch, as she firmly believed in keeping the Geth safe so as to return them to their proper place: serving their Quarian masters, mostly so she could experiment on the Geth and learn more about their AI hive mind. As both races were working more cooperatively, there would be no way to establish a Master/Servant society without causing another conflict. Xen figured that if the geth had a reason to believe that the Quarians depended on them, that the Geth would do everything in their power to help out. She needed to make the quarian race appear helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was apparent that as long as there was a massive growth in food production (as Admiral Shala'Raan vas Tonbay was in charge of what was currently the most productive and promising farmland, taking up a fair portion of the southern Continent), there was going to be excess, and as long as there was a robotic work force that was able to handle most of the labor, there was going to be a fair portion of the population that lived without a great deal of physical activity. This would undoubtedly result in a lazier and more gluttonous society. Or, to put it even more simply: the people were going to get fatter. Eventually, they were going to need assistance getting from place to place as their body fat would encumber them too much. Xen knew that if she could convince the Geth that these tubs of blubber needed help from the one race that could give them support, the Geth would be inclined to help, possibly allowing her to modify certain units. If she told the geth that she would allow the production of more geth units to help her people, they might \"appreciate\" that (as much as an AI could, at least). She had already started blueprints on geth-tech-based mobile platforms for the hopelessly immobile, as well as mobility-assisting powersuits that clung to its flabby host... the possibilities were endless..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Choice 1 will take place 2 months after this, with half the population in varying states of obesity, the rest being somewhat overweight or otherwise as slim as they always were.

The physical unit was a geth \"grunt soldier\" who was repainted green and repurposed to be connected to the \"administrative functions\" of the geth collective.

It was readily apparent that the Quarians below had changed quite a bit. There were a great variety of shapes and sizes on the once-nomadic populace, with only one aspect in common amongst all of them: they were overweight. A group of women were casually strolling and chatting about what they had read on their extranet feeds, with their chunky buttocks bouncing along with their steps. One slightly chubby male, donning a green business suit, was checking the settings on his omni-tool, occasionally scratching his slightly-rounded midriff. One female was absolutely enormous, a gelatinous pear-shaped woman clad in a straining pink bodysuit that had obviously been remade and refitted several times prior, whose hips were almost as wide as two pre-settlement quarians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm referring to the fact that our people are gaining weight at a rapid pace,\" stated Xen.

She was sure it wasn't that much, but.. \"We should wait until we start development on the implant, at least until the entire population has a relatively uniform amount of stability in their chemical makeup.

However, she is quite obese, and it's very likely she'll get fatter.\" It seemed extremely likely, as Rilo was sucking down several nutrient paste sacks in rapid fire succession, one after the other. \"She's already having difficulty walking.\" This was also true, as Rilo was waddling at a slower pace than almost everyone around her. \"She's going to need help getting to work if she gets any bigger, because society needs her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then you need the geth to build mobile support platforms for those in the populace who are too large to walk on their own?\" asked the Admin. \"Yes,\" replied Xen, grinning on the inside, surprised that the Geth was catching on so quickly. \"We should produce a modified version of the bodysuit that has a reinforced 'skeleton' with braces to attach to the limbs and assist the wearer's mobility.\" Xen's love of technological tinkering was showing, as she was getting more and more excited. \"Or just chairs that the far larger users could sit in, probably could also attach to their bodysuits to deal with the excretionary issues, most likely these chairs will need limbs to actually move as having them hover constantly would require too much fuel. We would probably need to utilize geth framework as a base for the different models of walkers, as security bots are far too frail--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"--One Moment, How large of a load are you expecting these geth units to carry?\" asked the Admin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Xen looked down at Rilo again, who had now stopped waddling to take another breather. One bingo-winged arm was propped up against a wall while the other lay slack at her side, her pudgy fist still clenching a nutrient-paste tube. Rilo wasn't just obese, she was obviously out-of-shape as well, with her daily commute not even coming close to being enough exercise to burn those calories (as it was her ONLY sources of exercise, being a desk-bound Administrator). The commute was slowly becoming more strenuous for her as she slowly grew bigger almost every day. It was obvious that the pink glutton was only going to get fatter, and was going to need some help (and some new clothes) in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Xen glanced back at the Admin Geth and answered very matter-of-factly: \"We need carriers to carry as large a load as necessary. As large and as heavy as we might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Option one details the start of production of the mobile carriers (which may include mobile chairs, literal platforms, etc.) and the modified bodysuits, with Xen Overseeing production and getting access to the Geth Framework to actually help make the platforms.

There were 50 more orders for the omni-suits  today than there were yesterday, and the entire facility was already being pushed to its limits to fill what orders they already had. \"Unbelievable!\" Adri exclaimed, \"We can't keep this up or else we're going to be back-logged again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ari was the Overseer for the Settlement's tailoring facility, and thanks to Daro'Xen's machinations and overabundance of natural resources, was always swamped with work. With the entire populace growing fatter an exponential rate, orders for new clothes would come flooding in. Normally, this would not be too much of a problem, as the very steady income allowed the tailoring facility to also expand to meet demand, but at this point, the Quarians were outgrowing their clothes at a much faster rate! This of course exasperated Ari to no end. \"Why can't we get those dietary implants developed yet? I need to see Admiral Xen, this is too much!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ari herself was not terribly overweight, as her job required her to constantly traverse her facility at all times to make sure the orders were being met. Clad in a pale green bodysuit, she had a moderate fluffy coating on her once-spindly body, just a noticeable layer of fat but nothing drastic. Her workers on the other hand were a fair bit chubbier, as they were usually stationary at their workstations, fusing the mechanical portions of the suits at their work tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ari grumbled and sent the updated order list to her workers via her omni-tool. She then sent another notification via the workplace comms channel stating that she was going to be out for a bit, but that they should all work on their orders as normal. She strode off towards the facility's exit, glancing at the workers around her. She never really took much time to stop and observe everything around her without a sense of urgency, so she never noticed certain things, like plush bellies pressed up against the work tables, broadened hips squeezing out of the confines of the much-suffering chairs, arm-fat pooling on the tables or the trash bins that were often overflowing with empty paste packets and tubes of varying flavors and sizes. She just shook her head, disappointed that the ones who were under such a heavy workload couldn't see that they were exacerbating the problem.<br>\r\n\tAri left the tailoring facility, managing a brisk stride as she made her way towards the Administrative building. The Settlement (now known as Lakti) was bustling with more busy Quarians (mostly those working as couriers for supplies distribution amongst the different buildings) of vastly varied shapes and sizes. Very few had remained as thin as they were when they arrived on Rannoch, but a few had gone unbelievably overboard when it came to satiating their hunger. These Quarians would have had a significant amount of difficulty with just walking, had it not been for the \"assistive technology\" (courtesy of Geth technology) that helped carry their tremendous bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ari recognized one of the massive Quarians as Lesi'Nedal vas Iktor, an acquaintance of hers from the same ship. Lesi worked as a supply manager for incoming ships, a very important, yet still sedentary, job. She used to be known as one of the best Dancers on her ship while they were all part of the Migrant Fleet, but it was very obvious that she hadn't danced in a while, nor would she be able to. Propped up on a 3 ft wide seat was an enormously obese Quarian in a mustard-yellow body-suit, her ass and hip fat spreading over the seat, dangerously close to the edges. The back of her suit was visibly attached to the chair, which walked with 4 legs resembling smaller versions of a Geth Colossi's legs. With a massive belly that sagged a little bit past her knees while she was sitting, it was obvious as to why Lesi couldn't really walk anymore. Lesi craned her fat-swaddled neck towards Ari, and upon recognizing her, started waving her arm, swinging her head-sized bingo wing back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fiddling with her omni-tool, Lesi turned her chair towards Ari and the machine started walking towards the stressed Tailor. \"Ari! It's good to see you! Are you busy?\" Ari stopped for a moment, responding \"Yes, actually. I need to speak with our wise Admiral\" before resuming her brisk pace. Lesi pressed a few buttons on her omni-tool again and the chair started walking alongside Ari, matching her pace, as the increased speed caused the yellow blob to bounce and wobble in her seat. \"You too? I need to see Xen about the increased amount of nutrient shipments we've been receiving, since we're currently doing well with our own food supply as is, and it just seems like a waste of money to have them come in the first place!\" Ari looked around at the other Quarians, saddlebags jiggling, tummies bouncing as they waddled about (for the ones who could walk, that is), some guzzling nutrient paste, and one particularly enormous Female Quarian cursing loudly as one of the legs on her moblility chair had completely collapsed, causing the pink-clad mound of fat to fall over on the ground, immobilised by her blubber. \"Maybe she's predicting demand, after all\" Ari motioned towards the immobilised screaming pink whale on the ground \"nobody's really getting any thinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Option one has them both reaching the office of Daro'Xen,and when they see her, she is the same weight.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Option two has them both reaching the office of Daro'Xen,and when they see her, she has gained a bit of weight.)</span></div></div>",

Her mind was hazy, and she could not recall much; the last thing she could remember was seducing a rather enticing redhead woman, before being interrupted by\u2014\u201cMother!\u201d She grimaced; of course she would have had to come along just as she was about to consume her most appetizing prey in centuries. After attempting to get on to her feet, she found her arms chained to the walls, preventing her from getting up from her seated position on the floor, and she was too drained for her biotics to be of any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to do anything else, Morinth tried to remember any other details that could provide clues as to how she survived her conflict with Samara, and where she was now. She had called out to Shepard for help before she blacked out, perhaps she intervened before Samara could deliver the finishing blow. The clicking of heels approaching where she was being held let her know that she may soon find out exactly what had happened, and she was right. The lights came on, and Samara strutted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you wanted me dead, but I never imagined you\u2019d be cruel enough to torture me before killing me. Are Justiciars permitted to torture, or are you going to stray from your precious code just for me?\u201d Morinth said with disgust, as though she hadn\u2019t done the same to her own enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara looked down and shook her head. She would not allow herself to be rattled by Morinth\u2019s taunting. \u201cI never wanted you dead, Morinth. I only wanted you to stop killing, and thought ending your life would be the only way to spare others, and would have had Shepard not stopped me. At first I was furious, but she convinced me of another way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorinth scoffed. \u201cNo prison or monastery can hold me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have no intention of sending you to either.\u201d Samara began to pace back and forth through the room, as though she still wasn\u2019t sure if her and Shepard\u2019s plan would work. \u201cI am pledged to Shepard to complete a mission of great importance. One that may very well decide the fate of the entire galaxy, and we need as much help as we can possibly get, and you are without a doubt an extremely powerful biotic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twisted smirk formed on Morinth\u2019s face. \u201cOh, I get it. I help you with your big important mission, and so long as I behave myself, I get to live and go free? Justiciar\u2019s promise?\u201d Samara gave her a solemn nod as an answer. This was certainly one of the best deals that Morinth had made for freedom, but they certainly weren\u2019t just going to let a murderous Ardat Yakshi go free\u2026 \u201cSo, what\u2019s the catch?\u201d Morinth asks, slanting her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Samara\u2019s turn to smile; this was her favorite part of the plan. It was a small smirk that grew on Samara\u2019s face, which made it all the more unnerving for Morinth. \u201cThroughout your time with us you will fattened up. Most everyone in the ships crew will pitch in in some way or another to make sure you grow. By missions end, you will be so fat you will hardly recognize yourself, and do you know what happens to Asari who grow too obese\u2026?\u201d Samara leaned in to whisper it in Morinth\u2019s ear. \u201cThey lose the ability to meld.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorinth\u2019s jaw dropped as her mother took a step back, and she realized the implications. \u201cAnd if I can\u2019t meld\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will no longer be a danger to any of your mates.\u201d Samara finished for her. \u201cYou will grow weak and harmless, but you will have atoned for your past crimes and be free.

She did as she was told, and went on ground missions when requested, but the rest of her time she spent stuffing her face as \u201cordered\u201d. As she initially thought, eatting whatever she wanted and get fat were both actually pretty enjoyable. Fattening, high calorie foods from across the galaxy were fed to her to keep her sedentary, but whenever they needed her to have energy, their scientist Salarian would give her some kind of pill that would temperaraly restore her energy so she could fight, or minor doses so she could do chores on the ship. They even had him make a special powed they sprinkled in all her food to make it extra fattening, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara and Shepard\u2019s plan was ultimately thought up to make Morinth useful in the fight against the Collectors, and to also remove the threat to her being an Ardat Yakshi, which was working great. However, they also hoped Morinth getting fat would humiliate her, which it did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorinth showed no shame in her widening frame, instead she wore every pound with pride. She never pulled her shirt all they way down, always leaving a sliver of her smooth blue belly flesh exposed, along with leaving a deep valley of cleavage on display. When she walked past a member of the crew, she exaggerated the sway of her widened hips, causing her chubby butt to wobble.

Morinth becoming obscenely fat was what they intended, but neither of them expected her to take her new lot in life with such stride, let alone derive pleasure from it. The way her first born traipsed about with her over fed curves hanging out of her whorishly exposing clothing made Samara feel a sense of secondhand shame and disgust for Morinth, and the desire to force her to cover herself. Something she didn\u2019t think she could feel for her. Almost like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think she\u2019s fat enough that she can\u2019t meld anymore?\u201d Shepard asked before Samara could complete her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d She replied, shaking her head. \u201cThe lowest known weight of an Asari to lose her ability to meld was only a few dozen pounds short of six hundred pounds. However, it is usually several hundred more, and with Morinth\u2019s unusual condition and exemplary powers, she will likely be able to maintain the ability for much, much longer\u2026 though, at the rate of which she is gaining, maybe not.\u201d Even in the highly unlikely event that Morinth <i>did</i> lose her ability to meld at a much lower weight than she anticipated, Samara wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until her psychopathic daughter was reduced to a quivering blob of fat that had significant trouble standing. And breathing. It was far better than she deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard uncrossed her arms and stopped leaning against a wall to stand up straight. \u201cRight. What I got from that was: no, I can\u2019t tap that yet without dying. So, I\u2019mma go masturbate.\u201d She said bluntly and without shame. The Commander often spoke her mind without censor, even when inappropriate, and usually delivered casually. Without another word, she turned on her heel and walked off toward her quarters. \u201cWho knew fat bitches gave me such raging lady boners\u2026\u201d Samara could hear Jane comment to herself as she left, though she wished she hadn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone involved in the concoction of the plan thought that her increasing weight would <i>repel</i> potential victims, but it only seemed to make her more alluring. Perhaps it was simply a part of the nature of an Ardat-Yakshi. No matter what, maybe they somehow maintained their attractiveness in the eyes of others. Either that, or the majority of the Normandy crew were obesophiles, which was unlikely to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Samara\u2019s train of thought,l was derailed, this time by the sound of a button popping and Morinth moaning sensually. Yet another pair of pants had be outgrown by the bulging bodacious blue beauty, her bulbous blue belly bumps burdening bottoms to bursting. She then bit down her bottom lip, and took each of her rolls in her hands and squeezed hard. \u201cSo\u2014mmm\u2014voluptuous\u2026\u201d She moaned. The only time Morinth stopped eating was when she slept, used the bathroom, was feeling herself up, or a combination of the three. And sometimes not even then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her tray cleared, though, Mornith heaved herself up from her seat in the mess hall to go get even more artery clogging goodies. It almost made Samara want to be sick. She managed to hold her lunch down long enough to leave the presence of her abomination of a daughter, and felt the urge subside. If she ever allowed herself to fall into such a state, the Justiciar would have put a bullet in her head before anyone could see her. Still, there was a part of her that was glad that there was an alternative to having to kill her daughter. Even if it was a small, insignificant, almost nonexistent part of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorinth was the one she was most proud of. Her strong willed first born, who she still saw her beloved bondmate in. She couldn\u2019t help but think killing her would kill a part of her, too. It pained her too much to think of it for too long, so she went the her quarters to meditate.</span></div></div>",

Success would require the absolute best out of everyone involved. The stress was starting to get to the entire crew. Shepard\u2019s behavior was becoming increasingly erratic and unpredictable, Miranda and Jack were always at each other\u2019s throats, and Tali was one jump scare away from putting another hole in Legion. The only one unaffected by it all was Morinth. No matter what, the Ardat Yakshi continued stuffing her face. No matter what horrors she encountered on missions, no matter the atrocities the Collectors committed, no matter how inevitable their deaths seemed, she would always saunter back onto the ship, into the mess hall, and slide right back into the endless feast her life had become.

She had be beaten, put into a corner, yet a smug grin never left Morinth\u2019s face. Only custom ordered clothes had any hope of keeping her covered, and even then she was growing so fast she would outgrow any nee outfits in a week, leading to her spending most days half naked, tempting everyone with her acres of exposed, supple flesh. It was clear to all now that Morinth did not see this forced expansion of her figure as a punishment, but yet another outlet for her to indulge her hedonism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours of ceaseless gorging, Morinth had finally retreated into the private quarters. Not because she was full, no, she had more food in her quarters, and even carried an armful of greasy delights to keep her sated during the short walk there. No, she went to her quarters to continue eating while indulging in other pleasures of the flesh she was forbidden from doing in public. It seemed that while Morinth\u2019s figure grew, so too did her hunger, not just for food, but for all carnal delights. She was becoming so insatiable that special accommodations needed to be give to sate Ardat Yakshi\u2019s appetites for fear she might lose control of herself and pounce on some helpless member of the crew. She was given any manner of illegal substance she desired to abuse, and she went through sex bots as quick as she did clothes. All lf this bankrolled by the Commander\u2019s mission funds. Samara couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it wasn\u2019t her daughter that was trapped, but rather the entire crew that was being held hosting by Morinth\u2019s capricious whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeditation no longer did anything to quiet Samara\u2019s rage. The Code taught her how to keep control over her emotions, but Morinth was becoming a living, jiggling monument to everything the Code was opposed to. Soulless self gratification, mind dulled by pleasure, a weak body bloated by indulgence, Morinth was a living embodiment of all these sins and more. If it had humiliated her, put her in her place and kept her harmless, she could have tolerated it, but the Justicar had finally convinced herself that she had made a grave mistake in sparing her daughter, and there was only one way to rectify it. She grabbed her pistol and marched to Morinth\u2019s room, intent on doing what she should have done when they had her cornered on Omega. It would be much easier, now that the Ardat Yakshi was so bloated she couldn\u2019t summon much energy without that special pill Mordin had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samara reached the door of Morinth\u2019s private quarters she found it locked from the inside, but that no obstacle for someone with biotics as refined and well tuned as her own. With only minimal effort, the Justicar was able to move the mechanisms in the doors and forced all the pieces open, allowing her to enter and confront her daughter for a final time. What she saw inside took her entirely off guard, leaving her frozen in shock. She knew Morinth had fallen into a life of debauchery and excess, but she had never seen the full extent of it for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorinth was laid on her belly atop her bed, a sex bot crushed beneath her girth and her round face buried into a pile of food in front of her, eating like pig at a trough. And what a big she was. Six hundred pounds of excess flesh were piled up on her body. Her double belly had become a triple, and the lowest tier would hang to her knees if she were to stand. Her back was a series of thick folds that stacked up on the shelf of her backside, which itself had become like two two moons, cratered with dimples of cellulite. Two heavy chins hung underneath the one she was born with, and they jiggled along with comically round cheeks when she pulled her face out of the pile of food to look up in surprise at her mother. She saw the gun and panicked. Desperately she tried to prop herself up, to scramble onto her hands and knees, but rings of fat around her thighs, thick as tiers, and the pillows of fat that hung from her upper coupled with the sheer size of her overfed gut kept her immobilized in ber current position. When she failed to move in any meaningful way, she tried to call om her biotics, but the narcotics in her system prevented her from manifesting the power in a manner she could use to defend herself, only managing to create some blue sparks of of energy that sent ripples through her oceans of azure adipose. She was entirely defenseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara saw her daughter in this pitiful state, entirely naked, covered in stains, and the Justicar could only feel one thing\u2026</span></div></div>",

Thought Shepard. Whe he laid his eyes on Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards, backdown! Me and Commander Shepard need some private conversation.\" Said Aria.<br>\r\nThey did so and Aria crossed her right leg over the other in an attempted seductive way, the small lines of cloth like straps around her legs creaked at the sudden movement.

She barely noticed when she spilled a fat dollop of ranch on her breasts and didn\u2019t even think of decency when she touched it with her finger and licked it off. An appetizer plate of fried food came and quickly went as the insatiable spy demolished it, ignorant of the ring of grease and sauce around her mouth. Her dress was feeling impossibly tight, so she began fiddling with its small belt. Her greasy fingers made a mess of the job and she soon stained her expensive dress before finally undoing the clasp. Arias\u2019s belly, which had been flowing around the belt, now surged outwards with ease.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was a blur. Lobster bisque soup and salad course vanished before her eyes and she could have sworn she saw Shepard eye her stuffed belly. A thick plate of fried potatoes and steak tips swimming in cheese disappeared as her stomach started aching and then finally this time gorging herself on a massive bowl of ice cream drowning in hot fudge, sprinkles and whipped cream.\ufeff<br>\r\n-<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the Purpule Asari finished it and idly started sucking on the spoon.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n If she could have seen her self she would have been shocked, for her face was covered in layers of grease, chocolate, sauce and melting ice cream. Her dress was utterly ruined, dozens of splotches from her careless gorging covering its front, which was badly stretched by her stuffed belly. Not really thinking she leaned against Shepard who put his strong hand on her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we talking about now again?\" Asked Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, right.

Well here's a proper story for you anyway, enjoy!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll things considered, rebuilding Omega had been the easy part. Sure Shepard wouldn't let her keep Petrovsky's skull for display purposes, but after the initial fighting, it was remarkably easy to keep things under her thumb when human extremists and giant robot squids were flying around the galaxy. If she closed her eyes, she could almost pretend it was like the old times again, where her word was law and every able body on the asteroid bowed down to lick her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the war ended, and the troubles began. She reorganized what was left of the Blue Suns, Blood Pack, and Eclipse into her own defense force to keep the rabble in line, but even united they were shadows of their former selves. Her criminal network was running strong, helped along by the frantic chaos of the Reaper conflicts, but that drew the attention of new criminal elements, old soldiers coming back from the war with connections and the money to start their own competing enterprises, new mercenary bands fresh from cutting their teeth on the Reapers and eager to make some money, and even some human corporations tainted by being on the wrong side of the war and looking to the back alleys to remain afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmega may have been back in business again, but if she wanted it to remain that way, she needed to remind everyone what the first law of Omega was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, while things were dire, new times allowed for new opportunities. Aria had the good fortune to be on the winning side of the conflict, and thanks to the spin given by a few pliable journalists, she enjoyed a lot of good will where she didn't have it before. No longer regarded as merely a den of corruption and vice, which in fairness was an entirely accurate portrayal, Omega quickly became home to refugees and resistance fighters of all shades, willing to fill the ranks of her mercenary army to protect their new lives here on Omega, and she could finally establish honest financial ties with a few willing corporations, establishing a financial lifeline she could use to engage with businesses and even some governments who wouldn't have given her anything but a bombing run before now. All of which kept her afloat and a step ahead, but it was a step too close for her comfort. Aria needed an ace in the hole, a faction she could control safely but would be powerful enough to protect her interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her ace in the Sisters of Rasvun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging during the Reaper conflict thanks to slackening government oversight, the Sisters of Rasvun rejected the passivity and patience of traditional Asari culture and encouraged assertive action, living in the moment and enjoying life to its fullest. It became appealing in a time when life could be cut short at any moment, but after the war the Sisters of Rasvun found their ideologies banned and they were sent packing in search of a new home. In a sense, they were exactly what Aria needed. For starters, they were perfectly fine with less then illegal activity (laws were restrictive of living in the moment), they didn't really want any power of their own, just a place where they could bed down, and perhaps most importantly of all, they were regarded as very powerful biotics, attributing their powerful biotic energies to their embrace of passion and spontaneity giving them greater energy to use such abilities. Whatever the reason, they were exactly what Aria needed; a powerful army that she could lean on for support and would fight tooth and nail to keep the status quo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fight they did; after one scuffle with some renegade Talons ended in a crushing loss for the invading mercs, no one had tried to come knocking for the last few months. Lounging in her favorite spot overlooking the newly rebuilt Afterlife, it seemed like things were, at last, back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, mostly normal. Even if the Sisters of Rasvun weren't openly preachy, you could see the effects that their encouragement of hedonistic life-seizing was having on the populace of Omega.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out on the dance floor, you couldn't see a lot of Asari that didn't have a belly on them. A few seemed reasonably ashamed at such hefty weights on their midsection, but most seemed pleased by their extra pounds, dancing frantically to show off how their guts jiggled and swayed to the music. Others had more then just a belly; the Asari working the bar was twice as wide as she had been before the Sisters showed up, visibly panting and sweating from lugging an extra hundred pounds of herself around to serve customers. Despite slowing down, her tip jar was already overflowing despite the day not being over yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't an anomaly either, the people of Omega, or at least the ones who came to Afterlife, were pretty receptive of the new belief spreading along with the added adipose. Interspecies eating contests became so popular that a gambling ring had sprung up around it, several of the non-Asari patrons were putting on weight thanks to the new beliefs, and many Krogans were pleased to find dance partners closer to their size, or partners in a more carnal sense. Aria even had some of the dancers on the center stage plump up to appeal to the new patrons, though reinforcing the stage after a huge dancer with too much sand her hourglass, so to say, tripped and nearly collapsed the whole center ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite these little headaches, business was still booming on Omega, and with the powerful biotics under her thumb, no one was coming along to shake things up. Say what you will about the Sisters of Rasvun and their beliefs; they knew not to fuck with Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to her private room opened behind her as she looked out onto the crowd below. Her guards escorted in a waddling Asari female in a long blue dress, a pendant hanging around her thick neck and nearly dipping into her meaty cleavage that would make any man or woman drool. In contrast to the straight and narrow guards flanking her, the Asari was quite round, three hundred or so pounds stuffed into a tight dress that threatened to emerge at any moment, with a great round face perched on top of a shelf of neck fat. Openly eating a large sandwich in front of her, the obese Asari stifled a burp as she lumbered to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister Aanyo Arteri,\" Aria said absently as she pondered some future adjustments to the club. Even with her back turned she recognized the distinctive sound of the high-ranking Sister's favorite food. \"What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Arteri bowed politely, her dress audibly stretching as her blubber strained against the fabric, and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: \"It's the other Sisters...they're concerned that you're not truly supportive of our beliefs,\" she says warily, not fully trusting Aria herself. (Skinny Aria)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: \"I merely wanted to see your progress as one of one of our newer converts, ma'am,\" she says brightly. (Fat Aria)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: \"I wanted to personally thank you,\" she says reverently. \"For all the persecution we endured, you've been an example to us all through your devotion.\" (Huge Aria)</span></div></div>",

Aria plucked the elaborate, expensive cocktail up for herself while Arteri took the carb-heavy ale for herself, sipping it with a content expression. Being the Asari that the ruler of Omega turned to for information on the Sisters certainly had its perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the Sisters...\" Aria continued, lowering herself onto the sofa and putting her feet up on the center table. Arteria's sip had turned into a gulp by the time Aria sat down, so the thinner Asari waited until the other lowered the glass with a light belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...well, there's some discontent among the leaders about our being here,\" Arteri tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you even call your leaders anyway?\" a Batarian skulking off to the side interjected. \"Big Sisters?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kindly keep the comments to yourself, Cralo,\" Aria coolly replied, giving him a look that could burn through steel if it needed to. Cralo, not willing to be cowed, simply shrugged, stepping back into position in the wings without another sound. Aria inwardly groaned; the ex-Talon commando was a handy trophy to have around, but his tendency to snipe back at her was a constant frustration. It almost made her miss having the Patriarch around. \"So, is there some moralizer or dissident your leaders are having trouble with? I'd hate for them to be unhappy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArteri swayed on her feet ponderously. \"Well...the problem they have is with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the pulsing club beat outside, you could hear a pin drop in the lofty room as Aria frowned in a puzzled sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to elaborate?\" Aria asked delicately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...some of the leaders are worried about your...erm...\" Arteri stumbled across her words, intimidated by the icy glare leveled at her. \"They're talking about...leaving before you can turn on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose in frustration. \"This again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Miss T'Loak, you have to at least consider-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I get that I'm a bitch sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm going to just throw your asses out into the void of space when the going gets tough,\" Aria barrelled on. \"I mean, yeah that's absolutely something I do to the occasional nuisance, but I'm not planning on turning you all over to the space police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what a lot of them say,\" Arteri muttered sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Aria snapped, leaning up from the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then finish your drink and go. Tell your leaders that they're being too goddamned paranoid. But say it...diplomatically, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say,\" Arteri muttered, barely hiding her frustration as she waddled off, her shapely rear bouncing and pitching in time with the steps. As the door slid shut, Aria leaned her head back in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I need to tell them this?\" Aria groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should pinky-swear that you won't throw them out this time,\" Cralo suggested, breaking his silence. Aria stared at the Batarian in confusion. \"Human expression I picked up somewhere, means-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless defining backwater humanoid slang is going to solve the problem I really do NOT care,\" Aria snapped. \"I...I don't understand these people. I've given them shelter, a place to practice their beliefs, way too much goddamned food. Why are they still too scared to stay around? Don't they know I need them as much as they need me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you considered you may be thinking about this incorrectly?\" Cralo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I? It's simple fact, my position is more stable with the Sisters around, the Sisters have a life and their freedom with me around. It's mutually beneficial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, maybe from where you're sitting. But these people have spent the better part of the last decade getting jerked around by people who said they would shelter and protect them. When you're in that kind of situation, you learn not to take the powerful at their word,\" Cralo pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave them a home!\" Aria insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can take it away at any time,\" Cralo countered. \"Sure <i>you </i>know you won't, but what makes you think <i>they </i>know you won't?\" The powerful leader of Omega froze, then visibly deflated at this point, admitting defeat with a scoff and a glance in the other direction, tossing her empty cocktail glass aside. She would sooner die before saying it aloud, but her new pet made a rather excellent point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you need to do is show that you actually care about their beliefs. Not just saying you care, but showing it. Which means...well...\" Cralo puffed out his cheeks and placed a hand on his stomach, moving it farther and farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria looked particularly murderous at the very idea. \"You...you're suggesting I get FAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a suggestion,\" Cralo reminded her, holding his hands up defensively. \"You'd make the Sisters happy and they'll stick around thinking you care about their beliefs enough to put on some weight. I can't imagine it would be difficult, since hedonism seems to come rather naturally to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't I have you vaporized?\" Aria said venomously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you're way of admitting I'm right?\" Cralo smirked, knowing full well that it absolutely was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even assuming that I was going to do this,\" Aria continued, patting her flat stomach apprehensively as she wondered what it would be like carrying a bulge there. \"How would I even go about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the obvious answer is gorging yourself,\" the Batarian pointed out. \"You definitely have the resources for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my position with them is precarious though, getting pounds the natural way might take too much time...\" Aria realized. \"I could just go to the Sisters directly and ask them to assist with this. I'm sure they wouldn't mind, and that way they'll know I care enough about them to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could use a chemical solution,\" Cralo suggested. \"I happen to know a few appetite enhancers and metabolism suppressants that are on the market. And no, you don't want to know how I know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of do now,\" Aria admitted with a sly grin. \"In any case, given the options...</span></div></div>",

Two hundred each, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dancers Aria pulled into her sanctum stared at her like a second head sprouted from her neck. The smaller, more timid one of the pair was too busy flushing a deep purple to speak, but her older companion wasn't so shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious! How are we supposed to dance if we're the size of a blimp?\" she shouted, taking a step towards her and prompting the Krogans standing guard stepped forward as well, openly brandishing their weapons as a warning to stand back. Lips pursed, the older dancer tempered herself but kept going. \"Zelyxea's such a lardass she broke the stage the other week and half of the girls are heading towards her size because of those 'Sisters',\" she sneered, putting as much venom into that last word as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And more people are coming to watch them dance then you,\" Aria reminded them. \"So if you're not going to bulk up, you're not going on that stage. There's the door, goodbye.\" The angrier dancer stood her ground, while her friend made eye movements towards said door but didn't move either. \"Then we're in agreement. Put on some pounds, or you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want four times my usual cut. Same for Cearisa here,\" the dancer demanded, jerking a thumb towards her more timid partner. Aria steepled her fingers in front of her mouth to hide her slight smile. She liked this one's spunk, maybe she'd put her in a more useful position later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One and a half,\" Aria replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two, and you get one free meal every day.\" The food was practically pocket change, cheap negotiating trick but it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dancers looked at one another before the older one looked back. \"Deal.\" The younger girl, Cearisa, looked relieved as a guard escorted the two away, presumably to the nearest eatery. Letting out a soft sigh, Aria let her head lean backwards, feeling the pulse of the dance beats through the window behind her. Time seemed to slip away somewhat before a guard made an announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, the Batarian's back,\" a surly-looking Turian reported. \"Brought someone with him, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria sat up eagerly as Cralo strode confidently into the room, a half-step ahead of...a Salarian female? Very interesting, Aria thought as she watched her look around curiously, lowering her hood as she stepped through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting crowd,\" she smirked at Cralo when they exited the audio haze of the club. \"So what's the gig, I'm fattening up some pervert's dancers for him?\" Aria frowned, clearing her throat to get her attention. The Salarian turned sharply to face her, only for her expression to soften considerably as she let out a soft little 'oh!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not fattening them up, they're good at making hogs out of themselves,\" Aria said, turning to the lone human among her security staff. \"That's the term, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" he said, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, just get out. All of you. This is a private matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the guards exchanged knowing smirks, but vacated the room without a word, leaving Aria alone with the frail looking Salarian and that skulking Batarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's the one you're fattening up,\" Cralo said, gesturing to his superior. \"This is Orlani, by the way. Good kid, put my heart back together after it got blasted into bits by a lucky shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria raised an eyebrow. \"And you're out here doing...well, this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You try finding steady, honest work when your species thinks you belong in a box for your entire life,\" Orlani sneered. \"Besides, most criminal lowlifes will pay out the nose for someone with my skills...no offense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" Aria and Cralo said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...especially when it involves indulging in their 'kinks' as it were,\"  Orlani said, unhooking the satchel from around her shoulder. \"For your situation, though...\" Aria looked on, expecting her to pull out a bottle of pills but instead began untangling a plasticine tube from a palm-sized device. \"Hold your arm out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold your arm out, unless you don't need me after all!\" Orlani snapped. Aria, frowning, complied, letting the Salarian wrap the device around her wrist. \"Anyway, it seems the excess weight is a means to an end, so I wanted to give you an easy way to get rid of it. This device administers a special drug that rapidly, and temporarily, multiplies adipose tissue, letting you live a couple hours a dose as a fat girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interest-urgh!\" Aria winced as the rogue Salarian doctor stabbed part of the tubing into her wrist. \"And it's safe to use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salarian offered a rare smile. \"Perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Five minutes earlier</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrlani frowned, feeling very much out of place at the bar of this seedy club. Checking the time on her omnitool, something warm and blubbery bumped into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" the young Asari giggled, tugging her shirt over her obese belly and continuing to dance with her friends. Orlani sneered and returned to her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a...huff...refill?\" the bartender asked, out of breath from the small walk up to Orlani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you,\" Orlani replied slowly, eying the bartender's flabby belly trying to swallow up her end of the bar. \"Just let Cralo know I'm here.\" She winced as another obese patron, this one a pear-shaped human doing her damnedest to split her hot shorts wide open, danced right into her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\" the bartender said, looking distressed at the idea of climbing up the stares to the VIP area over the dance floor. Orlani would roll her eyes if Salarians were capable of such a gesture; no wonder Cralo had contacted her for a job like this, she thought bitterly. It felt like all she catered to nowadays was niche fetishes, and she was even starting to miss good old fashioned backalley surgery. Sure the pay was good, but you try creating a product that caters to sexual desires when you have no capability for sexual attraction for days on end. It's all fun for them and nothing captivating or engaging for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething bumped into the back of her arm again. \"My sister, a word...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you watch where you're going?\" she snapped, tired of getting bumped into all the time and expecting to see some airhead fatty but instead found herself speaking to an Asari not in flashy new fashions but in a long robe, ornately designed. A yellow smudge on her chin suggested she'd recently been eating, and the paunch visible against her chest indicated she ate well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here to help her put on weight?\" the sister asked, taking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you...get off! That's confidential!\" Orlani lied, snapping her hand away. \"What do you care about it anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just here to tell you two things,\" she whispered. \"Make her huge. Triple what she's paying you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriple? Triple the already hefty pricetag this Aria chick demanded of her? Sorely tempting, Orlani thought as she glanced towards the returning figure of the obese bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much are we talking about, exactly?\" she said turning back to the stranger, only to find her gone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" the bartender said sluggishly as she squeezed herself back behind the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Orlani said quickly. \"Where's Cralo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be down in a bit,\" the bartender said. \"Sure you don't want anything else? Drink, dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dessert, in a dance club?</i> \"No, I'm fine...\" she said, thinking about that small little offer she just got. Triple her pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly,\" Orlani said, looking at Aria fiddle with the device and fit it more snugly on her arm. By the way she was roughhousing the casing, she clearly wasn't used to fragile tech like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how does this work?\" she asked, getting a hold of the largest black knob on the device. \"Is this like a variable setting of some sort?\" In a split second, Orlani thought about how not being careful with that knob would break the machine, and no doubt give her mysterious benefactor exactly what they wanted, and said...</span></div></div>",

But what's it-\" Aria's eyes widened, and she started to frantically tug at the tubing embedded in her wrist. She winced in pain as the micro-hooks kept the tubing attached long enough for the serum in the apparatus to start pumping into her. With a scream of pain, she ripped the tubes out full force, streaking her own blood across the carpet and crunched the device in her free hand with a show of biotic force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the pump on that was a little strong,\" the Salarian said delicately, still slipping slowly away. \"Looks like you got the full dosage. Hmmm.\" Realizing she was trying to escape, an enraged Aria leapt towards Orlani and lifted her up by the collar, unbridled fury contorting her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck do you think I am?!?\" Aria shouted, shaking her violently. \"Do you think you can kill the queen of Omega that fucking easy, bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bit slow to kick in,\" Orlani said idly, eerily calm despite being lifted into the air by a deranged biotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's slow to kick in...aaagh!\" Aria dropped the Salarian, clutching at her stomach in pain. Her breathing shortened, and when she looked at Orlani picking herself up, there was a distinct note of fear on the queen of Omega's paling face. \"What...what did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less what you wanted,\" Orlani said. \"No refunds! Cralo, might want to get out of here....may get messy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you....aggh!\" Aria was bent double as her stomach twisted itself into knots, breaking out in a cold sweat and feeling a tingling sensation spreading through her extremities. Cralo blinked his four eyes, then without a word followed Orlani out the door. \"Bastard,\" Aria hissed, breaking out in a cold sweat as she started to feel...strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrlani slipped out of Cralo's line of sight as they ran out of the loft, dodging through the crowd of patrons and dipping behind a chubby Asari getting grinded on. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the same woman who approached her with the request, smiling as her companion, bedecked in similar looking robes, opened up her omnitool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way out of the building to the relative safety of the walkways, the distinctive electric blip from her own system, signalling a deposit was made, was the sweetest sound in the world to her. And all she had to do was drug some alpha-bitch with an experimental chemical for some weird chubby chasing cultists. Easiest thirty thousand creds she'd ever made, and probably the only use she'd ever get out of that chemical that the Asari injected into herself. The stuff was niche and too specialized to use, boosting your weight significantly and temporarily in small doses, but the whole batch?</span></div></div>",

With no dangers nearby anymore, maybe just a couple of angry pirates or some scrapers there and there. She hits them with head shot in every singel one with her sniper rifle from her porch. She goes out in her Mako (Seen in ME1) when she goes to the city, or the module colony where the Tempest is in anchor for immediate weapons placements. The planet Eos begins to gain momentum, forests begin to form and food is grown in an abundance. The food is somewhat nutritious poor, so the colonists must take appetite enhancers including Cora. But her food is produced from a food replicator made by remnant tech. The food is installed to contain more fat and nutrient-rich substances. Cora is  unaware of that, but She dont mind those new pounds. She has just gone up 5 kilos since her fatigue weight. Now she is 65 Kilo sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a consequence, her thighs and hips have expanded and her buttocks along. The breasts vibrate sharply as she walks in the house with a numerous cake on a plate towards her desk where the news is lined up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was going to sit down, she stretched out her buttocks that the lower part of her pants slowly bursts, without noticing it.  so she sat down on the chair when the stomach was pushed out against the belt that caused it to crack. She ate the cake with spoon, a big spoon. The news magazine stated that The ryders would visit Eos for a holiday.<br>\r\nCora opened the mail where an email from one of the Ryder would come over to her and spend some time with her.<br>\r\nWith this, her heart pounded heavily, now it can be a good opportunity to fix more food for the visit. But it's not for a week, so no hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate the cake in happiness and with excitement, she made sure to take one to the pills of the appetite enhancers. Thought Cora, at the same time as her hand caressed her inflated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she lay down, she felt a great hunger, best to eat then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replicated more food, 50 Pizzas with fatty mozzarella cheese on with 10 fat princess cakes with some almonds and so on. terribly good that the replicator drew as much as a light bulb that mankind used before LED came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning after she was finished, 10 Kilo Later. Her belly has become quite soft, her beer belly sits and rests on her thighs, resting at the kneecaps in a sitting position. the hips are hanging outside the chair now ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worth it,\" Cora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Days Later ...</span></div></div>",

Ryder notices that she has laid out a nice grassy yard by the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for a while, but noticed that he parked the nomad in an embarrassing manner. \"Upside down, fuck too.\"<br>\r\nWhen he turned his head towards the door, it was open with a beautiful cora dressed in the Andromeda initiative's strandard uniform.<br>\r\n A little, the outline around the waist with a pair of seams worn. He found himself staring so he glanced up at Cora's smiling face. He observed that she had one hand on her hip which was a generous piece of beloved handle and one hand stretched above the head at the door frame. That gesture had caused her shirt to crack at the armpit. She didn't seem to care about her, well grown up clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Scott realized he had to say something:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello cora, nice to be seen again\". Said scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, scott,\" Said Cora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that time has treated you well.\" Said Scott, or pointed out. But not in a negative way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ha ha ha, of course. Must say that the food replicators are necessary for the local food here at Eos to be just as tasteless and nutrient poor.\" Said cora with her hand patting on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott noted it, He doesn't mind Cora's new look but can be a problem for what he was going to ask her about. He had a thought that she had put on her before coming to meet her personally, to assess the situation ...<br>\r\nHe went on and asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to ask you if you wanted to join a mission. I need a reliable biotic for this.\" Said Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am honored to be included, as good old times\". Said Cora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old Good Times? It has only been a year since the Kett stack from the helius cluster, speaking of it is exactly what the mission is about.\" Said Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we take the tempest out to a new place? Asked Cora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe carry out a briefing on the mission on the ship, all I want to know if you want to be with me and shoot evil aliens, bad guys you know. \"Scott said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh I hang on. \"Cora replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, her belt burst,  her pale belly shot out a bit below the shirt. Her pants bursted behind her, her buttocks flew out through the hole of her small frame. She has only put on 15 KG in one year so it is still a manageable weight to exchange fire against non-friendly minded enemies. Her pale breast was a little less shaped but was nice anyway. They shot forward and down because of the shock wave of the belt that cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dress Problems?\" Asked Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No danger, I have bigger clothes in the dressing room. Give me 3 hours, then I come over to the ship.\" Said Cora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, take the time you need,\" said Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before turning to the heels he leaned toward Cora and kissed her on her lips. She kissed back with 10 times harder strength against his lips, with her tongue. Her hands were looking behind Ryders behind And Scott's handes searched for her generous broad hips and ass and squeezed it.<br>\r\nCora laughed. :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathfinder not here ha, ha\". Said Cora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship in 3 hours then, see you there! Scott said waving on the way down to the stairs that led to the upside-down All-terrain vehicle, the Nomad.</span></div></div>",

The Turian had somehow managed to acquire all the ingredients necessary to prepare the Earth dish known as meatloaf, and prepared nice romantic dinner for them to share in the Pathfinder\u2019s spacious (and more importantly private) quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! I\u2019m eating with my eyes before I eat with my mouth.\u201d Maybe it was a trick of the lighting created by the candles in the middle of the small round table they were sat at, but Sara was pretty sure the meatloaf was orange, which, last she checked, was not the color it was supposed to be. With a shaky Sara gripped her fork and cautiously speared a chunk of the loaf. She raised the fork up to her mouth and put the meat on her tongue after a moment of hesitation. \u201cMmm\u2026 so yummy and\u2026 crunchy\u2026\u201d Awful as it tasted, the young brunette couldn\u2019t bring herself to spit it out for fear of hurting her beloved spiky girlfriend\u2019s feelings, and her body refused to swallow it, so it just stated on her tongue as she winced and chewed it into a gooey paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their relationship began about three months ago, Sara was surprised how easily Vetra adapted to having a Human lover. The much taller woman seemed to just instinctually know how to make things work, while Sara expected they would both need to do a little research before they got into the swing of things. Unfortunately, there was one thing that didn\u2019t come naturally to Vetra, nor did researching help her any, and that one thing was cooking food suitable for Human consumption. It wasn\u2019t her fault, really. How could she make good food when she couldn\u2019t taste test it without making herself sick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVetra found it hard to watch as her short Human lover struggled with the first bite of the meal she had made. Even if the faces Sara was making were cute, Vetra didn\u2019t like that they were ones of disgust caused by her terrible cooking. \u201cRyder, spit that out before you choke on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVetra sounded more tired and disappointed than upset, so the Pathfinder listened, lifting a napkin up to her mouth and spitting out the rancid meat. Once it was out the taste still lingered, so she tried to wash it down with some of her wine, and when that didn\u2019t work she scrubbed her tongue with another napkin. \u201cVetra, I love you, but that was terrible. You are just the worst at this.\u201d Ryder said once she finally got the bitter taste out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I know you Humans have the saying practice makes perfect, but I think at this rate my practice is going to give you food poisoning.\u201d It was meant as a joke, but the couple knew it was way too close to truth for their liking. \u201cSo much for romantic dinners\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs bad as that meatloaf was, and it was bad, it didn\u2019t make Sara feel nearly as sick as seeing Vetra looking so dejected did; like watching someone kick a puppy. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, babe. We can still have romantic meals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVetra pulled her face out of her hands and looked up at Sarah with sad eyes. \u201cWe can? How?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When it comes to traveling through space the weight of a vessel is the most limiting factor. So when the Andromeda Initiative was packing for the trip across dark space, things like silverware and tablecloths weren\u2019t on the list of bare essentials they could bring along. As a result, the closest thing to a fancy restaurant the colonists from the Milky Way could establish were bars on the Nexus. That left Sara and Vetra with very few places to have a romantic night out, and they were forced to look for a less conventional venue. When the Tempest landed on Kadara and Ryder told Vetra to get dressed up, the smuggler was understandably skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors of the restaurant slid open, and Vetra\u2019s fears were confirmed. \u201cRyder, I don\u2019t think <i>either</i> of us should eat anything here\u2026\u201d Whatever the Angara used the building for before the Outcasts took over, it had since been converted a restaurant in the loosest sense of the word; one that didn\u2019t look any cleaner than the rest of the port. Admittedly, the candles on each table were still a nice touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how the place looked, Sara was still cautiously optimistic. \u201cHey, nothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d Ryder hooked her arm around that of her much taller girlfriend and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo Humans have a saying for every bad idea they try to talk people into?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple were definitely the best dressed people in the seedy establishment, not that the other patrons had set a very high bar. Sara had hung up her well worn official Andromeda Initiative sweatpants and hoodie in favor of a stylish leather jacket and pants bearing the same blue and white color scheme, while Vetra wore a simple asymmetrical Turian dress that was just a tad darker than navy blue in color, with touches of purple flair here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the first time in my life I\u2019ve ever felt overdressed.\u201d If Turians could blush Vetra would certainly be doing it now. Instead she just felt an uncomfortable fluttering in her stomach. A distracting heat in her shoulders, chest and arms. Embarrassment was not an emotion she encountered often in her old life as a smuggler, and she would much rather be doing just about anything else if it meant she didn\u2019t have to deal with these unfamiliar sensations. But Sara looked happy, and that was more important than her own comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shut up. You look awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple sat down together at a table for two by a window that had an unobstructed view of an untouched stretch of Kadara\u2019s surface, the glistening pools of recently purified water reflect a rainbow of vivid colors from the setting sun\u2019s light. Leave it to the Pathfinder to find just about the only romantic view in the whole Cluster. Now it was just a question of whether or not the food was edible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVetra\u2019s awe over the beautiful landscape was cut short, however, when a decidedly grumpy looking Salarian cleared his (or her, it was hard to tell until they said something) throat and placed a single hand made menu on the table. He obviously didn\u2019t think he was going to cross the void between galaxies to become a waiter when he signed up for the Initiative. Before anyone said a word the Salarian left Sara and Vetra to look at the menu while he went to bus a different table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe menu was a single page of laminated paper with minimal flare. On one side were the levo dishes, and on the other were the dextro ones. The selection wasn\u2019t great, but of the few options presented they all at least sounded appetizing. In the end they both ordered comparable meals of a large cut of grilled seasoned meat and diced collard greens. The Salarian further proved his distaste for his current state of employment by taking his sweet time to serve them, but when the dishes were finally placed in front of them the couple weren\u2019t immediately repulsed. There were no strange colors, it wasn\u2019t over or under cooked, and most importantly it wasn\u2019t still moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder took the first bite, cutting off a small slice, cautiously placing it on her tongue. When Vetra saw her girlfriend\u2019s eyes light up, followed by the small busty brunette tucking into her meal with great zeal, the Turian had to try it herself.</span></div></div>",

He has already flittered with lexi who has packed on some pounds. \"I love him, to make sure he will be mine I have to start eating\" Said Peebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Peebe\u00b4s quaters on the Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeebe ate three whole hamburgers next, the meat grilled tender and the cheese melted to perfection. Never before could she ever been given the chance to stuff her face so piggishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a wonderful experience, wholly different from the battlefield. Peebe ate like a woman possessed, and she felt no shame about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally full, the Asaris's flat abs had billowed outward into a rock-hard ball. Peebe touched it, and winced; the stretched skin seemed to tingle underneath her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She had eaten way more than she should have. Now that the euphoria was wearing off, the young woman was beginning to see it might have been a good idea to have indulged her inner-glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perpetual silence that filled the room, was shattered as a tiny belch passed through the overstuffed Asaris lips. The once-clean,metal floor was now covered with a massive pile-up of torn wrappers, empty plastic bags, dirty plates and a multitude of tiny crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The small metal table in the center of the room was practically buried underneath a mountain of pizza boxes and soda cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was another small burp. Peebes incredibly rotund gut hanging out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhhh...\" the Asari moaned in agony, her bright blue eyes forced to squint due to her puffy blue cheeks, \"I think I...urp...I think I...uuuurrrrrrrp...I think I ate too much food...ugh...burrrp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, weakly, Peebe stretched out her left arm over towards her protruding belly, and placed her hand upon it. She marveled at the taut, stuffed feeling;<br>\r\n her stomach was so full that it gave off the impression of being as hard as a rock. Having burst out of her short-shorts long ago during the binge,the Young Asari's hefty tummy had grown past her thin legs and rested on the floor like the over-sized bag of  blue fat flesh that it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was something to see, it was rounder and bigger than if she were pregnant. To the touch even through the bio suit it was very warm and soft. It heaved significantly up and down as she struggled to breath, its size impeding her lungs. It visibly swelled just a bit larger as another donut had found its resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down to eat some more, but found it was all gone. All the food had been eaten. In its place was a massive dome roughly the size of a beach ball connected to a young woman who had defied what was possible. She had turned into a absolute glutton, who was more gorgeous than any. She rubbed her belly up and down feeling its shape and sizing knowing it was really a piece of her complete and whole. Her feet kicked a bit grinding into the bed she lay on it as she was wracked with an intense feeling of pressure building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeebe arched her back and rubbed her stomach desperately trying to relieve the pressure as it built. Finally it became too intense and she literally felt as if she really would burst. Greater and greater it became, worse and worse her discomfort. Just as it reached its climax and she knew she would burst from the pressure, she released the longest, loudest, and roughest burp she had ever heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she looked to her right and found that one more cupcake was indeed in reaching distance. More, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n1 Week later:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeebe walked across the room to the drawers to fetch herself a new outfit. Her soft, fluffy potbelly bounced and jiggled in time with steps.<br>\r\n If she sucked it in she could still see her feet, but her gut would scrunch up into several tiny rolls when she did so. A definite black line had formed that separated her stomach from her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeebe's belly seeped over her panty-line, stopping just short of touching her crotch. The constant calorie intake had caused her abdomen to swell up like a balloon; the lack of work to keep her body in shape helped produced this belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman stripped off her underwear so she could change. Her full breasts and stocky thighs were revealed, more results of her new eating habits. Peebe bent forward to dig through her collection of clothing, her plump rear wiggling in the air overhead. Once rather toned, her butt-cheeks have now become more loose and fleshy, as well as wider. Peebe threw on the tank-top and short-shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands flew up from her blubbery stomach. Her face was smiling in joy. Her stomach brushed against the sink counter. Her breasts flapped and her butt wobbled. Everywhere on her body, she was shaking, wobbling, trembling out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott Will love this!\" Said Peebe before she went out the ships corridors to meet ryder on the observation deck.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyway, Kallo and Suvi were busy at the ship's control panels and did not notice when she went out with a broad smile and swinging hips wandering in a seductive way through the ship's room to the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her leather pants sound like you rub leather against leather but then the sound when fat legs are wrapped in tight leather pants, try that statement.

Peebe could feel their looks in the back and her muffin top was on full view for everyone. Just to be sincere, you should know that the majority of her generous weight is below her waist, like hip and ass and of course her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she walked, she could feel that half of the chest mass hung outside the top she wore, which was partly diligent. But when you see someone pushing even everything for bold and large body parts in tight clothes, some of the dough (Fat) goes into areas that have airspace. Because of that she has a kind of vest or sweater that does so you can partially see the top of the breasts, so there the breasts have been pushed up and almost over the edge of her now small top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her belly is a blue fat mass but quite formable as a ball, keep in mind that it's not her greatest improvement on her body.

But what the hell, shall we give it a chance thought Lexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only has a few hospital records to go through when the rider's mental journal came up, why not go through it all.<br>\r\nThere, suddenly a text came up where Scott has commented that he likes fat girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" said Lexi<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi has never found a soul mate who has liked her appetite. She always has strictness with her diet so she can look good for the right mate.

The drug really works, better on an asari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi's blue breast almost cracked the tight jumpsuit while her pot belly has opened up on the sides as well as her ass and legs. She ate 3 times more until she rested her hands on her stomach,  horny as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi blushes purple on her cheeks with the eyes half open towards scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like how I look?\" Asked Lexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott nods and blushes so red that he gets up and massages Lexi's round stomach and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so soft?\" said Scott<br>\r\n\"You should be hard on something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls need to eat, sometimes more than normal to catch up\", said Lexi.<br>\r\n\"It is unhealthy to be slim, the doctor knows best.\" Says Lexi in a flatter tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at her so close that they can lick each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind for a kiss\", Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course yes\" Lexi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kissed and the drug from lexi grabbed hold of Scott and he falls in love with lexi and lexi falls in love with Scott. ..<br>\r\n_____________<br>\r\nIt became a love Story, sorry.<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Same with her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was being melted at the same time as her figure filled out. The stomach was massive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi held up his breasts and licked seductively on the nipples in front of Ryder, Scott has gone naked as he pulled his hands down towards the beloved handles at the side of his stomach and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi stroked his cock and stuck her tongue into his mouth. There they fought a war in each other's mouths. They went apart because Ryder lifted Lexi under the buttocks on her way to bed. Much heavier than expected but Scott is horny as hell. He probably thought Lexi wanted a simple passionate sex like Pebee in her weightless room.<br>\r\nBack to the present, Lexi's blue soft body lay beneath the rudder with her legs around his waist, she stroked his massive back muscles when he lowered himself on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody said anything... both panted so strongly of kissing and hugging. Both was so fucking horny so no one thought of a condom or such. Lexi just wanted him in her, so powerful now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott lowered his penis and started pumping, both cheering in the joy of sex, this was not Lexi's first time, but never had such a feeling, overheated after 10 seconds into their intercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caressed her breast and then came the feeling!<br>\r\n\"Lexi! I'm cumming!\" said scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay !, I want you in me!

Thought Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you love me!\" Said Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!!!!\" Said Lexi, \"please I want you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U Sure !? You Can Get Pregnant, Do You Want Children With Me?\" Shouted Ryder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Please, now scott, I can't hold myself more\" screaming Lexi<br>\r\n when she pushed Ryder down into her Womb with her biotic powers reinforced by her weight gain that pulled Ryder even further down to her womb were he ejeculated his seed inside her. He fell on top of Lexi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no she wasn't finished, they switched position so Lexi rides Scott's cock up and down. Her dull hang breasts were gripped by Rider's hands for waving them in the air. She emptied him on more cum in her when she finally collapsed on Scott with his penis in her still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott I love you\" said Lexi.<br>\r\n\"Love you to\" said scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so good looking with these extra pounds!\" said Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", Lexi said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, they didn't just look gigantic, they WERE gigantic. She could feel them rubbing together as she shifted her weight around. Lexi kept herself moving, jiggling her tits around as much as possible. She laughed a lot, making her tits bounce as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe took a piece of ice cream cake, a piece of cheesecake, or a fairly large sundae. from the kitchen. <br>\r\nLexi ate.<br>\r\nHer stomach was packed tight,and it was starting to hurt. Lexis stomach hurt, but it felt so good! As much as it was hurting her to eat, the ice cream was SO sweet and SO delicious, she just couldn't bring herself to stop. It hurt, but it was worth it to her.  Finally she got down to the bottom of the bowl. She tipped it up and slurped out the last bit of melted ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she'd finished, it was time to go home. She took a few minutes to recover from what she'd just done. She felt so good. Pain, but a good kind of pain, a satisfied kind of pain. Lexi rubbed her stomach, trying to ease the pressure, but to no avail. She had eaten too much. The drug was earing of, but Lexis newly founded love for Ryder wont let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked about seven months pregnant with food.

First she thought that one of the previous workers might forget their chocolates, but she found note as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For my lovely co-worker Sid\", it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst being little bit puzzled about origin of the chocolate box, but free chocolate is always good, unless it's poisoned, Sid thought herself. She opened the box and pick one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palaven's Berry Mix. I haven't taste this flavor in years\", she said and take a bite of it.

Several hours later, her shift was over and she was allowed to leave. Without noticing two persons were watching her. One was pleased, the other was little bit frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid decided to go her apartment and have small chat with Vetra with Omni-tool.
