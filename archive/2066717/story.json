It was a good life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he was taken by men of science and everything changed. Porkchop hadn't the foggiest clue what they had planned, but he couldn't shake the feeling that their plans were big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the one?\" said one of the scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\" said another. \"He's going to be our first subject for the trial\". There seemed to be a hint of excitement in his voice, but Porkchop didn't know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still say that this is wrong- turning animals into monsters so they can fight our battles for us\" a third man said, his brow furrowed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come off it, Johnson\" said the second man. Reaching for a tape recorder, he began to speak into it. \"Dr. Philip Hansel, reporting on United States Government secret experiment #120- Code Name: Project Guardian. Our first test subject- Porkchop, a bulldog -has been thoroughly screened and is in good health- mental and physical alike. Introducing the transformative agent now\". It was here that Dr. Hansel poured a packet of green substance into Porkchop's bowl of water. Curious, Porkchop sniffed it, a hint of worry tugging in his mind. Just before drinking some of it (as nothing seemed to happen), Porkchop heard someone say \"We're rolling now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the changes began. Barking in shock once, Porkchop slumped over, a strange feeling coursing through his body. Looking down, he saw his forelegs began to alter in bone structure, becoming humanoid. Sheer terror was flowing through his mind- what were these humans doing to him?! All the while, Dr. Hansel narrated over the recorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The transformative agent is taking effect stupendously! Bone alteration is apparent, though there seems to be no physical pain from the subject. I can only begin to imagine how his brain is developing right now... Likewise, in terms of development, our subject has reached a more humanoid form\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Porkchop found the scientist was right- he was still a dog, but had a human body structure! Shakily getting up on two legs, he found his whole form was like a bulldog and human had fused together. It was strange, and yet... Porkchop couldn't help but feel that something else was building in his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstounded, the entire band of scientists stared in absolute wonder at what they had done. Dr. Hansel was the one who seemed most excited- he was positively beaming. \"The transformation is complete- it seems we are successful. Now, to see if we can get out a reaction...\". Stopping for a moment, the doctor stepped closer and said \"Hello, Porkchop- how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess...\" said Porkchop... before he covered his muzzle in shock. He had just spoken English and, judging from the scientists' expressions, they had understood him. They were congratulating each other, shaking hands and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done it, Doc\" said one of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correction- WE'VE done it\" said Dr. Hansel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Doctor...\" said Johnson, who seemed to have made a shocking discovery concerning the packet from before- his tone and shocked expression said enough to Porkchop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Johnson\" said Dr. Hansel with a dismissive wave of his hand. \"We've made history with this application\". Rubbing his hands together with glee, Hansel said \"So, Porkchop, anything new that you're feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating for a second, Porkchop said \"Well, this new body is definitely going to take some getting used to...\". Looking down, his new intellect told him he was nude. Covering his privates, he added \"Is it too much to ask for a little common decency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hansel said \"Fair enough\". Giving a quick clap of his hands, Hansel brought a basic outfit to Porkchop- shirt, pants, underwear and socks (all custom-built for a dog). It seemed the U.S. had created their first humanoid animal warrior... But they were unaware that there was a major mistake in their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we need to contain that... thing now!\" said Johnson, clear panic in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion etched onto his face, Dr. Hansel said \"What's gotten into you, Johnson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith fear spreading through his soul, Johnson said \"We screwed up big-time! You gave him the Alpha formula- we were supposed to give him the Beta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA collective gasp of worry spread through the scientists gathered. Half of them looked with fear at a table where several packets had been lined up, whilst the other half could only stare in shock at Porkchop and the extremely nervous Dr. Hansel. \"But that can only mean... Oh, good God\" muttered Dr. Hansel, who sank to his knees in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPorkchop may have had new intelligence, but he didn't understand- what was the Alpha package? Was that why he felt some peculiar power pulsing through him? Curious, he went over to a nearby table and grabbed it... effortlessly lifting it with his pinkie finger, while it would've taken a few men to move it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientists were surprised- the Alpha package, which contained one Lot of the super soldier formula- U.S. secret experiment #13 -mixed in and the powers were already showing up. Some scientists present felt they had done good- but Johnson was sure they made a monster... which explained the rifle he brought back into the room with him. Lifting it and aiming for Porkchop's heart, he said \"Nighty night, boy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hansel had recovered by this point and, fearing for Porkchop's well-being, tried to intervene. \"No!\" he shouted, but the gun fired, the bullet flew straight for Porkchop... and bounced right off him like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the bullet on the floor, then up at the scientists, Porkchop raised an eyebrow before saying \"Was that supposed to hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Johnson was worried about this, he should've been more concerned about Dr. Hansel, who was unimpressed with his aide's poor reaction. \"Are you out of your mind?!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnson shouted right back, saying \"That thing could go rogue! With powers like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Porkchop isn't an \"it\"; besides, he hasn't done anything wrong!\" countered Hansel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis point was immediately retracted when a loud CRASH was heard. Turning to the source, Hansel saw that Porkchop had thrown the table at a wall and (afterwards) ran through it. He really was invulnerable. The downside, however, was that he was on the loose, in the nearby city, and his creators had caught the whole thing on camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are SO fired\" muttered someone in the crowd.<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *********************************************<br>\r\nOut at the edge of the city, Porkchop found himself in complete rapture- he was humanoid, he was free... but he didn't know what to do now. His new form brought new complications, it seemed. What could he do?</span></div></div>",

The Madame had only recently finished one of her shows when the terrible news came- she had cancer. Mary-Ann didn't quite understand what that meant (she was a bird, after all), but she knew something had changed with her mistress. Her beloved friend- the one who had once been so full of life -began to wither. Her smiles were few, her skin seemed to lose all its color and a sickly cough seemed to take her over. One day, she had someone come over to make a \"will\"; this seemed to be a major turning point for the Madame, as she decided to impart something to her pet... no, to her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dearest Mary\" said the Madame \"I am sorry to say that my time is short; soon, I will be gone\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary-Ann definitely understood that, tweeting a massive storm of chirps that, loosely translated, would've meant \"No, it can't be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a sad chuckle, the Madame said \"Somehow, I knew that you'd say that\". Sighing, she opened Mary's cage and took her in hand. \"My beloved confidant, it seems like only yesterday that I brought you into my life- a fair voice to match mine. Sadly, it seems that our time together was far shorter than I can admit...\". She paused for a moment, as if lost in thought, before continuing. \"Don't worry too much for me; I've found a new home for you, and they're going to take good care of you. My only regret is that I had no family to enjoy you with\". Speaking thusly, she returned Mary to her cage and left to speak of her will. This went on for a while, stopping only when the darkness of the night settled in. The sky was littered with stars that night, but they all had seemed to dim in the presence of the dark news. Mary-Ann was scared- would life truly be the same for her? Trying to ignore these thoughts, she gazed outside and spotted a shooting star. Strange as it is, she decided to wish upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a normal night in the central park zoo and all the animals were slumbering away. All except for one that was rising out of the water in her exhibit. This animal was Janine, the zoo's 11ft long 4-ton hippopotamus. The behemoth lumbered about and let out a bellow, showing her large open mouth of sharp teeth. This invited the ox-pecker she shared her exhibit with to pick her teeth. The hippopotamus grunted as she let her roommate pick her teeth. But then she heard Herman, the baboon in the nearby cage, let out a shriek and turned her head, nearly swallowing her tick bird friend right before she saw something coming down from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanine looked up and saw a fire burning in the sky that was coming down closer. All the animals were clamoring as the flames came down. A meteor was heading for the zoo and it was breaking apart. As it came closer to the ground, the rock of burning fire was heading for Janine's exhibit. At this point, it shrunk to the size of a basketball and landed in the water, startling the ox-pecker who flew to the top of a large rock. Janine's small beady eyes scanned the water and saw that the rock of fire didn't burn out. Out of curiosity, the large hippopotamus walked towards the water and submerged herself. The enormous beast made her way up to the meteorite and grunted. Out of curiosity, the hippo bit the piece of meteor rock and then grunted and twitched in the water, shaking it and making it bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething came over the massive creature. The gray-skinned beast was undergoing a strange transformation. Her body shifted and as she surfaced from the water, she was standing (or more accurately floating) on two legs instead of four. Her front two legs had become a pair of hands and her already obese body became more curvy and she grew a pair of human-like breasts. Finally, long bright orange-red hair grew from her head and reached all the way to her bench-sized butt and covered one of her eyes. The ox-pecker chirped as it flew over the hippopotamus woman. Janine came out of the water and looked at her hands in shock before she held up her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?!\" yelled the now-anthropomorphic hippopotamus. \"OMG! I just talked like a human!\" The ox-pecker flew on Janine's shoulder and tweeted. \"I don't know what you just said,\" said the 11ft tall and 4-ton hippo woman. \"But if it has something to do with that rock of fire, I agree. Well, thank goodness it didn't land in the crocodile cage. I hate those guys.\" Janine then realized something. She was now tall enough to reach the boundaries of her exhibit and climb out. She then flexed her obese body and stretched her flabby arms and legs. \"Oh yes. It's good to be free. Perhaps there could be a benefit to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Janine gasped and covered her private areas. \"Good grief!\" she yelled. \"I'm naked!\" Janine ran for the Central Park Zoo gift shop and upon realizing the door was locked, she simply hip-checked it off the hinges. \"If I'm going to walk and talk like a human, I need clothes. Humans don't go walking around naked.\" Janine's ox-pecker chirped as the hippopotamus woman walked to the part of the gift store that sold T-shirts. She held up the shirts to her fat body and grunted. \"Damn it! Does \"one size fit all\" mean anything to these humans?\" Eventually Janine found a T-shirt at least close to her size. It was a red t-shirt with an image of an eagle on it. It was so tight on her that it looked tattooed on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Janine. \"Now, all I have to do is cover myself from the waist down. Oh come on! Don't they sell any pants.\" Janine then spotted several souvenir pajamas and grabbed a pair of blue-colored pair of pajama pants with tree-frogs all over them. The hippopotamus had to stretch them out in order to get them to fit on her massive booty and they even opened up at the seams, barely keeping from being ripped apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanine grunted and then let out a sigh as her tick bird stood on her shoulder. \"Well,\" said Janine as she flipped her red hair and stroked her ox-pecker. \"I guess I better start living like a human.\" The hippopotamus walked towards the zoo exit, her massive size and weight making the entire zoo shake with her footprints. The animals in the zoo looked and spotted Janine as the enormous hippo shook her pajama-covered booty and walked to the zoo exit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Janine walked out of the zoo with her ox-pecker on her shoulder. The bird picked at the hippopotamus woman's new red hair and made her grunt. \"Be careful with that,\" said the enormous gray lady. \"I'm just getting used to having hair. And it's such beautiful red hair too. Personally, I always pictured that I'd be a blonde.\" The hippopotamus walked down the street as she looked around to see New York. It was dark so she didn't have to alarm anybody with her clearly abnormal appearance. She waddled in front of a closed clothing store and then looked in the window at the display dummies and bit her lip. What alarmed her was how skinny they were, the the point where the dummies looked skeletal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\" asked the mutated hippo. \"Why would anybody want to be that skinny. The only way any beast can be <i>that</i> thin is by starving themselves to near death.\" Janine's ox-pecker chirped in agreement. As Janine was looking in the window, a couple of women who looked like supermodels spotted her and let out a laugh. \"Look at that blimp,\" said the blonde girl. \"She's enormous.\" \"I wonder how long until those pants come flying off,\" said the blonde's raven haired friend. \"I'll bet that she can't even see her toes.\" The mean girls let out a laugh as Janine gave a snort. \"That redhead is so fat,\" said the blonde. \"I'd almost mistake her for a hippopotamus.\" Janine saw the girls walking away laughing and gave a snort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two say \"hippopotamus\" as if it's an insult. They clearly don't know that we kill more of them a year than lions. Guess some humans are just rude.\" The ox-pecker chirped as Janine went on her way. As she did, the hippopotamus felt her stomach roaring. \"I'm starving. Hmmm, I can't wait for the zookeepers to feed me anymore. That reminds me, I can't quite return to the zoo in this condition. Hmm, I need a place to live.\" Janine's stomach rumbled again. \"But first I need something to eat.\" The hippo lady looked around and muttered in frustration. \"What is wrong with this city? There isn't anything to graze on for miles. There's got to be something to eat around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippopotamus lady then spotted a pizza delivery boy on a moped drive by recklessly as he was listening to his headphones. The delivery boy drove his moped so haphazardly that one of the pizzas he was carrying fell out the back and the box landed at Janine's feet. Janine picked up the box and called to the boy. \"Excuse me! Excuse me! You dropped your.... whatever this is?\" Janine then looked at the writing on the pizza box and squinted her eyes. \"What is this written on here? I wish I could read. Well, since he hasn't come back for it, it must not be important.\" Janine opened the box and she saw a pepperoni pizza inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked out a slice of the pizza and looked in confusion. \"What is this?\" asked Janine. \"Is this food?\" The ox-pecker chirped as Janine looked at the pepperoni. \"What are these red things stuck to it?\" Janine sniffed the pepperoni and grunted. \"It's meat,\" she said. \"Well, I'm hungry enough. Normally we hippos don't eat meat or insects but if there's nothing else, we can't afford to be picky. Bottoms up.\" Janine bit into the pizza and chewed on it as she grunted. She was clearly enjoying the slice. She sat down on a bench, her big booty spilling out the sides due to being bigger than the bench, and enjoyed her meal. She even picked out some pieces of pepperoni for her ox-pecker before she finished the pizza. Because she didn't know better, Janine ate the box as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her meal was over, the 11ft hippo rubbed her enormous stomach and then let out a loud belch. \"That was delicious,\" said Janine. \"Well, now that I have something in my stomach, let's do something about our living situation. There's got to be some place for us.\" Janine spotted an apartment building and squinted her beady eyes as the redheaded hippo spotted an apartment building. \"Bingo.\" The hippo waddled to the apartment building. She gave a smile because it looked like she had found a new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanine walked in and saw a Japanese landlord hanging a photograph on the wall. \"Excuse me,\" said Janine. \"Do you have any vacancy?\" The landlord saw Janine's shadow on him and realized he was dealing with a potential tenant who was twice his size. He didn't know Janine was a hippopotamus at the time but he gulped because there was no way he'd refuse lodging to someone who utterly dwarfed him. \"That's right, ma'am,\" said the landlord. \"This is the Blue Kite apartment building. Just so you know, the rent is $150 a month.\" \"Rent?\" asked Janine in confusion. \"What's rent?\" The landlord gave a look of befuddlement. \"You're kidding? Where were you living before.\" Janine let out a grunt. \"Well, I lived in Africa when I was a calf but I was taken here a few years ago and I've been living at the Central Park Zoo ever since.\" \"Zoo?\" asked the landlord. \"N-Never mind. I'm going to need your name.\" \"Janine.\" \"And your last name?\" Janine blinked her eyes. \"I don't... have one.\" \"Huh!?\" \"The only name I have is the name the zookeepers gave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landlord decided to get a good look at his new tenant and as he turned around, he let out a scream at the anthropomorphic hippopotamus standing in front of him. Janine just looked in confusion. \"Are you alright?\" she asked. \"Don't worry. I'm not going to eat you. I just had... something yellow with meat stuck to it.\" The landlord looked up in pure fear but was too afraid to tell Janine he wouldn't rent to a hippo and he gave her the key to the room down the hall. Janine smiled and she and her bird walked down the hallway, causing the floorboards to crack under her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landlord ran to his phone to call the police. \"Hello,\" he said. \"Police. There's a hippopotamus in my boarding house. She told me she wanted to rent a room. No, I'm not drunk! She was an 11 foot tall hippo with bright red hair and an ox-pecker on her shoulder! Hello! They hung up!\" Janine had settled into her apartment and saw an easy chair in front of a television. She sat down on the chair and it was flattened into an ottoman under her large rear. The ox-pecker gave a chirp as Janine smiled. \"Well,\" she said. \"It's not going to be easy adapting to human society, but I think I'll manage. Now, what to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's the hippo's next course of action?</span></div></div>",

This is a redo of my first interactive story on Writing.com that I did a long time age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a story of animals turning into anthropomorphic beings. They are bipedal, have hands with opposable thumbs, etc. They also keep most of their bestial features and traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start out with a scenario with an animal and a cause of transformation. Where the story goes from there is up to you. You can even add more scenarios if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. No sexual content.<br>\r\n2. No killing or gore.<br>\r\n3. Proper spelling and grammer.<br>\r\n4. Please have a basic understanding of the animal if you want to use it.<br>\r\n5. No TG.<br>\r\n6. No mammary glands on non-mammal anthros.<br>\r\n7. No Macro or Micro. The animal can grow and shrink during their transformations but only between their original size and human size. Some might not change size at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun.</td>",
