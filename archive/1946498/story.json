Behind him, a tidal-wave of neon pink acid was flooding the path backwards, destroying everything in it's wake. In front of him; deadly lasers, nasty badniks, and even razor sharp axes swinging like pendulums from the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Huh, Eggman's gone all out to get me this time\"</i> Sonic thought amused, <i>\"this was almost difficult!\" </i> He chuckled to himself as he clenched the Purple Chaos Emerald he'd just stolen a little tighter, curling into a ball and leaping across a spike filled chasm. Bouncing off the walls and a few conveniently placed pipes he reached the other side with ease, but landed with only the tips of his shoes on the edge. Sonic flailed about about wildly for a second, practically tipping backwards into the pit before regaining his balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" -bizzt- Don't get too cocky out there Sonic!\" Tails radioed in on his intercom. Sonic grinned sheepishly, glad his lil orange buddy hadn't just seen him nearly fall to his death. \"You're still in first place, but Shadow and Knuckles are almost finished with their missions too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah,\" Sonic relayed back dismissively as he dashed off to find the exit again, \"I'll be out of here with time for lunch before those jokers even get close to the finish line. You're still in position with the Tornado right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-heh... I will be in a few minutes Sonic, I've had to deal with a few of Eggman's rocket attacks interrupting my flight plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, I don't have a few minutes Tails!\" Sonic yelled into his ear-piece angrily. As if on cue sirens wailed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Two Minutes To Detonation</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic rolled his eyes as he approached a flight of stairs, leaping on the railing and speeding down, ocean of burning pink water hot on his trail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well make time,\" Tails yelled back, he sounded distracted, as if he was currently preoccupied with his own aerial feats of avoiding Eggman's forces, \"take the south exit, my schematics show that leads to the clearest opening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do,\" Sonic replied, taking a hard left and jumping through a open ventilation pipe, \"the south is all submerged in Eggman's funky cherry soda. I'll have to take the west exit, now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha, but I'll never make there it in time?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll improvise!\" the hedgehog remarked back, cutting the feed before Tails could try to reason with him. Sonic spiraled down the metal shaft until he reached a suitable opening, a manufacturing plant with large machinery pumping out who knows what, probably some kind of weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed on a conveyer belt suspended over burning hot wires, the fizzing rushing sound of acidic water right behind him. Running against the flow, Sonic ducked under buzzing saws and leaped over drills, carefully weaving between crushing slabs that turned piles of metal into flat discs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>One Minute To Detonation</i></b> a voice chimed. And Sonic actually began to sweat a little as he looked for a clear way out. At the end of the tract was a truck-bucket loaded with pointy scrap metal ready for processing, Sonic leaped over the metal container and luckily found his exit, a loading bay door, looking out over the sheer 1,000 foot drop that the base was situated over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic grabbed a large plank of the discarded scrap material littered across the bay as he raced towards his escape. Leaping out of hanger doors right as a torrent of pink acid gushed out behind him, followed by a loud <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>KABOOM</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nas another of Eggman's bases started to explode into nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain-top base was destroying itself and Sonic was sliding down the slope cheering himself for another decisive victory. But he wasn't out of the danger zone yet, as burning chunks of metal shot out across the countryside and an avalanche of snow threatened to crush him if he slowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding his scrap metal board he deftly maneuvered between pine trees and rocks, sailing down a bordering-on vertical decent. He re-enabled his intercom, immediately a loud \" -krssh- <b>-ONIC!</b>!\" blasted his ear, a panicked Tails called out. Sonic almost felt a little bad for scaring the fox, but he should have been used to his antics by now. \"Haha, hey Tails, missed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?... Sonic where are you!?\" Tails shot back, clearly sounding relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm descending down the mountain right now since my flight was late\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter, I'm still well ahead of Shadow and Knux, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, yeah, if you can make it back on time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll be faster on foot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmph, we'll see. Knuckles is still dealing with Pumkin Hill Zone, but Shadow already has the Blue Chaos Emerald. It's going to be a tighter race than we thought.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not likely.\" Sonic replied, and with a smirk and a burst of speed fled down the mountain leaving a blue blur behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later Sonic was approaching the train station in Station Square, the finishing line his group had decided on earlier, and as Sonic suspected it appeared he was here first. Slowing down to a casual stroll, only a few more steps til he won the bet, Sonic wanted to savor this victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Chaos Control!\" </b> There was a flash of light, and before him stood the red and black speedster himself, Shadow the Hedgehog. Shadow just stood before the shocked blue hedgehog, his stoic expression hiding his feelings, his eyes only slightly revealing how pleased he was having apparently beaten his rival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... what... no... That's cheating!!\" Sonic decried, throwing his gem on the ground in protest, his cheeks going red with a mix of frustration and embarrassment. <br>\r\n\"By any means necessary you said\" Shadow replied coldly, catching the emerald in hand as it bounced across the pavement. \"T-that's not what I meant you jerk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because you didn't think of it. Fair's fair Sonic and I beat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was about to shout something vulgar, but he was interrupted by the sound of a bad plane landing, \"...Argh, I hope Tail's didn't chip the Tornado's paint again...\" said Sonic, his new foul mood making him more concerned about his plane's fate than Tails safety, not that he believe their was any real risk of hurt anyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hedgehogs rushed over to Emerald Coast to check out the damage, on the shore-line an orange two-tailed fox was crawling out of a smoking crash. \"Augh, s-sorry Sonic. The engine started to fail\" he defended meekly, pulling some pilot goggles off from his face as he scrambled up to the pair, a little dusty but okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some mechanic you turned out to be, can't even keep my plane in the air... and so slow, imagine if I'd left with you, Shadow might have <i>legitimately</i> beaten me.\" Sonic huffed, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails pouted, and looked like he might tear up, \"I couldn't help it! A-a screw was loose and we were low on gas and...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't mind Sonic,\" Shadow cut off, \"he's just taking it out on you cause he's being a sore loser.\"<br>\r\n\"...Oh, ah! So you won Shadow?\" Tails said, a bit comforted by his words, \"So I guess you'll get to decide where we'll eat tonight, do you have any plans?\"<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact I -\"<br>\r\nShadow was cut off by a frustrated grunt that could come from nobody but their friend, the red echidna Knuckles. \"Figure's you two would get the easier assignments.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Quit your whining, at least I beat Sonic, that's all we cared about\" Shadow replied, Sonic muttered something about him being a cheater and a faker but everyone ignored him.<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Knuckle's said, perking up, \"Good job Shad, I couldn't stand to spend another night at the chilli dog stand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold your horses, Knuckles, what if I want to go there too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh, what is it with you hedgehogs and terrible hot dogs? Do you even know what they're made of?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, don't worry, I had something else in mind...\"</span></div></div>",

Tails nervously kept jabbing his elbow into Sonic's shoulder trying to prevent him from laughing. \"I know what you're going to say hedgehog so out with it\" Shadow frowned crossing his arms. Thankfully it was Knuckles who spoke up first.<br>\r\n\"Shadow what's with the stupid apron?\" He asked pointing to the bright pink apron the black hedgehog was wearing.<br>\r\n\"It's Rouge's alright... It's the only one I have\" he frowned, the group had gone to Shadow's dwelling with the promise of good food. Needless to say Sonic had been pestering the other hedgehog the entire way about making chilidogs.<br>\r\n\"I've been learning how to cook and need to see how far I've come\" he explained the other three looking at him curiously.<br>\r\n\"Sounds great Shadow, thank you very much\" Tails smiled earnestly earning a Humph from the black hedgehog. He turned back to the kitchen and tried to cook lunch, keyword tried. Sonic wouldn't stop running over trying to swipe ingredients only to get smacked with whatever tool shadow had on hand. Knuckles wouldn't shut up about what every last ingredient was and why Shadow was adding it. His only solace was that two tailed fox had the courtesy to sit at the table and wait, his ears and tails twitching in time with his nose as he sniffed the air enjoying the pleasing aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh shadow I thought you were making lunch?\" Sonic asked poking and prodding  the dish before him.<br>\r\n\"I did, I made actual food instead of that abomination you call chili dogs\" his reply was blunt and curt.<br>\r\n\"Aww come on shads chili dogs cover all the important food groups\" he exclaimed while Tails rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Sonic it's just tortellini... fancy pasta\" Tails explained after noticing the lost expression on his two friends faces.<br>\r\n\"Well I'd prefer something simple not this fancy junk\" knuckles mumbled poking at his lunch. Shadow huffed knowing he wasn't going to get much feed back on his dish from anyone other than the Fox who seemed to enjoy the dish with a rather gluttonous gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on shadow make something good\" Sonic grinned prodding  black hedgehogs shoulder. The blue hedgehog didn't even bother trying his lunch passing it off to his little bro, Knuckles soon following suite. \"You know I need my daily dose of chili, you don't want me to faint do you?\"<br>\r\n\"Want me to answer that honestly?\" The dark hedgehog growled narrowing red eyes.<br>\r\n\"Hey stop it you two Urrp\" Tails tried to interrupt unfortunately after having three large dishes of tortellini he was quite full and bloated his flat white belly distended and looks  like he had swallowed a basketball. \"You should be thanking Shadow for at least trying to make something new and delicious\" he continued to scold.<br>\r\n\"Sorry little bro but you know me I've got a specific diet to follow and unless Mr grumpypants wants to cook that then we'll just have to go where I want\" he smirked triumphantly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a darkened lair, only illuminated by the dim glow of computer panels, a figure fumed with vexation, stomping back and forth in a circular motion like he was trying to cut a hole through the floor with his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Ivo Robotnik, known as Eggman to most, was trying his very hardest not to explode into a angry tantrum as he was informed of today's casualties. His fists were shaking as the long list of resources, weapons and chaos emeralds wasted were read out to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of the futuristic room a regiment of robotic henchmen stood, whispering to each other and trying to avoid the attention of the enraged doctor. A green mole and metal chicken stood out from the crowd, joking and arguing with each other louder than any dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Bah</b>!\" Eggman shouted, \"A thousand badniks and a thousand traps, and not a scratch on him! Worthless! You're all unfit to be called my creations!\" He slammed his firsts down on the control panel below him, shutting off the information screen, casting the room in a blue glow as error screens popped up all across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a snigger from the crowd, and Dr. Robotnik swiveled in the direction from where it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, one of you thinks that's funny, do you?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe regiment of henchmen stood stiff and unblinking, like deer caught in the headlights with Eggman's sinister glare on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, out with it. I want to know what's so funny. Which one you you thought that was funny?\" A sick, almost gleeful grin was spread across his face as he talked, but the crowd remained motionless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Oh, silent now? Alright, you miserable lot of bolts and scrap-metal, if you don't tell me who was having a chuckle in the next five seconds I'm going to send all you down the incinerator!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a frantic second there was about twenty robotic hands all pointing to the mole and chicken, Scratch and Grounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman stomped up to the pair of robots, now shaking with fear, and looked them over with curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... you! Rooster-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name is Scratch sir - eep!\" the chicken cut off as Eggman lean forward, threatening with his eyes not to interrupt again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, pray tell, what was it that was so <b>funny</b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...i-i-I... it was Grounder here sir, he was laughing... sir!\" Scratch said shifting the blame to his associate. The green digger robot's face almost went white if that was possible as Dr. Eggman glanced down toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, no fair! It was Scratch here who told the joke!\" Grounder replied, trying to shift the blame right back. With his left arm he knocked the rooster, who stuck right back, and in a instant they were both in a small fist fight, until Eggman lost his patience with the two morons and yelled, \"<b>Silence</b>!\" Grabbing them both by the head and slamming them into each other, knocking both down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman stood over the chicken, \"Now, would you please tell me about this little joke of yours? I'm always in the mood for a laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch was sweating bullets as he looked at his scared reflection in the boss' black glasses, \"I.. uh... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just saying uh... just saying how... it was ironic we were unfit to be made by you when, um, cause you're so.... <b>fat</b>!\" Scratch blurted out, as if he could say it quickly enough it his boss might not hear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman raised an eyebrow at the comment, pausing for a moment as if in deep contemplation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stupid robots hugged each other, dreading the punishment they were about to receive for badmouthing the boss while he was pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Eggman finally replied,  \"Ha-HA! You're RIGHT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire room was confused, especially the two dumb-bots who had expected Dr. Eggman was about to drag them off to the the room where they crush things into little cubes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about this all wrong! My problem with Sonic and his furry pals, all this time I've been trying to built robots good enough to beat biological specimens in perfect physical condition! How utterly foolish, when all along I should have been trying to weaken that blasted hedgehog! Only then then, when he's more unfit than me.. er, my robots will he fail!\" boldly declared Dr. Eggman, who broke out into a fit of evil laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch and Grounder looked on bewildered, but slowly began to relax and actually started to join in with the evil laughter, \"Bwa-haha-ha-HAA, that's a brilliant idea oh genius master sir, but uh, how do you plan on do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman chuckled darkly, and looked down at the robot rooster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little time later, in Dr. Eggman's personal lab, Scratch was strapped to a large metal table with lots of nasty looking lasers and sharp medical implements pointed at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry...\" the chicken feebly croaked out, but the doctor simply ignored him as he went about pressing buttons and flipping switches. Grounder was watching from the side-lines, spared from the punishment but still worried for his friend. A short while later Eggman stopped and faced his captive audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope my <i>volunteer</i> is feeling comfortable...\" Eggman spoke with a sly grin, and Scratch weakly tugged on the tight bonds keeping him on the table, \"heh, I know you must be feeling honored - being the first ever test subject for my latest creation - but I assure you, if this fails and you die horribly, we can always try again on you little friend here\" he indicated to Grounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, uh, w-what is this operation supposed to do again?\" Grounder asked meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good question, Part One, the easy part, <b>DE-robotization!</b>\" Dr. Eggman roared as he pulled a large blue switch. A thunderous boom reverberated around the room as a flurry or lasers fired on the helpless robot chicken. A flash of blinding light filled the room, and light the smell of smoke filled the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a minute went by until it suddenly stopped, and what was left on the table was... Scratch, seemingly unchanged. \"Wha? I'm alive! I'm alive!\" the idiot cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you've ever been\" Eggman declared, and walked up to the table. \"w-What do ya mean?\" Scratch asked wearily, and Dr. Eggman simply poked Scratch in the chest, then plucked out a small grey feather. \"100% flesh and bones\" Eggman muttered with a bit of disdain, \"not hardly as good as nice clean metal... but it suits you\" he sneered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch gulped, it was true, he could feel it, he could even see his heartbeat faintly pumping up and down in his chest. Scratch almost passed out from the shock, but Eggman slapped him, knocking him to his senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for Part Two, and who better to test this on than our resident expert on <i>fat jokes</i>...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robotnik walked back to his control panel. He gripped a second, red switch directly next to the blue one. He pulled it without a second thought in his twisted mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch however, had no idea that the scariest looking gun was going to position itself directly in front of him and emit a red laser to aim its shot. The pointer laser was directed right at his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whirring sound was heard, followed by an electric, motor sound. The gun visibly began vibrating from it's robotic arm holding it in position. Then, a huge beam of yellow/green, crackling light shot from the tip and hit Scratch dead on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was essentially being electrocuted by the projectile, but now that he had a beating heart, he was afraid it'd stop from this blast. It lasted a good ten seconds before Eggman switched it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch was breathing heavily from exhaustion. He wasn't used to this, alive stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman pressed a small, black button on his control panel. The back of the metal he was lying on receded into the ground and his restraints took over. On his wrists and ankles, they pulled him upright and into a spread eagle position with his right side facing Eggman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it, he doesn't look any different\" Grounder commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3, 2, 1\" Eggman counted down confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the number one came out of his mouth, Scratch felt odd. This was definitely a feeling he'd never felt as a robot. He looked down at his stomach and saw it slowly widening, gaining more and more weight by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly went from stick thin, to a normal sized stomach, to a small gut, to a beer belly, to a spare tire up front, and onwards. But it wasn't just his belly growing outwards, his face was growing two soft, plushy cheeks around his beak, giving him a cutesy demeanor. His thighs grew chubbier and chunkier until they were as wide around as Eggman himself! His neck became non-existent as a ring of fat enveloped it completely, giving him a drooping double chin, his waddle extremely pronounced. His chest suddenly surged forwards into two large man-boobs that layed atop his massive gut, sticking out three and a half feet in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept surging out with fat waves of growth, his belly, moobs, neck, cheeks, and newly developed love handles as large as ever. But then, Scratch blushed heavily, extremely embarrassed as he felt an explosive BWOOMPH behind him. His rump had suddenly ballooned into a massively wide load. Each butt cheek looked like it was able to act as it's own source of gravity, being a dome two and a half feet wide in diameter. EACH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth seemed to stop when Scratch's ass grew into the behemoth it just became. He was still blushing madly at his newly acquired assflab he couldn't help but make obvious. He now had a very prominent pair of hips to go with that rear and he was thoroughly embarrassed by his backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman pressed a purple button and the robots holding his wrists and ankles let go. Scratch almost fell over with the sudden fall. The hitting of the ground had sent a jiggling all throughout his frame. He tried to waddle to Eggman, but couldn't walk any other way than having to sway his hips back and forth with his waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he waddled to Eggman, his ass swayed back and forth, side to side with each step, his feminine (and freaking fat) hips doing the same, making him feel ridiculous.

Luckily, it was all covered by his monstrous belly fat which was four feet in front of him currently and was wobbling violently with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally reached taking distance from Eggman, the evil doctor looked over his doings and the embarrassed (and enlarged) look on his face and...</span></div></div>",

But it is not set in any specific canon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Only males gain weight, females can appear in the story but do not gain <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- All chapters must be of a reasonable length and decent spelling quality. (So basically no one line chapters 'kay)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- All characters are aged up to at least 18 - 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You may include sex/adult activity in the story if you wish, this is an adult story after-all, but it's by no means necessary for every story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Weight Gain should remain the focus of this fic, though you may include some other tame kinks if you want, but please refrain from including more extreme kinks <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd remember, be interesting and descriptive, no one likes to read \"so he ate 8000 chilli dogs and gained a ton!\"</td>",
