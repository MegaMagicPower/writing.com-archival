After finding out how smooth it makes her hair feel, she continues using it without realizing the price of such until it's too late. At first, she just has some slightly canine urges, like wanting to chase after squirrels but soon she'll be chowing down on some tasty nibbles as her new tail wags back and forth.

Though as the days roll by and she still doesn't see the dog she grows a bit suspicious, not even noticing the canine changes her body and mind are undergoing throughout the week.

That was a fatal flaw, shown very obviously when she suddenly feels compelled to put the dog collar on during the night. By the end of the week, she might be cheering on her team with a more innocent love than before, and with a new tail and ears to boot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other</b><br>\r\nHow else could we make this theoretical teen into a man's most loyal companion?
