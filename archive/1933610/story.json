She was feeling a little uncomfortable for her belly was pressing against her shirt buttons. She was still stuffed from the breakfast she got at McDonald's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen had only had her job for a couple months. She was reluctant to get a job right out of college. Her new job required little work (just a little paperwork), and paid well. She was always curvy in high school, but gained at least 40 pounds in college, weighing about 180 pounds at her heaviest. She gave some effort to lose some weight during college but had little success. After college she lost the motivation and desire to stay fit, opting to just not face her weight issue. 'It's not like I'm huge, I'm just a little 'thick,' which isn't a big deal,' Jen thought to herself. Since starting her job she had gained almost 10 pounds in two months.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She went through the bag just in time for the morning meeting. Every morning the staff got together for a daily rundown of their branches tasks, they were just a one small branch of the nationwide company. Jen spent these meetings munching on doughnuts and sipping coffee. She said vary little, devoting most of her attention to the doughnuts. At the end of the meeting she took the extra box of donuts to her desk, there was always an extra box left over for some reason. She munched throughout the rest of the morning to lunch time. She got an hour and a half for lunch, which she spent at the large food court in her business complex. After lunch she went back to her cubicle to finish the days tasks. At the end of the day she drove back to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to work, the pounds piled on. She had to get new work clothes as her expanding stomach and bottom ripped her old clothes. The more she ate the bigger her appetite became. She avoided any chance of exertion. She parked as close to the lobby as possible and always took the elevator instead of the stairs. She was devoting more attention to eating than working. </span></div></div>",

Her pants weren\u2019t very cooperative either. \u201cI haven\u2019t put on that much weight, I must have shrunk my clothes.\u201d She had definitely not shrunk her clothes, she had just gotten incredibly fat. She got into her car to go to work. \u201cWhy are these cars made so small?\u201d She barely fit into the sedan. The first thing she did was got to the McDonald's drive through which was right next to her apartment building. She spatted out her large breakfast order, \u201ccan I get 20 hash browns, 3 egg mcmuffins, 2 mcgriddles, a breakfast burrito, and a large mcflurrie, please?\u201d Jen\u2019s stomach started to make noises, she was so hungry. She received the huge meal and went continued on her way to work. She demolished the food in the half an hour it took for her to arrive. She licked her fingers as she pulled into the taco bell drive through. Jen\u2019s routine now was to order another meal at the taco bell right next to her office for her to eat at her desk. She loosened her belt another notch before leaving her car. The walk from her car to the lobby elevator was tiring for Jen since she was so out of shape and had a considerable amount of weight to move. She had already started eating the Taco Bell by the time she got to her desk. Her wide and round butt bounced as she stepped. As she lowered her shifting bulk into her desk chair she realized that her wide hips barely squeezed past the armrests. She would need a new chair. She resumed eating when she sat down. When she finished her second breakfast, she reached into her desk and pulled a twinkie out of a drawer stashed with twinkies and ding-dongs. She moaned at the taste of her third twinkie, her gut pushing the limits of her shirt buttons, of course Jen could only feel this, she couldn\u2019t see anything past her large jiggling cleavage. Her gluttonous bliss was interrupted by the morning meeting. As she waddled down the hallway she cradled her swollen midsection which could be seen in between the buttons of her shirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, this work office day part-time paid shift for her was to be the last for this current week with this very day being a Wednesday out of every Monday and Wednesday. She could worry about things like her clothes for a nice good weekend later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna then got to attending to some nearby paperwork that required her signature, her opinions, her answers to questions, etc., all of which neither consisted of much nor took long at all, as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, Jenna went to getting herself some lunch from the nearby employees' commons area cafeteria with that lunch that she got consisting of huge quantities of huge amounts of \"lunch\" types of foods among goods like hot dogs, burgers, fries, etc., as well as \"sweet foods and pastry foods\", managing to get several times much more \"snacks\" among \"sweet foods and pastry foods\", \"etc\"., than she had earlier before her arrival to work from the start of her working at where she was working at back during day 1 of two months ago which was the start of it all for Jenna; including the types she managed to have eaten earlier during the morning of this current office day for Jenna combined with even several times much more quantities of even \"breakfast foods\" and more all of what she had been eating at all with it being all the way up to prior to her current office work day here as it was and is occurring at this point; each and every single one of all of which she had be brought to her office cubicle room to be placed on her office cubicle room office table desk that was both surprisingly still full of all of these foods and surprisingly yet somehow able to surprisingly be able to have more space amounts for all these being-added-food amounts, after which she then made a surprisingly for someone like Jenna quick trip back to make a \"delivery order\" of lots of more \"\"dessert \"foods\"\" than any of the foods she was currently having combined and also more of these and/or those \"\"dessert\" \"foods\"\" than any of the foods she was having before this current office day for her combined at all. Each of these orders were all the while made with one very inexpensive price being paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then upon her getting back to her office cubicle room that: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed a little more paperwork of the usual kind, which didn't take long for her to attend, after which she then ended up having those and/or these, along with the rest of the paperwork for this current office day for Jenna, end up all but be taken from her by a nearby duo composed of a female and male worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of that being completely done: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna then got to eating all of her earlier \"breakfast foods\" that she had eaten earlier before the aforementioned meeting that were several times as huge in amounts as they were before the described meeting, finishing them \"in a jiffy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, she got to \"lunch\" foods, all of which she also finished in a matter of seconds, after which her ordered \"desert foods\" arrived and were placed on her table, prompting her to tell the bringer of those foods to return to confirm her wish for more of the same orders of the same types she made earlier only with it all comprising of even several times much more huge in huge quantities of huge amounts than just recently and earlier at the same time while offering up the same very inexpensive money price payment amount, due to her already so insanely massively enormously massively hugely big appetite already increasing some more and some more in satisfaction desiring levels in the process of her recent eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese \"deliveries\" didn't take long and neither did their being placed on Jenna's table, with another one of the same money price payment amount offered up for more quantities of these orders only for that price being offered up in exchange for covering these \"food deliveries\" to be brought to her in a cycle that would last for up to through 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the last of Jenna's work day office hours of her part-time shifts all the way up to this current work office part-time shift day before she could leave for its end, with each of these \"food deliveries\" having more and more times the amounts of each and every single one of all of these foods than before and more and more times the amounts of each and every single one of all of these foods than each and every single one of the previous ones combined, along with several times much more of the aforementioned snack kinds of foods with the same things going for them, etc., much to the silent surprise of the individuals bringing these and/or those foods to her, respectively speaking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to eating those and/or these foods just recently brought to her and/or these foods just recently brought to her in a jiffy, followed by her eating all of her \"snack foods\" from earlier up to before and after the described meeting.</span></div></div>",

By the time Jack came back, the last of Jenna's ordered food deliveries had been brought to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had a part-time paid position like Jenna. He was very good-hearted as far as his reputation goes.<br>\r\nBut he was especially so to Jenna. The reason was that Jenna had once stood up for him in the last of their high school years, something Jack would never forget for complex reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to wait for it all to end after noticing that Jenna was eating. It didn't take long, but despite her appetite increasing some more, it happened to be that before she finished it all up, Jenna felt like really full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thus also took into account that she had a really round belly that was still struggling to contain itself behind her shirt, and yet despite her shirts struggled success, her belly not only could still be seen between its buttons, but also had gotten fatter than beyond comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, shirt, don't burst off on me before I leave.\" She mumbled in a tone of voice that made it sound like she begged it despite the quiet tone of voice she used as she mumbled these words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to literally eat up all these foods, but by the time she finished, not only was it a few minutes right in time for her to \"clock out\", but also, Jack was standing there with it being that luckily for Jenna, her \"shirt buttons\" didn't \"pop off\", yet Jenna's belly had gotten several times bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna never thought of herself as being able to have subsequently eaten so much, despite her appetite increasing some more, and as such, despite that, she was catching herself having a bit of a \"slight\" \"stomach ache\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted and groaned a brief bit only as she recovered from this, all the while rubbing her belly with both her hands, after which she simply just let the both of her hands remain being placed onto the top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter which, she went to a nearby device on her table to \"clock out\" while in her at that point increasingly getting strained wheeled-and-four-legged-and-armed office cubicle room chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got up, which took a bit of a struggle for her, she then saw a nearby mirror that caused her to quietly gasp at the sight of her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*phew* Thank goodness you haven't bursted off on me, shirt, but despite this: -<br>\r\n\"OH MY STINKING GOODNESS!\" Mumbled Jenna quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying these words, she quietly said: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look PREGNANT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then patted her round belly gently but also slightly sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jenna.\" Jack then said as he entered the room, his part time shift ending earlier than Jenna's and as such having \"clocked out\" earlier than Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped quietly again, then turning to see Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, you surprised me, Jack!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. As for why I haven't left yet: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is that science fiction/fantasy fiction genre movie that just came out, it's available in a 6:00 PM showtime at a movie theater nearby where we both live-as I understand it-and as such-I was just curious if maybe you would like to see it with me, after which we could then head to that inexpensive price-requiring-yet-still-fancy-all-that-anyone-can-eat buffet restaurant that I would just like to know if maybe you'd like to then head to with me. As a friend, of course.\" Jack said, with a slightly nervous tone to his voice combined with a slight red-colored blush to his voice. Despite his last few words, Jack found himself attracted to Jenna, secretly, of course. Also, both he and Jenna enjoyed things like \"sci-if\" and \"fantasy\" and others that didn't include \"horror and gore\" or ANY of that infernal nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna also had a slight red-colored blush to her face as she responded with the following words in an equally nervous tone of voice as she did and then asked the following question: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure, Jack. I don't see why not. Although, if you do drive, do you think you could pick me up for when we go to that movie and to dinner and then bring me back home afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was nervous because of what might happen if she were to have a \"clothing \"function\" \"problem\"\"-which she found herself feeling embarrassed by the idea of happening in front of Jack-even though-unbeknownst to Jenna-Jack didn't really mind-due to his attraction to Jenna being from her kindness to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I could do that for you anytime you ask me.\" Jack said, followed by Jenna blushing some more at how sweet Jack was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, see you in enough time before it all begins?\" Jenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jenna and Jack made it back home to their respective residential places.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even so, though, as fitting as they were, it was due to as tight as they were at the same time that she put them on with a struggle to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack managed to make it home to his residential place in order to have changed into long-sleeved shirt and non-shortened pants clothing of classy nature, picked up Jenna when it was time to, and they made in enough time it for the movie to start, which lasted two hours and fifty eight minutes. For this movie, Jenna bought lots of snacks for herself, including two extra large regular popcorns with lots of butter, while Jack simply got a medium regular popcorn with medium butter for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movie started, she got to eating her snacks.

You alright?\", Jack politely asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Jack. I'm just preoccupied. That's all.\" Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she blushed more red on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I feel <i>really</i> <i>embarrassed</i> by what you're seeing if me.\" Jenna then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry. No need to feel embarrassed in front of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Jenna asked as she blushed more red in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was having dinner with a good-mannered and good-hearted former fellow high school and since high school friend of hers among many a good-mannered and good-hearted as well as \"really \"good-looking\"\" gentleman in spirit, and yet, as she perceived it, she had been allowing herself, her appetite, her food cravings and everything else about her, etc., \"get \"the better of her\"\", leading her to be managing to have subsequently eaten so much that she was fatter than beyond comprehension at least as far as what and how some would consider it to be so, goes. And yet, not only did she perceive it to be that \"she should \"be\" \"embarrassed\"\" by all of this, but she did feel like this, yet she felt somehow warm by Jack's good manners, good heart and good personality. Though she decided she couldn't find time during high school or university to do anything about this, she secretly found herself attracted to Jacob because of his \"good looks\", yet most especially on top of those his intelligence, maturity, personality, etc., along with his good and kind heart, etc., and that partially contributed in secret to their friendship since high school and university. Despite these things she was feeling embarrassed about, Jack continued to be as polite, nice, etc., to her, as ever. She still kept both her hands on her engorged belly, as such, from out of embarrassment, etc..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't really care about \"the way you look currently\" or about whether or not \"you're being \"skinny\"\" or about whether or not \"you're \"no\"t being \"skinny\"\". As far as what my answer would be while if and when asked goes, you're still the same person I've known, etc., since we met, etc., and nothing can convince me otherwise.\" Jack stated plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted Jenna to feel embarrassed still and yet feel flattered and warmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, much to Jenna's increased red color from her blushing on her face while she was stroking and rubbing her belly, her belly began to growl again, as her appetite increased some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it's not too much to ask you this: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but do you think you could get me more plates of the foods I've been eating since we got here, increase their amounts in the process, get additional food types in the same amounts as earlier up to the amounts that I've recently had, increasing more of them in the process as you get me some more to eat and increase their amounts in servings, etc., repeating that amount of what I've asked you after every time I've eaten, etc., please? And all the while as much of it all as you can at that, please? All the while managing to have the same thing go for \"dessert foods\" and/or the like or them, etc., and most especially with them all the while and increasing especially their amounts at that, please? I'm sorry if it is too much to ask you this, but yet all but at the same time: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"\"despite\" \"appearances\"\": -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling <i>really</i> <i>hungry</i> again.\" Jenna asked and said, stroking and rubbing her round belly as she spoke. And her belly rumbled for more for Jenna to want to eat as soon as she spoke, once again. Thus prompting her to be stroking and rubbing her belly some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'd be willing to do that for you anytime whenever you ask whenever you want wherever you are.\" Jack replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna retained her red-colored blush as she heard Jack speak and respond verbally and nonverbally in his ever-so-gebtleman-like manners, etc..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Jack. You're so sweet.\" Said Jenna, as she placed one hand under one of her cheeks bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, anywhere, wherever and whenever you want: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Sweet-Hearted Lady.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was feeling really bashful at how gentleman-like Jack was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jack. And while you're at it, don't stop doing so until I let you know when I'd like  to ask for it to stop due to my say so.\" Jenna then asked Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you are want, etc., Dear Lady.\" Jack said, causing Jenna to blush some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus Jack was doing exactly as he was asked as a favor to do for Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted a bit the first few times around at this some small talk but as all this continued on, verbal silence remained from there as: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus Jack was doing exactly as he was asked as a favor to do for Jenna some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, whatever foods he brought to Jenna from before to recently while he and Jenna were at this place, increasings of whatever foods he brought from back during before up to this point, combined with the additional foods, increasing amounts each time, doing the same thing with \"dessert foods\", \"the likes of dessert foods\", etc., and most especially doing so with \"dessert foods\", \"the likes of dessert foods\", etc., he was doing so repeatedly, not doing so until he was asked to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while she ended up seeing to it that it didn't stop until she asked for it to due to say so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus all the while it ended up being that she ended up thus: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying <i>absolutely</i> <i>no</i> <i>heed</i> to her \"already \"over-indulged\"\" big fat belly of a stomach.</span></div></div>",

New years eve had just passed and Jen had just resumed working a few days ago from her holiday vacation. She was sitting at her desk scarfing down a doughnut. She had really been treating herself over the holiday season. Around Halloween Jen bought tons of candy bags for her to graze on. She spent Halloween night serving trick or treaters. except that she ate all 3 bowls of candy she had before the third group of kids came to her door. Jen had a very successful thanksgiving, full of large feasts and bursting of clothes. She was lucky enough to get a week and a half off for christmas which she happily spent filling up her belly with gingerbread houses, cookies, and all kinds of treats. Jen had plumpened herself significantly. She was having trouble adjusting to her added girth in her few days back from vaca. As she sat at her desk she paused her eating at an alarming sound. PING! Jen put down her doughnut and grabbed a thick fold of her belly. She leaned her head over and pulled her belly in to inspect what just happened. Her fat chins popped out from under her chin as she craned her neck down. Going past her endless slab of jiggly cleavage, she finally laid her eyes on her overflowing belly flab. \u201cOh shoot.\u201d Jen said as she saw that yet another shirt button had been lost. This was her third missing button on this shirt. This was the second one she lost today. She had been especially gluttonous this morning. As she had almost double her usual breakfast today, and had really pigged out at lunch. \u201cI really need to watch what I eat,\u201d Jen thought as she observed her massive self. One hand feeding her cookies, the other carressing her swollen midsection. \u201cIf I eat to many of these I\u2019ll get huge!\u201d she said smacking her spare tire. Her incredibly large breasts rippling like a disturbed pond. All the food in her stomach sloshed around.</span></div></div>",

She was really not looking forward to having to stand up, so she quickly dispensed with the last of the doughnuts she got from the conference room. She put her pudgy hands on the armrests of her desk chair and started to lift herself up. Her bulging backside and wide, pillowy hips were packed in to her office chair, and proving to be quite a struggle. Finally she freed her two fat seat cushions from her chair. Her belly had been propped up by her thunder thighs all afternoon. When she stood upright her belly fell in an avalanche of jiggling flesh. Heavy boob fat crashed down onto her mound of a belly. As her gelatinous fat finally settled one thing was clear, Jens shirt was entirely too small. It\u2019s short sleeves pinched Jen\u2019s puffy arms. The top buttons were open enough to reveal significant cleavage. The shirt clung to her rotund fat rolls. below her generous chest were a few buttons that somehow manage to stay attached followed by the three empty button holes. the bottom of shirt opened up like the entrance to a tent. a triangle of pale white flesh was exposed, including her belly button which had now been consumed by the surrounding belly bulges. Another inch or two of midsection flab was visible in between her shirt and pants. Below her hefty upper body was her bulging lower half. As she waddled down the hall, her massive bubble butt bounced rhythmically with her short slow steps. The top of her crack started to wiggle out from under her tight and very filled out pants. Under her immense derriere was her two tree trunk thighs, which were in a constant embrace of gelatinous jiggling flesh. Once she squeezed herself into the empty elevator Jen was exhausted. \u201cWhew, *pant* why is this elevator so far away?\u201d Jen\u2019s soft flab folded as she kneeled over. When the elevator hit the ground floor Jen slowly wiggled her way over to her car in the parking lot. She made her way to the drivers side of her sedan, sweating from the walk. Jen opened the door and lowered her 300+ bulk into the front seat. Jen grunted as she fell onto the seat with a thud. Her immense flab doing a nice job of filling up the cabin. She went to close the door only to have the door bounce back open.<br>\r\n\u201cOw, my tush.\u201d Jen lifted her massive arm to get a good look at her side. Her fleshy hip and bum oozed over her seat. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my.\u201d Jen said as she watched the door bounce off her jiggling side. She awkwardly bounced her blubber over a few inches. Her right cheek swallowing the cup holder. She managed to close the door finally as her excess hip fat and overflowing love handles smushed against the inside of the door. Jen reached up and grabbed her seat belt and pulled it down. She quickly realized her immense belly was too much for the seat belt. <br>\r\n\u201cUgh... this stupid car!\u201d Jen said in frustration. She moved her seat back to give her fat rolls some space from the steering wheel and drove home. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She ate the first pizza relatively quickly. She started eating the second pizza until suddenly the last two buttons on her shirt popped off. Her top belly roll pushed outward matching her bottom roll. <br>\r\n\u201cOh crap, are those the last buttons? My god what size is this thing?\u201d Jen was astonished. She also came to the realization that she was maybe ignoring her weight a bit too much. <br>\r\n\u201cScale time, I guess.\u201d She heaved herself slowly off of the couch and waddled to the bathroom. Her shirt hung open to reveal her entire swollen belly. Freed from the confines of the shirt her big spare tires wobbled with each step. She stepped on the scale and bent over to see the numbers. She had literally no idea what to expect since she had become so out of touch with the realities of her eating.<br>\r\n\u201c340.\u201d This was a defining moment in her life.

She sure didn't feel 340lbs. \"I must be bloated or something. Regardless, I need to drop some pounds.\" Jenna munched on the rest of her second pizza while she thought up a way to lose the lard. \"Maybe stopping at Taco Bell for second breakfast isn't such a good idea.\" At the thought of cutting out her morning bag of burritos was painful, and just made her crave them even more. \"And I should really take the snack cakes out of my desk.\" Jenna mindlessly found her way into the kitchen after the pizza had been finished and found something sweet to eat. \"This is going to be hard, I'm going to be so hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Jenna attempted to cut back on her intake. It was just as hard as she had thought, and after years of no restraint it was next to impossible not to give into her urges. Her working environment was no help either. All the other office drones were on their health kicks and used people like Jenna to make sure no temptations were around. The morning boxes of donuts ended up on Jenna's desk so they wouldn't be temptation for the rest of the office. And after lunch the surprise birthday cake was placed near Jenna, and in a corner where no one else could get to it but her. Jenna couldn't control her sweet tooth and greedily ate up the goodies. Her stomach purred in satisfaction at her indulgence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was leaving for the day one of the skinny health nut co-workers stopped Jenna and gave her a gift certificate to an all you can eat Chinese buffet. She told her it expired today and no one else wanted it. Jenna regretfully took it and felt it a waste if she didn't go tonight and use it. Jenna stuffed her self to the gills at dinner and waddled her large frame home afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna sat at home after the large meal, reflecting on her day. She was happily stuffed, but her waist line was no smaller because of it. \"I don't think I did a very good job at weight loss today. Everything was just so good I couldn't hold myself back. I guess I'll try harder tomorrow.\" But that's just what she told herself every day as time kept rolling on. Instead of getting smaller she just got bigger and 340 lbs became 350 and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her weight went up so did her size. Jen had a hard time seeing any changed since her huge tits blocked her view. The round watermelons were the only view she had, and they blocked the sight of her large tum. The spherical object lumbered in front of the big cute bombshell. It was hard to contain in fabric, typically hanging loose by a few inches. Below that oozed some squishy hips, thighs, and a big round butt. Jenna's tight XL leggings didn't keep much from the imagination, but the stretchy material was the easiest thing to get on at her large size.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, today will be the day when I finally start to work on losing some of this weight\", Jenna promised herself, a promise that she had failed to deliver on for more than twenty days, as she got ready to get out of bed. She wiggled and struggled as she heaved her 350-pound frame out of bed, causing her thick, soft rolls and breasts to bounce and jiggle in the process. The bed creaked as the corpulent cutie lifted her bulging rear from the bed and stood up, her huge belly and breasts spilling downwards as gravity took hold of her well-fed frame. Every little movement sent ripples through her many folds as she took a few steps and reached for some clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was a weekend and Jenna wasn't going to work, and that was probably a good thing considering that her desk was still full of snack cakes and she always ended up stuffing herself with a staggering amount of sweets and snacks every day, even as she promised herself not to. Jenna told herself that she wasn't going to do the same today. Yes, her kitchen was just as full of snacks as the office, and she hadn't been able to resist eating far too much any other day, but today she had to find a way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna squeezed her fleshy thighs into a pair of leggings, proceeding to try to pull the leggings over her enormous rear. She was forced to struggle as her ass was simply a little too big and flabby to fit. As she tried jumping slightly all of her curves, especially her thick lower and upper belly rolls jiggled almost uncontrollably. There was no chance of the pants reaching all the way to her belly, which in turn was left oozing out in front of them. She finally squeezed her rear into the tight outfit. The pants did not make any effort to conceal Jen's overflowing curves, making her ass look just as massive as it really was and exposing her flabby cheeks as the big, bulbous sacks of fat they had become. She proceeded to grab a top and attempted to pull it down over her torso. Again, there was simply to much of her for the shirt to possibly cover no matter how many times she tugged at it. A fair bit of cleavage was showing and a good several inches of her pale bottom belly roll was visible between her shirt and her pants at all times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna finished getting dressed, and she had a plan for the day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, First: Breakfast. I can't go hungry all day, There's no way I'm going to be able to resist all those snacks if I'm hungry anyway,\" Jenna told herself. There really was only one place for her to get breakfast, and that was the usual fast food place. It was a good choice, Jen thought, walking to her car would get her some exercise as well which was just what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon exiting her apartment, Jenna was immidiately confronted with a choice in how to get to her parked car: The stairs or the elevator. Jen gave the stairs a hateful glance, almost feeling her thighs ache just by looking at it. Luckily, the elevator was in working order and she stepped inside. Jenna tugged at her shirt as she got into of the elevator. But the very instant she let go, the shirt rode straight back up, exposing inches of fat belly once again. <br>\r\nOut of breath from the very short walk from the elevator, Jen squeezed her ample frame into her car and drove to the fast food place. She ordered a usual meal (which for her had become a good meal for two) at the drive-through like she would on any day, but soon realized that it wasn't too long until lunch. Going to another restaurant, feeling like it would be awkward to explain her reason for ordering again, she ordered another meal and a dessert almost without thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aroma of the food was simply to much for Jenna to resist, she had to have just one bite before driving off. Having begun munching on her breakfast on the way home, Jenna arrived at her building carrying her grotesquely large meals with her. Unable to pull her shirt down due to having her hands full with the various bags, it kept crawling upwards, revealing more of her belly by the minute. The pale, exposed flesh jiggled increasingly vigorously as she walked forwards. <br>\r\n\"I should take the stairs... But with all this stuff, it's pretty risky. Better take the elevator,\" Jen thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at her apartment again, Jen put down the slightly greasy bags close to the usual couch. Even though she had already devoured half her breakfast at this point, she felt as hungry as ever. Planting her gargantuan rear in the couch, causing the couch to make a strained noise, Jenna reached for her breakfast. She didn't waste any time digging into the remains of her breakfast, and again almost without realizing it she started on her lunch as well. She started to feel full, but still had soon stuffed the rest of her lunch as well. Only the dessert was left. Jenna felt slightly sweaty from having both breakfast and lunch at once. Still, maybe it was best to have the dessert too. That way, there was no chance she would feel like snacking later, Jenna thought. Even reaching for it was slightly painful after having so much already, and Jenna could't help but notice that her wide hips were almost wedged between the couch's armrests. But soon enough she was greedily munching on the dessert just as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dessert was delicious, and Jenna proceeded to turn on the tv, she was simply too full to do anything else. She had meant to take a walk later, maybe go to a local shop and get something healthy to eat for dinner. Instead she was spending the whole day beached on the couch, getting no exercise at all and with a growing desire for sweets. She had a whole box of donuts at home, even though she had donuts every day she simply couldn't get enough, they were simply too delicious. At some point she just decided that if she was going to eat well, she had to adapt slowly. She could have a donut or two, if that meant she didn't have the whole box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had the whole box, and on top of that she ate some samples of all the other goodies she had at home. Chocolate, candy, snack bars. The weight loss efforts had been a total failure yet again. As Jenna got up from the couch, her shirt having retreated almost to her chest, her massive spare tires and rolls completely exposed, she felt bloated and heavier than ever. <br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but this weight loss thing isn't going too well, I think,\" she said to herself. If things kept going like this, she was going to get very huge, very soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jenna's attempts were met with failure after failure and her gluttony simply continued unhindered, it inevitably had an effect on her body. Pound after pound of fat was added to her rotund frame. Rolls at her belly and back grew thicker and more numerous. Her face was rounder and pudgier than ever, her generously proportioned melons rested heavily on her bulging belly and all her body parts were covered in more and more loose, pillowy fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling into the office one day, practically bursting out of an almost new shirt, a lot of Jenna's excess blubber was on display, jiggling as she walked, and there was simply nothing her overly strained wardrobe could do about it. Fabric was stretched tightly across Jenna's torso, clinging to her meaty rolls, digging into her back fat and obscuring none of her abundant curves. Weighing in at over 365 pounds, Jenna's body was more than a handful for any outfit. Gasping from the short walk to her desk, Jenna slowly planted her impressive backside on her overworked desk chair, provoking a surprisingly loud creaking sound from the flimsy furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the chair's pleading as always, Jenna was instantly met by the usual box of donuts that some office worker had made sure always was on her desk. And she was perfectly aware of that she still hadn't made the effort to put the snack bars out of her desk drawer, to keep them from tempting her. <br>\r\n\"I shouldn't... But just one donut won't do any harm\", Jenna thought, already licking her lips and imagining the tasty treat in her mouth. Struggling to reach for the box, Jen was met with the sound of stretching fabric and an uncomfortable feeling as the shirt was stretching to the max across her torso. The box seemed just out of arm's reach. The strained sound continued, followed by an ominous pop. The bottom button on Jenna's shirt abandoned its post and flew off her shirt, unable to contain her mass. Another pop was heard as a second button fell off for the same reason. The bottom of her shirt opened up to fully reveal the pale, heaving rolls of her lower torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, why is this happening to me? What does a girl have to do to get a shirt that doesn't just break?\" Jenna complained to herself. Tilting her head forward to look down, she saw only the cleavage that her shirt desperately struggled to cover. She had lost buttons before, but that didn't mean she wanted to go home that day lacking all of them. <br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe I won't have a donut today...\", Jenna told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just a few minutes later her meager resistance ended. Jenna strained her muscles and her ass lifted slightly off the chair, her bulbous cheeks quivering even from this small movement. Her belly blobbed onto her desk, the soft flesh pushing the keyboard in front of it away from her slightly. Reaching for the box again, carefully this time, Jenna was without further incidents able to open it and grab a donut, which she promptly devoured. It was just as delicious as she had imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day passed as it had begun, and soon the end of the workday approached. Jenna finished a final snack bar (once again she had not been able to resist them at all) and proceeded to heave her considerable girth off the chair. As she did, her heavy belly flab cascaded down in front of her hips, and her shirt dug tightly into her back rolls, her skin already slightly sweaty from all the gorging and the effort of lifting her bulk out of the chair. <br>\r\n\"Phew. Since when was it so hot in here all the time?\", she wheezed as she felt the sudden stickiness of her outfit. Putting one meaty leg in front of the other, Jen started to waddle away from her desk, every step accompanied by the slight noise of her huge, blubbery thighs brushing against each other. </span></div></div>",

A number of weeks had passed and she was standing in her apartment after another indulgent day at work, a half-eaten donut in one hand. Jenna had weighed herself and she wasn't entirely pleased with the large number the scale had shown. She took another bite at the donut. <br>\r\n\"I thought I was supposed to have started losing weight by now\", she complained as she chewed on her snack. Maybe she would have, if anything at all about her lifestyle had changed, but it really hadn't. In fact, if anything Jenna was getting ever lazier and more prone to overeating as she packed on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe softer curves of her pretty face and her more than fully developed double chin hinted at the weight she had put on even if one didn't see the rest of her abundant form. Jenna's shirt was completely open, revealing the quivering rolls and slabs of fat that covered her torso and poured out in front of her wide hips. Her two massive, fleshy pillows of an ass wobbled behind her and her thighs were so well-padded that they never stopped rubbing against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna brought her free hand to the meaty rolls on the side of her impressive gut. Her hand rubbing against her side was enough to cause her mass to jiggle a little. <br>\r\n\"I just keep getting bigger and fatter. No wonder I've been losing buttons so often\", she told herself as she raised the donut to her mouth again. Taking a final greedy bite, she finished her snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Jenna found herself in the kitchen. She was drawn to the box of pastries that was placed on the counter, its presence constantly tempting her to just keep eating. Jenna walked up to it, feeling her belly smack into the counter as she got a little too close. She considered taking another treat, opening the box and reaching inside. Even after a day of almost constant eating, Jenna wasn't completely satisfied. <br>\r\n\"Mmmm. I'll just have one more. Just one\", she said, grabbing another irresistible donut from the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was already munching on the donut as she squeezed out of the kitchen space. <br>\r\n\"Everything is so delicious, losing weight is harder than I thought\", she sighed between two mouthfuls of her snack. \"Maybe I'm sitting around too much, I think I'm going to have to start getting my butt off the couch or I'll just get even bigger\". She decided that she would try to exercise in order to halt her steady weight gain. Having made such a plan, she was at ease and soon she was fully focused on enjoying her food.</span></div></div>",

Her newest plan was to waddle the pounds off. Walking wasn't her favorite activity it had really just become a necessary activity that brought her to the food she wanted to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now Jenna was thinking to use this strenuous activity for a new purpose. How hard could it be? Jenna used to work out in college, back when she tried to control her curvy figure and appitite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the stairs to her car, parking in the back of the parking lot at work, just a few simple ways Jenna thought she could add some steps to her day. But it was one thing to plan it, it was another thing to execute it. Clocking in at 385 pounds made any extra excertion tough for this whale of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had a good idea and wanted to get a pedomiter to track her step count. She headed out of the apartment after a sugary breakfast, then after headed for some fast food before going to the electronics store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna walked into the large warehouse retailer being met with the cooling AC that was being pumped out by the store. It was a cooling breeze that Jenna needed after breaking a sweat walking from her car. It wasn't that hot out, but having to waddle her bulbous body around stirred up a bit of heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna took a look around the store, not wanting to needlessly walk in the wrong direction. She wasn't too familiar with the establishment since she wasn't too much of a tech person. Luckily she saw a sign off to her right that looked like what she was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmployees and customer looked on at the nearly 400 pound woman as she entered the fitness electronics section of the store. Many thoughts ran through their heads, most of them not that positive. But the one of the emolyee running the section was the most desperate 'please don't ask me any question!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna who obvious looked clueless when it came to tech or even weight loss, was full of questions and it didn't take her long to flag over the boy running the section. The boy looked tiny as he stood in the shadow of Jenna's enoumous body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm looking for a pedometer to keep track of my steps, can you help me with that?\" Simple enough request. The kid was relived and grabbed one of the fitness bands off the rack, one he knew would fit around Jenna's puffy wrists, and sent her on her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna waddled towards the registers and purchased her new step counter. Jenna was feeling better about her weight already.   </span></div></div>",

She took the elevator to her car, parked in her normal spot at work, and only got up from her desk to get a snack or lunch. All in all a pretty regular day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy days end Jenna had racked up 1000 steps, 9000 less than humanly recomended. But we can't be too hard on our big lady, at her size its much harder to get around. Jenna thought she could use that as her baseline but decided she needed more data before making a decision. Jenna may have been quite the tubby office worker but she did get her job for a reason, and she was pretty good with numbets. So maybe she should keep up her lazy life style for a whole week before starting her workout routine, just to crunch the numbers a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy weeks end her data didn't vary much. 1000 steps was fairly average for her. She plugged 1000 steps into her step tracker app and would compare her data to that from now on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Day one started off like any other, except Jenna was a bit more hopefully today. This was the day she turned this out of control weight situation around, or at least she thought. 385 pounds was so much. Jenna was rounder than anyone she knew. She couldn't see much of her bulk due to the bazongas right below her eye line. The very large pontoons on her chest obstructed her view of the rest of her large body. But the rest of the world could very easily see the mack truck sized tire around Jenna's middle. The puffy inner tube was always straining her tops, especially with her boobs packed in there. Down further the tight leggings that Jenna painted on every day left nothing to the imagination. Her large globes behind her were on display for all to see which led down to her tree trunk legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had a massive appetite, one of the reasons she had gone from 180 chunky pound out of college to a 385lb office worker. Paired with a sweet tooth she had gained over 200lbs in the past two to three years. Although she had a resolve to turn her weight around she knew cutting back on the food right now was not the way to go. Jenna's current goal was to add some extra walking to her life and hope that it would help the onslaught of pounds gathering on her frame. If anything maybe just to stop them from accumulating if not drop a few. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first task, take the stairs to her car. Jenna had gotten accustomed to taking the elevator in her apartment building down the four floors to the parking lot, that let her off just a few paces away from her car. Now the stairs were going to become her new best friend, or in her eyes, a mortal enemy. Not only were there four set of stairs, but the dropped her off on the other side of the parking lot, that she needed to traverse in the open air. Jenna approached the stairs with caution, not looking forward to her journey. Jenna had even eaten a few extra sticky buns this morning just to give her that extra push to make the walk happen. She waddled down the first few stairs, and started to realize that is wasn't going to be as bad as she thought. After a few more she had reached the first landing. \"See walking is a breeze!\" She told herself as she looked at her wrist band that was tracking all her new steps. After another short set of stairs Jenna had cleared on floor. She moved on to the next with determination but also some weakening ankles. She wasn't used to standing this long. Even in the elevator she just leaned on the walls and the ride was quite short. After the next set of stairs Jenna was starting to lose her resolve. \"Omh I'm not sure my legs can handle this for much longer.\" Jenna decided to take the elevator the rest of the way to save her legs the pain, she didn't want to go and injure herself after all. All that time with her buns planted on the couch mowing down on food had really weakened her ability to get up and go. No bother it was just the first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at the office her goal was to park in the back of the parking lot and trek across the lot and get in some extra steps. Jenna had just grabbed her taco order and was enjoying a few items from the bag before going in. She pulled into the parking structure and looked at how far of a walk she was about to take. Before turning her car off she had second thoughts and decided to park a little closer. After all that strain she put on her legs at home she didn't want to over do it here at work. Jenna waddled a moderate distance through the parking garage, carrying her greasy take out bags with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she plunked down at her desk she was famished. She polished off her grub and went about her normal routine, aka donuts, twinkies and other snacks that were within reach. She tried to get up from her desk as little as possible, she just let her massive gut rest in her lap, and take the weight off her aching calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy days end Jenna was back up to 100% and ready to take on the next step of her journey. The walk to the car wasn't bad, and she made it all better by stopping for some snacks on the way home. Back at home she looked at her next struggle, going up the stairs. Coming down them had been kinda easy, except on her weak leg muscles, but going up was going to be quite taxing on our beautiful bombshell. Just heaving her bulk up one step proved to be a challenge for her. After one flight of stairs she called it quits and hopped in the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had arrived home in one piece and plopped herself down on the couch for some recovery. Day one was in the books.</span></div></div>",

Her massive rear pressed against the couch, but her bountiful softness made her extra comfortable. It was a welcome relief after her attempt at a more physically active work day.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenna shuffled her frame out of her apartment, her sides and rear brushing against the doorway on the way out. Making it outside successfully, she closed the door. It was time for another workday and another attempt at exercising, and this time she was going to do it right. Jenna was wearing her usual outfit; a shirt that could barely contain her huge melons and her sizeable rolls of fat, and leggings that couldn't conceal any of the unchecked corpulence of her curvy, flabby lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 385-pound beauty started down the stairs, her boobs and mound of a stomach bouncing with every step. Behind her, her enormous ass cheeks jiggled vigorously as Jenna kept moving down the stairs. She lasted down the first and second set but started to feel her muscles complain of the effort. She stopped, her pudge continuing to ripple for a moment before settling. Considering the elevator for a moment, Jenna decided to stay determined and keep going another floor. <br>\r\n\"It won't be so hard if I just keep going, I'll be at the car in no time\", Jenna told herself. The effort was almost too much for her, she was panting and the room felt impossibly warm when she finally reached the end of the final set of stairs. Opening the door outside, Jenna waddled out to the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her hands on her slightly sticky shirt which had ridden up during her effort, Jenna sighed when she realized that she would have to go across the parking lot to reach her car. <br>\r\n\"This is too much at once, why did this seem like a smart plan before?\" she complained. She reached into a pocket for a snack bar, opening the wrapper and bringing it to her mouth. <br>\r\n\"I just need a few minutes to recharge. Then I can get to the car and sit my fat butt down as long as I need to\", she said as she started to chew on her snack. Her legs didn't feel any less tired when she had finished eating, but she had to get to work so she started off anyway, waddling past cars and parking spaces before finally reaching her own ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it to the office with her usual breakfast, Jenna had to decide where to park again. She didn't feel ready to park any further away than last time, not after the walk she had just been through, and she ended up pretty close to the entrance. Still, she felt great as she approached her desk, putting down her large bags of food and getting ready for the day. She was getting (a little) exercise and it made her both hungry and content enough to feast without thinking much of it. During the day she gorged on the greasy fast food as well as countless amounts of snacks. She almost didn't get up from her overworked office chair at all while at work, but she was still happy with her progress so far. She heaved her heavy girth off the seat at the end of the workday, her immense flab jiggling characteristically as she started off towards her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back to her apartment was largely uneventful. Jenna had to walk a small distance to reach her car at the parking lot. She didn't even consider trying to take the stairs to her apartment again, though. Jenna took the elevator, in total reaching only a slightly higher amount of steps than yesterday. She rewarded her efforts with a mountain of snacks, even though she had not done much better than yesterday. Jenna's enormous intake was undoubtedly working against her efforts at losing weight. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jenna whined at the sound and feeling of the door hitting the side of her ass and thigh. It was starting to hurt now, and Jenna couldn't shuffle much further to the side, it felt as if half of her butt was pretty much off the driver's seat already, but still Jenna's flab was bulging out the other way as well. As she forced her blubber to scoot over some more, her incredibly soft and sizeable belly blobbed it's way out of her top, its rolls constantly bouncing and rippling. Her corpulent front was pressed against the steering wheel and Jenna was just happy it was her habit to eat breakfast <i>after</i> her drive to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now we close it... No problem, just closing the car door as usual...\", Jenna mumbled to herself and pulled at the door again. Another thud, as the door didn't quite close. <br>\r\n\"Geez, this car and me, we just don't go together anymore!\", she continued to say to herself. One more time, she pulled at the door. A thud, but not the same kind- Did it actually close? Jenna had almost expected to be trying and trying, all morning. It's not like she hadn't had to before. She couldn't keep from snickering a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, no problem, right!\", Jenna told herself and patted her side. Not the side that was tightly pressed against the door, naturally. Her top had ridden up so much it practically only covered her melons, and Jenna found herself caressing one of her incredibly meaty rolls for a second, her hand feeling very cold against her folds. It was crazy hot outside, but Jenna had come prepared with some soda. She had already had some of it, and now she took another sip. But the whole ordeal with the car door had left her too warm for comfort and a little out of breath. Clearly, another sip of soda was needed. Okay, half of the can maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was she kidding, of course she was going to drink the whole thing. She held up the cold can to her lips and a few gulps later, she was satisfied with her drink. Well, it couldn't tempt her anymore anyway, since there wasn't any left. She was ready to go, and she started the car.</span></div></div>",

For someone like her with a clearly faulty curves-to-car size ratio, it wasn't a very comfortable experience. She and her humungous rear were both relieved as she pulled up at the company parking lot. Lifting herself out of the car, thick blubbery legs first followed by her mostly uncovered torso, her slabs of fat jiggling freely, Jenna then continued on to the other side of the car and grabbed her goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen couldn't avoid hungrily licking her lips as she thought of the food and pastries and all the other things she wanted to eat as she approached her desk. The smell of her delicious breakfast only made her even hungrier. She loved to eat and loved delicious food. She was never able to keep herself from eating and that was why she had promised herself to exercise. It was just too bad she had lost her step counter somewhere, she really needed to find it so that she could get back into that whole routine. Still, she'd been active(ish) for, like, more than a week before that little thing went missing, and for now she was happy to just indulge for a few days. Well, maybe a little more than a few days. Maybe a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely obvious that Jenna's frame was putting an almost unbearable strain on her outfit. Her overwhelming abundance jiggled within her painted-on clothes every time she took another step. Everything was close to snapping off under the onslaught of pressure from her expansive mass. Her pale skin peeked out in several places, her shirt revealing massive cleavage as well as a good part of her impressive front rolls. Her incredibly thick back rolls were mostly covered, but the shirt was stretched so thin that the curves and folds were completely visible. Her ass created quite the shelf as it was sticking out behind her, swaying and wobbling and stretching her garments to the max as she waddled along the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she made it to the desk. Placing down her breakfast bags, she reached inside before she even had a chance to sit down. She leaned forward slightly, her belly flopping onto the desk as Jenna grabbed everything she wanted from inside the first bag (that is, everything inside the bag). It was all heavenly, Jen simply tasted and chewed and filled herself with food. She finished half her breakfast, and still hadn't sat down at her desk. She didn't think about it, she just kept eating, gorging like there was no tomorrow. Only as she consumed the final mouthful of her breakfast did she plant her massive rear on her office chair. Smiling, she licked her lips, scooped up a few remaining crumbs and finally turned towards her desk. It wasn't long before her hands were reaching for those irresistible donuts that were always lying around...</span></div></div>",

She held her breath and pulled her shirt as far down as she could before letting go. It instantly rode up a little bit as her fingers let go, and the only reason Jenna could even notice it was because there was a mirror in front of her that let her see most of her upper body as it struggled to escape her clothes. <br>\r\n\"Oh well. Just stay there, at least\", she conceded. It wasn't perfect, but it was all she could do. She made one last check that her hair was alright and then got out of the restroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jenna arrived back at her desk, she was holding a half-eaten sticky pastry in one hand, and an identical but pristine pastry in the other, both of which she had picked up somewhere on the way from the restroom. She took another bite at the half-eaten one, tiny grains of sugar spilling into her exposed cleavage from the bun and her mouth. Further down her shirt had already ridden up to just as high as it was before, letting Jenna's rolls spill out into the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just about quitting time at the office. Jenna was already done for the day and ready to head home as soon as she finished off these last pastries. The first snack slowly disappeared into Jenna's mouth piece by piece and soon she started on the second one. While one hand was busy holding up the pastry, the other moved to her side, gently rubbing against her substantial love handles. She was pretty full already, but it was so good she just kept eating anyway until there was nothing left to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she started to waddle towards the elevator. Every step further strained her outfit as the excessively soft flesh covering her entire frame jiggled constantly. Her chest, her rolls and the huge globes of blubber behind her wobbled up, down and to the sides as much as the garments would let them. Her top was struggling to contain even the small part of Jen's curves that it was still holding on to. Her pants were so tight they were basically only making her skin a different color. Jenna's clothes were fighting a losing battle against her mounds of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! It's so hot all of a sudden, what's up with that\", Jenna panted as she forced herself the last few steps up to the elevator. She could have done anything for a cool breeze and wished in vain for a soda can or two. Just as she had stepped inside and was about to press the button, another figure hurried into the elevator behind her, squeezing itself into the space remaining next to Jenna. <br>\r\n\"Thanks\", she heard the figure mutter. She looked around: It was a guy, just some office worker. Not somebody Jenna knew in particular. Anyway, Jen hadn't even seen him coming, so he really didn't have to thank her for anything. She gave him a \"you're welcome\" smile anyway, and pressed the elevator button to get to the parking. He didn't move to press any other one. The elevator door closed, and as they did, he looked slightly towards her. He pointed to just below her face. <br>\r\n\"Looks like you got something, um, right there\". Jenna looked down. She spotted a piece of that pastry she had just been snacking on. Awkwardly, only a little bit was on her shirt, the majority of it lying on the uncovered part of her bulging, blubbery chest. She picked it up, accidentally causing her extra-extra-large boobs as well as her equally supersized rolls flop around slightly as her arm brushed against them. <br>\r\n\"These are <i>so</i> good, I hope we get more of them. Like, <i>seriously</i> good\", Jenna said mostly to herself. She couldn't stop herself from licking her lips and placing the unexpected piece of pastry in her mouth.</span></div></div>",

She had lost her pedometer after a week of getting it, and with losing it she had lost her will to exercise. Now she was approaching 400 lbs, a new milestone for Jenna. Her eating hadn't slowed down and her daily routine was unchanged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, after her awkward encounter on the elevator, Jenna arrived home, holding a bag of snacks that she has picked up that would not even last through the night. She plopped her bag down and started to do what had become natural, eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she bite into her first sugary treat, the weight of all the candy, sodas, and confections caused the bag to spill over and tumble all over the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jenna being her size wasn't accustom to having to bend over much, having a massive belly and giant jiggly boobs makes bending over quite a challenge. But we were talking about her nightly stash of food, she had to grab every last morsal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna started to bend over from her seated position on the couch. Something's had fallen in front of the couch, other under the coffee table, and just a few things had rolled under the couch. One by one she picked them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile grabbing the last few things from under the couch, Jenna had discovered a lithany of things hidden under there she had been to lazy to ever find or had lost. One of these treasures was her long lost pedomiter. It must have fallen under there one night after she checked her results and then started pigging out on her nightly snacks or plentiful dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow, that's where I lost this thing. Well I guess I should put it back on that way I can track my steps again.\" Jenna went to go put it back on her wrist but couldn't remember which one she had it on. \"Left or right?\" She settled on her right wrist, that felt more normal for her. She was able to fasten it around just the last loop hole. In reality it had been on her left wrist before, but she didn't notice a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna went on with her night, munching away, keeping her full form stuffed.

'Oh yeah, I've had this pedometer on all day I wonder how well I did.' Jenna synced the results to her phone and saw that it had registered 3,000 steps. 'Holy mackerel, that's way better than I ever used to do. I wonder what's different?' Jenna thought. 'It must be these new meetings on the other side of the office in the afternoon. They bring trays of muffins and cookies, but its just a tedious walk from my desk when I'm already dragging during the 3 O'Clock hour.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had really happened was that when she found her pedometer the night before she had put it on her right hand instead of her left like it used to. No when ever she took a bite of something, it was registering a step. As she stuck her hand in a bag of chip and pulled on out *step* then she'd grab for another *step*. By the time the office bilmp had eaten the whole bag she had added 50 steps to her total. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This blubber will be gone in no time if I keep this up.' Jenna looked down and her curvey form. Lumps and rolls protruded at every angle. Soft and fluffy fat covered her whole body.

Some days her pedometer would hit 10,000 steps with all the food she was shoveling into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic office worker was by far at her biggest, nearing 430lbs. Her tight blouses barely managed to hold her rolls in place. And her work skirts were like black sausage casings around her thick dimply rear and tree trunk legs. As Jenna's body jiggled furiously as she slowly waddled to her desk, she paid no mind to the fact that she was twice as big as any of the girls in the office. Her size had become something of an understanding around the office. She had now been so big for so long, everyone just kinda accepted it. There was no judgement when she ate to whole supply of morning donuts, and everyone knew they were only getting one slice of birthday cake because the rest belonged to Jenna, the office piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna licked her fingers at her desk as she finished a sugar filled flaky pastry.

As a way to encourage healthy eating habits the company was going to award the healthiest employee over the next month with a free cruise. Many factors were going to count, the number one being weight loss. Jenna got excited at the prospect of this contest.

Her big jiggly belly swished around as she shifted her weight from foot to foot as they waited. Jenna's only thought was that she should of had a few more donuts before she came down for this, she was getting quite peckish with all the waiting around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the weighing started. One by one they stepped on the scale, and their weight was recorded. When it was Jenna's turn she stepped on and looked down to see the numbers. There was too much Jenna in the way for her to see anything, but the guy next to her scratched down her weight, \"Umm excuse me sir, I can't see. Can you tell me what the number is...?\" She ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant looked a little embarrassed to have to tell this woman who was so big her weight, but he played nice and told her what it was. \"430.\" Jenna was ready for a large number, she knew she was extremely fat, but in her mind she was at least doing something about losing it. 'Not too bad' She thought to herself. 'Only can go down from here.' She continued in her head. 'I wonder how much I can lose in a month if I really put my mind to it. I have such an advantage over these other girls here, I bet I can lose 30 or more pounds, when they don't even have that much to lose.' Jenna took her confidence back to her desk where her donuts awaited her. She immediately started finishing the box. 'Not going to be a problem at all losing weight this next month.'

Of course her pedometer tracked all her steps and her eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the extra exercise made Jenna even more ravenous for meals, causing her to order larger meals and pack it away at a ferocious rate. Her pedometer was reading out record break rates everyday. Jenna was very pleased with herself over the full month. She really thought she was making progress. That was until she had to go back for her final weigh in results to the end of the month. All the girls in the room were looking a little slimmer than last time. A month wasn't a lot of time to lose a lot of weight, but at least they were starting to make progress. This was true for everybody, but not Jenna. Jenna looked even more bloated than she did a month ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was beaming a large smile as she stepped on the scale, excited to hear how well she did. Her fat jiggled as her anticipation built. Still she was unable to read the numbers on the scale and had to ask the guy with the clip board what it said. Now he had no clue what her starting weight was since it was a different guy this time and he was just writing the new results, so he was unaware he was about to be giving bad news to Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her with a smile and said \"450\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's jaw almost dropped. She had gained 20 pounds this month from all her pigging out. How could this have happened. She didn't feel like she was eating much more than normal, and she was trying to get any extra steps in she could. Even her pedometer said she was doing well, clocking in 12,000 to 15,000 steps a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And can I get your pedometer results? That's smart of you to have one, a lot of the contestants are missing out on bonus points by not keeping track of their workouts.\" Jenna didn't care she was utterly defeated. The guy plugged into Jenna wrist band and downloaded the results on to his computer and off she went.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'20 more pounds? I can't believe it. There is no way I'm going to win that cruise now. All those other girls at least lost weight. What was I thinking eating the way I did, I'm never going to lose weight if I keep eating like this. But I can't stop, my belly is always craving food, and the good stuff too. Biting into those sugary donuts in the morning is such a sweet release. I can't start my day without them. And my morning burrito bag fills me with energy for the day. All that grease and meat just makes that emptiness in my stomach disappear. And sitting at my desk, I'd be famished if I didn't have treats to eat all day. By dinner time I'm in need of a pizza or takeout or I'll be starving by bed. And I can't help myself at the grocery store, every flavor of ice cream looks good, and all the freshly baked sweets are irresistible. My mouth just waters until I buy it all. Even now I'm craving for lunch and it's only 11 o'clock. I think I'll slip out now so I can have some extra time at McDonald's, I really need a nice large meal right now.'</span></div></div>",

They correlated all the results in a large spreadsheet and two names rised to the top, Jenna and Kendra. Kendra was one of the over achievers in Jenna's department. It was no surprise she put her all into the company contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she is the clear winner.\" One of the judges said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she didn't even lose any weight.\" Another counter argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On our scale Jenna scored the most points. She may not have gotten any points for weight loss but she got 23 in the exercise catagoy, which puts her way over Kendra who only got 15 for weight loss and submitted no exercise totals.\" Very unlike Kendra to not submit her exercise totals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe argument raged on between the three of them on who deserved to win. But they finally came to their verdict. The announced it later that day in an email. \"Our congratulations to Jenna in finance for winning the healthiest employee of the month awarded.

Wow all that exercise really paid off.\" She said to herself and she took another bite of her pastry. \"I guess I been on the right path all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna continued to read the email and saw she had to head down to HR to retrieve her prize and head out on her vacation. </span></div></div>",

Adorned in a big floppy sun hat and a tropical blouse she was ready to hit the tropics from the seat on the deck. She rolled her bags along the long hallway to her cozy room. \"This is going to be the best two weeks ever.\" As she made herself at home the came a knocking at her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened it there was a young thin girl wearing a cruise employee uniform. \"Hello Miss Jenna, I'm Nicky, your cruise adventure assistant. I'm here to get you anything you need. Sun block, activities schedule, or even a nice meal, anything you want just ask. It seems like all your purchases are comped so don't even worry about the price. Anything I can get for you.\" Jenna being a very fat woman was feeling quite peckish so decided to start with some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind bringing me the desert menu?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly!\" Nicky said enthusiasticly. Nicky rushed off and Jenna went back about her business. A moment later another knock came across the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna opened it to see Nicky pushing two large carts. \"What's all this, I didn't even order anything yet.\" She asked as Nicky rolled the two carts into Jenna suite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you wanted the whole desert menu? That's what you asked for.\" Nicky said with a puzzling look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no I wanted to look at the desert menu, not order the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't take these back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem leave them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! And if you need anything else just give me a holler.\" And with that Jenna was left alone with trays and trays if sweets. Jenna didn't mind she was used to eating large and especially sweets. She ate most of them before stashing a few for later and headed out for her next adventure.</span></div></div>",

It fit her well despite Jenna being at her biggest of all time. The fresh sea air felt great, and the sun rays were warming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna found a nice lounge chair along the outside of the desk and began her relaxation. Jenna really wanted to relax with these two weeks she had off. Her life had been so stressful recently and a little mellowing was just what she needed. With all of her recent weight gain, attempts at exercising, her faltering on appitite control, and then this company health initiative, it was just all so stressful. Jenna just wanted to not have any worries on this trip, and that  included about not worrying about  a what went in her mouth. Thankfully her employer saw her as the healthiest employee so that made her feel even better about putting her eating habits on auto pilot this vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna sat reclined, letting the sun illuminate any of her exposed skin. Jenna's ponderous belly spilled all around her. Not only did it heave outward it popped into her lap and out above her hips. It was hard to see though over her well exposed melons. The top she had bought gave the girls plenty of room to breath and ripen in the sun. Her prize winning cans were so big they hid the true size of her belly, and they were also so wide they bounced off her ham hock sized arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long though until a server came by to check on the lonely Jenna. \"Anything I can get you ma'am?\" Said a deck hand with a smile. \"Might I suggest our bottomless frozen margarita along with an appetizer sampler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna liked the sound of that and a moment later the boy was walking back with a huge margarita and a trolly of food. \"Here you are ma'am, a frozen margarita and a sample of all 42 of our amazing appetizers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was a little shocked again by the volume of food presented to her, but again wasn't going to let it bother her. \"Wow you guys really take your grub seriously here.\" Jenna said as she took her first sip of the sweet margarita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure Jenna was all set the boy left to go back to work, and Jenna dug right in. Plate after plate started clearing off, and Jenna knew he said these were sample sizes, but to her they all seemed like full sized dishes. Jenna did what she did best though, eat to her hearts content. All the while washing it all down with her tasty frozen margarita. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe margarita was quite large but Jenna was making short work of it. As Jenna tipped the last of it into her mouth, and giving her large belly a satisfying short unconscious rub. As this was happening the deck boy was quickly approaching with another drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding her a nice new full drink and taking the sticky remains of the last one, all he said was, \"I told you they were bottomless.\" He said with a wink. Jenna didn't think much of it, as a refill was going to be necessary if she needed it to wash down the rest of this food.</span></div></div>",

There was no lack of deck hands or waitresses ready to take her order or bring her a refill. All the way until dinner Jenna had her fill. But seeing as how the hour had grown late Jenna decided she needed a real sit down meal, not just all these snacks. Slow maneuvering her bulky rolls for her deck chair, Jenna made the arduous decision to get up from her seat. Over the course of several hours she had slowly sank deeper and deeper into the stretchy material of the deck chair. Putting her soft hand on the metallic edge of the chair she slow hoisted her self up. Jenna had become accustomed to these tasks that had become more difficult in recent months, and paid no mind to the fact that it was all the calories going between her lips that was doing all this damage to her waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was much happier to eat first and ask questions later. That is why she was waddling to the nearest, tastiest restaurant she could find. With a big smile on her face she walked up to the hostess, announcing she needed a table for one. The flabby vacationer looked happy as can be as the hostess went and prepared a table for her, returning only a moment later to lead her to said table. Jenna sat down on what felt like quite a roomie chair. At this point she had gotten used to her extra girth not fitting in between the lines of most chairs, but this one seemed more than well equipped her handle her ample backside and flared out thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna started flipping through the menu, but her waiter was quick to the table. \"Good evening madam, how are you this evening? Can I get you started with a drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please! I've been enjoying margaritas all day, so I'll have one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice madam. And for your meal, are you ready to order?\" Jenna gave the boy a blank stare as she had only just leafed through the menu and had not really even read any of the menu items. \"Might I recommend our multi course dinner meal? It takes the pressure off and allows you to enjoy the finer items on the menu. First you will be treated to a trio of our favorite appetizers, then for the main course you will be served our house specials from the menu as well as a taste of the chefs special of the evening. To finish things off and cleanse the palate dessert will be served.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that sounds amazing, and easy. I'll take it!\" The waiter smiled as he retrieved her menu before leaving to put the order in. Jenna rubbed her ginormous tummy underneath her taxed sundress as she eagerly awaited her meal. Jenna was such a hog couldn't even rationalize how poorly her eating habits were, or how badly the wait staff here was exploiting her endless appetite. What they didn't know is that Jenna's employer was footing the bill for all her extra amenities, so she didn't give it a second thought when ever a delicious drink or menu item was presented to her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The waiter returned quickly with Jenna margarita and followed that up by bringing her three appetizers. Jenna was expecting a small plate with a trio of appetizers, but what she got was three full sized apps. Jenna never turned down a tasty plate of food though, so she went ahead and started to make quick work of the beginning of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the appetizers were done her first entre hit the table, the house special Chicken Alfredo Fettuccine. Jenna was quick to start slurping up the cheese covered noodles, dipping the accompanying breadsticks in the left over sauce as the plate emptied. As she finished that a plate of Chicken Parmigiana was slid in front of her. The breaded chicken slid right down her throat, and the tomato sauce was to die for. She made sure to get every last spec of sauce off the plate before it was cleared away and replaced with large serving of Shrimp Scampi. Jenna was surprised that another entree was coming out, she thought her meal only came with two specials, little did she know she had only made it on to the house specials on the menu, she hadn't yet seen the nightly specials from the chef. After the Shrimp Scampi came the last house special, a piece of grilled salmon drizzled with a reduced sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.\" Jenna purred as her waiter came to take her finished plate. \"That was so good. Thank you for the recommendation.\" Jenna said to her waiter as she rubbed her filling belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you are liking it so far. Next up we have the chef specials.\" He said as a bus boy holding a large tray came to stand beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean there is more?\" Jenna was puzzled, and concerned as she was already feeling full after a long day of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course. First we have the chefs lobster stuffed baked haddock in lobster sauce. We also have fresh and fried scallops from the sea in a lemon ginger sauce.\" The bus boy was taking the plates off his tray and was putting them in a semi circle in front of Jenna on the table. \"Lastly we have the chefs prime rib, with his special steak sauce with a sides of mashed potatoes and corn. Enjoy.\" Both boys left and Jenna could do nothing but dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotund woman worked her way from plate to plate shoveling the calorie rich food past her lips. Her belly swelled as she filled it to capacity. Her sundress stretched to its limits as it tried to contain her enormous girth, flabby rolls looking to escape from all angles. Jenna remained the eating champ she had been all these months, lot letting a single thing go to waste that was put before her. Jenna needed to lean back in her steady chair and take a breath. She let her stomach spill as much as it needed to into her lap. The big eater was starting to get red in the face from how over full she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we ready for dessert?\" Jenna had not noticed that her waiter had returned and already cleared off her table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no I couldn't I'm so full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But madam, what am I supposed to do with all these desserts?\" He gestured to the two full trays propped up next to Jenna's table. \"I know I'll have someone send them to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelived she didn't have to eat those desserts right now, Jenna let out a huff before answering. \"That sounds good.\" Jenna said like she about the slip into a food coma. Jenna billed the meal to her room, and slowly started to waddle in the direction of her bed. She made it to her room, and the first thing she noticed were all the desserts had been dropped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna collapsed on her bed, the massive belly heaving up and down and she took deep breaths. She closed her eyes for ten minutes before sitting back up and reaching for the closest dessert to her. An hour later all of the dessert trays were empty and Jenna was soundly sleeping in her bed. </span></div></div>",

She was on vacation, there was no rush to get up in the morning, other than her empty stomach that urged to be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut rather than her stomach, it was a knock at the door that got Jenna out of bed. Opening the cabin door she was greeted by her ever cheerful travel assistant Nicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Miss Jenna!\" Nicky chirped in her typical positive tone. \"I sure do hope you are enjoying yourself during your stay here. I wanted to stop by and see how you are doing? Anything you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna stood there puzzled as she had been put on the spot. The only thing that came to mind was a good meal to start the day. \"What time is it? Are they still serving breakfast?\" Jenna asked rubbing her eyes followed up with rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. It's only 10am, but we serve breakfast at all hours of the day. Never know when you're gonna want a stack of flapjacks at three in the afternoon.\" Nicky said jokingly with a wink while nudging her elbow into Jenna's pillowy belly. \"We also have some fun activities happening today if you're interested in hearing about those.\" She asked making the statement sound like a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Jenna enthusiastically replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are having a beach side bbq party up at the main pool starting at 11. After that there is a pie eating contest at the tree house play zone at 3. At 4 there is a mixed drink class, where you get to learn how to make, and then sample all our signature drinks. 5 o'clock kicks off chefs Antonio's cuisine around the world event at his restaurant, where you can try dishes from around the globe. 8pm is the start of our s'mores bar on the top floor deck, where you get to watch the sun set and try a variety of amore combinations. Finally the last thing, for the late night crowd is the ice cream sundae bar at 10 tonight. It's right around the corner from your room here, and it's all you can eat ice cream with every topping imaginable. Does any of that sound interesting to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's frail mind was overloaded by options. She was hungry enough to eat an elephant, and all of these food based activities sounded delightful. They sounded like they were all over the ship, and how was she going to remember when and where each one was. Nicky could tell she was struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you are interested in all the activities, may I offer you a crew lead tour for the day? That is where a crew member leads guests from one activity to the next, keeping everyone on time, and getting them to the right places. Today's is called the food tour, and I can sign you up if you're interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna almost begged to have Nicky sign her up, there was no way she could remember all those activities. Also it would be fun to be in a tour group and meet some other folks. \"Yes, please sign me up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then I'll be back in 45 minutes to bring you to your first activity!\" With all that sorted out, Nicky closed the door, leaving Jenna alone again.</span></div></div>",

Quickly Nicky came on back inside her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Jenna?\u201d Asked Nicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I would actually like the breakfast menu in lots of it all first before knowing about the first activities.\u201d Answered Jenna as she had rubbed her belly eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright O Miss Jenna. Quickly I shall bring it all in right away.\u201d Said Nicky and whilst with that, she had rushed out quite quickly and like with the last time that she had been asked for something by the quite very fat woman, she had delivered huge trays of each of all the whole entire breakfast menu in quite enormous quantities of it all and all whilst with variously vastly good qualities about all of it, and this had yet again here left Miss Jenna very surprised yet considering her enormous appetite feeling all of the more hungry and very quite eager. Therefore Jenna had quickly rubbed her huge belly very all off the more eagerly. Furthermore Jenna saw that these included most especially various <i>and</i> <i>quite</i> <i>so</i> <i>here</i> <i>literally</i> <i>so</i> <i>enormous</i> <i>tons</i> of waffles and pancakes most especially including chocolate chip flavoured types. Indeed Jenna <i>had</i> <i>really</i> <i>struggled</i> <i>to</i> <i>refrain</i> <i>whilst</i> <i>from</i> <i>drooling</i> as she saw this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell O Miss Jenna, please so do enjoy it all. Meanwhile I will be right back albeit again in forty five minutes to ensure you have what you need for activities etc,.\u201d Stated Nicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Nicky.\u201d Replied Jenna as her assistant left her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd The Hungry Jenna has eagerly ensured to begin to dig all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Jenna got to her cereals, her scrambled eggs, omelettes, her breakfast potatoes and bacon and then everything else up to her waffles and pancakes, all of which she poured lots of syrup onto all whilst in ways that surprisingly enough even for her made no messes on her bed or her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna ate them all up, her belly grew several times as big and now turned into a humongous single entity of a spare tire rather than multiple rolls, and after the last of them all she then gulped down to wash it all down gallons of milk that went with it all and again all whilst without making a mess of her bed or even her clothing for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Jenna did not feel full yet, yet not surprisingly so, considering her appetite\u2019s so incredibly very quite seemingly insatiable nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Jenna had seen to it that she had rubbed her filling and as well as becoming quite increasingly packed and bulging belly. Afterwards Jenna, with a struggle albeit not long, got herself off of her bed. Afterwards Jenna showered and cleaned up and put on an outfit like the kind she wore upon starting up here her occurring vacation, albeit fitting around her body and quite stretchy in material yet also slightly and becoming increasingly quite super snug as well. Soon Nicky came in carrying the list of activities for Miss Jenna thus here to be a part of from throughout this day, and whilst by then, the fat woman herself thus got herself all completely ready whilst for this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Jenna, here you go now. And Jenna also right by your room\u2019s door you can head and see an upcoming group for today\u2019s food tour heading on up to ready for the described bbq event up at 11:00 AM, which is fifteen minutes from the current time here.\u201d Explained Nicky who had then left the room yet again. Afterwards Jenna had held the list in her hands whilst waddling on out of her room. And Jenna clearly saw the group coming up, and she with a brief struggle considering how most of the line was thin and skinny got behind the line itself, yet she had still followed it, discreetly proceeding whilst in excitement thus so all here to have rubbed her belly as she had examined her list: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI.

She fried up a sausage patty, popped a waffle in her toaster, and munched down on her breakfast. The blubbery blonde finished quickly, and slid into her overly-tight Exercise apparel: Some Nike shorts that clung skin-tight to her legs and puffed out her thighs and giving her stomach a slight muffin top. She slid on her Tank Top, which was also about as skin-tight, and made her breasts hang awkwardly over her exposed belly-button. She filled her Water-Bottle and nodded to herself. \"Let's go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blubbery, obese woman's stomach jiggled and shook as her Tank-Top rode up as she stepped down the steps. It went by like a breeze, going down. Motivation surged her brain. <i>I can do this, the fitness thing is a breeze. Why didn't I get on this before? YOU HEAR THAT, TUMMY! You're about to DIE!</i> She got to the bottom, and her phone pinged, she looked at it. 'Go back up.' She turned back up to the stairs, and spoke to herself. \"Okay, can't be too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step was a struggle, but somehow a bit less hard than before. Was she improving? This gave her a bit of hope, though she still chugged on her water bottle. She stepped up and up, as she reached the seventh floor, the sweat emerged from every orifice: Her tank-top had ridden up and become a sports bra, her whole belly on show. Her hair dripped sweat like raindrops. She felt considerably tired as she returned back to her floor, and sat for a bit. She felt relieved. This was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the sweat had started chilling her body, she was barraged with pings of her phone reminding her to get back down there. After refilling her water bottle, she got going down, and emerged from her building. The outside street was bustling and hustling with businessmen, construction workers, and teens in hoodies. The skyscrapers gleamed with a special light as she walked, drawing quite a bit of attention. Out of her peripheral vision, she caught a man glancing at her butt. She got a bit of a smirk. <i>Even when I'm a whale, I can catch some eyes. Imagine how many I'll catch when I'm thin.</i> The end of the walk showed promise, as she remembered there was a BOMB pizza buffet at the end of her route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer travel brought her to a 3-story building she'd never quite noticed before, titled: 'Debbie's Gym'. It had big, blacked-out windows, on all floors but the lobby. In the lobby sat a slender, short little woman with her hair worn in a messy bun atop her head. She'd brought her wallet with her and she thought. All these years of working out alone never worked. She'd always dropped out. Would the gym work? After some pondering...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Would there be cameras snapping pictures of her, making fun of her? Would they turn her away for being too fat? Would she have to weigh-in on national television? It was scary until she heard the little voice in the back of her head, telling her \"Go, do it.\" She entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little electronic 'Deet-doot' alarmed as she entered, greeted by the woman. \"Hi! How can I help you!\" She spoke, taking a stab in the dark at the alarming, dark pool of the gym world. \"Yeah, uh, how much does it cost to join this gym?\" The woman replied rapidly, shooting back \"Oh, normally it's about a 45 buck membership, but we're running a New Year's Special, only 20 bucks if you join now.\" Jenna reached into her pocket. \"Uh, alright. How much for a first-time entry?\" The young little thin woman lit up. \"Oh, it's free for your first time visiting.\" Jenna nodded. \"Then, I'd like to come in on a first time entry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young little woman spryly hopped up from her chair and strode towards the door. \"Sure thing! Just follow me. You're gonna LOVE it, the people here are so nice.\" She opened the vast portal into the new world, and there was a symphony of sounds: The plodding of feet and the humming of treadmill belts, the loud, exerting noises of bulky bodybuilders lifting the big, black, blocky weights, and the clinking of said weights clacking against each other. \"Have fun!\" said the small, thin girl as she dissapeared behind the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhelp, no going back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna stood like a deer in the headlights, walking awkwardly towards a strange machine with tall handles and footpads raised from the ground. She stepped onto it and tapped at the console on it. She tapped at the big green 'Quick Start' button. Nothing in particular happened. She noticed that the screen had shut down. She hit it again, as her feet began slipping. The footpads rose and fell, and she was happy that she was holding onto one of the bars. This time, she noticed the screen was still on. She entered her weight into the console: 385. She noticed a variety of numbers, something about calories, heart rate, time spent on the machine, and how long it would take until she would have walked a mile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pumped it, and the dynamic actually worked rather well for her. As she pumped the handlebars, her legs were able to rest a little, and after this, her arms were able to rest. Before she knew it, the machine had hit 7 minutes and she was parched and her legs were tired. She stepped off the machine as the screen went dark. She rested on a nearby bench, with a convenient long, iron bar for a back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before long, she was approached by a buff man, looking rather confused. \"Uh.. How long until you finish your set?\" Jenna looked confusedly at the man. \"Uh..Set of what?\" The man chuckled a bit. \"I take it you're a first-timer, then. A set's a session of time you use the bench.\" Jenna looked at the round black wheels with open holes down the middle sitting on racks nearby. \"Ooooooh. So that's what this is, I thought it was just a place to sit.\" The man smiled and spoke. \"What's your name?\" Jenna replied slowly. \"Uhhhh...Jenna, Jenna Mossberg.\" The man nodded. \"I'm Dave. Dave Williams, nice to meet you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodybuilder shook her hand briskly.\"So you're here to start your fitness journey?\" Jenna chortled a little nervously. \"Yeah, heh-heh, funny story about that, I actually got stuck in a door at work.\" The bodybuilder shook his head. \"Man. Glad I never got that big. Well, you're doing something about it now.\" Jenna spoke. \"Yeah, I've been trying for a bit, but nothing's been working. I just can't lose weight, no matter how hard I work out.\" Dave replied, rubbing his stubbled chin. \"Well, have you changed your diet?\" Jenna looked confusedly at him. \"Does that help?\" Dave laughed. \"Does it help? Of course it does! It's the main way you lose weight, you can't out-exercise a bad diet.\" Jenna spoke inquisitively. \"So, what is a good diet?\" Dave spoke. \"Veggies, no fast food, holding back on what you eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some consideration, Jenna spoke. \"Wow. That sounds hard, I'd need somebody to help.\" Dave smirked. \"Funny you mention that. I happen to be a personal trainer. I normally charge, but you, I can see that you require some special help. I'll help you out for free for a bit.\" Jenna quietly thanked god that she'd made the decision to go to the gym. \"Well, want to get started?\" inquired Dave. Jenna nodded her head, and followed the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the gym satisfied, turning to the woman as she left, placing the 20 bucks on the counter. \"I'm ready for that membership.\" She got her card, walked out the door, and walked home. As she climbed the stairs to her apartment, utterly spent, she noticed a gnawing hunger at her stomach. She considered Dave's words, and weighed it against her hunger. She ended up...</span></div></div>",

After supper she had looked up healthy recipies for breakfast and lunch,  She had a bowl of Granola cereal with fruit chopped up and sparsed inbetween, and whole-grain pancakes. She was happy about it, she felt like she would make some genuine progress today. She plowed through her breakfast, which actually felt filling, she felt stuffed. After her energizing breakfast, she got up from the table, and got down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the gym, swiped her card in the gym door, and entered the door. She saw the familiar figure of Dave standing near the weight benches, who turned and waved his bulky arm at her. \"Jen! Good morning!\" She met up with him, and hugged him. \"Good morning, Dave! How've you been?\" Dave waved his hands either which way. \"Eeh, so and so, but Pre-Workout kicked in, so I'm ready!\" Jenna nodded. \"What first, today?\" Dave spoke. \"Get on that elliptical, and try upping the level a little bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna hopped on the elliptical, and this time, she had a bit more pump in her step, though the difficulty was increased, she was able to get going like a professional. She didn't feel sluggish in any sense of the word. Though about 6 minutes in she started slacking, Dave spoke words of encouragement to her. \"Get going! You got this! BURN that fat! You've got a new you in the carving! Go, go!\" She toned in, and got going. She ignored the riding up of her shirt, and kept going, in a zen-like state of workout, it was exclusively her and the machine. They were one, brothers, of the same material. By the time her bodily limits had kicked in, and she had looked down, the time read: 20:01, and the calories burned read \"100.\" Dave patted her on the back. \"Good freakin' job, girl! I knew you could do it! You did it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two relaxed, and cooled down, Jenna spoke. \"Yeah, dave, I feel like I'm doing good, but is there anything else that can help me out?\" Dave spoke. \"Oh, yeah, we've got all kinds of classes. Pilates, Yoga, Tae-Kwon-Do, Spin...\" Jenna interrupted him. \"What's spin?\" Dave smiled. \"It's crazy, it's like a biking class, you get on exercise bikes, do all kind of stuff on them.\" Jenna spoke. \"How do you get in it?\" \"Well, pay 5 bucks per class, and make sure to bring plenty of water.\" Jenna took note. \"And when does it happen?\" \"Oh, about 5:00.\" The two finished their session with a bit more weight-lifting, Jenna hit 50 as her benching max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 5:00 rolled around, Jenna had returned. She had a healthy lunch at the attached Healthy Life cafe, where members ate free. She had her water bottle filled up, and she entered the second floor. The platform was full of Exercise bikes, with a thin woman on the bike facing everyone. Each bike had a little slot on the front, each one seemed to hold water bottles. Jenna filed in with the program, and took her seat. The woman engaged the music. As jenna took a look around, she noticed a variety of women. Some seemed like seasoned bikers, but this class had a good majority of heavier women like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructor began. \"Alright, so, welcome to cycling class. We've got some among us who are new here, but that's okay, everyone's got to start somewhere. We're gonna start off normal pace, so find something that works for you.\" Jenna began pedaling. The slots that held her feet in place were very useful, as they prevented her from slipping off. Things were rather nice, and the instructor kicked it into full gear. \"Alright, everybody, sprints for 30 seconds. Get those legs MOVING! You can do this!\" She felt winded as she started doing it. She resisted the temptation for reaching for her water bottle. As the 30 seconds came to an end, the instructor repeated the cycle: Intervals of rest, followed by brief, intense spots of activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough hindered, Jenna found out something amazing to her. Some girls actually sounded more winded than she felt. She felt that this couldn't be. She was a whale, a blubberly tub of lard, how the hell could someone be less in shape than her? This gave her even more motivation, as she found new wind to keep going. As the intervals came to an end, the instructor spoke again. \"Alright, everybody, standing up! Keep pedaling, you want that thin body! Get rid of that fat! You got this!\" Jenna felt a bit winded. The instructor had them staying up. The heavier women rested for intervals. Jenna felt empowered. She wasn't the least fit person in the class. She had this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class descended to hell. The instructor had them squatting with their butt facing the wall, jenna sweated through it, but sweat she did. It felt like she was giving the bike a shower. But she kept going. She even heard people stopping their bikes entirely. This was incredible. As the workout powered down, and they relaxed with some easy stretches, everyone else seemed dead. But not her. She was on top of the world, nothing could stop her. As she chugged her water like she had never seen a drop of liquid, she walked out of the gym, walking towards her home. She was satisfied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenna awoke in the morning, another weekend. She rolled out of bed in her spry form, walking towards the bathroom, wondering how this day would be. It had been a month now. All her co-workers had viewed her rather strangely as she had cut out of the usual office routines. No more fattening sessions in the break room. No more sitting at her desk in her spare time. No more fattening girl's nights out. She was proud of herself, and she had plans to try to help her friends live a longer, healthier life with her. She stepped onto the electronic scale, as numbers flashed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually the three dots came about, and then a number: 290. She had lost 95 pounds, she almost jumped for joy, fist-pumping in joy and in delight. She had done it, she'd made actual progress. She'd come a long way from the lethargic, morbidly obese hog she was before. She was still obese, but now she was on the road to health, to being thinner, hell, possibly, maybe, going all the way to THIN. She was so excited, she couldn't wait to tell dave. She whipped up her breakfast, ate it, and jogged down to the gym. She'd made that change a while ago. She greeted dave with nearly an embrace. \"Dave, I weighed myself this morning. Guess how much I've lost?\" Dave stood puzzlingly, smirking a little. \"How much?\" \"Nine. Zero.\" He fist-bumped her. \"Hell yeah! I You got this! All you had to do was change your diet and you did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jenna spoke. \"And, for all this help...\" She handed him a wad of cash. \"Naw. Your success is all I need. Besides, the gym's had a boost. People noticed you getting thinner, and they want in. We're getting rediculous amounts of new members.\" After this, they went on to the cardio and a bit of lifting. The elliptical had now grown to know her rather well, and today she went not 7, not 20, but 45 minutes straight on it. She was a fitter fat girl than most of the thin girls in her office. She lifted, today, not 50, but 75. One month, and she'd gotten fit. But that's not all, she wanted more. She knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a call as she finished her 2 hour sesh at the gym: It was Jessica. \"Hey, Jen! I know we don't see you much anymore, but I thought we could meet up at the Pizza Parlor!\" She nodded, smiling. \"Sure! Meet you there!\" She hung up and got walking to the Parlor. As the girls pulled up, it was obvious that they weren't on the same program. Melissa and Alice were twin blimps, seeming to fatten each day. Alice had to be at least almost 400, her stomach starting to peek over even the expansive sweater, Melissa wearing her usual T-shirt that she wore on the weekends. Lucielle and Ashley were both sneaking up on 300, swelling balloons of stomachs that were embraced tightly by green blouses. The girls sat down to a parlor table, and they ordered one big pepperoni Pizza. Jenna decided to use this as her one cheat meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She slowly waited as the conversation started sliding. \"Yeah, oh my god, anyone else remember when the Elevator broke down the other day?\" A collective groan came from the table. \"Oh jesus, I hated that day. I, like, DIED that day.\" intoned Jessica. Melissa gave a similar nod. \"Oh shit yeah, that was terrible. I had to sit in the break room for, like, an HOUR to catch my breath.\" Alice spoke. \"Mm. Not as bad as the other day. I was visiting my Parents for christmas, and all they did was guilt me about my weight. Mom literally weighed me, took my blood pressure. She told me that I'm about to die because of it.  I don't know, I might do it just to make them shut up.\" Jenna spoke. \"Well, if you wanted to, the gym I'm at is very welcoming.\" Melissa spoke. \"Man, I would work out, but, I don't know, I love food too much.\" The rest of the whales nodded in intonement. \"Well, on the diet I've been on, I've been eating a crazy amount of stuff, man. Just different stuff. Like, when you eat like that, you feel SO much more energized.\" Alice spoke. \"You know what, why not?\" Melissa sighed. \"Damn you alice, now I gotta go.\" Alice shook her head. \"You don't GOT to-\" Melissa cut her off. \"Hell yes I do. If you're gonna suffer, I gotta suffer with you. We're friends for a reason.\" The girls mutually agreed: They'd all visit the gym tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day they'd come in their best exercise attire. A good amount of it was horridly ill-fitting. Jessica's literally only covered her breasts, stretched tight like a drum across it. Dave spoke. \"So, you're Jen's friends?\" They all nodded. \"Mmm-hmm.\" Dave spoke. \"So, I'm gonna help you guys out. I'm Dave. Say Hi, Dave.\" They all chuckled and spoke. \"Hi, Dave.\" They were stunned. What were they to do? Dave eventually lead them to the Treadmills. \"Good thing you guys got here early, these things are usually full in the mornings.\" They each climbed aboard, and after some brief instruction, they got walking. Each picked a walking pace, Jenna stayed there with them. Dave encouraged them to pick up the pace, and as the 5 minute mark approached, a majority of them were done, and so they dropped off. Dave kept working with them. He gave them the same talk he gave Jenna: Fix your diet, or the exercise won't work. As her friends left, Jenna spoke to them. \"Alright guys. You in this with me? Ready to change?\" Her friends deliberated. Eventually...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come on! You got this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructor was leading the charge. Today, Jenna was on the front row, beside Melissa and Alice, both sweating it out beside her. Both had to have dropped to about 340 by year's end. Progress, but still a ways to go. They had stayed up to standard on their diets, for the most part. There were a few weeks where they slipped, but Jenna kept them on track by the next week. At this point it had started to grow as a habit on them. Less enjoying of it, however, was Jess. She was a problem for Jenna, always slipping off diet, and it was a struggle to keep her on board. She hadn't lost but barely 2 pounds since she had committed, mostly due to her terrible diet. And she had a bad reputation of having WEEKS where she'd skip gym. She was barely hanging on and, if Jenna didn't start getting on her, Jess would be back on track for unhealthiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cycling class was kicking everyone's ass. The instructor had noticed the improvements in most of them, and had stepped up the regimen. However, it was absolute torture on poor jessica, who was barely hanging onto the bike, especially in the standing segments. Sooner or later, the class came to an end. Jessica stepped off the bike first, chugging her \"water\" bottle, which was orange to the point where it looked suspiciously like Orange Soda. They walked down, and Melissa spoke first and foremost, wiping her sweaty forehead. \"God. That one was absolute insanity, wasn't it?\" She had one rather well, surprisingly well for a woman of her gluttony. She seemed to have taken to the meal plan headily, mostly because it meant MORE eating, simply just different things. Alice had continued on a similar path, and she had stuck with the regime. \"Yeah. The instructor was going CRAZY today. I dunno how I kept up.\"  Jenna spoke. \"Well, you did it, that's all that matters.\" Jessica was too worn out for words. She hopped into her car and drove off, Melissa and Alice went jogging away, waving a farewell at Jenna. \"See ya!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna waved her farewells and jogged home. In her mind now, however, was the conundrum of how to fix Jessica. She sincerely wanted Jessica to succeed and didn't want to see her recede into her lethargic, piggy ways. She had her supper: A grilled chicken marinated in olive oil, with sauteed mushrooms, and she went to bed. Jenna awoke for work the next morning, and had a plan together. Through text co-ordination, she had planned to take Jessica to Healthy Life for lunch, instead of her usual fast-food greasepit. She took the stairs, and got to work. When lunchtime rolled around, she met up with the others, and they gathered around Jess's cubicle. As the signal was given, Jenna walked in. \"Hey, Jess!\" The lardy office worker turned around, speaking. \"Oh, hey Jen!\" Jen spoke. \"Hey, uh, the girls and I wanted to take you out to lunch at Healthy life.\" Jess shrugged her shoulders, and complied. They walked downstairs to their cars, drove to Debbie's Gym, and walked to the Cafe. The girls had the special of the day: Turkey, Lettuce, and Tomato sandwich, with some kale chips, apple slices, and whole wheat rolls. \"Look, Jess. We care about you. We want this diet plan to work for you as well as it works for us, but you got to work with me here.\" spoke Jenna. The group of girls nodded. Jess sighed and replied. \"Look, I'm sorry, but it's so hard. So much I have to do at work, so much I have to do at home. I'm strained.\"  Jenna replied. \"Well, we go to the same place. We can do the same stuff. At break, instead of eating out of boredom, how about we do some yoga, or pilates, or just some light stretching in the hallway.\" Jessica wondered, pondering the points. \"Yeah, and you always talk about how you're so out of breath from walking up stairs, if you follow the diet plan, and go to the gym more often, you won't have that problem.\" Jenna placed her hand on Jessica's mid-breast, between her boobs. \"And if you abandon all this, right here's gonna suffer. We want you to live a long time, happy, healthy, with us. We don't want you to get heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, all that stuff. You're killin' yourself, Jess.\" After a long sigh, Jessica replied..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenna awoke to another weekend. She woke up, cooked herself up a pancake with regular batter, fried up some bacon, and sat down to eat. The granola she had before sat untouched atop her fridge as she whipped out some butter and spread it atop the pancake. Ever since the month had begun, everything seemed to have gotten on her back. Not only had there been a massive influx of customers at work, she had less time to get up and do her stretches at work that she had been doing. She had less time to grab the healthier snacks, so she found herself, at her break, back with the girls, talking and, as a part of the usual ceremony, gluttonously chomping down on unhealthy, salty snacks, not to mention the usual, welcome sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit down into the buttery pancakes. She had found some joy that she had lost in that solitary week of dieting and exercise. She wanted to TASTE her food again. She wanted to relive the lifestyle she had been living. After she finished her breakfast, she waddled back over to her couch, sitting on her cushions which squeaked and metallically wailed. She surfed her channels, searching for her Hospital Drama with her hand resting on the vast, flabby fatness that was her stomach.<i> Ah</i>, she thought,<i> Life is good</i>. She felt an itch, though: She felt like she should check something. She hadn't gone to the gym for two weeks and something felt wrong. So when her show had finished about 20 minutes later, she got up, walked over to her electronic scale, and stepped on. The numbers flashed many times, many numbers before it came up to a set of three dots, and finally, a number: 405.5. Jenna sighed. \"Well this is what comes of this.\" She had an internal conflict as she debated this: She had slipped so far that she was now in the 400's. She needed the gym, but...This meant giving up all this comfort, all this nice food, all the sitting on the couch as opposed to cycling her way to hell, feeling like her heart's about to explode and her body's about to run out of sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmid the decision process, a phone call came up. She answered. \"Hello?\" Replying was a familiar voice...</span></div></div>",

On second thought I'd like to join you guys, but I think we should go to Mazelli's Parlor instead. I'll pay. Jessica's tone picked up. \"No problem! I've been meaning to go there but I haven't had the initiative, you know. Too far away from the office. I'll see you there!\" Jess hung up and gathered the pack of other blubbery blimps that encompassed her. Alice had swollen from 340 to 380, Melissa had shot up to the 450's, and Jess was about 390, most of her fat packed away above the belt, though not to neglect her blubbery thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd packed into the Elantra, which was normally a large car, but the throng of Obese women weren't normal. Melissa sported a dress she'd bought with her bonus recently, for preventing an aggressive attempt to buyout the company. Her dress consisted of a gray material with a thin leather sash on the stomach.  Alice wore a White Button-down blouse with frills to the side of the buttons, every roll hugged skin-tight by the blouse. She sported a black skirt, and a pink ascot, to try and hide her double-chin, which had sized up with her gains recently. Jess wasn't feeling so formal, she wore a white shirt, tucked into her worn jeans. She wore a belt to try and keep the pants from sliding off her unscalable belly, which shoved her stomach out, perking it up where it usually had some hang, showing her to be even fatter than her clothes usually let off. They all struggled a bit with the seat belt, Melissa most noticeably, as the seatbelt hit a snag just above her left thigh, on her stomach. 'Uh, jess, can you help?\" Jessica turned to her, she being a little worn out from her own ordeal with it. \"Uh...Sure.. Hold on, lemme catch my breath first.\" The redhead sat there, panting for 30 seconds, until she was ready and took on the seatbelt, and Melissa shoved too. AFter some effort for about 20 seconds, they got the seatbelt buckled, though both girls were worn out and panting. Jessica felt slightly insecure due to the expansion of her doughy, vast belly, not just due to the belt, but also her sitting down, which exaggerated her gains. She drove over to  Mazelli's, and parked out front on the curb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna stood out front of Mazelli's, wearing a pair of Black Yoga Pants which accentuated her evenly fattened rear, and a tight green shirt with short sleeves, which exposed her lardy arms, with an accentuated fat fold at the elbows. She stood out in the summer heat as Jessica's car parked on the curb. The horde of Morbidly Obese Maidens shuffled out of the car and greeted Jenna with a choking hug. \"Jen! Haven't seen you in forever!\" Jenna replied. \"Good to see you too, guys! Let's get in, it's hot out here.\" They shuffled and waddled into the Parlor, which was half a bar, half a pizza joint. The bar had the current Baseball series on, Cardinals versus the Brewers. It was mostly middle-aged men and preppy college kids populating the bar. They waddled through the smell of cigarette smoke into the smell of pizza in the parlor. They sat at a table, as their girth had much restricted their ability to sit in booths. They jawed on about work, \"I heard that Head Management is trying to merge a smaller company into us,\" et cetera. Then it moved on to other problems, until the Pizza arrived, with Pepperoni Toppings and the basic features. The ladies horked down. as Melissa pulled out a pack of cigarettes. \"Melissa, you smoke now?\" Melissa nodded as she held the cigarette in her finger. \"Mmhm. Some of the shit at work and home, I tell ya. My kids just won't shut up, my husband's a whipped little pussy, and these little sticks have really helped me cope.\" Alice spoke. \"Ain't that a turnaround. Speaking of habits, Jenna, how's your Diet and Exercise coming?\" They considered as Jessica sat, feeling the slightest twinge of envy of such a lifestyle, her earlier insecurity added on now by the fact that she realized that she is too fat to sit in a booth. Jenna replied sipmly and curtly, after the slightest bit of thought.</span></div></div>",

At that point she spoke. \"Yeah.. I might take that up though, I couldn't even buckle my seatbelt on the ride over there. I'm pretty sure that's a sign that I need to calm it down. Melissa sighed. \"Pfff. Longevity of life is bullshit anyways. We're all gonna die someday. Way I see it, I'd prefer for it to be faster than 80 years. You guys can do whatever. But I'm gonna be here, puffing, eating, and waiting for that last nail to go into the coffin that got made the day I was born.\" Nigh-instantly, Alice replied with, \"God, no need to go all nihilist on us.\" The obese quartet finished the pizza, and then waddled out to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was dropped off back at her apartment building. After a brief period, she had dinner and went to bed after a brief period on the couch. She awoke the next morning, drove to the local fast food joint, and moved on to work. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The masses of blubbery women waddled out of work, among them Jenna. She huffed, not in exhaustion, but out of sheer aggravation with the day. The reports felt like years to write, everything annoyed her but her beloved usual Pepsi and Cheetos. She waddled to her car, her thighs rubbing against each other. She stuck the keys into the ignition and drove down the road. She checked her rear-view mirror as she went down the road, going about 20 MPH in the jam-packed, sluggish rush-hour traffic. She saw a black Nissan Sentra 2013, and the man in the car seemed a bit twitchy. She got annoyed and couldn't wait until she got home. <i>We all have to go through it, asshole</i>, she thought, <i>Get used to it. This is Baltimore.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally got through the rush-hour traffic and got home about 6:03. She had a dinner date with the girls at 7:20, so she sat down on the couch for a second, and watched the news. The usual: Some crisis in the middle east, old men worrying about the economy, and some jackass doctor talking about how bad obesity was. Jenna wasn't doing too bad, though honestly she wouldn't know, she hadn't seen her doctor since she was 300 pounds. He was talking some nonsense about blood pressure, but she didn't give a rat's ass. Probably just some quack who got his medical lisence off the back of a cereal box. Then something hit the news that caught her eye.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The case of missing girl Bethany Morrison is still gone cold, with few clues, though police have determined one thing: What car the missing girl's kidnapper drove.\" The camera cut to the police chief of baltimore: an older man in his 50's, with some hair, but grey streaks in his hair. \"We've determined from a collection of sources that the killer drives a nissan car, we're not entirely sure yet, but we think it's a 2013 Nissan Sentra.\" Jenna's eyes went a little wide, she shut off the television and hurried over to get ready. She put on a rather tight skirt that was digging into the whale-like blubber of her stomach, and tried to calm herself down. \"They didn't say what color it was. It might have been blue. It might have been green.\" She put on her foundation and went on out to La Piaca, the local italian joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLa Piaca was a very traditional place, brick walls, with the Mediterranean roofing, and it emitted an evil, evil smell of meat smoke and the smell of baking bread. It wasn't quite the most advanced place, nor the most popular place, but it was a cult hit with the few that knew it. Jenna waddled out of the car to meet Jess and the gang. Jess was in tight-fitting jeans and a tee-shirt, Melissa was dressed rather upscale, she looked a little paler than usual, almost like a star of the 1920's. Her second chin was looking extra pronounced tonight. Alice wore a dress blouse and some dress pants, held up by a belt that shoved an extra shelf of her fat over the edge. The flock of fatties greeted each other, calling each other's names and hugging in a great collection of a hug. They then waddled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, they fit right in with the waitresses. They clearly had sampled the menu: Ample, fat ladies who all had to be at the absolute least, 200 pounds. Almost like the culinary version of Gordge Inc. A fat lady took them to their table in the smoking section, and Melissa lit up her first cigarette of the night while the girls struck up conversation. Orders came around. \"Hey ladies, what are we drinking tonight?\" Melissa spoke after a drag on her cigarette. \"I'll have a regular coke.\" Alice followed. \"Sweet tea.\"  Jenna spoke. \"Sweet tea.\" Then, she got around to Jessica. \"Water, please.\" The waitress walked off. Melissa spoke. \"Yeah, you're ordering water tonight.\" She turned to the rest of the table. \"...But watch her order a regular coke next time we go out.\" Jessica grunted. \"Go ahead and make fun while you smoke and eat yourself into an early grave. I'm sticking with it this time.\" Melissa rolled her eyes. \"Mmm-hmm. Yeah. I'll believe it when I see it.\" The conversation continued until the Waitress brought drinks. Jessica spoke with a bit of anger. \"Look, it's different this time, okay? I'm going to eat healthy tonight. I even bought a gym membership!\" The waitress handed around the drinks, not interfering with the conversation. Alice spoke up. \"Well, you're just, like, overreacting. Melissa, no need to make fun of her. If she wants to diet, let her diet.\" Melissa shrugged and got back to her cigarette. Jessica spoke to the table but edged her voice more towards her. \"I heard JoAnne from Accounting had to go to the hospital this weekend. Something about Cardiac Arrest?\" Alice spoke. \"Her mom had cardiac problems, so did her grandma. It was genetic.\" Jenna spoke. \"Though, you have to say, the pounds didn't help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe debate took a pause, as the waitress came to take food orders. Melissa ordered the Chicken Parmesan, Jenna ordered Chicken Alfredo, ALice ordered a small 4-slice pizza, and it came around to Jessica. After a second of debate, she ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. The debate took a second and Alice looked at Melissa. \"You know, I never have smoked. How does it feel?\" Melissa spoke. \"It's kind of a precise thing, care to try one?\" Alice shrugged. \"One won't kill me.\" Melissa handed her a cigarette. \"You know how to hold it, by the filter. Kind of prepare yourself for it to taste bad.\" Alice fidgeted with it for a second before putting it in her mouth. She looked oddly at the cigarette, feeling odd. Melissa handed her the lighter. \"Before you light it, exhale.\" Alice did as told. \"Light it, and when you do, breathe in a bit..\" She did so, and exhaled after a second. Her eyes widened. \"Wow. This actually feels pretty good!\" Melissa spoke. \"If you want, finish it. Just try not to put the smoke right in your face. You'll cough more than usual.\" Alice gave her first few coughs after her next drag, and the conversation topic shifted after the fourth drag. \"That's how you're gonna take over the world, Melissa, isn't it: An army of fat smokers?\" quipped Jenna. Melissa chuckled. \"Damn straight. Blow smoke in everyone's faces until they surrender.\" Alice sunk into the cigarette, smoking in a rhythmic pattern until the cigarette had burned about a quarter way down, patting it out in the tray. The food arrived soon, and the girls dug in, Alice hadn't ordered as much, and when it came time for dessert, she turned it down, as did Melissa. Jessica ordered a fruit plate, and Jenna ordered some Tiramisu cake. After that, and Alice's second cigarette, which she smoked during dessert, the girls exited the restaurant, said their goodbyes, and went out to the parking lot, Alice following after Melissa.

She was watchful as she pulled into the apartment parking lot, looking for the Nissan, ensuring she wasn't being followed. After this, she carefully walked to the apartment, tense and nervous as she had ever been. When she got inside her apartment, she locked the door. Feeling especially careful tonight, she deadbolt-locked it.  After this, she nervously sat down on the couch. No more news tonight. She watched a local improv show, and then shut off her TV. This friday was far from the usual calm friday night. Her weekend was going to need some extra relaxing. After a few laughs to calm her down and a nice, long shower, she dressed down to her underwear, and went to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke in the morning, had a mug of coffee, and cooked herself some breakfast: Bacon and Pancakes. As she sat down to munch, she flipped on to the news. Last night's worries had gone away, and the same old, same old was on the news. Nothing worrying today. No talk about the Nissan. Everything was okay, the problem didn't exist. She could spend some time at the pool, the weather was getting warmer.  Eventually she decided to do just that. A lazy day out at the pool. She slipped into her favorite bikini, which tightly hugged at her fat shoulders, giving it the 'Baked Bread' look. She started giving working out a second thought, she liked bikinis, but this wouldn't fit her in another 20 pounds. But not today, today she'd bum it at the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove there, her massive stomach hanging heavily over her bottom, covering it entirely. She took a second to set up her towel at a suitable spot, lounging for a bit to get her tan on. On one of her tanning cycles, she slipped a look across the pool. She saw a musclebound man with his eyes pinned on her. With her shades on, he didn't even know she was looking back. She decided not to spoil his view, as not many enjoyed the view of a 400+pound woman in a bikini, tanning. She planned it out in her head. She got up from tanning, setting her tanning oil on the table beside her, and hopped into the pool. As she paddled past the man's place on the loungers, she splashed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of this venture... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note by Chapter Author: This is Fatboy, this is my alt.)</span></div></div>",

And Jenna, whilst speaking to herself all so here in a mutter like tone of voice, had rubbed her really colossal belly that had ended up really packed and bulging really rock hard from how much she had eaten even for one as fat as one like her, even though alas it had left her with an all of the more insatiable an appetite and yet also feeling quite full all whilst for the very first time since some time ago before starting her respective office work job at where she had it all up at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Jenna had been sitting herself on her couch as she had her feasts of pizzas of various types with all manner of good stuff to go with it of the typical and stereotypical types like garlic bread and saving pepperoni types for last, then having dessert feasts of various types with all manner of good stuff to go with it of described types and washing it all down with lots of milk all of the while whilst saving chocolates flavoured types of dessert feasts for last.

Slowly Jenna had ended up as one who began absent-mindedly gently tiredly sleepily patting and rubbing her belly soothingly. After Jenna sat on her couch for a little while, she had then with yet another a brief struggle gotten herself up from off of her couch and then strode-walked towards her bedroom\u2019s bed in a waddle like fashion, her small yet still slightly bubbly rear swaying up and down like some ship at sea, her hips swaying with ease and her belly rumbling and packed and really having bulged out as she had waddled to her bedroom and placed herself on her bed, rubbing her belly even as she had lain there on her bed, slowly yet surely falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

Basically, she didn't really care how fat she'd be keeping on getting as a result of her eating habits, she didn't care if her eating habits would cause her to keep getting fatter and fatter, she didn't care how fat she ever was - even getting at that - also -  she didn't care about currently how fat she was at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore then, she used the same sources from the company she worked for to get literally tons of candy bags for her to graze on. Even before the end of Halloween night of that week during that year in this storyline and its version directions, it was enough for her to offer candies in all three bowls meant for kids to gather during that Halloween Night of that day of that week during that year. Before then, Jenna had at least done enough good work ethics to be offered to have her office job from the company she worked for be converted into a part time job she would take on at home that would only require her answering a few phone calls, attending a few phone conferences, answering work, business and other such emails, etc., etc., and a few other things that basically <i>did</i> <i>not</i> take long. Currently, it was a Friday, the 30th of the current October of a year at this point, and Jenna would soon be having a Non-Halloween Candy Bag, other \"sweet kinds of foods\" including cookies and other such foods type of feast. Currently, though, with the same aforementioned \"company resources\", she had <i>literally</i> ordered twenty boxes of extra large pizzas of every \"mere cheese pizza\" type, twenty of every pizza, twenty pizza boxes in turn of each \"meat\" type topping that could be named in twenty of every of those in twenty of all these sets and styles, twenty boxes of every \"crust\" type for these extra large pizzas in twenty sets of every one of them, twenty extra large pizzas of these types that added garlic bread sticks, every other types of such goods as well as twenty extra large pizza boxes with every one of these types of these extra large pizzas with every desert type in every set, form, etc., and every pizza restaurant desert in twenty sets of every type in chocolaty formats.

After her \"Friday\" \"Feast\", she had gotten herself into a position where she had been feeling <i>really</i>, <i>really</i> \"full\". Yet she was also still feeling hungry and yet also wasn't feeling as such right now. Jenna was also having a little problem from a slightly and yet really painful \"stomach ache\" and an attack from hearty hiccups. \"*HIC* Ow. For *HIC*! *HIC* OW *HIC*! OW! *HIC* *GASP* *HIC* OW! OW *HIC*! OH *HIC*!*HIC*! *HIC*! *HIC*! *HIC*! *HIC*! *HIC*! *HIC*! *HIC*! *HICCUP*! *HICCUP*! *HIC* *HIC* HIC* *HIC* *HILP* *HILP* *HILP* *HILP*! *HIC* This ... *HIC* UGGH!

This food tastes soooo good! *HIC*! Owwww, my belly. It really hurts yet I don't care!\" She then mumbled. She was suddenly having another attack of gasps and hearty hiccups that lasted for only thirty minutes, ending the current hour this was at. At this point, her \"single belly\" type of a fat belly had bulged out eighty times as much  as it had during the moment that she had gotten twice as fat as she had been during her weigh-in that led her to finding out her weight of three hundred and eighty pounds only for that weight gain of Jenna's to have been ignored and increased twice as much before and now had increased twice as much as even that. It was all the while at this point that she was sitting on her couch. She was now feeling very tired. And she fell asleep. Eventually, Saturday October 31st Halloween Day and Night of the year this storyline, its versions, their directions, etc., take place in. She had a \"hearty breakfast\" that caused her to get twice as fat as the night before during the morning of that day and night, a \"brunchfast &amp; brunch\" feast combination at 11:00 AM that lasted only a few seconds that caused her to get literally <i>eight</i> times as fat than before that \"feast\", a lunch later on during its afternoon's starting that caused her to get eight times as and thus bigger and fatter than that at the same time, then finally a \"pizza feast\" dinner she ordered like the one from the night before to arrive at her home at 5:00 PM - in enough time for her to have her \"pizza feast\" dinner like the one from the night before that was eight times larger - only it ended up lasting until 5:02 PM. She then got to her \"desert feast\" like the kind that she had before but was eighty times larger than that with it lasting until 5:04 PM - all the while like the night before - with Jenna in a pajama clothing set that consisted both with blue colors for shirt and pants of said pajama pair - with the shirt being enough to cover her now shrunken and small breasts and the pants being big enough to cover her now shrunken and small backside as well as her still big and fattened and swollen and widened hips with the pair of pajamas clothing of blue color being made with a stretchable fabric and yet becoming increasingly super snug on Jenna - all the while with her back and her big fat belly of a stomach being left for completely bare exposure, then eventually, 6:00 PM arrived, with it being the start of \"Halloween Night Trick Or Treat\" \"ers\" 's time during Halloween Night and lasting from there until 8:00 PM where she was residing. Unlike the previous \"Halloween\", it lasted with only Four groups of \"trick or treat\" kids and their families, etc., etc., coming to her home's front door area. She had saved the candies in the three extra large bowls meant for these kids' groups, this time, and from there, it turned out these three extra large bowls were still full enough with \"Halloween\" candy along with all the other Halloween Candy bag piles placed in all the other extra large bowls with it all being enough to last for months in tons and still enough for Jenna to graze on within an amount of time lasting from 8:00 PM until 9:00 PM with Jenna still having LOTS of other \"regular \"candy bags\"\" and LOTS of other types of \"desert types of sweets and other such foods\" in eighty times as much quantities as the previous Halloween for Jenna since being employed by the company she was working for and in fact eighty times more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Trick or Treat\" time in the neighborhood where Jenna's home was located at was now ended. For Jenna, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three groups of kids had come and gone, it was actually 7:00 PM by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had just gotten ready for her aforementioned \"feasts\" of \"desert and other such types\" of \"foods\" among \"goods\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was set up in piles in front of her in her main floor living room area with her being on her main couch in it with it all in front of her. She absentmindedly, gently, sleepily and soothingly rubbed her rounded out, ballooned outwards, bloated, swollen and huge gut for a round and big, round, big and fat round, big, fat and swollen, fat big and round, rounded out, ballooned outwards, bloated, swollen and huge round, big fat belly of a stomach in eagerness and excitement because of it all being what she was craving. She was <i>clearly</i> <i>too</i> <i>addicted</i> to care about what it was all doing to her body. She was craving for it all and she wanted it all, just because of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*HMMMMMMMHHH*! *HIC* This is the *HICCUP* life! I am absolutely *HIC* enjoy this!\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got straight to work. All the while without caring about it causing her sphere-shaped stylized, swollen and enormously round and big, fat belly to grow several times as big and fat.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't going to be able to keep calling her mom over to help her out of bed. Jenna was lost in thought but was suddenly interrupted when her massive belly started to clench inside of her. Her breakfast had been so puny compared to what Jenna usually liked to munch on, so she was going to have to rectify that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna dressed in what ever business attire semi fit, and took off for the day. Her first stop was the local Denny's where the wait staff knew her well, and she could enjoy endless Pancakes and Coffee. Jen liked to order a few side dishes on the side the keep things interesting, but easily put away a dozen plates of pancakes to start off the day. Next she did a drive through at the donut shop picking up a couple dozen. Her office supplied free endless donuts to the staff, along with bagels and other things, one of the reasons she had started to gain weight when she joined the office, but getting these few extra on the side would help her get her morning started right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the last stop before work was breakfast burrito place. Multiple bags of greasy meat, cheese, and egg filled burritos were in the arms of the lovable fluffy office worker. The 680 lb fatty did her best to scarf it all down before she strolled into work and a nice 10:30 in the morning, several hours late.</span></div></div>",

When Jenna had arrived, they had all but already set up tons and tons and tons and tons of food for her to eat up all of after her small work amounts were attended to and then had presented her with literally increasingly several times much more and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of food,  and even after her even-at-these-current-points-kept-by-her-secret-incident involving her bed-related difficulties she somehow was still feeling hungry even after the large breakfast that she got on her way up to work here and proceeded to eat up all of when she got in and in fact several tons of times hungrier even than when she had first started her very work job position that she had in the time amount she had it in and this was and is partly due to how some of the tons of foods she was eating up were with \u201csome shake drink powder like stuff\u201d in them that had caused them all to become addictive upon even one bite and so she was hooked onto them all with them all being what had literally increased literally several times much more than ever before her having started her job work position her already seemingly enormously colossally gigantically hugely uncontrollably insatiably humongous unbridled appetite, including amongst them foods that had not yet so but still were close to \u201chaving expired\u201d, with them and all of the other tons of food contributing to what had caused Ms. Jenna to as a result of eating up all of thus grow bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and grow fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter with her now already hugely massive single-belly becoming colossally gargantuan and colossally bloated and colossally swollen and colossally fat and all of the whole while whilst several times much more so and/or persay than it had ever been so whether from even before and/or even during the very start of the very beginning of her very starting to be enduring some \u201cweight gain\u201d or even than all of the very foods which thus and whilst all but as a result of \u201cher overeating all of\u201d had ended up ever going through and ending up ever enduring any at all of \u201cher ending up becoming one who grew big and big and fat and fat and all but as such grew bigger and bigger and fatter and fatter\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Now</i> <i>I</i> <i>really</i> <i>think</i> <i>that</i> <i>it</i> <i>is</i> <i>time</i> <i>for</i> <i>me</i> <i>to</i> <i>ensure</i> <i>to</i> <i>stop</i> <i>over</i> <i>here</i> <i>all</i> <i>of</i> <i>my</i> <i>over</i> <i>here</i> <i>overeating</i> <i>or</i> <i>else</i> <i>my</i> <i>own</i> <i>self</i> <i>will</i> <i>end</i> <i>up</i> <i>so</i> <i>fat</i> <i>that</i> <i>it</i> <i>will</i> <i>surely</i> <i>cause</i> <i>me</i> <i>to</i> <i>end</i> <i>up</i> <i>on</i> <i>my</i> <i>own</i> <i>whilst</i> <i>completely</i> <i>immobile</i>.\u201d Thought Jenna, yet it was not like she liked and not like she hated for she simply just did not care about \u201chow big and big and fat and fat or how bigger and bigger and fatter and fatter that she got or was or even so much as would remain or become or keep on getting\u201d for as long as she could still eat and if she could still eat then she would still eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Jenna, as stated from earlier, was presented throughout all morning and all afternoon over here with more tons and more tons of those and these and all manners of more tons and more tons and more tons of \u201cunhealthy types\u201d among breakfast appetizer, breakfast and lunch appetizer and lunch and snack and dessert type foods and increasingly several times much more tons of them both before and after her completing her small work amounts and all but increasingly even much more several times much more tons of food with the same being true with her typically chosen work day snack and sweet food snack types of foods as well and fancy and other types of dessert foods thus including cakes etc, etc, in tons of mounds of including donuts and pastries and other such food types all morning and afternoon long. And Jenna indeed so had yet welcomed even so much as every single little scrap that she was given. Now Jenna\u2019s low-rank-carrying coworkers could have caused her to have gotten herself possibly and/or potentially written up whilst for even-unintended incidental exposure, though they were convinced indeed that at those and these points truly so that was and still is what would have been a minor infraction compared to what she indeed really had deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of those who had brought her her foods were encouraging her to eat up as a part of what they had in mind and left whilst snickering and whispering words.

Indeed Jenna yes knew so yet most very especially since a year ago that she had quite such a so uncontrolled and endless feeling and quite so rather really absolutely uncontrollably massively unbridled appetite yet alas all but she liked eating and the more she ate, the more she had craved for a chance to be one who did so and the more she ate as a constant ever so increasing result of it all, the more was it the case that as a result of it all was it that all but thus so she grew wider and and wider and rounder and rounder and more huge and more huge and quite so so bigger and bigger and fatter and fatter, and so yet most very especially as her ever constantly really absolutely increasingly truly already massive round single-sphere-shaped-twenty-four-times-massive-boulder-sized bloated round swollen fat belly had yet continued to have managed to be expanding and had thus so wide-wards and so ever upwards thus here had ballooned ever outward, struggling to make room for all the-feeling-like-endless-food-supplies\u2019-massive-tons being devoured by her, and yet somehow with her very partly feeling some of it all as if it were somehow \u201call pressing against the roof of\u201d her belly. As Jenna\u2019s swollen gut for a belly had expanded and ballooned whilst at the-quite-so-alarming-feeling-exploding-like-rate that it had so, the buttons on her dark blue like grey stretchable work shirt above her grey stretchable non-buttoned-type-and-regular-shirt and as so well as the button on her stretchable-work-black-like-dark-blue-jeans-pants had fought very gallantly to contain, yet however, her belly was spilling out in really every possible gap all as if like rising dough, spilling from over her waistband of her said pants clothing, yes so indeed even pushing down its zipper, and soon enough spilling out of its opening. The button on said work pants had struggled quite so very desperately whilst to hold in her belly, even as how it was that her big fat belly was ending up as what was \u201cspilling out\u201d whilst in really every single direction whilst of all of really every single one of all of \u201creally every single a possible direction\u201d all as if like \u201crising up and all here so yet quite all so bloated and round and swollen and all quite so rather incredibly very fat dough\u201d that was \u201cspilling right out of\u201d her pants\u2019 opening all so after pushing its zipper down and pushing her non-work shirt of mentioned type all up somehow whilst at it all, and so here all with even the slightest move could so she hear the chair beneath her creak and groan albeit very slightly even as she tried herself to be \u201cholding all by sucking her round belly in\u201d which became a little so more difficult the more she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs This Current Workday had started to draw to a close and the low rank co-workers had started to head home they had left more and more tons of food for her to eat, even as workers of ranks and/or levels like that of herself and ones she was friends with like Jessica Patterson for example did remain even if for one more hour after the low rank holding co-workers had left, one among them was a thin and yet also a little muscular and sweet-hearted male worker from this company building\u2019s \u201cIT Unit\u201d named Tom also had remained in such time amounts as this. And Tom also was a friend of Jenna since their college/university time\u2019s final year with him befriending her right before it was all ending after she showed him kindness by completely verbally silencing a few fellow students who were whispering words about and snickering about him from behind his back, as a result of which event did he find himself attracted to her despite whatsoever even minor weight issues she had back then or even afterwards, even as \u201cshe had grown so fat as she had\u201d, and still did they remain as friends of each other yet one other reason for \u201call her weight gain\u201d was because Tom in secret was also delivering increasingly enormously massive tons of food to her home and yet so only recently did she find out about that and his also delivering absolutely equally enormous and massive tons of food to her during work time and yet still even then, she was not ever even as so much as even \u201cjust a little bit\u201d even enraged with but instead if so really anything, had found herself as starting to see in him such a good friend as one good enough to \u201ctruly really know how to treat and spoil her\u201d and soon enough had she started to reciprocate his attraction to her and they then started out \u201csome quite so secret romantic relationship whilst with each other\u201d, and in fact so very frequently as their first two years at where they worked at had passed on by, he would even start to sometimes \u201cvery personally feed her\u201d, and this all was \u201cmusic to her ears\u201d, as he did not at all \u201cever mind feeding nor catering to all the desires and requirements and needs and wants alike all whilst of\u201d her and she had come to all of the more truly really \u201cenjoy all his company and presence with her\u201d and in fact as it would all turn out was it that she had come to find herself thinking the likes of \u201cOh I say that he is <i>so</i> <i>cute</i>.\u201d, which also was and is why they so had even \u201cstarted out their secret romantic relationship\u201d, which itself was a few days ago which all itself was when she discovered his giving to her all of the described food amounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Tom had come by her office work cubicle work office room area place. \u201cHey Jenna. Here I was just curious if maybe you would like for me to have dinner with you at your place or something like that, yet so you choose.\u201d Said Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jenna looked up and smiled at and said to him, \u201cOh Tom, why yes, of course would myself like that.\u201d Said Jenna all so really very truly excitedly had said, \u201cFirst Tom, yet do please just let me finish these.\u201d As Jenna had spoken, she gestured with her head to the massive tons of food and massive tons of containers of food still left, and with that had her boyfriend stood very slightly stunned yet began to be \u201cdrinking it all in\u201d or so to say as she started with after having grabbed and then opened the first of all those of containers, which had two quadruple cheeseburgers and four hot dogs each with a dozen times extra large amount of fries within it, and so did she see to it that she began to devour it all. As Jenna ate up all the food in that and went on all so over to the next several tons of food containers which had another of said types of food as well as with some fried chicken fingers inside of twenty four amounts too, followed by two dozen total containers really every single one of each of various types of pizza within family sized forms like all so whilst for \u201cSuper Bowl Dinner Events\u201d most so very especially of cheese and cheese-and-also-pepperoni and also cheese-and-pepperoni-and-meat-lovers types of pizza and she very surprising fly for her - not that she either knew or care about it all - yet so not really only was it that none of the sauce stained her clothing but also she ate it all very speedily and often had combined some slices as she ate them, and went to containers of the likes of various Indian Asian and Middle Eastern curried meats that she ate with naan and/or other such breads and still without making a mess of her clothing even via the sauces with the same as true for the several amounts of food from among Italian Types very especially including of Chicken Parmisagn and red sauced pasta and spaghetti with red sauce and/or meatballs which she used a fork and knife for all of no matter the several tons of amounts of all of and then stakes etc and then returned to hand use starting with the calamari and red sauce still without making messes then went to eat all the roast skin chicken then tons more fries and hot dogs and burgers, all as her office chair truly deeply struggled to stay put despite how big and fat Jenna was getting especially in her belly, not that she knew or noticed or cared about it yet still, as it happened,  Tom stood and watched as Jenna\u2019s belly ballooned and bulged more, even with it being that \u201cJenna was oblivious to just how fat she got to focusing more on eating than how increasingly exhaustingly laborious holding in her belly became\u201d. Still Jenna grabbed and opened all the tons of sweet snack and dessert foods of all kinds she liked and loved to eat and starting with eclairs began to devour them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jenna and Tom heard popping and breaking sounds as said buttons \u201clost the fight and launched across her room\u201d and said zipper completely lowered itself down and said non work shirt pushed up over her belly and her chair gave in and broke, thudding her to the floor via her small yet bubbly rear as she ate her last twelve at once and her belly burst fourth more exposed and swollen. A Hiccuping Embarrassed Jenna tried to but found too much of her gut exposed to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jenna, worry not, you can use my jacket to cover it and I\u2019ll get you home.\u201d Said Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*HIC* Thanks Tom, *HUP* you\u2019re sweet.\u201d Said Jenna, who like a woman twenty four months overdue pregnant with twelve sons and daughters all then tried lifting her belly as she struggled but failed to and got up only with his help, getting her up home.</span></div></div>",

Her already massive belly ballooned ever outward, to make room for the endless supply of food. As it expanded the buttons on her shirt and skirt fought gallantly to contain Jenna, however her belly was spilling out every possible gap like rising dough, spilling over her waistband of her skirt. It had pushed down the zipper of her skirt, and spilling out of the opening. The button on the skirt struggled desperately, to hold her belly in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith even the slightest move she could hear the chair beneath her creak and groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the workday came to a close, and Jenna\u2019s coworkers started to heading home, except for Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was also worked at the office as well and befriended Jenna. He didn\u2019t hide that he was a fat admirer as well as a feeder.  This was music to Jenna\u2019s ears as she enjoy his company and though he was cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, popped into her office.  \u201cAre you ready for Netflix and Chill, at my place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, just let me finish these.\u201d Jenna said excitedly. She grabbed the box, opened it and started to devour the first eclair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly sounds of popping was heard as the buttons losing the fight was launched across the room. Her belly no longer constrained burst forth, from it\u2019s prison and sat there exposed and jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe embarrassed trying to cover the exposed part of her gut, but there was too much to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry you can use my jacket to cover it and I will drive you home.\u201d Tom said putting and hand on her shoulder to try confirm her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. You are a great boyfriend. \u201d She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hand on her desk, and tried to stand up. Like a women 9 months pregnant with quadruplets, she struggled to lift her belly into the air to get on her feet, and she got halfway up but, gravity was not her friend, and collapsed back into the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me! I eaten too much.\u201d She said almost crying looking down at her protruding belly. \u201cIt is so big and heavy, my mom had to come over to help me out of bed!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s trapping me in this chair.\u201d Jenna said crying. \u201cI probably too fat even for you now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, the bigger it is the harder I am.\u201d He whispered into her ear softly, kissing her cheek. \u201cAnd, feel how soft it is.\u201d He took her hand ran it across her exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the soft warm blubber ran through her fingers, a feeling of joy ran thought her. \u201cHow do it feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled his ear to her lips. \u201cLike you better get me back to your place before I cream myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen lets get you up.\u201d He grabbed both for her hands and pulled her to her feet. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile Tom somehow got Jenna home and all of the while before then he got all containers of food that Jenna ever received inside his vehicle and into his place as well. It was a bit of a struggle as he had helped Jenna on inside. His place was like one of those fancy houses among types of homes with four floors with three of them being above a basement floor that were not really mansions or manors but still pretty nice and fancy or so to say, over here, as a factual matter. Tom\u2019s Parents were all but both privately wealthy and with some help from them and some friends of their own including ones among them who were friends of himself also he got his home and enough money with it to have him thus be \u201ccompletely set up whilst for life\u201d again here or so to say and indeed so all but thus sincerely even Miss Jenna could only look at its outside and inside with quite an incredibly-beyond absolutely most impressed look on her face as the got in and yet even more so when he helped her downstairs through into a basement floor that had many rooms including a basement floor kitchen alongside the main floor kitchen and basement floor dining room alongside the main floor dining room and a basement floor living room alongside the main floor living room along with in fact six basement floor bathrooms and twelve basement floor bedrooms that were each like basement floor bedroom-living room combinations and all of the whole while whilst because of her seemingly endless one of a beyond insiatiably unbridled appetite, the fat young lady really struggled to refrain from drooling when she saw that Tom had been arranging whilst for all of this to have on the basement floor living room table and the other tables in the basement floor room located tables multiple huge feasts that indeed whilst as confirmed by Tom were meant for her to \u201cgo on ahead and dig into all of\u201d or so to say and all composed of all of the foods that she was eating earlier during today combined with all of the foods that she had ever eaten before whilst starting from back when she had been enduring her final high school years and all of her college/university years combined with when she had started her job position at where she had worked at with that being also where all but whilst in enough time had met and been befriended by and soon ended up in a romantic-feelings-caused-boyfriend-and-girlfriend relationship with Tom with all of those described foods being what had happened to have caused for her to have been one all but thus indeed so who had \u201cended up all but thus indeed so \u201cgoing through extremely serious belly-expanding-and-belly-swelling weight gain\u201d\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Tommy, you-are-so-sweet-and-cute-and-amazing!\u201d Said Jenna so eagerly and hungrily even though from all of the effort put into her being brought here had somehow not done that to Tom but nonetheless had still indeed absolutely tired her out and had left her for feeling indeed at the very least or so to say literally multiple tons of multiple times much more feeling beyond incredibly so very hungry than she had ever at all felt before even once whilst in her entire life. So Tom helped her down to a couch-bed that had already been converted from its couch form whilst in the basement floor living room and thus had helped her down in order for her to sit and lay herself down onto the bed form of the couch-bed and soon her belly had began to have begun to have been rumbling for more food for her to all but eat all of up and after Tom had done thus so, he then kissed the both of her cheeks and then whatsoever thus so indeed he could or so to say at the very least here thus all but the both of the sides of her neck and had then proceeded to set up everything whilst in order for him to bring up some food to her. Afterwards Jenna soon had placed all of the both of her hands on her beyond-absolutely-incredibly-immensely-gigantically massively massive belly as she had ended up as one who had been struggling some more to refrain from drooling as she had now began eagerly anticipating her feasts to eat up - and it was 5:00 PM as this had all occurred so fortunately whilst at least in her opinion and yet at the same time actually indeed thus so here there was enough time for her to have them all eaten up all whilst by her and thus she had begun to have began to be eagerly anticipating them and all of the whole while whilst in the company of her cute and sweet hearted boyfriend who she secretly thus so had all but whilst in secret as a nickname for him \u201cGentleman Tom\u201d as he had secretly for her thus indeed so here a nickname whilst in all but thus so \u201cLady Jenna\u201d and all but from throughout all but all of the whole while whilst perhaps thus with him all but respectivey indeed thus over here proceeding to be \u201cfeeding her\u201d.</span></div></div>",

Yet Jenna had welcomed every single bit and every single little piece of every single little serving of every single little scrap. And all of those foods were the same as what she was eating before her arrival at Tom\u2019s Place and all foods she had ever eaten that had caused her to have gone through her \u201cweight gain\u201d since her starting her job work position all combined and with mountains of tons of food that were with the same stuff about it all inside of it all that had increased her appetite and carried addictive stuff about it in turn and such amounts with more and more of that very stuff about it all and such amounts but without such stuff at all amongst such foods - and also her boyfriend Tom was saving the ones without it all for last especially including for the sweet food types including desert types here. And Tom watched for a bit as Jenna had seen to it that she had eaten it all up, not giving a single care that as a result of it all here, her very huge and very so incredibly very fat bulging \u201csingle belly\u201d was growing wider and wider and rounder and wider and bulging more and more wideward and upward and outward and growing more ballooned out and ballooned up and more ballooned out and ballooned up and more blown up and blown out and more  blown up and blown out bloated and more bloated and more swollen and more swollen and growing bigger and bigger and growing fatter and fatter and thus she herself was growing bigger and bigger and fatter and fatter and all of the while at that several times more so than she had ever been at all since starting her work position and as well as since before her arrival at Tom\u2019s Place all combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty Minutes later on, Ms. Jenna all but thus so had devoured the amounts she had eaten up whilst in a jiffy with these amounts being what Tom had thus arranged to be for her to eat up through the ways he had done so as described previously here. And Tom himself was feeling ever so more yet still only slightly hardened down below or so to say here. And Jenna had been gently and tiredly and sleepily along with unconsciously and absentmindedly rubbing her belly very soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jenna, you still feeling hungry?\u201d Asked Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jenna had placed both her hands on top of her belly as she had let out a hearty hiccup as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*HIC-HICCUP-HYULP-HILP* Oh Tom, oh truly indeed quite so here for sure.\u201d Muttered Jenna as she had patted her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tom had presented twenty four dozen times more and more tons and tons of each and every single one of all of the described foods with more of that described stuff in it and with it at all and without it at all indeed alike as the smell of it all had reached Jenna\u2019s Nose, and truly was it smelling delicious indeed whilst to her the very fat woman with such a seemingly endlessly unsatisfiable appetite as what she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jenna had really right then and there squeed in great delight, clapping her hands eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-Tom-you-are-so-amazing!!!!!!!!\u201d Squealed Jenna as she had pulled Tom close up enough to her to pull him into a great hug and had kissed her boyfriend right on both of his cheeks. And Tom had blushed in modesty as he had brought more and more and more mountains of tons of food for his girlfriend Jenna whilst to eat up. As Jenna proceeded to eat it all up, Tom had brought it all up in as many mountains of many tons of food as possible and then sat beside her as closely as he could, getting just a little bit more harder here or so to say. Unsurprisingly Jenna all but indeed so was eating up those mountains of tons of food even after so many of them that they were piling up as much as they were so, and her belly had bulged and bulged our more and more etc, and all whilst with her having done so with unashamed uncaringness whilst about \u201chow fat she was\u201d.

Ms. Jenna\u2019s weight was within a gigantically small bit of her small yet still bubbly rear end and as well as within a greatly gigantically huge amount from within her hips, yet her indeed so \u201cmost very prominent type of feature \u201cas far whilst as\u201d \u201cweight gain\u201d \u201cever goes\u201d\u201d was her so much very indeed gargantuan stylezed incredibly enormously colossally gigantically hugely bloated swollen round big fat greatly bloated and most incredibly distended rock hard \u201cvery huge single belly\u201d for a so much very indeed gargantuan stylezed incredibly enormously colossally gigantically hugely bloated and round and swollen and very incredibly hugely giant and gigantically huge and bloated and very incredibly huge swollen and round big fat belly of a stomach. Truly Jenna had felt a huge amount of pleasure from eating so many mountains of tons of such delicious foods as what she had eaten with that very described pleasure being what and which had felt most directly linked to a massively massive and as well as incredibly rock hard feeling thus so over here whilst in her middle. And Jenna, in her semi-comatose like state, laid where she had so whilst both of her eyes were closed and yet with her mouth as what had been what was all wide and open and and her mouth and lips curled into a dreamy smile and indeed whilst as her mouth was open it was so and was serving whilst as what was being a passageway for and as well here whilst as a passageway of very incredibly deep and labored breaths. Indeed Jenna, as every bit as incredibly very so fat as a very fat woman so fat that it was enough for her to be and as every bit as incredibly pathetically out of shape as she was, nonetheless was wheezing whilst in the middle of her attempting to be trying to catch her breath, even though her very greatly incredibly enormously hugely so pleasurably pleasurable feeling yet still so somehow gigantically dull pain in her belly had ended up restricting her breathing somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*MMMMMMMMFFFFFFFF*-*HICHILP* *HICHILP* Oh My *HILP* *HILP* *HIC* *HIC* Serious Goodness *HIC* *HIC* *HILP* *HILP*. *HICHILP* *HICHILP* Wow I *HICCUP* *HICCUP* am really *HILP* *HILP* feeling so *HILP* *HILP* *HILP* *HILP* *HIC* *HIC* absolutely fuuuullllllllllll *HIC* *HIC* *HIC* *HIC* *HICHULP* *HICHULP* *HILP* *HILP* *HILP*.\u201d Huffed Jenna whilst rubbing her rock hard swollen humongously hugely enormously bloated and distended and swollen huge single belly for a hugely big fat belly of a stomach, and yet here so some would say that whilst in consideration with the sheer incredibly enormously fat woman that Ms. Jenna indeed had become as a result of eating so much as she had, this was really saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tom was watching her eat up so much of all the food amounts that she had up to this point and was watching her belly grow and grow and end up so packed and bulging swollen with more and more thus of all of the foods that she was eating up, and whilst doing so, he found himself struggling for nothing ever so undesirable to happen to him as he found himself ever so just a little bit more hard or so to say. Yet Tom still had more and more of mountains and mountains of tons and tons of trays of platters of food some of which had the stuff about it all and which did not,  although there were several times much more here of such described amounts amongst what did not have such stuff - and more such amounts also amongst dessert types of foods, all thus whilst with Tom intending to stuff them all into Jenna, saving all respectively here of the dessert foods amongst ones with that stuff in them and not so for last - the dessert types of foods having more of such amounts without it - and intending to stuff them all into Jenna and not stop until they were all completely gone with. And Tom had also started to get slightly worn out thus whilst from out of the trips he was making even though it did not take long for him to bring them all. Though Jenna could still smell it all and feel like wanting to eat them all up especially considering how massive and indeed here as well as seemingly endless as her appetite had been known to have been what had become thus so over here, thus causing a flame to start tickling inside her belly that was her appetite itself. Though Jenna was left by all of this whilst for ending up in the mood for more foods to eat up, still all but alas, Ms. Jenna truly sincerely here so indeed was simply just feeling too full and tired to even do so much as even want to try to eat anymore thus whilst for the time being at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jenna, you still feeling hungry?\u201d Asked Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Tom, ...... *MMMMFFFF* *MMMMFFFF* *HICHILP* *HICHILP* *HIC* *HIC* *HILP* *HILP* seriously no, dear handsome.\u201d Wheezed Jenna incredibly weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tom, right whilst on cue, had immediately begun slamming mouthfuls after mouthfuls of several appetizer and snack and snack sweet and not dessert sweet and lunch foods with one hand whilst holding the holders of them in the other hand. Quickly Jenna\u2019s eyes had immediately exploded wide open, and she had grunted and whimpered as her boyfriend was shoving it all down her throat yet still she obediently chewed and swallowed it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh Tom. ...... Seriously Tom, ...... truly no. Please Tom, seriously no. ......\u201d Called Jenna quite helplessly. Ms. Jenna was feeling far too overfull to get up even if she had ever tried, and her attempts to get for her boyfriend to stop had left him only just a little bit more hardened most especially so from over here whilst as her belly grew bigger and bigger and fatter and fatter. Yet Tom had still continued on stuffing up Ms. Jenna with all of the mountains of tons of foods he had, shoving it all straight down her throat, all but thus so leaving her belly more and more packed and as well here as more and more left for continuously onwards and upwards and wide wards thus constantly ballooning and constantly bulging all whilst also as if the foods are pushing against the very roof of the inside of her belly as it had continued to have been continuously and constantly bulging ever outwards and more etc and Ms. Jenna had continuously whimpered out and struggled and tried to have shook her head from side to side but not ever ensuring this would be enough for it all to stop. \u201cPlease Tom, just so simply stop! Please Tom!\u201d Thought Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Time had went on and still Jenna\u2019s boyfriend named Tom had continued to have managed to shove and stuff mountains and mountains of tons and tons of delicious foods all right into his girlfriend Ms. Jenna\u2019s very mouth, all of the while feeling just a little bit more hardened as he was managing to have proceeded thus to up and stuff to the very brim and beyond it his swelling very incredibly massively obese fat girlfriend Ms. Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jenna had thought back to her high school and her college also called university years, when she would make sure not to leave any trace of food she had ever eaten left, and leaving whichever table she sat at with a very eager and temporarily satisfied smile on her very face. Though Jenna was not and yet somehow at the same time was prepared for what was happening with her whilst currently, as she nonetheless had only gotten more and more of that pleasure she had from eating whatever she had liked to eat whenever she had liked to without regard to quantity whilst from all of the food chewed up and swallowed and eaten up thus whilst by her as it was all had ended up thus hitting her belly, thus causing her to be all but thus so ending up whilst as one who grew bigger and bigger and fatter and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Jenna had literally eaten up all of the several mountains and mountains of tons and tons of food and had gotten so big and her belly was far more enormously several times as fat and fat fatter and fat more super fat than even she her own self could ever comprehend ever at all.</span></div></div>",

Jenna Herself did not care though. As stated from before, truly whilst all but after weighing and discovering herself whilst over \u201cat three hundred and forty pounds\u201d, she decided that she did not care about any of that stuff or stuff like that stuff anymore, <br>\r\nfor truly \u201cif she was and is fat then she was and is fat\u201d. She did not prefer to think and did not care about any of that stuff here at all anymore. All that the fat young lady cared about was and is if she could still eat. And so she did just that. And that was when due to how many foods there were her belly had gotten as big and round as it did with the shape it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose three girls themselves from earlier and several times much more coworkers of lower ranks than her\u2019s along with the three of them had proceeded to show up and bring several tons of lunch foods and several tons much more of the foods from earlier. Lunch foods consisted of pizzas, burgers, etc., and thus more and more snack foods were given to Jenna Herself in literally eighty eight times more tons. Yet still she ate up piles of them even after so many tons of them had piled on her desktable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foods piled up so enormously and so heavily that one might perhaps find it surprising that she could yet still Jenna Herself proceeded to gobble up and to eat up them all, as she truly really had a very enormously gigantically large appetite as a result of succumbing to and eating up everything she did so, she grew bigger and bigger and fatter and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how many tons there were though, Jenna Herself had still proceeded to eat them all up. Surprisingly enough, her stretchable-materials-made work clothings had not bursted but were still becoming ever so increasingly even more than before super tight and super snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Tom came around by then and confirmed he had already clocked out for the two of them to her, and she thanked him for it, as they had been friends of each other since before their job positions they got at the same place, as it was indeed clocking-out time for all workers. She had gotten really incredibly round and big and fat at this point but still did not care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Tom. You did save me a bit of time by doing so.\u201d Said Jenna. She placed both hands on and contently patted her belly after she got up after a surprisingly-enough-only-very-brief-struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Jenna, you are welcome and please do have a nice day.\u201d Said Tom as he showed a note confirming that some food had been arranged to be delivered to her door through an inexpensive price arranged-for-payment-coupon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Tom, thanks so very much. You are too sweet.\u201d Said Jenna as she had swayed her bubbly hips whilst she had stepped towards Tom and kissed his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Tom blushed shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jenna had smirked. She had never seen \u201ca guy\u201d as shy as him and did think him rather \u201creally cute\u201d. She then asked for his cell phone a brief moment only whilst upon it being handed to him she put all of her contact information into a place for it in his contacts list before handing it back on over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Tom, it is so that that way, you could come and then have a bit of time with me whilst my own self has some dinner at my place some time like perhaps that upcoming twelve-day-weekend-day-off time amount starting on This Friday if you have chosen to have it upon a chance as I Myself have so. How about all but that maybe?\u201d Said-&amp;-Asked Jenna as she had placed a right hand on her right hip and held up her left hand and shown her first two fingers as she had flirtatiously winked right at him as she had proceeded to take her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and if you have make sure to bring lots of food for me.\u201d Said Jenna with both her hands on her belly as she had swayed her hips a bit more before she left.</span></div></div>",

For Jenna, one more huge shoveling and cramming in of all of those very so deliciously good tasting foods was all it took before whatsoever leftover physical strengths she ever so still did have left ever at all albeit even whilst if temporarily so yet still nonetheless here so whilst indeed thus on from over here so had been thus here all what gave out, and as her hand used to help with her shirt to hold her belly in and her leftover physical strength being used for that as well had thus been what gave out and all of that itself and had all loosened and her hand used for helping out whilst with holding her belly in had lowered itself and all throughout the whole while whilst for indeed so at that merely over here so only just a single split second, causing a chain reaction for the rest of her body that had been pinned down as her belly had went and ended up all of the more very so extremely seriously ever outward metaphorically blowing up bloating swelling ballooning all rock hard led heavy distended round swollen gigantically colossally enormously heavily hugely so giant bloated round swollen packed and bulging belly all of the more so, thus so over here leaving her and her body all increasingly very heavy even for her own large and wide living room couch. And Jenna had then went on ahead and proceeded to eat up all of the rest of her tons of foods from all of her lower-rank-carrying-coworkers and from Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Jenna had been at the first here so only yet to turn out to be momentarily dazed, and after this she had then begun to be placing the both of her own two hands on and rubbing her belly, all of the while whilst at that grunting in and with all but completely pure bliss over the deliciousness of all of the foods she ate. \u201cMmmh I *ugh* *ugh* *hnngh* *hnngh* *pant* *pant* really must say how quite so very much indeed here really absolutely fabulously deliciously tasting quite truly very soooooooooo good.\u201d Cooed Jenna as she had rubbed her belly. And Jenna saw that there were still tons more left for her to eat up all of over here so in amount by amount. \u201cTruly I have even during earlier from the very beginning of my job time ever at all so never before known of such feasting off and on foods like the kinds just eaten up by me. Why I must have eaten so much that even my own self has lost track of it completely so here. And I also see that there are still plentiful more and several more foods all left .... hmmmmhhhh absolutely so riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiich.\u201d Grunted Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubsequently Jenna had proceeded to eat them all and they were all for her so much that as a result whilst of her having eaten them all literally speaking, she was now twice as fat as she had been before her feasts during this day up to this point and as well as several times as fat as she had ever at all been since her very having been starting her job position and also her belly and her hips all had indeed so in fact here bulged out so very greatly at every single level and side and frontal area etc that it had left her and as well as all of the rest of her body rather slightly tired out and a thunderous churn had echoed throughout all of her home as her belly and hips had bulged out so greatly that her belly had spread itself all out and also all over every side and level and length and width and spread out over her entire two legs and her lap and she and her body became all of the more and more so weighed down. Although Jenna was not one to be ashamed of that and as well as not one to even do much as even try whilst to ever at all even give just a very tiny small little bit of a single care about that even or any of it all from over here so ever at all. As Jenna had eaten the very last of all of those foods here so, as her belly had bulged all on out several times more here so, she had then let out a very quite much gigantically greatly hugely violently bellowing heartily hearty hiccup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jenna heard her doorbell ring out, its ding ding sound echo throughout her home, leaving her smiling as she had heard it. \u201c*HIC* *HIC* Oh I so do hope that it was and is what and who it is thought by me to be present by here *HILP* *HILP* and that he has brought lots of and lots of delicious foods all on up over here for me.\u201d Purred Jenna incredibly flirtatiously and seductively. And Jenna all of the while with a brief struggle got herself off of her couch whilst cradling her exposed tummy. As Jenna had seen to it that she had waddled on towards her home\u2019s door, her small yet bubbly rear swayed up and down all like a ship at sea, her belly rumbled for more food and her hips swayed with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna made it to up her door, she had then here rubbed her belly all around and over and moved her hands from there up to her two hips with a greatly very excited passion and had gently bit both her lips flirtatiously and seductively. \u201c*HIC* *HIC* Oh I so do hope all of this.\u201d Purred Jenna flirtatiously seductively. Then Jenna opened the door and when asked to be so and stepping aside for such moments, watched as Tom brought tons of more food containers all around her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jenna. Well I hope you are hungry.\u201d Said Tom.</span></div></div>",

Though she did do some small amounts of paperwork here and there that had caused her to be well-paid in spite of the nature of her position and thus in spite of the time amount in which she did it all was not for very long and other than with those exceptions otherwise along with leaving her coworkers of lower rank to take care of the rest for her simply just because of her work position granting her permission to do so thus whilst she simply just proceeded to sit at her office cubicle room office desk and eat her days away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering what it had all added for all of the work that they themselves had to do: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Truly Sincerely Incredibly Very Fat Glob For A Truly Sincerely Incredibly Very Fat Blob Of A Truly Sincerely Incredibly Very Fat Woman Of A Fat Young Lady Jenna\u2019s coworkers of lower rank than her own truly and sincerely speaking \u201chad not been nice to the very-fat-young-woman-for-a-very-fat-young-lady-of-a-very-fat girl\u2019s body and waistline and belly\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if they were of lower ranks and therefore lower positions than she her own self: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach and every single one of all of Jenna\u2019s she her very own self\u2019s also put in as all of her office mates amongst ones with lower ranks and therefore lower positions than those of her own were really truly quite rather set off by how it was that with a few amounts of paperwork here and there that did not take long for a signature to be written down and otherwise with such exceptions all of the rest of those and other kinds of work were amongst what was left up to them to do whilst she had simply only just proceeded to sit back and eat up and indulge into all manner of pleasures of feasts of food her own self like the truly incredibly gargantuan colossally gigantically enormously hugely spectacularly and particularly bloated and swollen and huge and round and big and fat glob for a fat blob for a very fat young woman for a very fat girl for a very fat young girl for a very fat girl for a very fat lady for a very fat woman that she her own self Jenna indeed was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo therefore she had decided to turn the tables on the very incredibly fat one for a very fat glob for a very  fat blob for a very fat land-whale for a very fat woman for a very fat lady for a very fat lady for a very very fat woman. What they did not take into some consideration, however though, was and is that ones like even them their own selves to cause someone to get fired if and when such a someone could never screw up because of some position that such a someone had been given allowing them only a little work to be required and otherwise leaving such a someone with non-work to do yet in the case of someone like this very someone being addressed here they could at least cause her to end up keeping her position only to have to do so whilst through \u201cworking whilst thus from a home\u201d. So therefore, in turn, they had decided to simply just continue on and proceed to continue to help ensure that she her own self would thus all the more so end up as someone to fatten up to such a size as this size which had become her size. Jenna Herself did a pretty much well done type of a good job of \u201cblowing up on her very own\u201d, yet her lower-rank-and-lower-position-carrying coworkers had helped out to have helped ensure to have really proceeded to \u201ccompletely tip things over the edge\u201d. There were truly sincerely all but thus literally so many of them amongst so many of her lower-rank-and-lower-position-carrying coworkers that their literally enormously numerously literally enormously numerous food supplies\u2019 tons all being presented in enough here to literally last for tons of months in literally numerous tons of food supplies that those themselves had been all but literally speaking all but really starting to be proceeding to have really piled on her desk tables. And Jenna yet had welcomed and eaten up literally every single scrap and bit and piece of food even if some of them all were even as so much as only slightly stale with any that were not slightly so along with such ones being provided with concentrated enough substances to get them to taste good and in the process become so addictive to her from merely tasting so good that they would leave her for craving for more and her appetite increasing and her all the more even faster than ever so in the process of enduring many a faster version of her \u201cweight gain\u201d whilst all such substances were applied in certain types not amongst the rest of and otherwise with the rest of all of those foods that were not at all stale but still left without such described stuff in them. That said, as a result of it all, Jenna Herself would end up all the more uncaring about \u201chow fat she already had gotten\u201d and all the more uncaring about \u201chow much as a result of it all would it be that she would keep getting fatter and fatter\u201d, etc etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll morning right after finishing small-enough-to-not-take-long paperwork amounts she was presented with severally numerously enourmously sized  literally tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of \u201cfast food and non fast food type breakfast and even lunch types of foods thus\u201d along with all but literally severally numerously enourmously sized tons and tons of sweet foods to go with and after those amongst literally tons and tons of desert type sweet foods and literally tons and tons and tons and tons of snack type sweet foods like literally tons of doughnuts and pastries along with literally tons of cakes, literally tons of cupcakes, literally tons of muffins, literally tons of brownies, literally tons of cookies and more tons of such foods etc and all of the whole while it was throughout every single moment of every single second of every single minute of every single morning hour with each of those described foods\u2019 literal tons being increased up to all but eighty eight times much more tons than previously so and yet with all of those being what were thus all but what were thus what had been those here that Jenna Herself dug into. Yet due to how stretchable the materials her current work clothes were made of, those truly had not \u201cthus bursted\u201d ever yet and despite that they all were getting super tight and super snug with her work shirts despite being how stretchable they were due to the materials they were made of being still tight enough that they had still gotten so super tight that they had looked as though they were about ready to end up not fitting enough of her to cover up and thus leave her belly for completely bare and thus exposed. They perhaps could have caused her to have gotten for a first time whilst for her \u201ca write-up whilst for some indecent exposure\u201d, sincerely as far as they were ever convinced, thus all \u201cbut at this point\u201d, that would only be a minor infraction whilst in being compared to what she had deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt these very many a moment, she was being approached by her twenty four most known food-givers who one could say were the ones behind all of that and all of this whilst from over here. \u201cMorning-&amp;-Hey Jenna. We were just in the breakrooms and spotted these each twenty four dozen a full box each of twenty four dozen of every type of vanilla flavored chocolate flavored cupcakes and muffins and brownies and cookies and had thought that you might like all of it.\u201d Said six blonde ones and they let the heavy containers of described types of foods land on the young fat lady\u2019s desktable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso there was literally forty eight dozen a special on forty eight dozen of every type of a vanilla flavored and chocolate flavored poundcake, so we all went to pick up for you twenty four dozen containers here of twenty four dozen or such an amount.\u201d Said six twelve head-located red-haired ones who had then each placed each of their food amounts alongside the rest. Jenna Herself was not speaking at all as she was \u201ctoo busy with stuffing her face\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd twenty four males each had thought that it each was his turn to bring in sixty four dozen of every single type from amongst sixty four dozen vanilla and sixty four dozen chocolate flavored cakes  each and so therefore there was it all leading to so many a whole extra one. We told them not to worry and that you could handle the many a whole thing.\u201d Said the other black-haired ones as they made some room placing all the many a massive cake on the desktable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jenna do truly eat up. We all heard lunch is also being delivered in all-one-can-eat buffet style here. We all know how you find it way too hard to pass up on free food.\u201d Said all of the girls who snickered before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna Herself happily continued to munch, only expanding her ever growing fat belly.</span></div></div>",

She was becoming surprised by how much more she still had left for her to eat which was increasing eighty times more, more, more, more and more and more and more and more than each previous amount of forty times eighty of all of the described country types or so to say along with more upon being told by her and Tom\u2019s primary waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom still watched her belly grow and was feeling a little more hardened from down below than before, or so to say. Jenna did not really care or notice despite her reciprocated attraction to Tom from how kind to her he was, and did not even care or notice that Tom was even thinking about rubbing her belly along with other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all of the appetizer and dessert foods were feasted on completely by Jenna, who then had her surprisingly still contained-by-clothes belly despite its incredibly blown-up-metaphorically-and-overgrown-and-oversized-and-overfed-and-overstuffed belly whilst albeit within a brief struggle still placed on the still larger table for some space. It had not ended up exposed yet, though still, it was several times more enormous, not that Jenna liked or hated that due to the fact that she did not care about that and only cared about being able to be one who could eat and who could still eat, etc., and in fact serveral times more so than even she could comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big eater was <i>really</i> starting to get red in the face from just how overfull feeling she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like she needed a breather, yet semi-obliviously accepted Tom\u2019s \u201csweet-and-kind-hearted offer\u201d as she called if to \u201cfeed her\u201d the dessert foods when they were brought for her to eat if in case she were to ask him to, each of which were forty times eighty times more than the appetizer and dinner meals offerings combined of all of the dessert types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were brought to her, the fat young lady started drooling more from the inside despite her overfull feeling state, and proceeded to have eaten as much as she could of all with only as much of all of those and all of the chocolaty kinds of dessert types of foods remaining. She ate as much as she could of all of those and as well. She ate up until she decided to gave Tom a personal go-ahead and truly was it that whilst only stopping when she asked him to so she could have a breather and otherwise did he stuff her to the brim and caused her to be far beyond overfull feeling, with Tom quietly asking \u201cI hope you do not mind....\u201d with her only silently nodding as he rubbed her belly gently and soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh *HIC* Tom, you *HIC* are sweet. Such-*HIC*-Such a *HIC* kind heart you *HIC* have. *HIC*-*HICCUP*-*HILP*!\u201d She said as he rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing as kind-hearted as he was, he helped her up whilst albeit with a brief struggle and he walked with her from-there-waddling-self whilst paying a very inexpensive bill on their way out and took her to her home. She kissed both his cheeks in the way a fat girl like her only could do so, and as she \u201cwaddled\u201d inside her home, Tom blushed as he walked to his home which was circumstantially speaking not too far due to at least being in the same home neighborhood suburb subdivision as her home was in.</span></div></div>",

Whilst uttering these words the way Jenna did so, she placed the other one of the both of her hands on and used both her hands\u2019 palms to be proceeding to have been again absent-mindedly rubbing soothingly and then proceeding to have gently and slightly tiredly proceeded to have patted her at-this-point-due-to-being-in-fact-four-times-as-such-even-more-so-than-even-bef ore-this-very-moment-particularly-massively-sized-and-boulder-sized-and-sphere-s haped-and-thrusted-both-towards-legs-and-thrusted-upwards-stylizedly-at-this-poi nt-due-to-being-in-fact-four-times-as-such-even-more-so-than-even-before-this-ve ry-moment-particularly-incredibly-so-at-this-point-due-to-being-in-fact-four-tim es-as-such-even-more-so-than-even-before-this-very-moment-particularly-incredibl y-so-massively-sized-and-boulder-sized-and-sphere-shaped incredibly so colossally and gigantically and enormously round and blown-up and ballooned-up and plumped-up and exploded-up and porked-up and swelled-up and bloated-up and fattened-up big, ballooned, bloated, swollen, fat, big and round big, fat belly of a stomach sometimes called her swollen, big, fat and round, swollen big fat belly of a stomach sometimes called her round and swollen big, fat belly for a big and fat and round swollen belly for a swollen and round, fat big belly for a swollen and round, big, fat belly for a swollen and fat, round, big belly for a round and fat swollen big belly for a big and round and swollen fat belly for a swollen and fat round big fat belly for a round, fat and big swollen belly that had been also called her fat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf something at least does happen of unfavorable nature, though, could you at least step aside?\u201d Jenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Answered Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jenna had once again attempted to get up from her chair, but she alas yet all but still had happened to find it <i>really</i> <i>hard</i> to even do so much as try to even so much as do happen to do even one bit of even attempting to try to even so much as even successfully managing to be even attempting to All but try to lift her belly up high enough even with her legs and her hands and her feet and her arms. Then she tried it again times on and by her own self. Yet despite her efforts all alas but the very reason why it did not work due to the fact that she even did so much as manage to have even just simply seemed to have ended up as one who was happening to have even just simply seemed to been just simply too overwhelmed by the sheer size of her belly was because of the fact that she happened to indeed have ended up as one who had gotten so fat she could not do so much as even attempt to try to get her huge gut for a big, fat belly of a stomach sometimes called her fat belly up high enough for her to be able to stand on her own. Only this time, as a result of her efforts, the only thing that it had changed - the only difference that it had managed to have made - was that instead of just simply ending up stuck in her chair, she ended getting her own self off of her chair in the fashion of ending up sliding across it, and thus had ended up landing her own self on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result of it was enough that though due to the \u201cquake-proof\u201d design of the building this was all happening in the middle of the inside of, It had not been heard by anyone else but Jenna and Tom, a \u201cground-shake-like sound\u201d had sounded upon her landing herself on the floor. As such, as she placed the both of her hands onto the top of her fat belly immediately upon landing on the floor, and she gasped in shock and let out a hearty hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*HILP* Oh Dear! I Guess I Have Gotten That Fat!\u201d She Said In Embarrassment And Shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe One Called Jenna The Young Fat Lady Sometimes Called Jenna The Fat Young Lady Then Was Starting To Get Forty Times As Red In The Face From How Frustrated And Embarrassed She Was Feeling - Especially Whilst In Front Of \u201cThe \u201cHandsome And Sweet-And-Kind-Hearted\u201d\u201d Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. I Offered To Help You Up. Did I Not?\u201d Stated And Reminded Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*HIC* Oh Of Course You Did! It Is Just *HIIIIIICHIIIIIIIIIIIILP* That *HUUUUUYOOOOLHIIIIIIIIIIIICHILP* *HIIIIIIIIIIIILPHICCUP* *HICYAAOOLBEUHYAOOOOLLLLPHICHILP* I Am So Shocked A-A*HICHILP*-And Embarr-*HIC*-Embarrassed That Practically Speaking All Nut I Have Gotten <i>SOOOOOOOOOOOO</i> <i>FAT</i> That I Might Have Ended Up As Such A One As And In Turn As Such I Can\u2019t Even Try To Lift My Own Self Up Whilst On And By My Own Self And It Is For The Fact That You Had To See That That I Am <i>Truly</i> <i>SOOOOOOOOOOOO</i> <i>SORRY</i>!\u201d Jenna Distraught-Fully And Distressingly Stated As She Let Out A Few More Hearty Hiccups. As She Did So She Started To Let Out A Few Tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. No Need For Tears. Just Let Me Help You Up.\u201d Tom Replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe Then Offered Up For Her To See To It That And She Did a See To It That She Took The Both His Hands. When She Did Thus Surprisingly Enough Even For Her Own Self And In-Some-Ways-Surprisingly-Enough-Even-For-Him-And-His-Thin-And-Yet-At-The-Same-T ime-Also-Lean-And-Yet-Slightly-Yet-Also-Averagely-Muscular-Self He Was Strong Enough To Successfully Help Her Up. He then lifted up a hand to dry her tears for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank You Tom.\u201d Jenna Said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she managed as much as she could to proceed to have somehow managed to find a way to have wrapped both her arms around his neck whilst proceeding to have been able to have done so whilst only in part due to her height being something that was at least shorter than his height in the process - not to say that she was \u201c\u201cso short\u201d \u201cthat\u201d \u201cshe was\u201d \u201ca\u201d \u201cdwarf\u201d\u201d but merely that she was \u201c\u201cshorter\u201d \u201cthan\u201d \u201cTom\u201d\u201d - and then she kissed him on the both of his cheeks. Before she did that, he found a way to have wrapped both his arms around \u201c\u201cher\u201d \u201cwaist\u201d\u201d and patted her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen She Let Go Of Him He Said To Her \u201cSo As I Said We Could Head To Some Restaurant Of Your Choosing Before Doing So If You Would Prefer For And/Or Yet If You Would Prefer We Do Not Have To Head For Some Restaurant We Could Instead Head For Either Your\u2019s Or My Place Whilst All The While For Dinner <i>And</i> For Desert As Well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna The Answered By Having Proceeded To Have Been Saying \u201cYou Know Now That I Think About It I Have Decided That....\u201d</span></div></div>",

He then took from his pocket a brochure booklet that had descriptions of such places. He pointed to two restaurants that were nearby the neighborhood suburb subdivision that - as it turned out - they both lived at - and as it had happened as well too - had the homes they had lived it - two fancy upstairs-and-downstairs-and-basement house types of homes that were arranged by their albeit-quietly-so-yet-still-thus-all-of-the-same <i>incredibly</i> <i>and</i> <i>enormously</i> <i>very</i> <i>financially</i> <i>resourceful</i> parents and the connections they had from companies their parents were employed by and from equally and/or far more financially resourceful friends and/or co-workers etc., helping out - all the while as that had also turned out - not too far thus from each  other and where they had lived at <i>and</i> <i>also</i> were in walking distance from where they currently were and from where they had respectively lived at as well.

As they did so, Jenna herself respectively has kept one hand be placed on her belly. When they got there and went inside (the doors were surprisingly enough whilst primarily and yet especially at the same time whilst for Jenna), they were offered a table within what had happened to be a special room within a 6th lower basement ground floor for just the two of them to sit at the table within (Tom himself had arranged this for only one very small price of two dollars). Jenna was internally squeeling in delight about how accommodating this was yet most especially when she saw how large the extra table was whilst for Tom and herself to sit over and at most especially whilst in consideration with all but \u201d\u201da woman\u201c \u201dthat was and thus still is of\u201c \u201dher stature\u201c\u201c.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When they had sat themselves at this table, Tom surprisingly only just got one serving of a few types of foods of various types whilst Jenna had already only just started to have been looking at her menu list. After a very small time amount of her looking at the menu, a very young and part-time-working-male waiter came up to her and Tom\u2019s table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201dYou ready to order, O Miss?\u201c He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jenna was caught by surprise over this as she had only just started looking at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201dMay I suggest the various-and-diverse-and-multiple-amount-composed-and-multi-amounted-course-arran ged-and-multi-meal-serving-composed-meal-course-serving course meal providing buffet course?\u201c Asked he before saying \u201dIt has so many food offerings of various and diverse types in various different servings in buffet treys, each of various different types and in various different servings, servings\u2019 sizes, quantities for all of them, amounts portions, etc all brought to you all of the whole while whilst with it consisting of appetizer type foods and dinner type foods and dessert type foods alike.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jenna found herself once again struggling not to actually do so and ended up internally drooling with actual drool remaining in a struggle with Jenna that was compelling her to struggle to keep her drool and all her drooling-related-type urges under refrainment. She placed the menu list she had initially been looking at back down and then placed the both of her hands on and then had started to have been proceeding to have been rubbing her belly. She looked over at Tom, who then looked back at and then gave her a non-verbal signal that was to have encouraged her to take this offer whilst with a go-ahead-type-nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She then had eagerly and as though-having-it-be-declared-and-yet-mostly-as-though-whilst-having-it-be-purred \u201dOh wow and thus that truly sounds most absolutely greatly amazingly absolutely amazing and offers to leave me with less time-consuming matters and more selected selectable options all the while and amazing and easy! I will truly and most definitely take it!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201dComing truly right up soon then.\u201c Replied the younger male waiter and thus so he then took her menu list and went on to put the order in. Jenna began to be proceeding to have thus been managing to have thus gently, slightly sleepily, slightly absentmindedly and truly really soothingly rubbed her incredibly gargantuan ginormously collosally sized and gigantically and titanically sphere-shaped incredibly gargantuan ginormously colossally and gigantically titanically massively enormously bloated and swollen gigantic single-hill-like-entity-resembling incredibly gargantuan ginormously colossally sized and gigantically titanically massively enormously bloated and swollen massive boulder-sized incredibly gargantuan ginormously collossally gigantically titanically massively enormously incredibly gargantuan, ginormous, colossal, gigantic, titanic, massive, bloated, swollen and fattened-up incredibly gargantuan, ginormous, colossal, gigantic, titanic, massive, bloated and big and fat tummy for a huge big, fat belly of a stomach whilst and as she had most eagerly awaited her meal. Truly Jenna was such a massively massive big fat glob for a massively big fat blob for a maasive big fat glob for a massive big fat blob for a big fat glob for a big fat blob for a massive glob for a massive blob for a fat glob for a fat blob for a really very, very fat woman of a fat girl  with such a massively massive and uncontrolled and unbridled appetite that she could only conclude that she had found it way too hard for her to even attempt to even try to give a care about or to even attempt to even try to rationalize exactly just how poorly her eating habits were ever being managed, or of how much even after their restaurant time that the sweet hearted male-gendered individual referred to as a sweet young man who had been the one to have invited her respectively speaking thus was planning to be managing to be proceeding to spoil her with more and more and more and more and several times more and several times more and several times more and several times more food when they had ended up having gotten to either her home (Jenna\u2019s Home) or to his home (Tom\u2019s Home) and all the while whilst with it being from amongst appetizer and dinner and dessert foods alike also as well.</span></div></div>",

Using her leg muscles, the blimpy blonde strained herself to reach as far into the apartment as she could. Then, despite the protests of the odd coupling of doorway and belly dough, she attempted to force her round body though the square hole. At first it seemed to work, Jenna could feel herself sliding through ever so slightly even as her face twisted and contorted in her exertion. It was physically exhausting, her round face becoming red from the center out as little beads of sweat rolled down her forehead\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw ow ow okay!\u201d she cried out in defeat, \u201cOkay\u2026 okay\u2026 that didn\u2019t work so well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAscertaining the situation further (by means of moving the pliable belly blubber around so she could see) Jenna saw (and certainly felt) that her situation had only gotten worse.

She had forgotten to charge it before she left for work this morning and her charger in her office had shorted out earlier due to a little soda accident one day during lunch. In her creed to not waste the battery life, she had forgotten all about it! If she could manage just one phone call, somebody might be able to come and help her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her doughy shoulder and allowing the big black purse to slide down her rippling arm fat, Jenna reached over the swell of her stomach with her right arm and searched the sea of wrappers and crumbs to find\u2026 yes, her smartphone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her fat thumb, Jenna unlocked her phone with a quick swipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly any battery\u2026\u201d she commented quietly, \u201cBetter make this one count\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who could she call? She didn\u2019t exactly have a booming social life, even at work. And what\u2019s more, who could get there quickly?

Once she had on the clothes that where ready to bust open she walked down the hall to the elevator and rode down to her car. After she got the seat belt lacked she drove to the fast food restaurant only to discover that the drive thou was being redone she decided to just go in and eat.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Burger world\" said the minimum wage employe told her.<br>\r\n\"May I take your order?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can I will have 3 of the double cheese burgers, 2 large fries and 1 large soda\"<br>\r\n\"Ok\" replied the bored cashier however, Jenna was not finished.<br>\r\n\"I will also have a large chocolate shake and another large frys.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n           As she sat down in a tight booth Jenna could feel all the eyes on her and the judgements being made.

By the time she was finished she was stuffed to the brim and as she tried to get up she soon dicovered that she was stuck.

Only after two more men came over to help was she free. When she was finally unstuck she flow out of the booth on to the floor and lost the button on her jean and ripped her shirt. Embrassed she waddled to her car as fast as possible. As her fat fingers pushed the buttons on her phone she tried to forget what had happened.<br>\r\n\"Marianne?\"<br>\r\n\"Jenna?

How in the world could she have let this happen? She knew she was gaining weight, but there was no way she was too fat to get in and out of her apartment! She had no problem with the doors in her office building, or her cubicle! There had to be some logical explanation for all of this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter, Avery was on her way.

Jen was starting to swell up even faster now. She had accepted her full-fledged fatdom. She quickly became the fattest woman in the whole office. In no time she was up to 350 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m up to 350 pounds. Never thought I\u2019d see a number that high. But I\u2019m still not that fat right? 350 pounds is like, average in the US. I\u2019m just chubby, that\u2019s all.\u201d She thought. She was sitting at her desk eating candy. She rubbed her bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis belly is not even that big. It could be so much bigger.\u201d Jenna thought as she patted her blubbery fat rolls. \u201cOops I\u2019m out of candy. I should go get something from the kitchen.\u201d She slowly lifted her enormous butt out of her chair. She struggled to squeeze her flabby wide hips free from the chair. She then waddled over to the kitchen. Breathing heavily from the short walk, she opened the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we have here? *pant* Well I really should treat myself after that much *gasp* exercise.\u201d Jenna said to herself. She pulled out some left over birthday cake and closed the fridge. She started to make her way back to her desk when she suddenly bumped into another coworker. It turned out to be Alice. Alice had been at the office for a short while. Luckily she was still a fairly thin girl so she didn\u2019t make much of an impact on Jen. Jenna\u2019s large midsection absorbed most of the hit leaving her cake untouched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Jess, must not have seen me.\u201d Alice said. Alice was a bit taken aback by Jen\u2019s much larger figure. Even though she hadn\u2019t been at the office for long, she had notice a significant increase in Jen\u2019s weight since she started working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. *wheeze* I still have my cake.\u201d Jen said. She was still exhausted by all this movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay? You\u2019re out of breath.\u201d Alice said. She didn\u2019t want to be to blunt about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, never better.*sigh* It\u2019s ridiculous how far I have to walk back to my desk. *pant* How are regular people supposed to go bring stuff back to there desk?\u201d Jenna said. Alice of course wasn\u2019t tired at all from the short walk to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 Yeah good point. Well see yah.\u201d Alice said. Jenna made her way back to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a workout,\u201d Jen said as she sat down at her desk. \u201cI need to eat more to keep my energy up I guess.\u201d She finished her cake and started to eat some chips. She spread her thighs to let her growing fat belly have more room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can handle this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna paused and took a sharp inhale, putting more pressure on her stuck stomach as she fit more snugly into the doorframe. Using her leg muscles, the blimpy blonde strained herself to reach as far into the apartment as she could. Then, despite the protests of the odd coupling of doorway and belly dough, she attempted to force her round body though the square hole. At first it seemed to work, Jenna could feel herself sliding through ever so slightly even as her face twisted and contorted in her exertion. It was physically exhausting, her round face becoming red from the center out as little beads of sweat rolled down her forehead\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw ow ow okay!\u201d she said loudly in defeat, \u201cOkay\u2026 okay\u2026 that didn\u2019t work so well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAscertaining the situation further (by means of moving the pliable belly blubber around so she could see) Jenna saw (and certainly felt) that her situation had only gotten worse. She was now exactly half in and half out of the apartment\u2014the spot on her stomach just above her bellybutton French kissed the spot where the plunger fell on the door, and her mountainous butt-blubber hadn\u2019t shifted at all, leaving her at an awkward and uncomfortable angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear\u2026\u201d she muttered, \u201cWhat am I going to do? Certainly I can\u2019t be and certainly I'm not too fat to get through the doorway of my own apartment!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just remained stuck there for a few hours. It was mid afternoon when her work time finished, and yet it was only by early evening, a few hours later, that someone came by. A good friend of hers from University during her associate's degree before her job she got afterwards, a young black haired person in his early twenties at this point, named Joe, came along. He was living in the same neighborhood as she was, circumstantially speaking and happened by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some help?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing his voice, Jenna said \"Good thing you're here, Joe. You think you could help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Joe answered. The last time they saw each other was after they both graduated their university associate's degrees, having first seen each other some time in their final year of as such, as each other's classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe had hoped they could hang around as friends at least at some point some time soon, but both were kept busy. Jenna's job made it all moreso. Joe was only for a brief moment slightly caught off guard at first and thus didn't recognize Jenna at first, due to how FAT Jenna had already gotten at this point. Joe had been at least trim while at University. At this point, he became a bit more muscular. Joe remembered Jenna for being at least FAT but not nearly like the fat whale of a very FAT woman that Jenna was now at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe helped Jenna in with a bit of a push and it was done. Jenna was back inside, her fat gut for a fat belly having churned and rumbled as she made it in. \"Phew! Thanks, Joe.\" She said as she waddled over and plopped herself down on her living room sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Just being helpful. Mind if I come in at least for a bit?\" Joe replied and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Joe. You're sweet.\" Jenna stated as she placed both her hands on her fat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, thanks sooo much.\" Jenna said as she rubbed her round swollen belly.  \u201cUgh\u2026How could I do this to myself?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Joe asked, seeing Jenna\u2019s sad face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet myself get SOOOO FAT!!!!\" Jenna said as she got distraught Tears went rolling down her cheek. Joe thought he should cheer a friend up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Ugh-err\u2026 Why should it matter how fat you are?\" Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean why should it matter? I cant even get in my apartment.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 maybe it was just\u2026 the door.\u201d Joe said. \u201cAre there any other doors you can\u2019t fit through?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell *sniff* no, I guess not. This has never happened to me before.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, setting that aside, it ought not not matter how fat you are, whether you are so or not.\" Avery said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I should care how fat I am?\" Jenna asked. Her tears finally stopped. Joe paused. Jenna was incredibly fat, enough in the opinions of some to be cause for concern, but Joe was incredibly diplomatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I admit you gained some weight.\u201d Jenna looked like she was about to have a breakdown. \u201cBut even if you are fat. That doesn't matter, Jenna. A bit of advice: No matter how you look, it's not appearances that judge one for what and who one is but one's character.\u201d Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I have gained A LOT of weight but so what? It's personality that counts at the end.\" Jenna said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whilst Jenna, who had a nice house type of home set up by a few good and \u201cquietly rich\u201d friends of both her parents and herself in an upstairs-and-downstairs-and-basement-levels consistent house type Home that she had gotten along with enough money that she inherited from a late family relative whilst to \u201ccompletely financially set her up whilst for life up until old age regardless of whatever amounts spent on anything ever at all\u201d after she had graduated from out of college/university, was on her way all up to work, she noticed that two dozen huge boxes with cakes were left at her door which she had placed into her vehicle to take her to work, having enough time still by the time of doing that with all of them to get ready for this current work day which she did so, after which she had then driven to work, getting herself there on time after picking up some iHops two dozen chocolate-chip-pancake-and-chocolate-chip-waffle-breakfast of two dozen servings of every of those two types and some ice cream gallon pints and doughnuts and pastries and cookies on her way there. Surprisingly Jenna was somehow able to bring them all on inside, after which she had attended to all of those and all of these great many an incredibly-small-amount-of-work-requiring-and-yet-well-paying-paperwork-attendin g-tasks, and then got herself set to have her feasts. Afterwards Jenna had received a little more paperwork to attend to, after which a morning meeting had then been what thus got started - which was one of those every-morning-type-of-work-meetings that had workers convene whilst for daily-branch-task-rundowns - during which Miss Jenna herself thus had here said very little yet paid enough attention to be able to be allowed for giving more attention whilst to lots of delicious foods among pastries like doughnuts, eclairs, more of both of those and also muffins, cupcakes, all others amongst all of those and other pastries, candies, cookies and more such foods for her to be munching on whilst also having some glasses of milk to wash it all down with - for there all but had always seemed to be hoards of dozens of containers of them including containers of boxes of dozens of them for her to eat and yet tons more hoards of them all then that and indeed as stated before, Miss Jenna had said very little despite paying enough attention and yet was otherwise equally giving such attention and yet at the very same time devoting most of her attention to all of those described delicious foods, and so as soon as the meeting\u2019s end finally came, she took two dozen containers of dozen boxes of dozens of every single one of those and these foods to her desk office cubicle desk office work office room as there had always seemed to be such amounts for such a one as someone like her to take and yet dozens of tons and as well as tons and tons more of them all whilst for some kind and some type of reason. She had really devoured and munched on all of them and whatever tons she still had of these and those within quite plentifully enough time from before the start of lunchtime, which she had spent whilst and over at the one of many an incredibly large all-that-one-can-eat-buffet-restaurant-style-foodcourt within the very gigantically large business complex building in which she had practiced her work position, eating so much that it would leave some internal questions about her being able to and yet she was able to be returning up to her office work cubicle office work cubicle desk office work cubicle room still during the lunchtime session time amount still lasting to be able to have taken two dozens enough of pre-lunch appetizer and lunch and dessert and dessert-like snack foods to be able to be munching on back in her office room. After lunchtime, she had finished her afternoon tasks which were in very little amounts, and had afterwards all but then subesequently proceeded to eat some more of these and eat some more of those described types of foods and described kinds of foods whilst in several times more dozens of amounts and yet still had tons more left in her work office room. At Jenna\u2019s respective workday\u2019s end, she got herself up off from her metal-like-material-bound-leather-made-quadritripod-wheeled-and-armed-chair, took herself to her vehicle and then she drove back to her home with the time of her return to her home being 3:00 PM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna had seen to it that she had continued on with her current work position, it was all of the whole while whilst as a result of her increasingly growing enourmously massively uncontrollably insatiably uncontrollable and insatiable appetite and as well as her ever-so-increasingly constant and increasing overeating habits, thus she grew bigger, grew bigger, grew fatter, grew fatter and all but really indeed thus grew bigger and grew fatter and grew bigger and grew fatter and all of the whole while whilst in a fashion that had caused her to have a particularly round big and fat swollen and massive-boulder-sized-and-like-and-thus-massive-boulder-like-and-massive-boulder -resembling-sphere-shaped-bloated and swollen boulder for an incredibly round big, fat belly of a stomach that had seeing to it as its really ever-so increasing girth was growing in turn here that \u201cit was not split into rolls but instead a single humongous massively-enourmously-overgrown-gigantically-oversized massive-boulder-resembling-massive-boulder-shaped-massive-boulder-sized hill-like entity\u201d all of the whole while whilst as if Ms. Jenna herself had been packing it full of food since a combination of her high school and her college/university years and as well as her starting her work position combined and here all at the very same time which she practically had been whilst most especially since the very beginning start of her beginning her work position - not that she had ever at all here happened to know and as well as not that she had ever at all here happened to even do so much as even try to give even just a single little bit of even just a little bit of even just a little care about or even of it all. Though Jenna would have somehow only just a few minor setbacks surprisingly enough even whilst for someone of such a stature as someone like her as she had all but thus ended up whilst as one who got big and big and fat and fat and as she had all but thus ended up ended up whilst as one who would all but proceed to all but thus here all but keep on getting bigger and keep on getting bigger and keep on getting fatter and keep on getting fatter and keep getting bigger and bigger and all but thus here keep getting bigger and bigger and keep fatter and fatter as she had ever thus so got and gotten and had become one proceeding to keep getting, and so the pounds had continued to have all but thus over here piled on. Soon Jenna would end up as one who would have been ending up becoming one who had to buy new and new-as-well-as-ever-so-stretchy-and-yet-amongst-some-of-them-thus-eventually-eve r-so-thus-ever-so-increasingly-incredibly-super-snug-work clothes as her all-but-ever-so-thus-becoming-increasingly expanding big fat belly of a stomach and hips had ripped a few amongst and/or had stretched out the rest of all of her multiple old work clothes. As Jenna had proceeded to eat more and eat more and as well as overeat more and overeat more and overeat more, she was ending up as one who had and as such here, the more she ate and the more she ate as well as the more she overate and the more she overate, all but the more ever so increasingly enormously gigantically colossal, the more increasingly enormously ever so gigantically colossal and the truly ever so increasingly enormous, the truly ever so increasingly enormous, the ever so increasingly uncontrollably instiable, the ever so increasingly uncontrollably insatiable and as well as the huger, the huger, the larger, the larger and also the bigger and thus the bigger that her ever so increasingly enourmously colossally uncontrollably insatiably gargantuan ever so increasingly enormously colossally uncontrollably insatiably uncontrollable and as well thus here as ever so increasingly enormously insatiably instatiable appetite became. Eventually Jenna had seen to it without any knowledge or care about it all that she had avoided any chances at and as well as avoided any chances of exertion and had soon began seeing to it that she had taken care that she had always ensured that she had parked as ever as close to the frontal main lobby entrance entryway as possible and had always seen to it that she had managed to have ensured that she always took an elevator instead of any stairs and all but thus in turn was ensuring that she was always was seeing to it that she only took care of each and every single one of all of the albeit-minimum-in-amount-yet-still-nonetheless-main-despite-being-small types thus of paperwork-related requirements that were set to her to attend to and otherwise had seen to it outside of these and those requirements that she had ensured that she had devoted all of the rest of her at-those-very-points-left-whilst-for-freed time amounts in proceeding to have always managed to have ensured that and all of the while whilst for as long as she had been paid every bit as ever well so as she had been able to have obtained the described money amounts she got and had inherited that \u201chad her set up for life\u201d whilst from over here thus respectively all but in turn she had always devoted all of the rest of her at-those-very-points-free attention that she had always seen to it that she was devoting all of from amongst all but attention amounts for her to have been ensuring that she was devoting from amongst attention amounts whilst thus to eating ever at all instead of any extra working ever so thus.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miss Jenna had struggled to button her shirt over her hugely swollen fat belly. \u201cSeriously Jenna about this here thing?!??!? Did I shrink it and a few of my other clothes in the laundry again somehow perhaps?!??!?\u201d Muttered Jenna after she had just managed to button it all up only for her pants to also initially not be so cooperative either. \u201cSurely I absolutely indeed all but <i>most</i> <i>certainly</i> <i>have</i> <i>not</i> ever so at all \u201c<i>truly</i> <i>put</i> <i>on</i> <i>that</i> <i>much</i> <i>weight</i>\u201d?!??!? <i>Have</i> <i>I</i>?!??!? <i>Indeed</i> <i>I</i> <i>truly</i> <i>must</i> <i>have</i> here only simply just merely shrunk my clothes.\u201d Muttered Jenna up to what she had here concluded thus. Actually Jenna had indeed, however though, all but <i>most</i> <i>definitely</i> <i>not</i> <i>ever</i> <i>so</i> respectively at all thus \u201c<i>here</i> <i>only</i> <i>simply</i> <i>just</i> <i>merely</i> <i>shrunk</i> <i>her</i> <i>clothes</i>\u201d, for thus here simply merely speaking, she had just gotten incredibly fat - note also that initially it was all from within \u201cmostly primarily her hips and lower stomach \u201cas though she had put on so much weight and all of the whole while whilst in a pace that was so fast that her body did not have time to deal with it all at all at first which thus resulted in it \u201csimply just landing there and at first remaining there as though having just not wanted to move\u201d\u201d\u201d only for it to all but be that she had gotten as every bit as much as \u201cbelly heavy type incredibly very fat\u201d as previously described which she had ended up at whilst over at these described points. Afterwards Jenna got herself into her vehicle, albeit with a brief struggle ensuing in the process of it all. Then Jenna\u2019s first thing to do was get herself over to her work-place\u2019s nearest McDonald\u2019s at its drive through area with the place itself and her work place both being not far from her home with the McDonald\u2019s area being in fact directly nearby. There Jenna had then spatted out her incredibly enormous order, politely asking to get twenty four dozen hash browns, twelve dozen egg mcmuffins, nine dozen mcgriddles, six dozen breakfast burritos and twenty six dozen extra large chocolate and vanilla and both-of-those-whilst-with-mixtures-of-them-and-toppings combined all with it being under one price of $6.40 through a special deal between the place she worked at and it and a special coupon combined which she then got, all whilst as thus in the processing of the order being made, Miss Jenna\u2019s big fat belly of a stomach had growled - this was how much that she was feeling so hungry. Miss Jenna had received the colossally gigantically enormously hugely largely enormous and huge and large meal, and then went to work. After Jenna had arrived and went into her office room to have placed the huge meal on her desk, she then went as was part of a current-during-these-points routine to a nearby TacoBell and Burger King Rally\u2019s and Steak 'N Shake and DQ to make equally large orders for a same price then took them all somehow in surprisingly enough for her enough time for her to gather it all in still enough time for her to eat it all before this work day for her starting its beginning moments. As Jenna placed herself into her chair, her hips had given her a little bit of difficulty as she had sat herself down into her same type but albeit much more enlarged chair. When Jenna thus had devoured all of it, it was surprisingly enough even for \u201csomeone of such a stature as\u201d that of \u201ca girl\u201d and/or \u201ca woman\u201d and/or \u201ca lady\u201d as someone such as that as someone like herself only a few minutes before the beginning of this daily work day session for her and even more surprisingly enough even for someone like her without even making a single mess, yet though nonetheless here, Miss Jenna still had subsequently eaten so much as a result of all of it that she was one who\u2019s already incredibly swollen-bloated-big-fat-belly-of-a-stomach-heavy-bodied figure and swollen bloated big fat belly of a stomach were all but thus \u201cvery much exploding at an incredibly alarming rate\u201d whilst so greatly that it was really starting to overwhelm her - not that she either knew or cared about what was causing it all as she was so oblivious and uncaring about it all already thus so - and she had placed both her hands on her incredibly enormously spectacularly particularly round belly whilst panting and hiccuping, only to then turn her attention to some delicious ding-dongs and doughnuts and muffins and cupcakes and twinkies and cookies - there were already so many tons of dozens of packs of them all in all of her containers of them all - and proceeded to see to it that she had managed to dive into them and it all and ensured to have dug herself into all of it and all of them from as much as she could ever have. Soon Jenna had grunted in pleasure-filled bliss at the taste of every single one of them amongst her fourth set of twenty six dozen of each of all of them - her hugely heavily bloated swollen gut for a hugely heavily bloated swollen huge big fat belly of a stomach pushing to the point of practically ballooning outwards past the seemingly limit-carrying points of her shirt buttons - though indeed of course she felt it only to ignore and pay absolutely no heed and pay absolutely no attention to and thus decide that she could give less of a single bit of such a thing as she already in fact did not give a single bit of care about it - and rubbing her belly whilst eating up. Once Jenna finished that, it was all but thus soon enough morning meeting time. As Jenna got up and had waddled down the hallway, she had cradled with as much as she could of her arms her swollen belly that was starting to be something that all but indeed <i>could</i> <i>clearly</i> <i>be</i> <i>seen</i> <i>whilst</i> <i>in</i> <i>between</i> <i>her</i> <i>shirt</i>\u2019<i>s</i> <i>buttons</i>. There Jenna had struggled to refrain from drooling over certain types of containers of food as this was just how much that her appetite was increasing etc,. When Jenna had returned to her office room after the described meeting\u2019s respective end, she saw that multiple dozens of two dozens of huge boxes types of containers of cakes were seen on her desk table like the kind that were being left at her home at its front door since she started work which had contributed to her \u201cweight gain\u201d. So Jenna had then proceeded to have decided to have dealt with her small amounts of work after having placed them all over at her desk table and after her lunch time hour during which she gathered more twenty fours of two dozens of tons of lunch foods and dessert like snack foods and dessert foods which like those and other stuff among foods as well as foods from all-that-one-can-eat-buffet-restaurant foods that were from all-that-one-can-eat-buffet-restaurant places nearby where Jenna\u2019s Home was and her workplace both thus had each contributed to her \u201cweight gain\u201d and then worked on whatever remaining small work amounts had after having gathered any there that were still left unattended to and proceeded feast on whilst as if it were like there was no tomorrow at all. As Jenna proceeded to simply just eat and ignore how much her ever so growing swollen and round and big and fat belly of a stomach was swelling out and bulging out, a certain slim yet muscular and sweet young man who had went through high school and as well as college/university with her and had a work position at the same place as she had afterwards but here and thus whilst \u201cwith much greater ambitions\u201d had been leaving her more of the same cakes he had been leaving her whilst in the same described containers in the same described amounts of them, a coworker and friend of her\u2019s named Tom who despite finding himself attracted to her out of her good nature had chosen to be friends with her and vice versa - only she did not know at least and yet even over and whilst at these described points of his attraction to her. Miss Jenna had found him out at one point at her home - which was a few days before this one - yet she did not mind him doing what he was doing regardless or so to say - and she welcomed more and more of it all whilst both at her home and at work alike - and then Tom had prepared to continue on when he noticed a note at her table which appeared to be meant for him to read from her - that here was today written and also saying \u201cHey Tom. Feel free to join me at whatever buffet restaurant I go to eat at during any time you can and would like to do so. Here is my cell phone number for you to add to your contacts\u2019 list. - Jenna\u201d and so with that he added her number and discreetly went to somewhere to text her a confirmation message of his receiving her cell phone number which she responded with a thumbs up emoji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jenna had just finished what she had been eating up all of by the time that this work day was over combined with literally tons of tons more food amongst described types. Then Jenna, albeit with simply just a brief struggle, had managed to get up and then had headed onwards thus.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was one of the last few days of September which allowed enough time before Halloween October Holiday Week. Thus Tom had throughout that time amount been successful in joining up with \u201cLady Jenna\u201d as he had for a private nickname for her whilst kept to himself by him thus respectively at whichever inexpensive yet still \u201cfancy type\u201d from amongst any to call an all-that-one-can-eat-buffet-restaurant place that Miss Jenna herself had ever went to whilst for a single very inexpensive price to pay whilst in order to have multiple feasts whilst for appetizers, for dinners and for desserts at, whilst with he himself only just having one small appetizer serving and one dinner serving and on certain rare occasions one dessert serving for himself whilst Miss Jenna had multiple amounts almost literally nearing tons for Miss Jenna herself indeed. Though Tom, as stated before here, was not ever at all \u201cpurely shallow\u201d whilst in regards to such matters because as long as whichever girl he found himself attracted to was good natured etc yet still indeed nonetheless whenever he was watching the gigantically massive belly heavy bodied type of a gigantically enormously incredibly very fat woman indulge herself into as much foods as she had ever wanted to equally as much as she did during her work break times and yet several tons of several times much more so at the same time to the point of doing so even if it had resulted to the point of overeating for as long as she was still able to do so without a single bit of a shame or a care at all whilst at any such places as all-that-someone-can-eat-buffet-restaurant-place and end up as a result growing bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter with her always constantly ever expanding and constantly ever growing and constantly ever packed bulging and constantly ever extremely swelling incredibly gigantically bloated and massive boulder-sized sphere shaped single humongous entity for a very particularly incredibly spectacularly very particularly round glob for a constantly ever expanding and constantly ever growing incredibly gigantically bloated and massive boulder-sized sphere shaped single humongous entity for a very particularly incredibly spectacularly particularly round swollen blob for a hugely swollen big fat belly of a stomach all but more and more so than ever indeed becoming bigger and bigger and fatter and fatter rounder and rounder thus whilst with her all but thus so from over here indeed ever so unbridled and insatiable appetite becoming several times more unbridled and several times more insatiable than ever so before each time thus here indeed so, in spite of his attraction to her being from out of her good natured personality still nonetheless whilst he was watching all of it and her and was watching her belly grow and bulge and bloat and swell and balloon and expand more and more, he had found himself at the very least truly and sincerely only slightly getting \u201chardened whilst down below\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jenna, whilst on her part, did happened to have become one who had happened really so thus indeed to all but come to enjoy his company yet she did not know of nor reciprocated her male gendered friend-turned-into-friend-and-coworker\u2019s attraction to her at the very least whilst during those and these points but rather instead had simply just considered him to be a very good friend of her\u2019s and at that one good enough to keep her well fed and whatever any to call the booth table that they had seen to it that they would sit in nearby whichever buffet parts of whichever an all-that-one-can-eat-buffet-restaurant-place that they had seen to it that they would go to all but whilst for her well stocked. Soon Jenna was all but thus here indeed growing so fat and slow and heavy and easy to tire out that it did not take too long for her to ask for her good friend \u201cGentleman Tom\u201d as her secret nickname for him based on his good natured personality to bring tons and tons of trays and trays of platters and trays of platters of plates of tons and tons of food up to her as soon as they had selected whichever booth table to sit at and personally seat her own self over and at it, all with Tom doing this for her before getting something for himself to eat and as soon as they both had something he would finish his whilst watching and continue watching Miss Jenna whilst as she had went on ahead and indulged herself as much as she had liked to whilst for just one inexpensive price and having Tom bring more tons and more tons of trays of platters of plates of tons and tons of food to her for her to eat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Tom decided throughout that time amount to at least try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Tom, one day, whilst sitting down with Miss Jenna, had decided at last. \u201cUh Jenna?\u201d Asked Tom and she paused as she was finishing the last of one of her many servings. \u201cMMPHNOMF-Yesshh Tohem.\u201d Responded Jenna whilst meaning to ask it thus, though she unintentionally and without realizing it asked it whilst with her mouth all full yet fortunately nothing came out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I .... Well I do plan, since it happens to be that you and I are able to have and did take an opportunity for us to have thus here A Special Halloween Holoday October Week Lasting Week Off since on that week which will consist of seven days with Its Saturday as its final week day which is also Halloween Night AKA October 31st, to have a special dinner party like gathering on The Friday Before It and so would just like to know if maybe you would like to come to it albeit whilst as a friend of mine of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw Tom. Truly I am honored and as well as am touched that you would invite me to come to it. So I therefore would like to come to it very much.\u201d Replied Jenna who saw to it that she placed a single gently patting hand on her belly as she spoke her first few words and whilst speaking more of thus with it rubbing and then proceeding to have then placed two gently patting hands on her belly as she spoke her last few words and then gently and semi-absentmindedly rubbing her round belly that somehow still had yet to become an exposed and left for bare one due to the stretchable materials that her stretchable yet still becoming increasingly super tight and increasingly super snug work and non work clothing alike were made of very soothingly. Then Tom thanked her for agreeing and when Miss Jenna had finished her other food servings they had went on home right after the address for his place was described for hera whilst to place into her cell phone notes with it being confirmed to be not so far from her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Tom got all to the ready with some help from other fellow staff members for free food to be brought through catering and got lots and lots of food amongst various types and origins whilst \u201cfrom around The Globe\u201d, as well as various bakery types and other types of sweet foods and such ones as those and these yet also through his own being good at \u201cmaking them\u201d and soon Friday Before Halloween Week had come and by then they were all readied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus Jenna was brought by him to there by foot. Tom\u2019s Home was pretty nice and had various rooms and was like one of those fancy mansion manor like home resembling houses only far more inexpensive and with two upstairs floors and one main and one downstairs one and he got it all like how she did in that he got it through arrangements made by his family, friends of his family etc all and whilst with enough money for him to have him thus be \u201cset up whilst for life\u201d or so to say. Then Tom brought her inside with her all of the while carrying an extra large sized duffel bag carrier and a few extra large sized duffel bags inside it that each had purposes involving the likes of carrying books etc, and when they made it inside and into the downstairs basement kitchen room that itself was so indeed quite large, Miss Jenna had immediately waddled on over to the room\u2019s table from feeling an urge to need to catch her breath from the not so long walk to here from her place and then sat at a large armed chair. When Jenna saw what he had as food for her to eat up all of, indeed naturally Miss Jenna began salivating whilst panting.\u201cWell Jenna, is it understood that you are feeling hungry?\u201d Asked Tom. \u201cOh Tom *PANT* *PANT*, you know me all *PANT* *PANT* too well.\u201d Replied Jenna as she gently patted her big fat belly. \u201cNow Tom *PANT* *PANT*, could you be a dear and bring me lots of all of those foods on trays and trays of platters of plates of food to me in order for me to eat up?\u201d Asked Jenna after that as she had eagerly rubbed her belly. Then Tom did as she had thus asked and brought it all up to her. Miss Jenna right then and there to devour the many lots of them very so eagerly. What Jenna did not know was that indeed she would literally be eating each and every single one of all of those and these foods and them all by herself, for all of this was set up by her friend \u201cGentleman Tom\u201d for him to have some more one on one time with Miss Jenna <i>whilst</i> <i>privately</i>. Soon Jenna indeed had literally devoured <i>indeed</i> <i>simply</i> <i>only</i> <i>just</i> <i>a</i> <i>majority</i> of all of those and these and still from amongst them there still were literally tons and tons more left amongst appetizer and lunch and dinner and dessert foods. Now Jenna\u2019s belly was protruding out far rounder and gigantically hugely big and bloated and swollen and fat than ever before. \u201cUh Jenna, still feeling very hungry?\u201d Asked Tom. \u201cOh Tom, *HICHILP* indeed sure am so.\u201d Grunted Jenna whilst she had then rubbed her belly with both hands semi-sleepily. When Tom showed what he had for her, her jaw dropped open. Then Jenna had squeed and clapped her hands eagerly. \u201cOh-Tom, you-are-so-amazing!\u201d Squealed Jenna, who had then heaved herself up and squeezed him into a hug and kissing him on both his cheeks before digging in more and leaving him to blush in modesty.</span></div></div>",

With the end of the quarter fast approaching, it seemed anyone and everyone had to call today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Gordge Inc., how may I direct your call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Seriously, it's like they're transferring all the calls to my phone,\"</i> she thought, though she knew that wasn't true. Though she couldn't see the other secretaries, she could hear them answering and redirecting as many calls as she was. <i>\"Christ, how am I supposed to get anything else done?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA legitimate question, as the office had frankly become a zoo. Apparently, they were down two staff members, though if rumours were to be believed, one of them had been less then useful. Also if the rumours were true, not one but both women had fattened themselves into immobility, and that was patently ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, true or not (and Ashley suspected not), the girls at this office did seem to have a... shall we say, slight weight problem. Chubby seemed the norm for the majority of the staff, though there wasn't a shortage of women she could safely describe as fat. And there seemed to be at least a few who reached well beyond that title. Indeed, Ashley belonged to a small group that could be called thin without adding \"by comparison\" afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to see at least one root cause. Ashley could see into the break room from her desk, and there were several boxes of doughnuts in there, and a steady stream of staff running in and out of the room. She was starting to see a clear divide in the compulsive snackers, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby ones she typically only saw once over the course of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavier ones came by a couple times, too embarrassed to grab multiple pastries in one go, but apparently needing more then a singleton to get through the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fattest ones didn't have such compunctions. Whether from sheer comfort at work or simply not caring, these women would grab multiple desserts at a time and take them back to their desks. One in particular, Melissa, was the worst, grabbing full boxes on the mail cart when she came around. She was undoubtedly the fattest woman Ashley had ever seen as well. She looked almost as wide as she was tall, and her belly hung halfway down her thighs. Her upper arms were the size of roasted hams, and jiggled mightily at the slightest provocation. Jiggle, in fact, was definitely Melissa's watch word, as each laboured movement set some part of her overfed frame into gelatinous motion. Ashley hadn't even been here a full month, and she'd swear Melissa seemed bigger and her clothes tighter in that short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Ashley could hear her young coworker approaching now. Were her footsteps slower and her breathing louder then a month ago, or was that her imagination? Regardless, she smiled as Mel came around the corner. Mel's return smile dimpled her large cheeks, and her small wave set a substantial amount of fat into motion. \"Hey newbie, how goes the fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up as she finished her last call, Ashley answered, \"Exhausting. I've been on the phone all day; I've literally got nothing else done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear ya,\" Mel said as she dropped a handful of mail on Ashley's desk. \"The bosses have so much paperwork going around, I haven't even had time to sort any of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley groaned at the new papers on her desk. \"I haven't even finished yesterday's yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa scrunched her face. \"I know, it sucks, but just keep plugging away at it, you'll be fine.\" Mel looked down at Ashley's desk, forcing her enlarged double chin to hide her real one. \"Ash, what time's your lunch break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked down at her clock, and was shocked to see that it was nearly one. \"Oh, damn it! I worked through my lunch hour, and it's way too late to switch with someone!\" As if to rub salt in the wound, her stomach let out a soft growl, though certainly only loud enough for Ashley to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa rubbed her chins thoughtfully for a second before gesturing over her shoulder. \"Well, it may not be your usual fare, Miss Rabbit Food, but there's plenty of doughnuts in the break room. The one manager's husband is a baker and always bringing them by. She's convinced he's trying to fatten her up, so she gives them to the staff and tells us to help ourselves. Or if that's not to your liking, there's also some pizza left over from a manager's meeting earlier in the week, and we really need to finish that off soon before it goes bad and we have to pitch it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley couldn't help but look Mel up and down once she said that, though thankfully the large girl didn't seem to notice. <i>\"That does explain a lot,\"</i> she thought as the cart creaked its complaints as Mel leaned heavily upon it, half burying it under her rolls. \"Thanks, but I think I'll just wait until I get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? That could be a long time away; the Sup almost always starts asking people to work late around this time of year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll chance it for now, and grab something if I don't have time for anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, whatever works for ya. Anyway, I got to keep going. The mail won't deliver itself!\" Mel made her way off, but not before (<i>\"Of course.\"</i>) grabbing a full box of doughnuts. Ash's eyes were glued to Mel's expansive derriere as it wobbled away from her, leaving her feeling good about her decision to skip lunch rather then eat a lot of fatty foods. She knew she could never get that big, but she couldn't help but worry about her figure after being confronted with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, I definitely made the right choice...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That was the stupidest decision ever!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought passed through Ashley's mind as she flopped down on her couch, still dressed in her work clothes. Sure enough, her supervisor had come around and asked all the employees to stay late to try and get caught up on work. Her finances were too tight to say no to overtime, so Ash had spent her evening working on data entry, meaning it was nearly ten o'clock before she got back to her apartment. She'd caved to her hunger and eaten a pair of creme horns around four, but the light pastries hadn't stay with her, so now she was absolutely starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding insult to injury, her right knee was throbbing. Her trick knee, combined with her paltry wages at the gym, had led this one-time high school basketball star to seek a career change for something more sustainable. She certainly couldn't complain about the starting wages at Gordge, <i>\"But the hours leave something to be desired.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stretched her spine, feeling a pop from several spots in her back. God, she was tired. She knew she should cook something and exercise before bed, but the thought of doing anymore right now seemed impossible. She reached over and grabbed the small stack of take-out menus from her coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know I shouldn't, but I really don't feel like cooking. I wouldn't be eating until after eleven if I did, anyway. Take out is fine once in awhile, I just need to make sure it doesn't become a habit.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly wasn't a habit as it stood, as the bulk of the coupons were expired. Eventually, she found one that was still good. Ashley wasn't a big fan of Orange Star Pizza, as it was really, really greasy. However, it was cheap, and most importantly, they were the only place close to her building that delivered after ten. She placed her order for a large pineapple and olive pizza, and got changed out of her work duds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery guy arrived at about ten thirty, and Ashley couldn't help but smile when the poor kid's jaw dropped as she opened the door. She was a very good looking woman at twenty seven. She stood 5'7\" tall, and had a great set of legs. Her toned calves and muscular thighs gave way to the gentle swell of her hips and the more considerable bulge of her heart shaped ass. Sometimes she worried that her lower half was too large to be attractive, but if the delivery guy's reaction was anything to go by, she needn't worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed in cargo shorts and a short t-shirt that showed off her flat belly, and did nothing to hide her 34C breasts. Her family were of Swedish descent, and her long blonde hair fell in curly locks around her shoulders. Her sparkling blue eyes and pristine white smile left the poor guy speechless, and the kid processed her order and went on his way as quickly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nearly skipped to the couch after that ego boost, and ate four slices in short order. Back when she was still playing b-ball, she'd had the biggest appetite on the team. Once she wasn't playing full time, she slowed up considerably and carefully watched what she ate. Her hunger got the better of her this time, however, and she was a little taken aback with how much and how quickly she devoured her pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, this was the third time this month she was skipping her evening workout, and the first time she'd ordered take-out this year. <i>\"I really need to be careful. It's a slippery slope from here if I don't watch out. Still, it's just for tonight; I'll get back on my diet and start working out tomorrow.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with the temptations at and the nature of her job, that may be easier said then done...</span></div></div>",

Sliding off her belt, she flopped down on her couch with a sigh. <i>\"What a long day,\"</i> she thought as she grabbed a nearby delivery menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last month had seen Ashley ordering out more and more frequently. The end of quarter madness had made for many a late night, and Ashley seldom found herself with the time or inclination to cook anything for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times they'd just ordered pizza up to the office, and while she initially tried to restrain herself, it wasn't too long before she was eating her fill alongside the other women. Ashley knew this shift in diet wasn't terribly healthy, but given how little she was still eating next to the other office drones, she felt confident that she was still well within moderation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd also missed her evening workout more then she cared to admit. <i>\"And I'm hardly about to worry about that tonight,\"</i> she thought as she rubbed her sore knee. That said, she took some solace that she was still managing an abbreviated workout more often then not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And at least the first quarter is finally over. I can finally start getting myself back on track. Tomorrow, though, definitely tomorrow.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley leafed through the various menus before settling on a nearby fried chicken place, figuring if she was going to get back to her \"rabbit food,\" as Melissa liked referring to it, she might as well enjoy herself now. <i>\"And it's been so long since I had fried chicken.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a favorite of hers when she was still in high school, and her family always treated her to a feast of poultry whenever she won a game. The last time she'd had any was back in college, and just thinking about it was causing her to drool slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also felt a bit of pang of worry as she thought back to her time in college. After her knee had given out in high school, she knew a career in athletics wasn't in her future. However, while she couldn't be on the field, she decided to pursue a career in kinesiology. She'd never been lacking in effort regarding her academics, and had had no problem putting her nose to the grindstone to improve her grades where they were needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer waistline, however, had also taken its share of upgrades as well. Like many athletes, Ashley had continued to eat like she needed to burn 5,000 calories or so a day, but her newly sedentary lifestyle required less then 2,000. On top of that, she'd developed a terrible habit of stress snacking, adding to her calorie count quite heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer excessive consumption combined with her daily exercise dropping to nil could only have had a single outcome; Ashley had blown up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gain had continued through her final year of high school and into college. She did everything in her power to ignore her rapidly growing weight, but when her lard-engorged ass outgrew her third pair of fat pants in a year, she'd finally caved in and weighed herself. It was then that she'd found out that the 128 pound high school sports addict was now a jiggly 217 pound sophomore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had proven the wake-up call she needed. Almost overnight, Ashley had reinvented herself, maintaining a strict diet and exercise plan. She took advantage of the campus pool, swimming laps everyday to take it easy on her knee. Slowly but surely, her dedication paid off and she managed to drop a considerable amount, but never quite managed to get back to her high school weight. After graduation, she'd taken a job at Maxxi's Gym, in large part because she could use their facility at a substantial discount. However, her poor wages combined with being passed up for promotion twice had necessitated a career change, and thus she'd lost regular access to a pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley didn't want to find herself that large again, and knew she was already at risk of putting on some weight given her recent slips with regards to her plan. Still, she managed to convince herself that there wasn't a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It'll be fine just this once. I haven't had fried chicken in over five years and it sounds so, so good. Once isn't going to kill me. It's only a slippery slope if I let myself fall down it, and I'll be back to my normal routine this weekend. I'll start eating better and working out again, and keep my figure. It's not like I could get that big again, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, even if I did get as fat as I was in college, I'd still be tiny next to the girls at work.\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa had been at the office for a couple years. She came into the office a young na\u00efve college student. College had given her a small layer of fat that could be described as her \u201cfilling out\u201d her boney high school figure. She walked a thin line of curviness that was dangerously close to becoming chubby. In her first few years at the office though she \u201cfilled out\u201d more and more.  She became thicker and thicker until she became chubby and then fat. The hourglass shape remained intact but now it was much larger and lumpier. She really wasn\u2019t very happy with her weight gain but tried to repress those feelings. She simply lacked the will power to face her weight issue. Until one day her view of her weight changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting in the breakroom with tears running down her face. That\u2019s when Jenna waddled in. Jenna was an obese coworker that had been working at the office for many years.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want some doughnuts? Oh my god, are you okay!\u201d Jenna said noticing the crying Vanessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cna-\u2026 nooo.\u201d Vanessa squeaked. Jenna grabbed the box of doughnuts and sat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so fat now. *sniff* And now guys don\u2019t like me.\u201d Vanessa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not fat at all.\u201d Jenna said. Vanessa was fat at over 200 pounds but Jenna didn\u2019t want to tell her that, plus Vanessa was hardly fat compared to Jenna who was more than 150 pounds heavier than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am fat, I used to be so thin but now I\u2019m huge.\u201d Vanessa sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2026 You\u2019re just curvaceous. Your hips and boobs are too die for\u2026 for guys it\u2019s the bigger the better. You probably drive men crazy with all that \u2018junk in your trunk.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Then how come guys don\u2019t talk to me anymore, they just stare in disgust.\u201d Vanessa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere probably just nervous. Beauty can be intimidating. And those aren\u2019t stares of disgust! Guys are just checking out your hot bod.\u201d Jenna said. She knew she wasn\u2019t telling the truth but she figured that\u2019s what Vanessa wanted to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never thought about that. I guess maybe I\u2019m just filling out in the right places.\u201d Vanessa stopped crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly, you\u2019re hotter than when you started working here. You should embrace the phat, and that with a ph.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeehee, I\u2019m so glad you told me this. I feel so much better now. I think I\u2019ll have that doughnut now.\u201d Vanessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I finished the whole box.\u201d Jenna said with a smile. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Vanessa's confidence grew so did everything else. After initially freaking out about reaching 200 pounds she managed to pack on 60 pounds in 6 months! A majority of this weight went to her ass and thighs, but she also gained substantial weight in her breasts, stomach and arms. She loved every pound, she loved her new 38 F breasts, and her now chubby arms that she could use as a pillow if she ever felt like taking a nap after one of her lunch binges with one of the women or men in the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women in the office either looked at her in disgust and encouraged her to gain weight by telling her how good she looked or how sexy she her big ass was looking. They frequently offered to take her out for lunch so \"She could add some junk in the trunk\" but in reality it was so her gain would hide their own personal weight gain, or these ladies would offer her some leftover snacks or candy because they were \"too full\" or \"were just walking by her desk\". When in reality most of them did that so they would look smaller in comparison to her. Vanessa was oblivious to this so she took the all the free lunches she could get and saw this sudden popularity in the office among the women as a good thing. While about 1/2 of the office was actively trying to get her to gain weight the other 1/2 sincerely liked her and her new confidence so they would encourage her by telling her how sexy she was getting and complimenting her. She took it as a sign that her new confident attitude and pride in her image was winning over the ladies in the office. But during this period she was also experiencing new success with men in the office and else where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a lot of the men looked at her with disgust due to the weight she gained a surprising amount of the guys in the Gordge inc workplace looked at her with lust with every pound she gained. When she wasn't getting a free lunch from one of her girlfriends there were often a handful of guys willing to take her out for free. Kyle the little awkward man from Accounting who got the job when Vanessa was still just on the curvy line would come and talk to her any time an opportunity showed itself. He would take her out for lunch, dinner or buy her anything she wanted which Vanessa was gladly willing to take advantage of. In her mind her ass and tits were so amazing she deserved all the food and entertainment she could get, and if Kyle had the extra income why not spend it on her? Then there was the new hire Jeff who played Football in College but an injury ended his career before he could go pro. He was muscular and kind of dumb, but always loved big women and was an in the closet FA. He would always bring Vanessa a Weight Gain shake in the morning that he told her \"would help keep her from losing any of her curves\". He always brought her snacks and would surprise her with random gifts such as that Deep Fryer he got her for her Birthday. He was a bit dumb by her standards but she appreciated the free food and gifts. Then there was the intern Joey who never had much experience with women but openly admitted to loving curvy women. While there were bigger women in the office none were as well proportioned or sexy as Vanessa in his eyes. She had the perfect hip to waist ratio, a huge ass that you could see when looking at her in the front, a small but growing pot belly that shoot slightly when she walked and tits that he could get lost in for days. He was the perfect woman to her and he tried to show his affection by giving food like all the other guys and doing her work. She appreciated Joey's attention and would seductively bend over to pick up a dropped pencil or would ask him a question and lean over and rest her breast on his shoulder. She knew it drove him mad with lust but knew it would keep him doing her work so she could laze around the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant eating and feasting made Vanessa lazy so she frequently sat at her chair comatose or talking to one of the girls or guys she was now friends with. With Joey doing all her work and Kyle doing the work that Joey wasn't able to get too she was able to get paid to do nothing but laze around being social and eating. None of the girls knew about the guys doing her work so her boss thought she was doing an amazing job and gave her a raise which allowed her to eat even more and add too her already voluptuous curves. She felt bad for leading the handful of guys in the office who were in love with her on, but after working there for a few years she knew an office romance was a bad idea so she created online dating profiles. <br>\r\nShe had a tinder when she wanted an easy meal or lay, and was constantly going on dates nearly all nights of the week. usually going on dates 3 times a day on Saturday and Sunday in order to get a free meal and stuff herself. She usually hooked up with a few guys and then dropped then for whatever new boy she managed to find online just adding to her already blossoming confidence. She had a few fall back guys such as Raj, Ofer, or Justin who she went to when she really wanted to add to her curves because they would feed her and give her the best belly rubs or massages. They weren't really her type but they didn't pressure her into doing anything she didn't want to do and would stuff her and shower her with gifts turning the previously insecure girl into a vain woman who just wanted to add to her voluptuousness and date guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's easy to see how she managed to gain 60 pounds in 6 months. She felt with every pound it was just adding to her sexiness. She even worked out 3 times a week usually with one of her personal trainer boy toys who made her do workouts specifically to enhance her figure like squats for her sexy ass or Jeff who would usually make her do a light workout on the stair stepping machine and with weights and then take her out to stuff herself with protein heavy foods and desserts which would serve as \"carbs\". As she grew so did her vanity but she loved it and no one ever called her out on it so she grew more vain, more successful, and grew \"curvier\" every day due to the silence of others. Jenna who initial response turned her into the confident vain person she became loved her because she had someone to talk to and stuff her face with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after a large breakfast that caused her to come to work late again at 10 AM instead of 9, and after drinking the daily shake given to her by Jeff at 1030 every morning she was getting ready to take a quick nap when her boss called. \"Vanessa I need to speak to you as soon as possible, please come to my office immediately\" The boss stated. \"I wonder why I'm being called into the office\" Vanessa thought to herself as she pulled her fat ass out of her shrinking office chair and headed to the bosses office, but not before stopping into the break room to grab some donuts. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A quick stop in the break room for a donut turned into a quick dozen donuts as she saw an opportunity to add to her voluptuous figure despite being stuffed from her large breakfast and shake from earlier. Just before she walks into her bosses office she exhales causing a button to pop off of her work blouse to pop off revealing even more of her belly. The clothes she was wearing fit 3 months ago and she saw the outfit as proof that she's been growing curvier and even more irresistible but in this situation before meeting the boss she was nervous. Mr. Johnson always seemed like he had a stick up his ass and she didn't imagine coming into the meeting with her belly sticking out would leave a good impression. Still she had to see him so she proceeded into his office hoping for the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into his office and sat down on a wooden chair that creaked ominously. Things didn't start off too well either, before Mr. Johnson could greet Vanessa her stomach gurgled and she let out a loud belch, \"bbbuuuurrrrppppp\". \"Oh excuse me Mr. Johnson I apologize, something must be upsetting my stomach\" Vanessa said blushing. To her surprise Mr. Johnson replied by saying \"Good one, we need the future leaders of this company to be the biggest and brightest individuals in the company and if that burp was any indicator you are one of the best burpers I've ever heard haha!\" It took Vanessa a 2nd to think of a response, old Mr. Johnson always seemed like an asshole but here he was making jokes about burping, \" Well I am the best Mr. Johnson, and I'm working on becoming the biggest but Jessica had a head start so I need to catch her ha!\" she stated trying to joke around with Mr. Johnson. \"The jokester here, you don't only do good work but you're funny, I like you and I'm here to make you an offer Ms. Singh, here at Gordge inc. we're trying to diversify our executive leadership, stuffy old white men is the thing of the past we need men and women of diverse backgrounds such as yourself Ms. Singh, that's why we created the Minority Executive Training Program and we want you to be the 1st person to partake in the program.\" \"... Wow, I would be honored, I always saw myself as a leader, I mean I'm so popular the whole office fights over whose going to take me out to lunch haha, it is such an honor to be placed in this program Mr. Johnson.\" Vanessa said awe struck barely even able to believe what happened. \" Call me Joe Vanessa, it's a honor to have you with our company, your performance these past 6 months have been incredible, you been working overtime and taking new projects and initiative, you've worked very hard. Here at Gordge inc. we like individuals who don't just want a piece of the pie, but want the whole pie and I think you're the type of woman that wants the whole pie, am I correct Vanessa?\" Vanessa was still a bit awe struck but started gaining her composure, \" I don't just want a piece of the pie Joe I want the whole pie and then some, I want the pie, the cake, the donuts and the pastries, I want it all and I think you made the right choice Joe.\" Joe smiled appreciating the answer, \"That's what I want to hear from a future executive ha, here at Gordge inc. we want it all.\" Joe stated smiling, \"speaking of cake I bought 3 pies from the bakery up the street to leave for the employees in the break room, would you like a sneak peak and have the 1st slice?\" Joe said as he brought out the 3 pies and set them on his desk, \"Just choose which pie you'd like, I have Apple, Cherry, and Banana Cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa on cloud 9 1st grabbed the Banana Cream and set it next to her and then grabbed the Apply and Cherry pies and put them in her lap as she put the whole Cherry Pie to her mouth and took a bite, \"I want them all Joe, I wasn't lying when I said that\" she smiled as she took another bite from the Cherry Pie. Joe looked confused at 1st, he thought to herself, \"Who the fuck does this woman think she is, this is crazy, let's see if her stomach is as big as her mouth is\". \"Well Ms. Singh I love your enthusiasm, I was going to discuss the exact details at a later time, but let's talk now\". \"Alright Joe, but I need to be gone by lunch, I promised Kyle I would let him take me out to lunch\" she said with a smug look on her face as she was already finished with 1/3 of the pie meant to feed 10 people in less than 5 minutes. \" Well how about this, I'll let you leave for lunch if you finish those pies, before lunch time, it's 11:25, so you have 35 minutes, if you finish in time you can leave, but if you don't you have to stay in my office for lunch and watch me eat instead of going out... deal?\" Joe said with a smug arrogance in his tone, \"No way she could possible finish those 3 pies in 35 minutes\" he thought to himself. \"You're on Joe\" Vanessa said, \" As I said before I want it all and I'm going to have it all.\" she said as she increased her pace and took another bite of her Cherry pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started eating like a woman possessed, even though she already had a large breakfast and a shake, she started eating those pies with a renewed vigor. She finished the Cherry pie 10 minutes later at 11:35 straining her overworked blouse even more and making her skirt uncomfortable tight. She was already full but was up to the challenge, she needed to eat 2 more pies meant to feed 20 people in 25 minutes, and it took her 15 minutes to eat the 1st one. \"Okay, you can do this, just unbutton your skirt and that'll make room for more pie\" she thought to herself as she started unbuttoning her skirt. \"What the heck are you doing Vanessa? Why are you unbuttoning your skirt?\" Joe said confused. \" So I can eat more\" she smiled as she took started on the apple pie. Joe just shook his head and went back to checking his email. Vanessa was feeling uncomfortable full but kept trucking on, her mouth was never not full as she took bite after bite of the apple pie trying to finish it as fast as possible. Her stomach grew, her blouse got tighter and tighter as her belly grew filled with pies meant to feed all the employees on her floor. Finally as she took the last bite and was getting ready to grab the Banana Cream pie 2 of her buttons popped off of her blouse leaving most of her belly in the open and one of the buttons flew right past Joe's head. \"What the hell was that\" Joe said startled, but Vanessa didn't even respond, it took her 12 minutes to finish the 2nd pie and she needed all the time she could get if she wanted to finish the 3rd pie before lunch. She was stuffed, she hadn't been this full since the time Jeff took her to the all you can eat buffet and challenged her to an eating contest which she won of course and she wasn't going to lose this contest either. Joe took his lunch out and put it on his desk, he didn't think it would be possible for her to finish the 3rd pie in less than 13 minutes. But there Vanessa was eating like a woman whose been out in the desert for weeks without food despite feeling so full that she feared she might pop. Pop went a 3rd button as her stomach was completely out now, but she didn't even acknowledge it, it was 11:57 and she only had 3 minutes to finish the last 1/5th of the thick Banana Cream pie. Joe was looking worried now, not about losing the best but worried about her safety, \"Ms. Singh, you don't have to do this, are you sure you want to finish this pie?\" He said fearfully worried that her belly might burst. But Vanessa didn't even show any signs of recognizing the statement, she was in the zone and their was only 2 minutes left to finish the rest of the pie. As 11:59 approached she slowed down with only one bite left. She looked Joe directly in the eyes as if to say, \"I told you so\", she licked each of her fingers and then reached into her cleavage to get some of the filling that fell. She looked at him seductively and licked her finger before finishing the last bite with one minute to spare. She stuck her chest out causing another button to pop and fly past Joe's head as he ducked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over Joe's desk and whispered, \" I told you I want it all.\" before standing up and taking the lunch he put out on the desk in order to mock her. Joe couldn't even say anything and had a dumb struck look on his face and an awkward boner than he tried to hide but Vanessa noticed. As she walked towards the door she rocked her hips back and forth hypnotizing Joe and as she opened the door she said, \"We can talk about the Minority Executive Training Program later, but as for now I'm going to go get lunch.\" She winked before she shut the door. As soon as the door shut she saw Lucille, \"Hey Lucille want to get lunch with me and Kyle, I'm in the process of adding more curves to my body\" she said as she winked and stuck out her tongue. She thought to herself, \"I really need to thank Kyle and Joey for their hard work, I'll let them take me to an all you can eat buffet sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was in his room confused and hungry. He called his assistant, \"Get me some lunch boy, and get it to me as soon as possible or else you're fired!\", the assistant responded, \"But I already got you lunch and those pie--\", \"ONE MORE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED, GET ME MORE PIES AND LUNCH\" He hung up and called upper management, \"I think we made the right choice, that Vanessa Singh is a competitor.\"</span></div></div>",

She soaked it all in. \"So Kyle I just got up graded, isn't that just awesome? And I know you've been working so hard so I'll try to put in a little extra, sound good?\" Her words flashed like a nice chrome paint job. Drawing Kyle out of his gaze for a moment. \"Hu-- yeah..\" Stammered Kyle.<br>\r\n\"Some people just can't take it all in.\" Thought Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the buffet, they got their table and ordered. Vanessa's chair moaned at her huge round ass. <br>\r\n\"I'll  have the endless hot dogs and fried butter.\" Stated Vanessa.<br>\r\n\"A slice of pizza\" droned Kyle.<br>\r\nA minute later the food hit the table and all beta were off. Kyle watched Vanessa go to work on her food as she stuffed her face and swallowed. She finished in 12 min. And got her second plate. After that she had lyles pizza while waiting on her thirds. Then lastly her fourths ended the lunch with her last spoon full of deep fried Mac and cheese mixed with deep fried re-fried butter. She let out a prolonged burp letting Kyle know she was done. She let out a slight giggle when she stood up. Kyle was beyond speechless when he saw her belly stuffed to the brim. It stuck out past her gargantuan tits so much that it barely knocked over the table when she stood up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How could Kyle say no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kyle had to return to the office. But he left Vanessa in his apartment, insisting that she help herself to anything he had, and feel free to use his credit card to order pizza and take-out, if it wasn't enough. She didn't need to be told twice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore all that, Vanessa had to change out of her constricting, blown-out work clothes into something more comfortable. She rummaged through Kyle's stuff and found a comfy-looking shirt and shorts that she just managed to squeeze into. Kyle was smaller than her, and her huge tits, belly, and ass stretched out his clothes quite a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kyle returned home, he found Vanessa lying on the couch in front of the TV, surrounded by empty boxes of food. She had been gorging all day while he was at work, and her belly bulged out of her shirt which he recognized immediately as one of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you bring home dinner, baby?\" asked Vanessa, her massive breasts jiggling and straining his shirt as she sat up. She didn't feel ashamed at all asking for more, despite having over-stretched Kyle's clothes, eaten out his food, and used his credit card to pay for her feast. She thought that a hot, sexy, curvy woman like herself ought to be spoiled this way, and she was entitled to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I missed one!\" she exclaimed, spying a single doughnut in an otherwise emptied box on the floor by the couch. She bent forward, and Kyle winced as his poor shorts stretched against her giant ass, before a loud *RIPPPPPPPPP* resounded through his living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm getting even curvier\" breathed Vanessa with a wink, and taking a huge bite out of the doughnut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wondered how much larger she would grow in the months to come. </span></div></div>",

Her fat ass, barely contained in a straining skirt, spilled over the sides of her buckling chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at this size she maintained her hourglass figure, and she looked over her massive, HH-cup boobs bursting out of her blouse to see what she wanted to see: several boxes of pastries and sweets provided by co-workers, and stacks of reports all finished thanks to the ever-helpful Kyle, Joey, and a couple of other boys who had been added to her collection of underlings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just come in (although it was already 11:00 am--she could afford being lazy and late nowadays), but most of her work for the day was already done without her having to lift a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life is good when you're this hot\" she smiled, her massive, heavy breasts knocking aside some of the materials on her desk for emphasis, as she reached a wobbling, fat arm for a box of doughnuts. A button popped off, allowing her bra to be seen as even more of her cleavage spilled out of her blouse. It wasn't the first button, either. Many of her buttons were already gone, and the remaining ones strained against her giant boobs and fat belly, her belly button showing as her gut poured out visibly. Another perk of having a higher position was she got away with office dress-code issues, since the boss thought she was doing so well with work anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa spent the next hour stuffing her face and messing around on facebook, tinder, and instagram. She set up dates for herself, and posted selfies showing off her immense cleavage, waiting as the \"likes\" flooded in for each photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was living large, and was loving it. How could she had not seen the value of her bodacious, bursting figure before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as she tossed aside her last box into the emptied pile, she realized:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lunch time!\" licking her lips as she heaved her monstrous ass off her chair, which seemed to sigh in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chloe was one of the girls at the office who pretended to adore Vanessa's expanding figure, but actually found the burgeoning BBW frankly quite disgusting. She was part of the 1/2 of the office who purposely wanted the fat bitch to get even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the other girls who felt the same way, Chloe often encouraged Vanessa to eat and fatten up, often passing her high-calorie treats during office hours, and even taking the gluttonous girl out to free meals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance, right now Chloe had two massive pork burritos and a box of fudge brownies that she had picked up on the way to work, intended solely for Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessa!\" called Chloe, just as Vanessa waddled past her cubicle towards the break room. It was lunch time after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe!\" smiled Vanessa making a detour into Chloe's cubicle. Chloe noticed how her huge hips were nearly as wide as the cubicle entrance--it looked like only a matter of time before she outgrew cubicle entrance-ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking fineeee girl\" she lied, as she watched Vanessa's giant, overflowing tits and fat, exposed belly wobble heavily to a halt, as her immense office-mate stood before her. Those tits were enormous, blocking her view of most of Vanessa's face from as the big girl stood and she sat, and the girl's belly button was showing for Pete's sake. Hadn't she heard of office dress code? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally pull off that...ummm...outgrown corporate look...\" went on Chloe, not knowing how else to praise the fat-ass. \"Like...ummm...you are waaaay too much woman for those pathetic clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow very much self-confident and full of herself, Vanessa ate up the complements like she would a strawberry cheesecake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe, seeing Vanessa grin smugly like she was the hottest thing in the world, went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big ARE those things anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa loved being asked her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just got myself measured up, so I'm waiting for my new K-cup bras to come in the mail...\" boasted Vanessa, looking down at her mammoth mammaries which partially blocked her view of Chloe. \"...but while I wait, I'm cramming them into these tiny HH-cups for now. Ugh, these are TIGHT!\" For emphasis, she tugged at her bra cups, visible since so many of her blouse's buttons had bust off trying to contain her immense rack, making her giant boobs wobble heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so unfair, it's like all of your weight goes straight to your tits and ass\" said Chloe with a fake sigh, before staring ironically at the exposed, blubbery belly bulging before her and those thunder thighs that supported that giant ass of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? No wonder the boys can't take their eyes off me\" said Vanessa vainly, stretching her chubby arms up and thrusting out her monstrous chest, just as another button flew off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What a cow' thought Chloe in disbelief, listening to the HH-cup bra struggle against the enormous K-cup tits they tried to contain. She had the biggest tits and ass in the office, by far. Though some girls were still heavier than her, none were blessed with her ridiculous hourglass proportions She had quickly outgrown all of the G-cup bras she borrowed from Jenna--the girl who had encouraged her to embrace her curves in the first place. Even now, Jenna was still about 50 pounds heavier than the 320-lb Vanessa, but Vanessa's tits and ass just eclipsed whatever anyone else had at her current size. One wondered how big they would grow if she got even FATTER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we're about to find out' thought Chloe with a dastardly smile, as she grabbed the two massive burritos and the box of brownies she had stashed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you've got those unfair curves, I guess you wouldn't mind polishing this off for me? It just goes to all the right places for you\" she said, holding up the fattening food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's eyes lit up, and she immediately tore open the first burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're absolutely right. Thanks, babe\" she said through a mouthful of burrito, cradling the other one and the box of brownies in her plump arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe wasn't the only one who offered her lunch, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of other ladies, right on cue, presented Vanessa with free food--chinese take-out, burgers and fries, barbecue, sometimes even whole pizzas! This happened on a daily basis. It was no wonder Vanessa was getting so huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gluttonous girl took her massive stash to the break room, which was empty. She stuffed her face happily in private, devouring everything all of her office mates brought her. There, she watched television, and used the internet on her phone, wasting more time. Now and then, someone would come in (usually from the \"fatten-up-Vanessa brigade\") to offer her even more to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent the better part of 3 hours just eating and lazing about in the break room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she returned to her desk, she hardly looked professional. Only a few buttons remained on her creaking blouse, her massive tits and very stuffed belly bulging out for all to see. Her skirt struggled to contain her vast hips, were bursting at the seams, and barely stretched over her gigantic ass. Her face and fingers were messy with food, and her blouse had stains evident of her pigging-out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh I loveee work\" said the big girl contentedly, as she sat her enormous booty down into her groaning, buckling chair once more, and smiled at a newly-completed stack of papers on her desk.</span></div></div>",

She was so in demand. 'Then again, why would I NOT be?' she thought vainly, looking down at her blouse-busting boobs and chair-overflowing ass. She was a whole lot of hot, outrageous woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked out one of the lucky boys and gave him a \"yes\", telling him to pick her up at her office in 30 minutes. It was only 3:00 pm, yet she was already getting to leave work. She had come in late, gotten no work done herself, spent her entire time lazing about and eating, and now was going to be leaving work at 3:30 pm. She really was a shining example of an employee--and yet, thanks to her hardworking boys like Kyle and Joey, she appeared super productive to all the higher-ups, and she took all the credit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from her chair (after squeezing her giant booty out of it, of course), Vanessa waddled her way to the ladies room to get dressed. She usually went out on dates after work (sometimes several a day), so she had a variety of clothes ready at her cubicle for any occasion. Since today's date wasn't going to be anything special, she decided to pick out something casual--a pair of denim cut-off shorts, a nice thick leather belt, and a tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get into a cubicle in the ladies room, Vanessa had to squeeze herself at an angle, as her vast hips were wider than the doorway. The cubicle itself was pretty cramped, as her 320-lb body took up a good portion of it, leaving little room for maneuverability. That was a bit of a problem, since the girl had to jump and shimmy and tug her struggling clothes over her over-abundant curves. Other women in the bathroom were already used to the sounds of Vanessa banging against the cubicle door and walls as she did battle with her clothing. The girl needed a wardrobe upgrade soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally squeezing out of the cubicle, Vanessa, admired her bodacious bod in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer giant tits were bursting out of her tank top, which had actually torn down the neckline a bit to accommodate her bulging chest. Her fat belly was showing as it spilled over her shorts, rendering her thick belt and much of the shorts themselves invisible under her gut and love handles. She turned to the side, admiring her profile (her massive breasts and big belly wobbling as she spun), and seeing how her humongous ass bulged halfway out of her creaking shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am fine' she smiled at her reflection, totally oblivious to the other women in the bathroom who were shooting her concealed looks of disgust and disapproval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, that giant ass of hers settled into the passengers seat of her date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you must be Collin. I'm Vanessa, so nice to meet you\" she said, flashing a pretty, double-chinned smile. She thrust her giant chest out and pressed her arms together, pushing her already massive K-cup boobs out of her top even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin's jaw was a-gape as his eyes stared fixedly on the sea of cleavage wobbling before him. Vanessa grinned. Another little man for her to exploit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin wasn't Vanessa's only date that day, either. Vanessa went on two more, each of which took her out to dinner, dessert, and drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she returned home to her apartment, she was bursting full, her poor belt stuffed uselessly in her handbag and her giant, stuffed gut forcing her tank top up as it spilled over her unbuttoned, unzipped shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 320-pound girl (though probably a couple of pounds heavier now!) collapsed onto her bed, which groaned loudly. She booted up her laptop and sliced herself a bit of caramel-fudge cake that had been sent by Joey, the intern. She decided to give Joey a call, to remind him to work on her presentation. Calling on webcam always persuaded the boy to work extra hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Joeee\" she cooed, and she could see herself onscreen as how she appeared on Joey's monitor--pretty face, double chin, and overflowing cleavage bursting out of her insubstantial top, as her giant boobs bulged onto her bed as she lay on her side. She had also removed her bra, and one of her nipples was starting to poke out of her creaking top. K-cup boobs were very hard to contain, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey miss 'Nessa\" he gulped, eyes bulging at the sight of the tremendous-tittied woman. She was helping herself to the cake he had sent. No doubt a good chunk of all those calories would go to those ballooning tits and expanding ass of hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just making sure you're working on my presentation like I asked you too\" she said, crumbs bouncing off her cleavage. \"I really...really need that done by tomorrow\" she smiled, adjusting herself on her bed. Joey could hear the bed creak, and held back a gasp as one of her nipples poked out, her giant boobs bursting out of her tearing top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Uhhh...of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled. She was doing it all on purpose, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a sweetie Joey\" she said, giving the monitor a kiss, her monstrous cleavage rocking as she leaned in. \"See you tomorrow at the office!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa logged off, set her laptop aside, and switched on the television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to sit up since seeing the TV past her gigantic boobs was impossible while laying down fully. As she flipped through channels and stuffed herself with Joey's cake, she rubbed her fat, bulging belly happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Life is good!'</span></div></div>",

Only empty cartons, boxes, and food wrappers remain. \"It's only 11:00 am for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Vanessa came into work early today, then\" chuckled Mel, who had been wise enough to buy lunch. She unwrapped her large, sub sandwich oozing with cheese. She knew when that vacuum-cleaner of a woman Vanessa arrived at work, anything not nailed down was fair game to her. Then again, she knew that they--the 1/2 of the office that belonged to the \"fatten-up-Nessa-brigade\"--had been partly to blame for her shameless gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we're purposely fattening that cow up, and it was pretty fun at first, but this is ridiculous!\" said Chara, opening the refrigerator and finding that all 3 boxes of doughnuts she had bought earlier today were totally cleaned-out. And so was the rest of the refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the object of Chara's misery came waddling in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow an enormous 440 pounds, Vanessa had managed to pile out an astounding 120 lbs in the past 3 months. How could she not, when all she did at work was eat, and rely on her boys to do her work for her? Toss in the fact that she got another raise for her \"good work\", giving her even more funds to spend on food, and it was no surprise just how massive the girl had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, still no refills?\" frowned Vanessa, looking around at the mess she had break room in. She was used to having people either send food directly to her table, or leave things in the break room with her name on it. She had waited a whole 10 minutes without eating a thing, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then spied her two workmates, and more importantly, spied the mouth-watering sub sandwich Mel had yet to take a bite out of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, that looks goooood\" she moaned hungrily, smiling down at Mel, who was seated at the table. She could hardly see the woman past her now monstrous, Q-cup breasts (which she liked to remind her friend Jenna, who was still a sizeable G-cup, was equivalent to a GGGGGGGGGGG-cup. That was 10 cup sizes larger), barely contained in a rapidly-failing button-up cardigan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreedily, she grabbed the sandwich right out of Mel's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have a little taste, if you don't mind\" she said, licking her lips as she took a giant bite that made 1/4th of the sandwich disappear instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessa, that's my lunch!\" cried Mel, who was helpless as the massive woman wolfed down the rest of her sandwich in seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, all gone already? They make them so small these days\" she frowned, licking her oily, cheesy fingers clean. Obviously still hungry, she looked around the break room to triple-check if she missed any food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go see if Joey made that pastry-run yet\" she shrugged, turning around and proceeding to lumber away. Her giant booty was flooding out of the top of her groaning khaki pants which, Chara and Mel noticed, had a massive rip down the middle and along the sides, where her monstrous ass cheeks and thighs were bulging through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't even lunch time yet. </span></div></div>",

As a result, she was allowed to strut about the office in less than decent clothing, her giant boobs and ass often bursting out and wobbling as she waddled through the cubicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also made certain arrangements to suit his best employee's needs. The faster restocking of the break room and pantries was one, and replacing her broken office chair after she broke the 400-pound mark was another. However, even these arrangements were quickly becoming outdated--Vanessa was depleting the break room and pantry stores at a frightening rate daily, and by the looks of things, she was already starting to outgrow her brand-new office chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese privileges allowed Vanessa to really \"bloom\", in all senses of the word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as the 440-pound young woman came lumbering into his office, giant Q-cup tits a-wobbling and massive hips a-swaying, he knew that she would make it BIG in the industry one day. Both figuratively and literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa! I hope I did not intercept your early lunch break\" he said, as the big girl settled her monstrous booty into the bench in front of his desk. Mr. Johnson had replaced the chair that used to be there, after Vanessa broke it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know about that Joe?\" smiled Vanessa, feigning surprise and guilt, and pretended to tug her struggling cardigan over her huge belly. She had been taking early, prolonged lunch breaks for the past few months now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kid, I kid. If eating keeps your brilliance and productivity up, why should I stop it?\" replied the boss with a friendly shrug. \"Now, on to the reason why I called you here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe then explained that, as part of the Executive Training Program, they would be sending her to a top management school in a different state, for training. She would be away for 2 months, all expenses paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was delighted. All expenses paid meant food too, of course. She accepted the offer in a heartbeat. She would be leaving the following Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Friday, and she felt like celebrating. But who to celebrate with?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But Vanessa was still at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a difference a few months can make huh?\" she smiled, almost proudly, as Vanessa raised a fat, wobbling arm and called for an 8th burger. After all, she had been the one who convinced Vanessa that her figure was worth admiring...and cultivating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. I can't believe I used to think I was anything less than smoking hot\" replied her friend, looking down at her own monstrous rack and seeing that her tits were all but busting out of her top. She gave the tiny tube she wore under her bursting cardigan a few tugs, but her massive melons just wobbled uncontrollably. Q-cup boobs tended to be difficult to contain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you used to be so much....well...smaller than me. NOW look at you! You're nearly 100 pounds heavier than me!\" exclaimed Jenna, watching those monster tits jiggle and wondering how many seconds her own G-cup bras would last trying to hold them. \"But you carry it all so well\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right? The time and pounds just fly when you're having fun\" winked Vanessa back, just as her burger arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a massive dinner that left the diner's cooks reeling, Jenna dropped Vanessa off at her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey big girl, do me a favor will ya?\" chuckled Jenna as Vanessa wedged her massive booty out of the passenger doorway. The car seemed to sigh in relief as 440 pounds of woman was relieved off its back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try and make sure that giant ass of yours can still FIT into my car when you get back! 2 months is a damn long time for a girl with your appetite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" called Vanessa back with a smile, sticking out her tongue and proceeding to waddle to her apartment door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped her keys, and as she bent to pick them up, her poor khakis let out one final groan before exploding apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled, looking down at her fully exposed, monstrous booty.

The courses, Vanessa found, were nothing more than a few seminars and the occasional team building activities. This meant she had more than enough time to try all the different restaurants and bars around town, attend parties, or just laze around at her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was taking full advantage of the \"all expenses paid\" aspect of the program, spending hours at the school dining halls or at nearby diners and restaurants, restocking her substantial supply of food at her apartment several times a day, and just being an all-around glutton.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the result?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gain the Freshman Fifteen in your first week, did you?\" laughed Jenna, noticing how much fatter her friend's face looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the Freshman FIFTY...PLUS\" boasted Vanessa, zooming-out her webcam to reveal a truly monstrous rack that was bursting out of a torn, creaking Gallaway University tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez girl!\" gasped Jenna, though she had not expected any less of her gluttonous friend. As Vanessa zoomed-out more, Jenna got a good look at her huge belly, bulging onto her thighs and out of her inadequate top, serving as a good support for her massive boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The college boys can't take their eyes off me. They're actually really sweet\" giggled the now nearly 500-lb woman, even her giggling sending her gargantuan cleavage into waves of jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could they, when you're wearing tops that tiny?\" said Jenna, watching her friend stretch, her Gallaway University top riding up and showing even more of her massive belly, fattened up with four weeks' worth of college food and booze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your information, this is a XXL\" smiled Vanessa, trying to tug her \"tiny\" top over her huge gut, which only succeeded in making it rip even more against her monstrous breasts. \"It just can't handle all my curves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised the boys still CAN. You must be a whole lot of woman to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa grinned. It was true that many boys were starting to struggle with her...abundance. She noticed they had been, even back at work, for a few months now. They were struggling even more now with her added, nearly 500-pound bulk. But it was the price they had to pay to be with an absolute goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should be thankful, they're learning how to be with a REAL woman with REAL curves. I wouldn't give my curves up for anything!\" retorted the proud girl, as she took a massive bite out of some cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she dropped out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessa? You okay?\" asked Jenna with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her friend's monstrous, overflowing boobs and giant belly filled the screen again. She had stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, part of my bed just gave way. I'm getting soooo curvaceous!\" she replied proudly, before turning around and showing Jenna a gargantuan ass barely contained in a tiny pair of shorts that stretched only halfway over each tremendous buttock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back! My 10th pizza just got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna watched her friend's giant booty wobble away, she checked her clock. It wasn't even lunchtime yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That old Vanessa weighed less than 150 pounds and was still blessed with curves her Punjabi ancestry gave her but had no confidence in. This time College would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her 1st group class session she sat at the front, feigned interest (even though she was starving) and successfully convinced the professor in charge that she was serious and interested in the program.

Everything seemed a whole lot closer to her now that she was so vast, and the cubicle felt certainly more cramped. At least the boss had gotten her order for the new industrial strength, heavy-duty computer chair. There was no way an ordinary chair could take her monstrous ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, the new chair buckled under her immense weight, as her hips and ass poured over the sides. Her huge belly, which her groaning strapped top and cardigan barely stretched over, bulged heavily onto her desk, smothering her keyboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her gigantic tits, stretching forward even further than her massive gut, smashed against her computer monitor, pressing it against her cubicle wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot and sweaty, she peeled off her useless cardigan, her giant boobs bursting out of the creaking top she had on underneath. She tugged at her custom-ordered, SS-cup bra that barely contained her megaton breasts, the straps digging into her shoulders and back fat. It was time for an upsize. Again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her computer booted up, she glanced over her titanic tits and saw a stack of papers and a couple of boxes of pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, Kyle. How I missed you\" she cooed, reaching out a massive, wobbling arm and grabbing her first box. As she did, one of her monstrous breasts knocked over the stack of papers. She didn't care. She only cared about further increasing her hotness, her curvage...and she dug into the box hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kyle and Joey had prepped them on what they were getting into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa munched on her morning donuts, more food started showing up at her desk. Her new flock of boys were bringing in deliveries all day. Vanessa kept quite full and had no reason to leave her desk all day. Her womanly curves expanded even more as she ate. At this rate she was just going to continue her gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gotten so big it was hard to tell where one roll stopped and the next began.

She knew she was hot, she slept with enough men the past 2 years at Gorge inc to fill a yearbook and manipulated her way to the top. As she got bigger she got lazier and she noticed her mobility lessoning. Getting tired at the dance club after 15 minutes of standing or 5 minutes of dancing. She loved her body and wanted it to get even bigger but knew she would have to work out again to get it. So naturally she emailed one of her earlier flings in the office Jeff the former football player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey Jeff,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I have a stressful day tomorrow and have to evaluate all the people I manage, would you mind working out with me before work tomorrow at the corporate gym? I have keys to it so we can get there at 7 and hit the gym. I would love to see you again <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff replied by sending her an IM,<br>\r\nJ - you know I'm enganged now right? But I've been seeing that fat ass and massive utters in the office, I'll work you out on the down low sexy ;P<br>\r\nV - Congrats on the wife to be, is she as sexy as me <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> , I doubt it lol, BUT I really meant work out, I need to do it, I need to work out if I'm gonna keep twerking the 2 massive cheeks of mine, do you think you can even still handle me little man :D ha, so you down to work me out tomorrow big man?<br>\r\nJ - you bet, I'll work that massive desi bod of yours any day, I'll tell my girl I need to do some \"extra work\", see you tomorrow morning at 7 sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Jeff signed off and went back to work. After a rather uneventful day filled with snacking, eating and... \"managing\", Vanessa went home and went to bed earl for once without her usual dinner feast. I need to be able to work out tomorrow, so no feasting she thought to herself as she laid down on her reinforced King size bed without a man (or occasionally woman) on it for the 1st time in about a week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning Vanessa actually arrived 15 minutes early and skipped breakfast. It was very unchararistic of her but she was motivated to get her mobility back so she could keep using her growing curves to her advantage. Luckily for her Jeff showed up early too and after 20 minutes of Vanessa riding his massive cock and nearly suffocating him with her massive belly which now overflowed over Jeff's head (which she not so secretly loved doing to her men) and ending their fuck session with a some classic  69'n she stopped things after she Orgasmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fianc\u00e9 is a lucky woman Jeff, you still eat a pussy like a starving animal\" - Vanessa said contently trying to get the energy to put her workout gear back on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can eat your beautiful pussy like an all-you can eat buffet, its still tasty as ever, you want a round 2 of the Jeff show baby?\" Jeff said as he tried to spread Vanessa's Tree Trunk thighs apart again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No, I NEED to work out, riding you was cardio so lets head straight to the weights\" Vanessa said, squeezing his head between her thighs before letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright babe, we'll start with the Leg Press Machine\" and with that Jeff started working Vanessa out, literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter over an hour of leg presses, lunges (which she could somehow still do), deadlifts, and other workouts designed to make her ass bigger and legs stronger they stopped with a worn out red Vanessa and an impressed Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly\", I didn't think that fat ass could still work out he said laughing as he slapped her ass as hard as he could. \"Underneath that sexy blubber of yours is some muscle baby, good job, seriously, I know women like my fianc\u00e9 weigh less than 200 pounds but couldn't do the workout you just did\" he told Vanessa with admiration as they walked towards the locker rooms to shower<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know baby, I used to work out on a regular basis until I hit 550 pounds or so, I'm just trying to get back in it so I can keep shaking my blubber butt stud\" she winked as she slowly wobbled into the locker room to shower. Vanessa was always competitive in everything she did, in College she was a 4.0 student, HS a valedictorian, and at the gym she never gave up, but in this instance she knew she pushed herself to hard as she collapsed on a bench to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wouldn't be so hard if I ate, I'm just STARVING she thought to herself as she rested on a bench before she showered.  I feel like I could eat a horse, no 2 horses, no 2 horses both with Jeff's riding on them she thought as she giggled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting for a few minutes and taking a quick shower she realized she was running late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, it's 9:20, I need to get to the conference room asap! I'm supposed to be giving my crew evaluations today.\" she stated matter of factly to herself as she put on her custom made skirt and suit jacket on. Then as she was getting ready to leave she her stomach roared with displeasure. It's been literally years since Vanessa had let herself starve, and the veracity and loudness of her stomach gurgling frightened her. She's pleased her stomach for so long she forgot how angry it could get as her belly vibrated from the booming sound her stomach was making causing the rest of her fat laden body to vibrate ever so slightly. She put a hand on her stomach and reached down in her purse to try to briefly state the being that was her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate her usually morning snack in 5 minutes stuffing all her candy bars, pastries and chips in her mouth as fast as possible to try to sedate her destructive belly. She forgot how hungry working out made her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a smile crept up on her face as her stomach (briefly) was content, \"I know what I'll do\" she said to no one in particular, \"I'll base all 10 people working under me performance review on how much food they can get me in a days time, that way I'll get the protein I need and satisfy this monster belly of mine\" that she grabbed and shook for emphasis. Perfect she thought as rushed out the gym and headed to the conference room only 30 minutes late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm brilliant she thought to herself as she squeezed her wide hips in the elevator and headed up to the conference room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she went to the conference room she was feeling woozy from the hunger pains and spotted donuts and cinnamon rolls on the snack table completely untouched. Aw, they know me to well Vanessa thought to herself as she sat her fat near 700 pound ass in the reinforced chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOEY, DONUTS, MY CHAIR NOW\" she screamed at poor unsuspecting JOEY as he got up and rushed to satisfy his boss and lover, she then shouted at Raj who always liked her because she was the only person of Indian heritage in the office besides her, \"RAJ, GRAB THOSE CINNOMON ROLLS NOW!\" and with that Raj ran over to satisfy his boss and \"friend\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone,\" she stated with authority while switching from eating donuts and cinnamon rolls, it's employee review time and I decided to be a bit unorthodox with my review system. She got up from her chair and swirled around for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see this body, this beautiful thicker than a milkshake body of mine\" Vanessa said as everyone nodded, \"Well this body takes a lot of work to maintain, and part of that maintenance requires substantial amounts of food, that's where you guys and gals come in, if you can keep me full which is almost impossible then that must mean you're hard working and pay attention to detail, that is why for your performance review I'm going to base it on who brings me the most food while keeping up with their own previously assigned work, don't worry nothing new will be assigned today I just expect ya'll to meet deadlines and bring me food\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the ladies raised her hand to ask a question but Vanessa shot her down immediately, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look its not hard, bring me food, I eat the food, you do your work and I evaluate you, if you don't get it you're fired, is everyone clear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of 10 people working under Vanessa looked at each other and then shook their heads, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'm glad everyone understands\" She said before one of the new people came up to her to give her their lunch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go maim, I'm starting with my lunch, I'll get you more asap and keep doing my work\" and the anonymous new office bitch rushed to his cubicle to get work done and order more food. Everyone else followed his example and gave her their lunches and rushed off to their desks to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a great idea she thought to herself as she smiled, walked to her office and began digging in. </span></div></div>",

I'll go to HR and we'll see what they have to say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was saying that Noel one of the contract workers trying to get a full-time job at Gorge Inc burst through the door in a hurry a long with 2 of the other contractors who were trying to get full time positions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Raj said \"\u0907\u0938 \u0915\u0941\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e , \u0939\u092e \u0905\u092d\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \"\u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947\" \u0915\u0932 \u0930\u093e\u0924 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u092a\u0930 ?\" (this bitch, we still on for \"dinner\" tomorrow night? in hindi)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, now off you go, I don't want to have to give you a bad review\" Vanessa said with a wink as Raj walked out her office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 by 1 the rest of the crew walked out until it was just kyle and chloe left who had a dumbstruck look on her face. As Kyle turned to leave he said to Chloe,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just mad that that fat bitch as you called her looks better at 580 then you'll ever look at any weight, now get going, I wouldn't want your chubby bitch ass to get fired, especially after buying that new house you've been talking about\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe gasped and hung her head low as she was forced to admit defeat, Vanessa had a smug look on her face as she shoo'd Chloe out of the office and sat at her desk waiting for her treats to arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day boxes were packed to the ceiling filled with goodies, everyone not only brought her food but went beyond and above her expectations, there was literally no room to move about with all the boxes in her office, and that's including the food she ate as she waited for the end of the work day. As she told everyone good job and that they could leave she motioned to Chloe to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, I noticed that you brought me the least food, and after that outburst I can't say I'll give a good recommendation, in fact you may have to be fired sweetie and we don't want that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe had a mortgage to pay and school loans and began silently freaking out, \"No miss Singh, please I'll do anything, I'm so sorry about my outburst, I just had a bad morning, I'm so sor---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa cut her off, \"You can do one thing, you see these boxes, you're going to feed them to me until I say stop and trust me I won't say stop, afterwords you're going to rub my big brown swollen belly until I'm satisfied and THEN you MIGHT have the opportunity to keep your job\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe looked disgusted, \"But it's cl---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO BUTTS, if there isn't food in my mouth in 30 seconds you're gone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Chloe rushed to grab the nearest box which happened to contain somosas. After 30 minutes the 1st of Vanessa's blouses began to pop off, after an hour she moaning in ecstasy as chloe kept feeding her more of the various goodies she was brought for the \"evaluation\", by 1.5 hours all her blouse buttons had popped off and she was in her bra with her skirt unzipped letting her massive caramel belly hang out pleasuring herself as Chloe STILL brought more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chloe brought a kolache to Vanessa's mouth she looked at her boss in disbelief rubbing her eyes to see if she was really pleasuring herself as she had to sweat her ass off bringing her food, \"Boss, can you... not do that please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool, this fat bitch is eating, and if you interrupt me again you WILL BE FIRED, understood\" she replied as she stuffed a whole Kolache in her mouth and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe rushed back to the diminishing boxes, after an hour and a half she'd only gotten through half of them and to her own disbelief Vanessa was still chowing down non-stop like she was suffering from starvation. She'd eaten enough food to feed the office and she was still eating more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the ordeal was over 3.5 hours later Vanessa's belly had overtaken her whole desk and then some. Chloe looking disheveled, sweaty and tired finally shoved the last donut in her managers mouth and asked \"Can I please go home, haven't you tortured me enough\" with a little tear running down her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa had not intended on eating ALL the food they brought her in one day, but she wanted to punish the insubordination . She was stuffed beyond capacity, even she had never glutted like this before and felt incredibly nauseous. \"Don't cry sweetie, you did an amazing job filling this fat ass\" laughing as she gently tapped her belly, \"but before you go I need to this lil ol belly of mine to be rubbed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe looked at Vanessa with hate in her eyes but sighed and started rubbing her massive belly. To Vanessa's surprise it felt absolutely orgasmic, this was the best belly rub she'd ever received. After only 10 minutes she moaned in satisfaction her pussy dripping wet as Chloe stopped. \"Ummm, boss does that mean I can go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, chloe, that was the best belly rub I've ever received, take all the empty boxes out of my office to the dumpster and you can go.\" with that Chloe collected the boxes and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chloe left, Vanessa messaged Jeff,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV - Hey, I may have overdone the \"protein', we HAVE to work out tomorrow okay, be at work at 7:30AM on the dot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ - Yes Maim, I'll be there and ready to \"work out\" <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/inlove.png\" alt=\"*InLove*\" title=\"InLove\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nV- good, after today we may need to modify the work out plan from 3-5 days a week, I REALLY OVERDID it today, you'll see soon <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/devilish.png\" alt=\"*Devilish*\" title=\"Devilish\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Vanessa began to snooze off at her desk grateful she had an extra pair of larger work and workout clothes in the office she could change into when she work.</span></div></div>",

While not the brightest bulb he quickly came to the conclusion that Vanessa must be in her office. He took the elevator up with a box of donuts in hand and saw a massive blob of a woman passed out at Vannesa's desk snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was amazed, he rubbed his eyes, pinched himself, and did a double take but in Vanessas office was a woman who looked like Vanessa but even bigger, and considering she's already a massive woman blew his mind. The young boss was sitting at her desk which was completely engulfed by her stretch marked laden belly snoring loudly. He's seen and came to fall in love with Vanessa's curves and the binges that came along with being so bodacious. But this was truly incredible. Her hips overcame her tight panties and tore through the struggling skirt while she was sleeping and her breast burst though her bra like a water finding a hole in a damn. While looking at her with his box of donuts he swore he could see her body visibly grow as she digested her massive meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 minutes of listening to the growing beauty digest and snore. He finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still sound asleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VANESSA! WAKE UP\" he shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shouting startled the massive Indian and she leaned back in her chair, the additional weight actually caused her to crush the double enforced chair under her massive growing backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK, that FUCKIN HURT, god dammit you stupid fuck\" Vanessa shouted in pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff immediately rushed over to his giant lover and offered a hand, \"im so sorry love, you are never late to workouts so I came to check on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrritated, Vanessa replied, \"you have a wife, don't call me love and are those donuts?\" She looked and saw the box, then she noticed Jeffs throbbing manhood underneath his basketball shorts. She quickly changed her attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, place the box in front of me, then since my panties and skirt are already ripped put that big dick of yours to use, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff didn't need to be told twice as he placed the donuts in front of his engorged boss, literally ripped her clothes off and went at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa could barely reach pass her engorged breast to reach he donut box in front of her. Her belly was so full that she was literally lying on all fours and couldn't completely reach the ground. She of course could still reach the catering sized 50 box of donuts and stuff herself as Jeff hit her from the back doggy style. She wasn't even hungry but she's gotten so used to stuffed n fucks it just felt right to eat while having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even need Jeff to turn her on, her ass was literally too big for her extra wide double enforced chair. Which in her mind meant she had the ultimate ghetto booty, her tits had outgrown her bra she'd gotten a week before in record time, on top of that she got the only person to ever stand up to her in the office to stuff her silly and then rub her belly until she came, life was good for Vanessa. I can get into this whole life on top of the world thing she thought as she finally finished her donuts while getting pounded by Jeff's large manhood. She could feel him thrusting, sinking into her fat which got her even wetter knowing her curves were engulfing the large <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there naked, both of them out of breath, she asked Jeff to help her up, and after 5 minutes of struggling she got up and used her private corporate bathroom that had been customized for her voluptuousness, shortly after she asked Jeff to grab her sized up  workout gear knowing she 100% couldn't fit into her emergency work clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her massive belly still digesting last nights feast she then with Jeff's help started trying to put on her xxxxxxl yoga pants, to her and Jeff's surprise no matter how much her and Jeff tugged, no matter how much she sucked in or moved fat around they could NOT get the yoga pants more than half way up her ass. Half of her ass was literally hanging out and the rest of the pants looked like they would have been a tight fit 50 pounds ago. Same luck with the way too tight sports bra that her breast were desperately trying to find freedom from. Vanessa was large and in charge. She took the tightness of her \"fat clothes\" as a sign that she truly was developing the body of a goddess <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the workout big boy\" she said to Jeff as she led him out of her office  and smacked his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around as he exited the door to say something but Vanessa slammed the door before anything could be said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood lord she thought, i need new clothes asap, then suddenly her phone rang.</span></div></div>",

Cathy tried to speak with Vanessa only to be immediately cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you called, I need you to cancel all my appointments for the day, I need a personal day\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, I can't exactly do that, Mr. Johnson is expecting you in his office in 15 minutes\" Cathy said calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, well can you tell him to come to my office?\" Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me check\", Cathy put her on hold and about a minute later she got back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, he wants you in his office\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck Vanessa thought to herself, she had no proper work clothes and exercise gear that could barely contain her mass if you call having half of your ass and titties out containing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed, \"Alright, let him know I'll be right there, you wouldn't happen to have my bed sheets I told you to wash would ya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Miss Singh, they'll be ready for pick up in an hour, may I ask why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit, I could have at least used the bed sheet to cover up, \"no reason, I must get ready now, remember cancel all other meeting okay Cathy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Maim, will do buh bye\" and with that she hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho am I kidding thought Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Vanessa Singh, the sexiest woman in the office, who cares if my voluptuous body is out for all to see.\" She said aloud pumping herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new found sense of pride and excitement Vanessa began the journey to Mr. Joe Johnsons office on the other side of the building. She knew she would cross paths with her coworkers and underlings before making it his office and was excited to see there reactions.</span></div></div>",

She has nothing to hide she thought to herself. 1st off she had to get past a narrow hallway where Lucille with her incredibly wide hips was taking 3/4 of the hallway herself. Lucille was talking with Alice when she felt herself getting squeezed into the wall by a soft mountain of flesh. She turned around when Alice gave her the que with her wide terrified eyes and noticed Ms. Singh cramming her massive half naked body into the hallway. As Alice backed away to give the 2 massive ladies space Lucille squeezed herself as small as she could get to give the even bigger woman as much space as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her muffin and Starbucks  in the air as she turned around to attempt to let Vanessa through only to have both of them swiped by the large and in charge Indian woman. \"Thanks sweetie, I need this for the meeting, love ya Lucille, let's get lunch!\" She shouted as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille just looked in awe at the massive mesmerizing hips swaying in rhythm as half of one incredible ass hung out some clearly too small workout shorts.

Vanessa felt the fat on fat action and didn't even see who she ran over like a running back trying to score a touchdown but she did see the 2 dozen muffins in 2 boxes on the ground in front of her and bent over to pick them up giving Jenna a full few of her big meaty ass. God damn was all Jenna could think, I'm not into girls but wow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa got the 2 boxes and walked away with a quick apology as she stuffed whole muffins into her mouth so she could finish the 2 dozen muffins before she got to her bosses office. She wasn't even hungry, in fact she was stuffed but her greedy mindset plus her want to test out her gag reflex drove her to finish the muffins before she got to Mr. Johnson's office. She checked her watch, 9:14 and all the muffins were gone, record time for her and she made it on time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dusted off the crumbs off her corpulent cleavage and opened the door.

Using her curves to get what she needed was a forte of Vanessa's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vanessa\" said Kyle, eyes bulging at the sight of all that boobage. Not to mention one of her nipples already poking out of the ripped top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be coming in today, I'm feeling a bit...\" sighed Vanessa through a mouthful of cake, as she took a long swing from her carton of milk, which trickled down her double-chin and onto her wobbling cleavage. \"...under the weather\" she pouted, running a hand across her giant breasts tantalizingly, which made Kyle gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I could totally fill in for you Vanessa. Just tell me what to do, and I'll take care of your workload no problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled.

She ordered out for her proper meals--pizza, Chinese, pastries and sweets--which were strung together throughout the day by non-stop eating. Some of her boys swung by to leave her gifts of food, which she wholeheartedly accepted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, her belly was massively bloated, heaving up her giant tits and spilling all over her massive thighs happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh I could get used to working at home\" she smiled contentedly, rubbing that fat gut as she reached for another pastry. \"Maybe I should talk to the boss about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The entire time, her faithful servants would be doing her work for her, while the growing girl lazed about as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd grow she did, because 2 months later, Vanessa was tipping the scales at over 390 lbs. All that \"working from home\" had done her good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Life is good' thought Vanessa to herself as she woke up that morning.

All 390 pounds of her spilling out of her rapidly failing outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn, just look at me' she said, turning around and viewing her own ridiculous profile, giant breasts and ass sticking out so far in front and behind her.

It was an old tank top, which she had ripped down the front just to accomodate her giant breasts, and she stretched it with difficulty over her immense bosom. Little else was left to cover her fully-exposed belly, and, being bra-less, her areolas were showing and her nipples taunt against the stretched-out fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore off the already-torn skirt, tossing that on top of her ruined bra.

Jenna had found her scarfing down her second box of dozen, clad ironically in gym clothes, before she took Vanessa back to her place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was the last time you actually got to use those clothes?\" asked Jenna, biting her lip, as the zipper of Vanessa's outgrown tank top creaked open to its fullest extent, forced by the Q-cup girl's monstrous breasts as she reached forward for more fried noodles. Those giant boobs smashed heavily onto the table, knocking aside a few empty takeout boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa straightened back up in her groaning seats (Jenna had gotten her an extra chair so she could spread out her monstrous ass more comfortably), her tank top riding up and showing her fat, well-fed gut as it bulged onto her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" Vanessa thought, stuffing an eggroll into her mouth with her bare hands as she tried to think when she last worked out with Jenna. \"...probably three weeks ago?

Jenna was out bikini shopping with Vanessa, since none of Vanessa's old swimwear was even close to fitting anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" said Vanessa, emerging form the fitting room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a whopping 450 pounds, Vanessa was all but bursting out of the tiny two piece bikini she had picked out. The bikini bottom was invisible, hidden under her giant gut and love-handles, and digging into her vast hips. It was like floss between her enormous, fat ass-cheeks. The bikini top was just as bad, barely holding on as her monstrous breasts bulged out the front, sides, and even bottom of the creaking cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to need a bigger size dear\" said Jenna, eyes bulging at all the flesh that was showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This IS the biggest size\" said Vanessa, waddling over to Jenna so that her tits bulged immensely before her smaller BBW friend. \"This bikini top has J-cups!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what size are your boobs, currently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr...W-cups\" admitted Vanessa with a grin, looking down at her giant tits exploding out of the bikini top.

Your boobs are THIRTEEN cup sizes too big for that bikini top\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the inevitable happened--the bikini top exploded off, and Vanessa's earthshaking tits tumbled out, slapping heavily against her fat gut. She tried to collect them in her fat arms, though pressing them together like that meant her cleavage was nearly pushing against her own double-chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should try another store some other time\" suggested Vanessa heaving those gargantuan breasts in her arms. \"It's almost lunch time anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was doing so well at work thanks to her boys, that she was getting frequent raises that helped fund her constant need to *ehem* \"upgrade\" her wardrobe every few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jenna wasn't wrong either, and as the months rolled by and Vanessa grew fatter and fatter, pretty soon even the proud SSBBW was having trouble containing her curvage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I just got this top a month ago\" moaned Vanessa, as yet another button flew off her blouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at a whopping 580 pounds, she was ENORMOUS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna looked across the table at her gigantic buddy, who was working her way through a sixth giant burger. And it was just Vanessa's pre-lunch snack! The girl's month-old blouse barely contained her gigantic belly, and of course those gargantuan breasts of hers, which were held up by a massive custom-made push-up bra that brought Vanessa's overwhelming cleavage up to her fat double-chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How time flies. Just months ago you were a tiny 200 pound girl worrying about her weight, and now look at you! You're over 200 pounds heavier than I am!\" said Jenna, patting her friend's exposed belly, the waves of jiggling rippling up to her immense breasts. \"Don't you have an important meeting today? And you're going...dressed like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked down at her enormous, overflowing figure. Belly bulging, tits nearly tumbling out...they didn't even see her ass yet, which was barely contained by a torn, too-small skirt. 580 pounds of woman was a lot to hold in, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I don't think they'll mind seeing a bit of skin\" grinned Vanessa mischievously, just as another button popped off her blouse. Her groaning bra was fully visible now, and one could see a hint of nipple peeking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more than a bit, Nessa\" gulped her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll just have one last burger, than I'm done for pre-lunch\" she conceded, raising an enormous, wobbling arm and calling for a waiter. \"Another mega-burger please! And, alright...maybe just three more to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Jenna as she tried to tug her failing blouse over her mammoth mammaries. \"What? I might get hungry on the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These were all from her co-workers, and not just her loyal male slaves either. The girls whose mission it was to fatten her up further contributed as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cara's always so generous\" said Vanessa happily, digging into a giant family-sized box of lasagna from one of those girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa didn't even make it to the table. Such was her gluttony that she just stood by the counter, eating out of all the food items simultaneously. Some of theirs weren't even hers, but she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" she gasped through a mouthful of doughnuts, when she realized this particular box of dozen didn't have her name on it. She licked her fingers and looked over the vastness of her monstrous breasts, and saw that only one doughnut was left. She grinned mischievously. \"Well, it's only one left anywayyyy...\" she reasoned, leaning forward to grab the doughnut, which made yet another button fly off her blouse as her giant tits poured out even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa just ate and ate and ate, until several minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a sweetie and run down to the nearest clothing store and buy me the biggest top you can find. Bring it to me in the break room. Will pay you back\" read Kyle off his phone. He shrugged and was off to do his lady a favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at the break room, he found a very full Vanessa sitting on the floor with her back against the wall. All the buttons of her top had burst off, and her groaning bra was fully exposed along with her huge belly. Her nipples were showing, and the bra looked ready to give way too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Vanessa! Did you eat...everything?\" went Kyle, eyes wide as he sat down next to the enormous girl. 580 pounds of woman filled his vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda\" grinned Vanessa, peeling off her pathetic blouse and grabbing the top Kyle had bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgghhhh...what the hell Kyle, I said get the...urgghhh...largest one!\" she groaned, barely able to stretch the thing over her giant breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That WAS the largest one! Nessa, that's a 4XL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neckline tore down the front in order to accommodate the enormity of Vanessa's bosom. Her cleavage was heaving out the front, but at least her nipples were hidden. She stretched the rest of the fabric over her belly, though it hardly had any left. Half of her fat gut was showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll have to do\" she shrugged, putting her blouse back on as a sort of cardigan. She stood up ahead of Kyle, who was still seated as Vanessa's giant belly and humongous boobs loomed over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're still up for dinner later, right hun?\" she winked down at him, though he could barely see her face past all the blockades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've been working your ass off these past few months\" said one of her co-workers with a false tone of praise, as she watched the gargantuan, 580-pound behemoth waddle over to the counter, giant ass wobbling and bursting out of her tiny skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food had been set up by the office bitches who were purposely fattening Vanessa up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I couldn't have done it without you guys\" said Vanessa through a mouthful of pizza, spinning around to face the girls and making her monstrous boobs shake and jostle heavily, testing her undersized 4XL top. The girls heard the rip widen, thanks to all the bouncing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What a cow' thought one girl, as she watched those udders undulate several seconds more even after Vanessa stopped moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls left Vanessa to her feast, and she spent the rest of her work day shoveling all that food down her greedy throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was time for her date with Kyle, she was even heavier and more bloated than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already had a bit to eat, Nessa?\" inquired Kyle nervously, as his poor car leaned to the passenger's side as Vanessa struggled to squeeze herself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little...urgghhhh...pick-me-up\" she groaned, and the frame of the car did too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car was still titled heavily to her side when she finally closed the door. Her enormity was bulging over the center console, and pressing against Kyle in the driver's seat. Her tits were pressing against the windshield, and impeding Kyle's view of the side=mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...maybe something light tonight?\" asked Kyle, who knew that every date with Vanessa put a considerable dent in his wallet. She was a natural food-disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably just one eat-all-you-can buffet tonight, sweetie\" she smiled, bulging cleavage pressing into her own fat double-chin as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't so bad, there were times when Vanessa cleaned out up to three buffets in a single night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that my tire?\" went Kyle as his entire car buckled, the frame settling onto the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOOM!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other tire on Vanessa's side gave way, with Kyle's side raised disproportionately above with both tires still intact. They looked like they were on a see-saw; one skinny guy raised off the ground by one enormous fat girl sinking into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa stuck her head outside, a good portion of her gigantic breasts pouring out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it couldn't take my voluptuousness?\" she smiled as she turned back to Kyle, who noticed one of her nipples was peeking out of her top again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So good, in fact, that she had moved up to training and managing to leverage her talents by training more just like her. Courtney had always been a people person and a leader.

She'd always wanted the perfect man and every one that came along eventually showed a flaw or two.  She'd planned to marry her high school sweetheart when he returned from the Marines but his chosen career as a plumber wasn't glamerous enough and then he started getting fat.  She turned to her coworkers but one by one she discovered that they were selfish, lazy, demanding.  Now she was accepting life as a single lady, playing the field but not expecting to find the man of her dreams anymore.<br>\r\nNow as she approached 30, she was enjoying her role as the mature woman to her twenty-something underlings- an older sister to the girls and the unattainable (well maybe not) older woman to the guys.

She noticed that Bud was just a bit over six feet and that he had a firm handshake - and beautiful grey eyes.  Their hands lingered together a bit before Bud nevously pulled away and rushed back to his cubicle.<br>\r\nThe next morning when Courtney reached her office she noticed that Bud was already at work.<br>\r\n\"Good morning.

Instead she continued to eat demolish the box of twinkies. Alice bent over and picked up the lost button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go.\u201d When Alice found the button Jessica had finished the large box of twinkies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uh thanks.\u201d Jess patted her big belly. \u201cBoy that *burp* hit the spot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell was nice to meet you Jess.

She had also been shopping for some suitable gym clothes, and had chosen a loose fitting tank top and shorts that she hoped wouldn't draw too much attention to her larger frame - while she didn't consider herself 'fat', she knew she had been putting on the pounds quickly, and would be chubby if she continued growing at this rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely knew what to do with herself in the gym, the whole experience was alien to her, but after awkwardly looking around at the equipment, she finally got on a treadmill and started jogging. As soon as she got going, she felt like her body was going everywhere; her heavy breasts jiggled up and down, despite being crammed into a sturdy sports bra, and her soft bulge of a belly shook from side to side uncomfortably, while her hips and ass swayed. She felt awkward and exposed, but knew she had to keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Aubrey stepped off the treadmill in a sweat and tried out the rowing machine, exercise bike and a few of the weight machines, hoping she could regain her toned figure with a few sessions like these.

She walked into her bedroom and looked at her reflection in the mirror; her extra poundage was a lot more obvious when she wasn't wearing clothes, her belly bulging out, her breasts struggling against her bra and her curvy hips looked huge. Aubrey had always taken pride in her curvaceous figure, but now she was definitely on the verge of being chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unclasped her bra and breathed a sigh of relief as her breasts bulged free. She reached under her growing boobs and lifted them up to feel their weight, they were getting absolutely huge...although she had to admit, she didn't mind this part of her weight gain, her breasts looked pretty awesome at this size. The other girls in the office were pretty busty, but despite weighing more than her, their breasts weren't as impressive and shapely as hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey headed to bed, collapsing under the sheets in just her panties, hoping she had lost a few pounds today. </span></div></div>",

She started skipping breakfast and getting a salad at lunch.  She ate what she wanted for dinner because she was starving at the end of the day.

The trouble was that although she viewed these things as the core of her dietary routine, the reality escaped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't eat breakfast at home, but the donuts that were readily available at work didn't count; they were just little snacks to get her through to lunch.  She was steadily increasing these \"snacks\" and was up to an average of about five per morning now.  At lunch, she ate a salad, but followed this with an afternoon of snacking on cake, cookies, brownies, whatever was around, nonstop for the duration if the workday.  Her dinners were huge, as she rewarded herself for sticking to her plan, and she never hesitated to eat seconds or thirds followed by as much dessert as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot surprisingly, she piled on pounds with increasing speed.  She got bigger all over, but her breasts were rapidly becoming massive.  She had promised herself not to be weight obsessed or self-defeating, so she skipped the scale in favor of a system in which she rewarded herself for meeting her goals each day.  She felt good about herself, even as her body became ever more corpulent.  She figured she was still young and just hadn't stopped maturing yet, and that was why her boobs were filling up to gigantic proportions.

The reality was that she would have loved to just openly tell people how she loved her gigantic belly, and that 400 pounds was just the beginning for this girl.  With the increasing amounts of food being provided by the new fat female boss who had taken over the division, and the replacement of the male staff with big girls like her, she felt more and more at home, and wanted to remain stuffed all of the time, getting as fat as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't understand Aubrey.  The girl was in denial over who she was.  She was starting behind the 8-ball, being relatively short and curvy, but she had no willpower to boot.  It would have been a miracle for her not to become a fat hog, even without a constant supply of food around.  That said, Aubrey didn't get it.  She patted herself on the back constantly for \"sticking to her diet\", even though Jessica watched her \"snack\" on thousands of calories a day.  It was like she was mesmerized by her own gigantic breasts, Jessica thought, because it was all she talked about and all she dressed to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boobs are so big...I need a new bra...I need a bigger blouse...My boobs, my boobs, my boobs...\"  Jessica could hear Aubrey saying.  How fat would she have to get before she saw what she was becoming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wanted to find out, and she didn't want to wait.  She took it upon herself to make sure that Aubrey never lacked for food.  She complimented her on her \"obvious\" weight loss.  She encouraged Aubrey to treat herself as a reward for her progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica practically force fed her from the time she arrived at work until the end of the day.  She got her to go out for huge lunches and skip the salads.  Aubrey remained oblivious, downing a dozen donuts a day, plowing through seconds and thirds at \"reward\" lunches, stuffing herself with sweets of all manner until the work day ended, drinking pitchers of alcohol and mountains of fried food at happy hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica watched Aubrey's growth take off.  She was literally gaining pounds per day.  Her expanding ass actually ripped a pair of pants one day, but as big as she got elsewhere, her breasts greedily siphoned off a noticeable surplus of calories, getting bigger and rounder by the day.

Physically, she was mesmerized by the explosive growth of her breasts.  It was like they were taking on a life of their own.  They were bigger than her head, for God's sake!  She continued to flaunt that with stretchy tops that clung to these LL cup behemoths.  She realized that she was softening elsewhere, but she chalked it up to balance, and was thrown off by the disproportionate distribution of her weight to her bustline.  She didn't believe in scales, but she was well over 200 pounds now.  Her belly was round and pudgy, and she frequently displayed a sizeable muffin top over pants that were invariably too tight.  She had grown fond of yoga pants because they had an elastic waistband and stretched around her thick, growing legs and butt, so she frequently wore them to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Victoria asked if she could speak with Aubrey in private.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aubrey, I'll get right to the point.\"  Victoria said.  \"I need you to go home and get some different pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"  Aubrey asked.  \"I've worn these to work plenty of times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it might be time for a new pair.\"  Victoria explained.  \"It's easy to put weight on in this office, and you've stretched those pants so thin that you're not leaving anything to the imagination at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't put on any weight.\"  Aubrey explained.  \"At least, not much down there.  My boobs are still growing, but as big as they are, they won't stretch my pants out.  Besides, I keep to a strict diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aubrey.\"  Victoria said.  \"You're developing into a stunning woman, and your work is impeccable.  You know that the philosophy around here is that a happy employee is a more productive one, and you stay happy by eating.  I think that you might eat more than anyone else here.  I think it's great, but this lifestyle has side effects.

And Jess had gotten a pay raise for diligent work prior to this, and as such, she had gotten more than enough money to pay for the massive gluttonous amounts of food each and every day that had been accounting for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n All of this snacking, about 20 bags per day, including her fattening, massive dinners, each day she consumed about 10,000 calories. Starting at about 415 pounds by the previous month, the month of absolute, complete gluttony had amounted to a gain of 250 pounds: The whale had reached 665 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her complete and utter gluttony had showed: The redhead's waistline had sustained a good portion of the damage: Her stomach was a mountain of fat that, even when far back by normal standards, would smother the desk. Her breasts were dangling like long sausages, but still barely ahead of Aubrey's mounds. She had ditched dress pants and she had completely given up on button-ups: She had taken absolutely to massive Muumuu sweaters, and she could barely even move. She had completely given up on movement at work: She had the good secretary Aubrey fetch her food. And miss aubrey did a good job at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Aubrey could only chuckle at her good work. She had shown that damn whale what for, and a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she didn't notice that Jessica had an impact on her weight too. Her snacking rate had increased and she had piled on a good 50 in the past month. She hadn't ballooned up quite at the rate of Jessica, though. And if her plan kept through, she would have eaten herself to the point where she'd need a mobility scooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooh, a mobility scooter</i>, thought Aubrey. <i>That'd be so delightful to see that wide loaded pallet ass having to drive her lardy pile of fat self around here like a cripple</i>, thought the spiteful, 200+ pound secretary. Her rage at the fat woman had turned her to thoughts of imagining the whale dying of a heart attack, being delighted by these malicious thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon closing time rolled around, and Jessica started trying to get up...</span></div></div>",

It was another of her 'rewards' after eating a salad at lunch today and starving herself all afternoon. She had managed to resist the urge to eat her usual afternoon snack of doughnuts as part of her diet, but her stomach had been grumbling for hours, and as soon as she got home, she had ordered the biggest, greasiest Pizza she could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey lay sprawled out on the couch, still dressed in her work clothes. She had been in such a hurry to order food that she hadn't bothered changing out of her white shirt and black skirt and into something more casual. As a result of her gorging, her clothes, which had started growing increasingly tight over the past few weeks, were now being pushed to their limits. She did a lot of snacking during office hours, but she rarely ate a huge meal like this. As she lay on her back, too stuffed to move, she could see her belly rising like a mountain just past her breasts, which usually obscured her view of her growing pot belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...maybe I should have just gone for the doughnuts after all...I look huge...\" Aubrey groaned, rubbing a hand over her dome of a belly and groaning as she felt it's taught surface. \"Good thing I'm on a diet, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey switched on the TV and lay there massaging her belly for the next half hour, until she finally found the strength to move. With a tired grunt, she swung her legs off the side of the couch and sat up. That movement was all it caused to blow apart the buttons of her tight shirt - they pinged off one by one before Aubrey realized what was happening, flying into the air like missiles as her bloated stomach burst free and her huge boobs bulged forward, almost popping out of her overstuffed bra. Aubrey could only stare in shock at what had just happened. Had she really been <i>that </i>full?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed by her own sudden exposure, she struggled to her feet, only to hear a loud tearing from beneath her bulging stomach. She felt the sides of her skirt splitting, and felt her belly push out a little more as it started to split apart at the seams. \"Oh no no no...this is not happening!\" Aubrey cried out, unable to believe just how severe her wardrobe malfunction was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to walk towards her bedroom, but that only sped up the tearing of her skirt, which had now torn open across the backside, exposing a large part of her growing butt. Aubrey groaned as she hurried inside her room and stared at her reflection in the mirror. She gasped as she saw how huge and bloated her stomach had become. Her tits looked absolutely enormous, and for the first time she noticed how tiny her bra looked. Her nipples was almost visible above the lacey cups! She turned to the side and stuck her belly out, rubbing her hand over the bulge to make sure it was real. She glanced down and saw that her skirt had split along her larger thighs and torn open at the back, so she quickly pulled it down and threw it aside. She certainly wouldn't be wearing it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStood in her underwear, still wearing her ruined shirt, she turned back to the mirror and faced her body once again. The diet hadn't worked. She hadn't lost any weight at all. She was bigger than ever. How had she not noticed what was happening to her body?! </span></div></div>",

She got her things ready and put on some track pants and v-neck t-shirt. Aubrey then took out her phone and used her plump fingers to search through her contacts until she found Jess' number.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" The blimpy brunnete answered.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jess, it's Aubrey! I was wondering if you were free today? I thought I'd try to get some excersise at the gym everyone's been talking about...also thought you could tag along and make sure I don't screw up my diet!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure. I'll come with you, I didn't really have anything planned.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. See you around Noon?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, see you then. Bye!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women hung up their phones and met up later at Fit Life.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey waddled her way inside with Jess following behind her. As they entered, both of them were quite impressed. Their fellow coworkers weren't lying about how fancy and organized things were here.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Brey, I'll just be over her at the food court while you excercise. Then later you can come and grab a bite with me!\" Jessica smiled at her newfound friend and toddered off to the food court to find a seat.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jess\" Aubrey giggled then made her way over to the exercise area and sat on one of the mats, preparing to do some push ups. She laid on her doughy stomach and placing her hands to either side, her feet spread behind her, and pushed herself up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is a little *pant* harder than I remember...</i> she thought as she continued doing pushups, struggling only slightly. Soon though, after completing about twelve pushups, she gave up. Aubrey flopped over onto her chubby back and panting and sweating, her hand holding her fat tummy as it rose and fell with her heavy breathing.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment or two to catch her breath, she get up with somewhat of a grunt and shuffled over to the food court, taking a seat beside Jessica. Meanwhile, Jess had been sampling a smoothie or two as Aubrey had attempted exercise.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how *sip* was it?\" Jessica asked as she sucked down her second smoothie.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it went well\" Aubrey said with a bit of a smile. Oooh hey, do you think I could have a smoothie?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looked thoughtful a moment as she slurped up the remains of her own fruity beverage then nodded emphatically.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! They're healthy cause they have fruit and milk in them. Help yourself.\" She browsed the menu then her eyes fell onto the protein shakes.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Aubrey, you might wanna try a shake too. At least once a day.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok cool. Thanks Jess.\" Aubrey ordered a lemon-lime smoothie and started slurping it up eagerly. She rubbed her doughy middle as she drank the creamy, smooth beverage.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...this is really good! And um Jess?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Her hefty diet coach looked over as she ordered herself some nachos.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about the shakes? They don't seem all that healthy...?\" Aubrey said doubtfully.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. When I was in college I was a culinary major, so I think I know these things. Besides, these shakes contain protein which will help you build muscle!\" she replied, giggling as she flexed a flabby arm.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well, if you say so Jess.\" Aubrey smiled and ordered a shake as soon as she finished her smoothie.\u00a0</span></div></div>",

This stuff doesn\u2019t seem healthy.\u201d Aubrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but you just worked out, so you\u2019re going to want to eat a lot to give your body energy.

Pounds kept adding on to Aubrey\u2019s chubby frame. She never knew dieting was so easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was amazing was that as bad as Jessica\u2019s coaching was to begin with, Aubrey still managed to cheat on her diet occasionally. Sneaking extra snacks without talking to Jess. Aubrey just lacked the proper discipline. Her workouts involved more sitting around trying to catch her breath than actual exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard though for her to ignore her continuing weight gain. She was now over 200 pounds.

Despite her best efforts, and Jess's advice, she hadn't lost a single pound. In fact, her weight had sky rocketed since she started taking her friends advice. Aubrey groaned as she walked to her bedroom, her thighs rubbing together as she walked, her breasts jiggling with each step, and her pants chafing around her widening rear. The chubby red head sat down on the edge of her bed and stared at her reflection in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...how did I get so big...\" Aubrey groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a T-shirt and jeans that barely fit her anymore. Her belly bulged out from the bottom of the shirt, which covered only as far as her belly button, and left her spare tire of a gut on display. Her pants had been impossible to button up, so she had left them hanging open to give her some room to breathe. She hadn't considered that she might need new clothes when she started packing on weight, she had just assumed that she would have lost it all by now, but things hadn't turned out quite the way she had planned, and now she was stuck with a wardrobe full of tight, constricting clothes that left very little of her growing body to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bra was the worst. Her breasts seemed to get bigger each day, and while Aubrey rather enjoyed her ever expanding boobs, it was getting a little hard to manage them. She slowly pulled her shirt off and tossed it aside. Her black, lace bra was overfilled and straining at the seams. Her nipples were almost overflowing the cups, and breast flesh oozed in every direction. With a resigned sigh, she unclasped the bra and allowed her massive jugs to jiggle free. She grabbed them, one in each hand, and marveled at their size. They were enormous, perfectly round, perfectly firm, perfectly <i>huge</i>. Maybe the extra poundage wasn't so bad if she got to keep these babies...any guy would go crazy for them, and probably not even notice her little pot belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes dropped to her belly then, and she realized that was probably a little hopeful. Her stomach was almost the same size as her breasts now, a big, round fleshy ball that formed a trio of spheres alongside her big breasts. She wondered just how she was going to lose this extra weight now; all her efforts so far had failed, and it seemed she was doomed to end up as fat as those chubby girls at work. She was probably going to have trouble with her work clothes in the morning too...</span></div></div>",

Her button up shirt was barely containing her titanic tits to begin with but now with a full belly pushing the limits of every button, Aubrey was dangerously close to popping completely out of her top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she overeat again? She had told herself she was going to take control of her eating. If she wasn\u2019t going to diet properly at least she could limit her portions. But yet here she was with her chubby belly packed and bloated. Aubrey had to admit it as a great meal. But how could she be so short sighted? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m careful these buttons might just stay.\u201d Aubrey said to herself. She leaned back slowly in her chair. Small tears and groans could be heard as her flabby body strained her clothes. \u201cOh god\u2026 Maybe if I undid one button it would ease the pressure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey slowly unbuttoned the top button that was hiding her enormous cleavage. Immediately her breasts dropped into a more comfortable position. Her shirt turned into a wide V of exposed flabby chest. Aubrey breathed a sigh of relief. But there was still a creaking and groaning coming from her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d She grunted looking down. POP\u2026 POP\u2026 POP. POP POP POP! In a chain reaction every button popped going down her shirt. Her heaving boob jiggled and extended forward. Then her belly began to pop every button as it pushed forward in it\u2019s stuffed glory. Aubrey muffled her shriek. She was sweating from embarrassment. She quickly dashed out to her car and threw on an oversized sweater.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll hopefully be back in tomorrow.\" That last part might even have been true. She was feeling very queasy after watching her shirt split open like that. Quickly hitting the gas, Aubrey drove home and climbed the stairs to her apartment. She thought this would be a better idea than taking the elevator, and might even burn a few calories, but it was easier said than done. She was on a high floor of the building, and after the first two flights of stairs she was almost out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come, I can't be that out of shape...\" She thought to herself as she panted and groaned her way up the next flight. It didn't help that it was a warm day today, and the temperature in the stair well was sweltering. By the time she had clambered to the top step, she was sweating and exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to pull open the door when it swung open and nearly knocked her over. She staggered back and was about to tell whoever it was to watch where the hell they were going, when she looked up and saw Mark. Mark, her incredibly cute neighbor. They hadn't really spoken much since he moved in a few weeks ago, but occasionally she would see him coming back from the gym, and he would give her a wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I'm so sorry,\" he said. \"Are you okay? I thought I was the only one who used the stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine,\" Aubrey stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look exhausted. They still haven't fixed the air con in here, huh?\" Mark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Aubrey said, wiping her brow with a sleeve. She would have been happy to be talking to him if she was still in shape, but she just felt embarrassed now. His toned, muscular body was in stark contrast to her bloated, bulging form. \"See you around!\" She said quickly, and passed by him into the corridor. As she turned, she could have sworn he was checking her out, but no, he was probably just amazed at what a porker she had become lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling even worse than when she had left work, Aubrey walked into her apartment, locked the door behind her and started to strip down. She was sweating like a pig after climbing those stairs, and her clothes were still tight from lunch. She pulled off her oversized sweater and threw it into the laundry basket, then unzipped her skirt with a sigh of relief. Her belly was still bloated from lunch, but it felt better now it was freed from her skirt. At least <i>that </i>hadn't ripped yet. She slumped onto the couch in her underwear with a tired moan and rubbed her swollen belly. \"No more food for you!\" She said. \"This is my wake up call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night...</span></div></div>",

Now what?\"  She muttered to herself as she lumbered to her feet and began waddling toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked through the keyhole to see Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\"  She thought as she instinctively brought her arms up to cover her chest, even though there was a door between her and Mark and her arms could barely have covered even one of her enormous breasts at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\"  She yelled before racing back to her room to grab a t-shirt and a pair of drawstring pants.  She checked herself in the mirror, huffing and puffing.  The v-neck shirt displayed her deep cleavage well, but rode halfway up her full belly.  She tugged it downward, stretching it as far as it would go before pulling the pants up and pulling the string.  The ensemble left only a sliver of belly visible, which was an improvement, but Aubrey was mortified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, if I get through this day, I'm going to lose this weight if it's the last thing I do.\"  Aubrey said as she trudged toward the door red faced and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark!\"  She exclaimed as she swung open the door.  \"What a pleasant surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Aubrey.\"  He said.  \"I'm headed down to the City Grill for a late lunch - want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey pondered the offer.  She had no clothing that fit any better than what she was wearing and she was already stuffed from her original lunch.  Still, could she really turn down lunch with Mark?  Maybe he had been checking her out a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not very hungry, but I'll come along.\"  She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"  Mark replied.  \"And you say you're not hungry now, but they have the biggest and best hamburgers in town.  You've got to try one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\"  Aubrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the diner, Mark and Aubrey made small talk.  Turns out he was in finance, and had played college basketball.  Aubrey was glad to find that he was as charming as he was handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the waiter came, Mark said, \"She'll have a double cheeseburger, fries, and a large chocolate shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark!\"  She said.  \"I told you I wasn't hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grinned.  \"And I told you that you had to try the burger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey relented.  \"OK, OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark ordered, she wondered what she was going to do.  The truth was that she wasn't feeling as full as before, but she was feeling very self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more chatting, the waiter brought out plates with gigantic burgers with a mountain of fries for each of them.  Her shake came as well, and was a humongous 32 ounces in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked, they ate, and Aubrey mindlessly worked her way through the massive pile of food.  Before she knew it, she had finished it all and found that once again she felt like she was on the verge of bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slurped the last of the delicious chocolate shake, the waiter approached.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you two some dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark said, \"Not for me, but this one will have apple pie a la mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey gulped as the waiter said, \"Coming right up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to love this.\"  Mark said excitedly.  \"Easily the best apple pie I've ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Mark, I don't know.\"  Aubrey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I insist.\"  He answered with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey's heart fluttered, and she blushed before saying, \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter brought out a giant slab of the pie with a softball sized scoop of vanilla ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God.\"  Aubrey said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark watched expectantly as Aubrey forced down every last bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\"  Mark said.  \"What did I tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey's mouth was still full as she smiled and nodded her head in agreement, even as she worried that she might explode.  She could feel her overdistended abdomen bulge firmly against the drawstring of her pants.  Her cleavage had become more prominent during the meal as her gut filled and displaced her melon-like boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cringed slightly when the waiter asked, \"Anything else, folks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a small measure of relief when Mark mercifully said, \"The check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arose from the table, there was no hiding what had occurred.  No amount of tugging on the shirt was going to pull it down over her ballooned belly.  She decided to simply act nonchalantly as they left, even though she could hardly breathe, had to waddle slowly, and looked like a parade float.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark acted like he either didn't notice or didn't care, escorting her all the way back to her apartment before leaving to go to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for lunch - I had a great time.\"  Aubrey said at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"  Mark answered.  \"Let's get together again.  Soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"  Aubrey replied, elated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner tonight?\"  Mark said, moving in closer and flashing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  Aubrey said.  \"That is soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too soon?\"  Mark asked, leaning in a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey started to answer when Mark kissed her and brought her into an embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no?\"  Aubrey said, looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his hands to her fat midsection and stopped with his hands slightly pressed into her soft flesh.  \"Good.  Bring your appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed her again and walked to the stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey smiled.  He had been checking her out!</span></div></div>",

She had managed to make it out to purchase some new clothing in the afternoon and was wearing a new dress that hugged her substantial curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you look great!\"  Mark said, setting a grocery bag down on the counter and pulling out a twelve pack of imported beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I did some shopping.\"  Aubrey replied before somewhat sheepishly adding,  \"I've put on a little weight recently, so I needed some fat clothes.  I really need to go on a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aubrey, I don't think that you don't need to diet, but if you want, I'll help you.\"  Mark offered as he opened a couple of beers for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take all the help I can get!\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Let's start with dinner.\"  Mark suggested.  \"I thought we'd order in, so I took the liberty of calling for pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound like diet food...\"  Aubrey said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be for this diet!\"  Mark answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey again made small talk as they sat on the couch, and each worked on a second beer.  As Aubrey neared the end of the beer, the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark went to the door, and Aubrey heard the delivery man say, \"OK, that's three extra large pizzas, a double order of cheese garlic bread, and a half dozen cannolis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was he ordering for a party?\"  Aubrey wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, here we go.\"  Mark said.  \"You ready for another beer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  Aubrey answered.  She was a little unsure if this was a good idea.  She was already feeling the effects of the first two, but they tasted pretty good, so she decided that this would be her last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Italian place does the best pizza.\"  Mark reported as he brought her beer and a plate with three slices on it.  \"You're going to love this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey was hungry at this point, so the three pieces were gone fairly quickly.  Before she had finished chewing, Mark got up, refilled her plate, and brought her another beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey had nearly finished her beer, so the timing was good, but she was experiencing a good buzz that led her to think that might not be such a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what about that diet?\"  Aubrey said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let me worry about that.\"  Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey had no problem with that answer.  Three pieces of pizza hadn't really touched her hunger, and three more probably wouldn't erase it either.  And so she ate and drank while she and Mark talked about his job.  Before long, her plate was empty again.  As before, Mark immediately got up and refilled it, and brought another beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me about your work.\"  Mark said when he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey ate while she explained her menial job, finishing with:  \"It's an OK place to work, but everyone there is SO fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God.\"  Aubrey elaborated.  \"There's food everywhere, and the women who work there just eat and eat all day long.\"  After this statement, she finished her next beer and belched loudly before giggling and saying:  \"Oops!  Excuse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you need a refill.\"  Mark said with a smile, taking her now empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey was starting to feel fuller now, but Mark clearly knew what he was talking about when it came to food.  The pizza was outstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you eat with them?\"  Mark asked as he set down another plate and another beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey already had the next piece in her mouth.  \"Mmmmph.  A little.  That's why I've gotten so fat lately.  I'm going to the gym, though, and I have this great new diet coach who says he's going to help me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winked at him after she said this, and then grabbed two pieces of pizza stacked on top of one another and ate them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't be afraid to snack with your friends at work.  The mistake that most people make is trying to starve themselves, and then they overeat later.\"  Mark explained.  \"You need another refill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey finished the double stack of slices while Mark was up again.  He must have thought it was a good idea, because the next plate had six slices stacked into three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no beer?\"  Aubrey joked as she picked up the first double stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd hate to see you get drunk.\"  Mark laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late, handsome.\"  Aubrey said, winking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is it all junk food?\"  Mark asked her, getting back to their workplace discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it.\"  Aubrey answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, those women must be pretty big then.\"  He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph.  Huge.\"  She agreed as she chewed.  \"My bosth mufft weigh 500 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"  Mark remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so hard to stay thin in that place.\"  Aubrey said as she picked up another double stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet.\"  Mark agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph.  I've ptt on smm wt, but mm jst glad it moftly gss to my boobth.\"  Aubrey said with mouth full as she finished the second double stack and picked up the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could see that as a nice benefit to putting on a few pounds.\"  Mark said.  \"Let's get you some more pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey was finally starting to feel close to full.  One more plate would probably do the trick.  Fortunately, Mark had that for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your favorite, then?\"  Mark asked as he dropped off another plate of double stacks.  \"Cake?  Pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph.  Donutth.\"  She admitted.  \"I cd eat thmm all day lng.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As your diet coach, that's good to know.\"  Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thith ith quite a sthart to mm diet.\"  Aubrey remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, and it's almost time for dessert!\"  He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dethert?\"  Aubrey asked.  \"Oh, Mrk, I'm fll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark slid closer to her on the couch and put one of his hands on her belly, now quite swollen, and the other behind her head as he looked her in the eye.  \"You can finish the pizza, and these cannolis are the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do like cannoli.\" Aubrey confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, finish your dinner, and you can have dessert.\"  Mark said with a smile. \"Lean back a bit, it'll give you more room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she picked up the last double stack, Mark disappeared to the kitchen.  Aubrey's eyes widened when Mark returned with three more double stacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tht you sd I waf dn!\"  Aubrey exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the last of it.\"  He assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey was stuffed, but Mark cajoled her into getting the last of the pizza down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I'm stuffed.\"  Aubrey groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's always room for cannoli.\"  Mark said, bringing out the cream-filled treats.  \"Which flavor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one with the chocolate chips looks good.\"  She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay back some more.\"  Mark said.  \"I'll feed it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark fed her with one hand while he caressed her with the other.  He kissed her sugary lips after the first was gone, and she closed her eyes.  She reached for him when he backed out and opened her mouth slightly to kiss him, but was greeted with another cannoli.  His fondling had moved to her left breast at this point, and she enjoyed the joint sensations of a gentle touch and a sweet cannoli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he brought the third to her mouth, she moaned softly.  \"Mark, I'm so full.  No more, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are four more.\"  Mark said, gently squeezing her right breast.  \"Two for this side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then squeezed her left breast.  \"And two for this side.  Just the thought of that turns me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes still closed, Aubrey smiled.  \"OK, for the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was done.  Mark kissed her and gently massaged her belly and breasts.  Eventually, he simply stroked her hair until she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey awoke the next morning on her couch.  Her apartment was empty, her living room and kitchen were clean.  She staggered to her feet, confused by Mark's absence.  She decided to see if he had gone home, and went to her front door.  When she opened it, she found four boxes of a dozen donuts outside with a note on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had to go to work, but thought you might like a donut, and these are the best in town.  Don't share them with your coworkers, they're just for you and 'the girls'.  Love, Mark\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey smiled as she brought the boxes inside.  She opened up a box, grabbed an old-fashioned, and took a bite.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, what a great donut!\"  She thought.  The guy definitely knew his food...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several weeks later, Aubrey was again facing what was becoming an all too familiar problem for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, damn it!\"  She cursed as she attempted to squeeze into yet another bra that had become too tight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiggled and jiggled and wobbled her body all over and finally managed to encase the tips of her breasts in the 38J bra.  The cups were holding them back as effectively as could be expected, but they couldn't stop the overflow of boobs around their edges.  The bra dug into Aubrey's fleshy back, attempting to maintain a foothold, but it was clear that this could only last so long before her massive tits grew a bit more and broke free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on her panties failed to replicate the struggle that she had with her bra, but that wasn't because the fit was any better.  Unlike the bra's battle of the bulge, the panties simply retreated into the valley between Aubrey's round butt cheeks and the waistband hid beneath the overhang of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on the dress that she had worn for her first dinner with Mark.  If it had hugged her curves before, it was now squeezing them much tighter.  Every rounded edge of her body was now clearly visible, thanks to another 30 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I get any fatter, Mark's going to have to roll me to bed tonight.\"  Aubrey said ruefully as she looked in the mirror.  \"I've got to get this weight under control or I'm going to lose him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Mark had spent all of their free time together since that first day.  They went to lunch, they went to brunch, they went to dinner, they had dessert, they ate candy and popcorn at the movies, they had ice cream in the park.  During the time they couldn't be together, Mark was always giving her surprises, like candy, chocolate dipped fruit, and what seemed like a never ending supply of those ridiculously good donuts.  He always knew where the best food could be found, and he never let Aubrey miss out on any of it, to the point where she left any time with him so full that she could hardly move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night was their weekly pizza night, and Mark was gently encouraging Aubrey to reach new levels of gluttony yet again.  She had eaten the better part of four extra large pizzas and her cannoli count had reached nine with Mark holding the tenth in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark, I'm so full I can hardly breathe.\"  She groaned.  \"My belly feels like an overinflated beach ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just one more little cannoli.\"  He said.  \"I'd hate for it to go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\"  She said.  \"You eat it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I don't like cannoli.\"  He laughed before giving her a peck on her round cheek.  \"Besides, I want you to have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey leaned her head back.  \"Mark, I don't know.\"  She started.  \"I've got to stop this.  I've gotten so fat I have to get new fat clothes because I'm too fat for the fat clothes I bought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not fat.\"  He said, putting the cannoli down and kissing her again.  \"You're absolutely perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right.\"  Aubrey said with a long exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love every inch of you.\"  He said, resting a hand on her rotund belly, and kissing her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love my boobs.\"  She said.  \"I think you want to see if they'll get so big that people mistake them for planets.  That's why you keep making me get fatter and fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do love them.\"  Mark admitted.  \"But I'd settle for people mistaking them for moons as opposed to full-fledged planets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My belly is going to need its own solar system soon.\"  Aubrey lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aubrey, you're not fat.\"  Mark reassured her.  \"And I love your belly, your boobs, your thighs, and every other part of you, body and soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you.\"  Aubrey said, pulling him in for a kiss, which he gave her.  \"It's just that I don't want to lose you, and I'm afraid that if I get too fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aubrey, eat the cannoli.\"  He said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I just said...\"  Aubrey began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I thought you were getting too fat, would I want you to eat another cannoli?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I...\"  Aubrey stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, after the cannoli, I want you to eat until you absolutely, positively cannot eat another bite.  I know we have ice cream and candy.\"  Mark said.  \"And I'll go out and get you anything else that you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\"  Aubrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About you.\"  He said very seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey lurched forward and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere.\"  She replied, stripping out of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"  He asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making room.\"  She answered, unclasping her bra and kicking off her panties, allowing her gigantic round boobs to rest on her spherical belly before she lay back on the couch.  \"That's better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark couldn't resist putting his hands on her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey pushed him away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cannoli.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark scrambled to pick it up and feed it to Aubrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm...\"  Aubrey said.  \"I think that one had extra calories.  I felt my boobs get a little bigger as soon as I swallowed.  Do they look bigger to you?  Wait, don't answer, just get me my favorite fattening food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sprinted to the kitchen, returning with a dozen donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it.\"  Aubrey smiled, and Mark put one up to her mouth.  \"Mmmmmm...Mrk, I wisth I wd hfff known tht you wntd me fft.  I've bn hldng bck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you fat, I just want you.\"  Mark said.  \"Your perfect body is just a bonus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey was already reaching out for a second donut.  \"Itth nt prfct yet.  My titth ar gng to be huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're already huge.\"  Mark pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey shook her head.  \"Mmmph.  Nt cmprd to wht thrr gnna be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey's enthusiasm got her through 6 donuts before she surrendered, donut crumbs sprinkled across her boobs and belly.  She laid back with her eyes closed and a smile on her face.  \"I can't eat another bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it!\"  Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think that I was afraid that I was getting too fat for you.\"  Aubrey said, sighing in contentment as Mark stroked her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never.\"  Mark replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\"  Aubrey challenged.  \"I'm not dieting any more.  I'm going to be your dream girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already are.\"  Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, in that case, I'll be your dream girl with bigger boobs than anyone's ever seen.\"  She flirted.  \"Now, can you clean these crumbs off of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  Mark said, starting to brush them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll just end up on the floor like that!\"  Aubrey squealed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\"  Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer immediately, instead reaching a plump arm out, grabbing the back of Mark's head, and pulling him face first into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be the only one eating dessert all of the time.\"  She said.  \"Aren't those little crumbs delicious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmphhmmm...\"  Came Mark's muffled response, while Aubrey grinned and digested.</span></div></div>",

Jessica was essentially correct.  Aubrey was eating at meals, between meals, and between snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we could hit the gym later.\"  Jessica suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm over that place.\"  Aubrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more diet and exercise?\"  Jessica asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for me.\"  Aubrey responded.  \"I've found some new hobbies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's no lie.\"  Jess thought to herself as she watched Aubrey waddle away.  \"Apparently blowing yourself up like a balloon is a hobby now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly had become one for Aubrey.  What's more, she was good at it and getting better every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt times, it was like a sport - how fast could she eat a box of donuts?  At other times, a test of will - could she force that 15th donut down?  And at still other times, it remained just a pastime - what would the donut of the day be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the moment to moment motivation, she was getting really fat, really fast. She had added 46 pounds since the night that Mark had essentially told her to get fatter, and whereas it had previously been something to try and hide, now it was a nonstop celebration.  She loved it when she tore a dress or a skirt because her ass had gotten bigger.  She now actually tried to stuff herself to the point of popping buttons on her shirts.  Her favorite though, not surprisingly, was busting a bra.  She had a corkboard in her bedroom that she would tack them to after they broke, and she made little R.I.P. tombstones to accompany them that recorded its size, the day she first wore it and the day it met its end.  There were already four of them, including the most recent victim, a red lace 40NN, which had only lasted about a week before her growing bust popped the clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was awed by her transformation.  Before he had made his move, he had watched as Aubrey went from being a curvy girl to a plump girl with big tits.  Now he was helping her become a fat girl with the most massive boobs he had ever laid eyes on, and she was adding pounds faster than he ever could have imagined, growing those boobs bigger by the day!  The girl's appetite was almost insatiable, and she had thoroughly embraced a lifestyle of unabashed gluttony in the pursuit of humongous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as Aubrey inflated before his eyes, Mark wanted more.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't get enough of her growing body either, and his level of attraction to her seemed to increase along with her ballooning breasts.  Although his tastes had always tended toward more curvaceous women, Aubrey was the first girl he had ever dated that could be referred to as fat, and he had never realized how much bit aroused him to feed her and aid her in getting even bigger.  There was a certain thrill in it all for him that he had been unaware of, watching the previously chubby girl add more and more fat to her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, they were planning to go out to dinner at a restaurant near Aubrey's office, so Mark arranged to pick her up at work.  He smiled as she ambled out of the office with some of her coworkers, snacking on a donut as usual.  As they approached, Mark got a closer look at them.  The first was a huge brunette who had to weigh around 400 pounds mostly contained in an enormous belly.  The second was a blonde girl with a strikingly pretty face who weighed a little less and whose weight was distributed more evenly in her large breasts, belly, and butt.  The third was a blonde girl who looked a bit out of place with the other three, because she wasn't huge.  This third girl had some attitude about her with her dark sunglasses and designer purse; she looked practically anorexic next to the others, but Mark noticed that she was showing some signs that she might one day catch them, with a blouse showing gaps in the buttons over a nice sized bustline, and a hint of a muffin top over her black skirt that looked to be just a bit too tight.  Aubrey introduced them as Jessica, Alice, and Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making some polite conversation following the introductions, Mark and Aubrey made their way to dinner.  They had their usual good time together, and afterward Mark took her back to the office to get her car.  After dropping her off, Mark drove home, ready to meet back up with Aubrey at the apartment, but he found that his thoughts kept drifting to...</span></div></div>",

She seemed to have a nice rack forming, would her weight go there?  Would she come to like it, or would she fight it all the way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your friends seem nice.\"  Mark said to Aubrey when they arrived back at the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the huge meal she had just eaten, Aubrey was already opening a container of ice cream.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jessica's my best friend there.\"  She said as she fumbled around for a spoon.  \"She helped me get fat in the first place, so you should probably thank her some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She helped you get fat?\"  Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she was my diet and exercise coach before you came along.\"  Aubrey explained with a giggle.  \"I was already getting fat, she just gave me food advice that packed on more pounds, and I followed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Alice and Christina?\"  Mark probed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice apparently used to be a homecoming queen, cheerleader, all that.\"  Aubrey said.  \"She's huge, but so pretty.  I hope I stay pretty when I'm the size of a parade float.  I'm going to get soooooo big, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Christina?\"  Mark inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.\"  Aubrey answered, mouth full of ice cream.  \"She's only been there a month or two.  Cute, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\"  Mark said, feigning disinterest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's starting to get chunky.\"  Aubrey said.  \"She was super skinny when she started, but now she's actually got boobs and a little bit of a belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think she'll get bigger?\"  Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey smiled.  \"We all will.

She was an eating machine at this point, gorging herself for him night and day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggled up to him on the couch and fell asleep.  As he stared into gigantic breasts that gently rose and fell in time with her soft breathing, he found himself once again thinking about the growing Christina, and he began to hatch a plan to turn her into another busty engine of gluttony for his pleasure.</span></div></div>",

She suggested that Jessica might be a better choice for the task, but Mark convinced her to participate by pointing out that Jessica might not be able to keep a secret from her good friend Aubrey.  Mark suggested that they meet up on a Saturday afternoon and said that he'd buy lunch in exchange for her assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a warm afternoon, and Christina wore a tank top and skirt.  As she approached their meeting point in the mall food court, Mark noted that neither probably fit her as they had on the days that she bought them.  The tank top was a stretch cotton, and hugged both her bustline and her belly, with the indentation of her belly button visible.  The skirt rode a little high on her rounded bottom and showed off plump thighs that touched as she walked closer.  With her sun-kissed skin and blonde hair, she was every bit as beautiful as Mark had remembered her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark?\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Christina.\"  He answered.  \"Thanks for coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem.\"  She responded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we'd eat lunch first.\"  Mark suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"  Christina replied.  \"I'm not that hungry, but I'll snack on something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took her to the Pie Factory, a casual restaurant known for gargantuan portions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this OK?\"  Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\"  She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were seated, and Christina sighed as she looked over the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\"  Mark inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kind of on a diet.\"  Christina admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but what brought on the sigh?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love their macaroni and cheeseburger, but it has, like, 8,000 calories.\"  She groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can diet tomorrow.\"  Mark said.  \"Have what you want, I insist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"  Christina said, just as the waitress arrived at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\"  Mark said with a smile.  \"She'll have the macaroni and cheeseburger and I'll take the chicken sandwich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to drink?\"  The waitress asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a diet...\"  Christina began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she won't.\"  Mark interrupted.  \"We'll both have non-diet colas of whatever type you serve here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina smiled as the waitress left.  \"Why'd you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm treating you to lunch.\"  Mark explained.  \"Enjoy yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be enjoying a new pant size if I don't get on top of this diet!\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that right now.\"  Mark replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter small talk about Christina's college and sorority and Mark's college basketball days, the meal was gone.  They laughed and had a good time in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you two save room for dessert?\"  The waitress asked, holding a tray of cakes and pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Christina, what's it going to be?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm so full.\"  She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you don't finish, you can always take it home.\"  He offered. \"Again, it's my treat.  If you don't pick something, I'll pick it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, all right, I love the turtle cheesecake.\"  Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another minute, the gigantic dessert was there, and she began to pick at it while they chatted some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I try a bite?\"  Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"  Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took a small bite.  \"I can see why you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share the rest of it with me.\"  Christina instructed.  \"I don't really want to eat it all and I don't want to carry it around, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark obliged, knowing that she would finish the bulk of it, which she had just a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm such a pig...\"  Christina whined as Mark signed the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you say that?\"  Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know that I've put on fifteen pounds in the last two months?\"  She asked rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark guessed that it was likely more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't stop eating!\"  She moaned.  \"I'm going to be as big as a whale soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, I think you're beautiful, and you weren't the problem here.\"  He said softly as he looked into her eyes.  \"I'm sorry that I ordered all of that food for you, I was just trying to show my gratitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not just this meal.\"  She said, looking down with some tears welling up.  \"I'm eating all of the time.  There's always something around at work, and if it weren't so good, I could probably stop, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're a knockout, right?\"  Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"  She replied, making eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spectacular.\"  Mark offered, touching her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina drew back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"  He said.  \"I shouldn't have done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina realized at that moment what was going on.  Mark hadn't called her to help pick out a gift for Aubrey; this was an excuse to see her!  Her confidence surged; this was the kind of guy she was accustomed to dating, and this one couldn't resist her even after she had put on weight.  He probably thought that she was super skinny compared to Aubrey, who was getting as fat as those other heifers in the office and he also didn't realize that this was way fatter than she had ever been.  He was cute and smart, and his girlfriend Aubrey was no competition for her; this was a no-brainer.  She was going to have this guy, get skinny again, and her life was going to be back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed his hand and then smiled.  \"No, it's OK.  I was just surprised, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good.\"  Mark said. \"I'd hate for you to have gotten the wrong idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I get it.\"  She cooed.  \"So, are we going to shop for a gift for Aubrey now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grinned.  \"I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get to it!\"  She said.</span></div></div>",

Christina wasn't even what one would call chubby, just a little soft.  While Mark had almost immediately been able get Aubrey to stuff herself, Christina constantly was told how their time together was infrequent and thus special, so she should indulge.  One thing that was similar was that both women had a food weakness.  Aubrey couldn't resist donuts, while Christina loved chocolate.  Both were kept amply supplied with these items at work: Aubrey by Mark and Christina by her \"secret admirer\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the addition of large meals and frequent surprise deliveries of chocolate candies, cupcakes, donuts, and pies in addition to the seemingly never ending supply of food at work, Christina's appetite was increasing, and her body was slowly morphing.  She had the advantage of height, and so pounds found their way relatively evenly across her body, to include her now DD cup breasts, pudgy midsection, round butt, and chunky thighs.  She had gained a good 20 more pounds since her first date with Mark, bringing her up to 160.  Her appetite had grown in kind, and Mark was finding it easier to get her to take more, even as she snacked all day at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Aubrey had continued to swell.  She was approaching 330 pounds on a rapid pace.  Her tits were reaching the size of beach balls as her once curvy frame coalesced into three large spheres with a head and stubby arms and legs.  She was finding it harder and harder to get around, now getting out of breath with the slightest of effort.  All the while, she and Mark marveled at the fact that her boobs were STILL getting bigger and rounder.  This kept her going as she struggled to make it from her car to the desk, or when she broke a chair while taking minutes in a meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina realized that she had been gaining weight, but she was increasingly shrugging it off.  Mark was cheating on Aubrey with her, so he clearly thought she was skinny and hot, even if his frame of reference was mildly skewed.  She wasn't crazy about her belly, but did enjoy having big boobs for the first time in her life.  She'd lose the weight eventually, but maybe she'd be able to hang on to these new arrivals.  She was also actively \"sabotaging\" Aubrey by making sure that her desk was constantly piled high with food.  That blimp just ate it as fast as she could - it was like she was trying to get fat!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over another few months, Mark's life actually somehow managed to improve. Aubrey's figure continued to balloon, and with it came less and less mobility. She was mainly limited to wherever it was she decided to plant herself. This was usually her desk at work or her couch at home, and whenever she would decide to wedge herself into her car. Mark was driven wild by her ridiculously large, wobbling spheres of flesh- all of them. Her stomach, butt, and boobs all were massive chunks of her that kept her from doing much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really drove Mark wild was Aubrey's appetite- she could easily eat 6 boxes of donuts, and almost never stopped eating. On one of their more adventurous nights together, he had managed to push Aubrey to her max, and she had managed to down 12 dozen donuts. She then proceeded to pass out and sleep for almost 20 hours in bloated digestion, but that's besides the point. She weighed in at 372 pounds on that day, and Mark could only guess how much she had grown since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this time that Aubrey spent eating, sleeping, and lazing about made it much easier for Mark to slide time with Christina into his schedule. He started spending almost all of the time he had outside of work and Aubrey with her, and that meant bad things for Christina's waistline. Chocolate and massive portions, stuffing sessions before sex, and various snacks he brought her during work (Aubrey's lack of mobility and the indifference of the other people working there allowed him to bring gifts to both at once) allowed her to pack on 50 pounds. Her height allowed the weight to continue to spread throughout her body, leaving her with a sizable potbelly and fairly large breasts (though nothing compared to Aubrey's), with the real jewel being her wobbly behind. It wobbled and jiggled and seemingly had a mind of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn more important news, Mark had 2 great new things that allowed him to push his blimping girlfriends to new heights (or, more specifically, waist sizes). He had attracted several new clients to his personal finance business, including a couple millionaires. His increase in salary allowed him to provide an absolute deluge of tasty, fattening treats to Aubrey and Christina, as well as pay for their new clothing, and in Aubrey's case, buy her a car she could actually get her boobs into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other big new thing was that Mark had found the Holy Grail to Christina's waistline. He had quickly figured out that she was a big fan of kissing and sex and all of that stuff, so they had kept that side of their relationship very active. But he had learned that if he told her she was looking really skinny or thin, it would boost her self-confidence through the roof and eliminate any self-enacted limits on her eating. Just a simple, \"Oh my gosh, have you dropped a pant size or two?\" up to Christina's personal favorite, \"Aubrey is such a fat whale compared to you,\" would allow Christina to stuff herself to her heart's content and not think twice about it.</span></div></div>",

Mesmerised by the once skinny women packing on pound after pound, he became more focused on her becoming a true butterball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the f*ck.\u201d Christina screamed as she came in a mad rage storming out the bathroom, her now much larger gut swinging side to side from the quick movement. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Said mark sincerely from the bed, staring at a much fatter Christina. <br>\r\n\u201cIm fat\u201d Christina yelled almost in a panic. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you look fine, perfectly thin\u201d mark said lying, she looked huge. <br>\r\n\u201cThin.. thin. I weigh 250 f*cking pounds. I\u2019m fat\u201d she said angrily. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve gained so much weight\u201d she said as her anger quickly turned to sadness. <br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look fat at all\u201dSaid mark in a calm caring voice. <br>\r\n\u201cI used to weigh, 125lbs now I\u2019m just huge.\u201d She said touching a her new round stomach. <br>\r\n\u201cYou look great much better than Aubrey\u201d he said trying to boost her self esteem so she would keep gaining. <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true at least I\u2019m not as fat as that cow. God I would never let myself get that big. \u201c<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. Last time she weighed she was edging on 500lbs.\u201d Mark said happily as he could see his plan working. <br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s settled. I can\u2019t be this fat, I used to be a cheerleader, I\u2019m supposed to be thin. I have to go on a diet\u201d Christina said. <br>\r\nMarks face drop \u201coh crap. All his hard work\u201d he thought. <br>\r\nAfter a short conversation trying to persuade her out of it he realised that it wasn\u2019t working and that he would have to fined a new way to keep her gaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at work he scrambled his mined searching for new ideas to keep Christina ballooning up. He knew that she likely wouldn\u2019t stop gaining she was to addicted to all the fatty foods he had been buying her, and she was way to weak willed that exercising at her weight was unlikely or not going to last long. However what troubles mark was how fast she was gaining, he had never seen anyone pack on so much weight so quickly, from such a small starter weight, and he didn\u2019t want this new diet to slow down such rapid expansion or even stop it. As he store at his desk at work sifting threw the papers with all the different products and items his newly successful company was buying and selling, he saw something that gave him an idea. <br>\r\nIt was an idea that he got off a movie he saw sometime and it might just be perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day as he and Christina met up at the secret hotel. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, Christina. So I\u2019ve been thinking, you know how I\u2019m a buisness man.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d She said fafing with her pants as they were to tight. <br>\r\n\u201cWell. I sometimes do trades from aboard and I\u2019ve found these nutrition bars which will be perfect for you diet.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?!\u201d She said excitedly. <br>\r\n\u201c yeah there from this country, and they are supposed to work wonders for diets cutting making people drop up to hundreds of pounds. There super healthy. \u201c<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. This is exactly what I need\u201d Christina said grabbing a bar and eating it. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah. And the best is you don\u2019t even need to exercise either, the just soak up weight. \u201c<br>\r\n\u201cThis is perfect. I\u2019ll never be fat now\u201d she said grabbing 2 more. <br>\r\n\u201cHow many can I eat \u201c she said as she started stuffing her face. <br>\r\n\u201cAs many as you want. They have no calories and all the do is make you loose weight. \u201c<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god. They are chocolate as well. That\u2019s my fave. \u201c<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been wolfing down these nutrition bars left right and centre, I was found rarely ever not eating one. Mark had told her that these bars were like practically God\u2019s gift for a thin body and tight ass, but the truth is that they are  so jam packed with fats, sugars, carbs and the calories where so high they are practically of the charts, that these bars were pretty much a death sentence for your waistline. And to make things worse, not only were these bars super unhealthy but they are also filled with supplements to slow metabolism, increases hunger and make a person more lethargic. However this  was great for mark as because they are foreign only he knows they are super fattening and supposed to be used on people suffering malnutrition, so he can just watch as Christina just stuffs em down like there\u2019s no tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had catastrophic effects over the months for Christina. Ever since her diet started she was eating more than ever before and her weight gain had skyrocketed. Whenever she would get hungry she would eat a bar in an attempt to loose weight, but the bar would just make her hungrier making her crave other foods leading to her buying mass amounts of fast food to fill herself. After that she would feel guilty about the junk she at so she would eat more bars thinking it would soak up the weight but it only made her hungrier. This cycle would continue and as time went on the weight piled on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey on ther other hand had become a titanic ball of flab. Weighing over 650lbs she had become truely obese. Her body had become a mound of blubber, stacked with rolls of fat.  Her face was laired with chins and her arms were as thick as normal legs. But the worst was her breast, the were gigantic and saggyly rested on her folds of fat for a gut. Mark had actually not given her the nutrition bars, as her appetite was so out of control he feared what they may do to her. She was truely fat. </span></div></div>",

Yeah this is good making her the fattest i like that. Its like karma and irony, this could be a good plan i like it. One thing though, how are we going to make her fatter than us, because no offence girl im pretty big and you, you are just huge.\u201d Said jessica. <br>\r\n\u201c well yeah i know it might be hard, but like you said she has been packing on tons off weight on her own, all we have to do is speed up the process fast enough so eventually she\u2019ll be fatter than us.\u201d Said aubrey. <br>\r\n\u201cOk then. I get it but how do we speed her gain up and how will we know when she is fatter\u201d said jess. <br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Err... ive got it.\u201d Said aubrey. <br>\r\n\u201cTo measure her progress we can get on of those super fast electronic scales, and then hide under the carpet at the coat rack in the office. Wvery single person in the office stands directly in front of that rack as they take there coat off and puts it on the rack. This way when everyone stands in front the scale will measure and then i can program it to send the result to my phone. That way not only can we keep track of christinas weight but we can compare hers with every on in the office and see when she passes some ones weight\u201d said aubrey. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah thats good. Oo and ive got an idea on how to make her fatter.\u201d Said jess. <br>\r\n\u201c you see in the office ive notice that christina wolfs down this bar things, then like 5 minutes later she gets like super hungry and starts super binging, like literally eating everything. So all we need to do is surround her with like tons super fatty and sugar foods like a tray of burgers and donuts and like cake. And once she eats one of those bars she will start stuffing her face with all the junk.\u201d Said jess<br>\r\n\u201cYeah this is a great plan. That b*tch is gonna wish she never messed with me\u201d said aubrey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls got their plan started immediately. They got the other girls in the office, in on the plan, as they knew everybody was sick of christinas bitchy attitude and judgey looks and they all felt bad for Aubrey, after what christina did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan proved much easier than the girls thought. Christina was already well on her way to becoming a massive glutton, thanks to mark, and since her break up she had been rapidly piling on weight, stuffing herself with comfort food , then feeling guilty and stuffing herself with her nutrition bars starting the cycle over again. Since the breakup mark made it clear to Christina, out of respect to Aubrey, that he wouldn\u2019t see her anymore however he still agreed to send her a box of nutrition bars every week \u201cfor her diet\u201d, but secretly holding on to some hope that one day he might bump into a colossal Christina some time in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this made it very easy for the girls to turn Christina into the blob she deserved to be. Once they had set up the scale under the coat rack so that they could keep track off her weight, all they had to do was make sure Christina was surrounded by enough fatty and sugary foods for her to inhale, and with almost everyone in the office in on the plan Christina was practically buried in junk food. Her waistline was doomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girls started the plan Christina was weighing around 360lbs and was quickly getting bigger. <br>\r\n\u201cJesus Aubrey. This girl doesn\u2019t even need our help getting fat she\u2019s doin a good enough job to herself anyway. \u201c said Jess shocked at how big she was as she remembered the thin, lithe Christina who had started working here a year ago. <br>\r\n\u201c yeah well she is still the smallest in the office even if she is a fatty. Plus she deserves to become the fattest.\u201d Aubrey said. \u201cYeah true. We are still doing this. Now according to the chart, the next smallest is Alice at 452lbs and the biggest is you at 686lbs, I\u2019m at 589lbs whilst everyone else is somewhere in between you and Alice . So shall we get started\u201d jess said as they both gave an evil grin at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths began to fly by and pounds were flooding onto Christina at an alarming rate, she was stuffing fast food down her mouth like it was going out of style. She was on the fast track to fattest. <br>\r\nAfter the first 2 months Christina quickly over took Alice putting her up to 463lbs. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Christina, how\u2019s It feel not being the smallest anymore? Welcome to the fat side of life.\u201d A co-worker said laughing as they walked past her desk whilst she was binging on donuts. <br>\r\nAfter 5 months she had actually become fatter than Jess. <br>\r\n\u201cAubrey, look look. She did it she\u2019s actually fatter than me\u201d Jess said excitedly as she showed Aubrey the chart. \u201cwow 611lbs. Shes certainly fat now.\u201d Aubrey said laughing. However, Christina was starting to struggle. After gaining weight so fast she hadn\u2019t gotten used to her shear size. She was now super clumsy always breaking chairs and knocking things over and mediocre task like bending over, fitting in her car and even walking were now getting very difficult. Finally, she never seemed to have clothes that fit, whenever she bought new ones she always seem to out grow them in a matter of days. Her life was going down hill. She hated how fat she had become and this only made her eat more out of stress, anger and comfort. She now had a huge wobbly ass that struggled to fit through door ways, and she had large tree trunk thighs that constantly rubbed when she walked. Her arms were now incredibly thick and jiggly and her face was paired with a massive heavy double chin and a fat neck. Then there was her colossal saggy boobs which couldn\u2019t fit in a bra so just rested on her giant gut, which was by far her largest area. Her belly had become gigantic and squishy, it swayed as she walked and hung to her knees. When she looked in the mirror she couldn\u2019t even fully fit in it. She was sat at her desk, no surprise eating food when a co-worker walked past. \u201cDamm Christina, you big\u201d. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter that months and months flew by. Christina was still rapidly getting fatter and once she over took Jenna at 644lbs she was the second biggest in the office. However, time still flew by and she never changed from second no matter how hard the girls in the office tried. This was because it wasn\u2019t getting Christina fatter that was the problem. It was getting Aubrey to stop getting fatter. Even though this was Aubrey\u2019s plan, she just couldn\u2019t stop gaining weight too. After her break up with mark and her limitless appetite she to had been packing on the weight. Luckily though Christina was gaining a tiny bit faster, however Aubrey had a huge lead. So the girls in the office just had to wait for the inevitable. They monitored there gains month after month once Christina had become second biggest. <br>\r\nmonth 1: Aubrey 839lbs Christina 663lbs<br>\r\nmonth 2: Aubrey 885lbs Christina 724lbs<br>\r\nmonth 4: Aubrey 936lbs Christina 805lbs<br>\r\nmonth 8: Aubrey 1189lbs Christina 1178lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until after nine and half months later that Christina was finally the fattest. All the girls celebrated and when they finally revealed she was the fattest she almost past out, baring in mined when she last weighed herself she was only 250 pounds and that was huge for her. After that Christina was forced to work from and put under special care because of how huge she had become. The same thing happened to Aubrey as she was just as big but Jessica offered for her to be moved to her house as they where close friends. </span></div></div>",

Wake up, go to the office, sit at her desk, leave the office, come home. A routine she experienced everyday (except the weekends). She entered her house and dropped her bag on a chair and waddled into her bedroom. Lucielle had grown used to the living the \u201coffice grind,\u201d something that so many people despised, Lucielle thoroughly enjoyed. She unbuttoned her dress shirt and slipped into a t shirt. She took her pants off and squeezed her big fat thighs into some sweatpants. This was her after work attire. Lucielle loved to be comfortable and relaxed. She entered the kitchen. She opened the freezer and pulled out a big carton of ice cream. She next grabbed a box of Oreo\u2019s and waddled into the living room. She turned on the TV and dropped her big butt on the sofa. Her flabby blubber jiggled as she sank deep into the sofa cushion. Lucielle had been stuck doing the same thing everyday for years. She exercised less and less, and was fatter than ever before. Yet she couldn\u2019t be happier. Lucielle sat and started to empty the ice cream carton into her big gut. It was odd that despite the incredible decline of her health and fitness, Lucielle didn\u2019t seem to mind that she was fat. Lucielle smiled as the last spoonful of ice cream slipped down her throat. She placed the empty carton on the coffee table. She let out an audible \u201cAghhhhhhhhh\u201d of relaxation as she patted her chubby bloated belly. She had a moment of bliss as she rearranged her flabby body into a more relaxed position on the soft couch. Lucielle sat comfortably in the light lounge-wear, in her perfectly temperatured living-room, as she mindlessly watched old TV episode\u2019s on Netflix. She then smiled again as she noticed the un-opened package of Oreo\u2019s that was beside her on the sofa. It wasn\u2019t long before the first sweet cookie passed her lips. And this is why Lucielle didn't mind being fat.</span></div></div>",

Clothes stretched and ripped as their flabby bodies squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they all came tumbling through the doorway. The three butterballs dragged themselves up on their feet.

If anything it was having the opposite effect in that her intake had increased since. This was in part due to the fact that the experience had something of a...sexual appeal to the ballooning pear shaped blonde. The night of the incident had led to the expected reflection but Lucielle realised she'd enjoyed it no less, been trapped helplessly by her own girth, hips and thighs squeezing against the doorframe unable to move, the thought of fire fighters coming to rescue her whilst someone fed her more and more empty calories for her nerves of course...<br>\r\nLucielle snapped herself out of the daydream as the insides of her thighs started to heat up from the recollection, remembering where she was.<br>\r\nGirls night!<br>\r\nGirls night had become a frequent outing between Lucielle, Alice and Jessica in recent times, although it was mostly a glorified excuse to get dressed up like typical size 6 office girls and gorge themselves stupid. It was pretty damn hot thought Lucielle.<br>\r\nAt this point in time, or at least according to her scales that morning, Lucielle was just cresting 410lbs, a huge 60lbs since the door. Naturally her lower half had taken the brunt of this gain, as indicated by her filling two thirds of the booth seat she was in with an enormous arse cheek starting to spill into the final third. The gain wasn't without other expansions though and an impressive belly was filling her middle giving her an exaggerated muffin top and, in her stuffed condition, her belly button was nearing the table edge at an alarming rate. She loved it, stroking her belly, every single inch.<br>\r\nJess was naturally the biggest at this point although she never weighed herself, huge belly leading her figure and nearly hanging to her knees without restraint, but Alice was slowing it seemed. By no means small, Alice was a sweet all round fatty but, as shared at the start of the meal, she was peaking and was steady at 435lbs. Lucielle had got rather hot and bothered upon hearing this, the thought of overtaking her friend in fatness was divine, especially given how ravenous she was at the moment.<br>\r\n\"As much as I love this place, the service is a bit sloppy\" Jessica cut across the booths silence.<br>\r\nShe was right, Lucielle needed dessert and there was no help on the way.<br>\r\n\"I'll go\" the blonde pear half groaned and started to slide her fat arse out of the booth.<br>\r\nUpon standing, the blonde readjusted her blue dress to attempt to cover her growing arse (not succeeding entirely) and starts to waddle to the till. Huge cellulite covered thighs rolled past each other, enormous smooth cheeks bouncing on top and bloated stomach jiggling with each step, the young blonde was something of a sight crossing the buffet. Upon reaching the service till, slightly out of breath from the quite short walk, Lucielle placed the huge order and went to make her return. She wasn't impolite, just hungry, but her hunger did make her blind as she ploughed into the person behind her.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm so sorry!\" She shrieked as the man behind stumbled back to his feet.<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about it\" the guy smiled warmly, placing a hand on her stomach reassuringly. In between the thighs warmth again. \"A girl like you is FAR too pretty to apologise, here, let me get you something for your troubles\" the guy signalled to a waitress and said something out of earshot from Lucielle who started to turn red at the mystery mans comments.<br>\r\nLost in her own little world, Lucielle accepted a whole cheesecake boxed to go, thanked the man and went back to her table with her friends on autopilot.<br>\r\n\"You took your time\" observed Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you ok Lu?\" Asked a concerned Alice \"hey what's that?\" Alice pointed to the box.<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just something from a guy I knocked over\" answered Lucielle quietly<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Her friends shouted<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'm ok\" said the blushing blonde as the rest of the food turned up which distracted the other two sufficiently. Lucielle lifted the lid on her cheesecake and saw a hand written note inside the lid<br>\r\n-call me, Alex-<br>\r\nA phone number was scribbled below<br>\r\nDid NOT expect that</span></div></div>",

Lucielle's innocent mind up to that point led her to believe her continued gaining was purely a result of her own appetite but it didn't take long to notice that things were growing much quicker now knowing Alex was into cramming her face full of food at all times.<br>\r\nAnd so we end up here, a 570lb blonde crushing the life out of Alex's bed whilst he did all the work in the back. In near euphoria, Lucielle continued pushing cake into her hungry mouth nearly as aroused by the food as she was by the act going on behind her (it hadn't been long before her link between food and arousal was discovered and now there was rarely a time when she wasn't eating during sex) and totally in love with her enormous figure. In keeping with her weight gain form, her lower half had frankly ballooned. Her arse resembled two over inflated beach balls looking fit to burst in any kind of clothing which was admittedly rare these days, not that it was a problem as she had been granted a leave of absence from work as her new office was getting fitted. Her thighs were pressed firmly together top to bottom, covered in a delicate layer of cellulite and thick enough to stretch her last pair of leggings to near transparency on the first outing. Surprisingly, though not unexpected given her weight, her belly had caught up impressively in recent months and in her current all fours position was pressed against the struggling bed and spilling wider to her sides from the pressure being exerted from the rest of her bulk. At standing her belly formed two thick rolls around her waist and accented her gargantuan hips with a thick jiggly muffin top which was becoming a favourite feature of the two love birds as Lucielle expanded, particularly in this moment as it gave Alex something to grab onto as the couple climaxed in sync. <br>\r\nLucielle groaned in pleasure, lazily scooping the last remnants of cake into her mouth as the quacking waves of pleasure caused her to heavily roll onto her side causing a great jiggle to roll through her entire body. Belly still wobbling, the enormous pear shaped girl gently placed her chubby hands on the vast surface and coyly caressed the soft pale skin. Thick eyelashes starting to drop, Lucielle felt the mattress shift next to her and then felt a great force on her belly. Her eyes opened fast enough to see Alex straddling her girth but were not fast enough to see the hand sized muffin pressed into her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh uh, you know the rules\" Alex purred \"princesses sleep when they are full and you have a very long way to go yet\" he slapped a tree trunk thick thigh and wobbled a handful of belly fat to demonstrate his point.<br>\r\nWithout even a hint of resistance the heifer sized blonde opened her mouth, snatching a huge bite from the muffin by her lips.<br>\r\n\"That's my girl\" Alex purred again, leaning in closer to properly start their morning session.</span></div></div>",

She licked her lips longingly as she shifted her vast weight to a more upright seated position rather than the slouch she had adopted to nap in.<br>\r\nBreakfast wasn't entirely accurate at this point either as this was more like a second breakfast after an earlier session predominantly involving pastries. Lots and lots of dense buttery pastries that now sat heavily in Lucielle's belly. The hefty blonde shifted her immense weight, causing the two chairs holding her titanic arse to creak in protest, with arms stretched to the sky allowing her fat underarms to sag as she expelled her tiredness. A long lethargic yawn parted Lucielle's lips as Alex piled her up with plates of food, ready for the blonde behemoth to devour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting her biting bra strap, Lucielle leaned forward slightly, taking in a deep breath of the already accustomed smells bringing a smile to her shapely lips.<br>\r\n\"Mhmmm, thank you baby\" the blonde cooed with a slight glance to her boyfriend. The look was brief though as she began to tear into the food before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chorus of gentle moans and soft chewing noises, Alex looks on as Lucielle gorges herself for the second time before midday and felt nothing but love for the blonde heifer. At her rate of growth, Lucielle was struggling to keep her wardrobe ahead of her expanding figure so usually resorted to underwear at most. This particular morning though also featured a pair of leggings that, in the interest of sex appeal, were not to be removed until her humongous arse and tree trunk thighs ripped them clean off; a feat that was inching ever closer. As Lucielle cleared plates Alex replenished them, not wanting to let his princess go hungry any longer than necessary, something which was definitely not an issue or risk. Hands and face covered in grease, Lucielle's eyes were glazed with euphoria as she hungrily pulled more food into her waiting mouth. A particularly syrupy stack of pancakes was clumsily pulled too hard causing them to topple into Lucielle's ample bosom but, without skipping a beat, lowered her face to eat from her chest, double chin rounding out from the downward tilt. Hands free, bacon and eggs are crammed in alongside pancake and the rate of disappearing food increases greatly. In awe, Alex just watches as Lucielle's hair becomes dishevelled and sweat makes her forehead glisten.<br>\r\n\"Rub my *mphm* belly\" groaned the feasting blonde, not breaking eye contact with her target.<br>\r\nObediently Alex makes his way behind Lucielle, noticing that her arse cheeks are actually overhanging the two chairs on each side, and instinctively wraps his arms around her fattened waist feeling moistness from sweat between her rolls. As his fingers started to dig into her engorged belly Lucielle moaned erotically, pausing her indulgence for the first time, even if only for a split second, before her effort intensifies on return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the burgeoning blonde's belly fills and hardens, Lucielle finally begins to slow down with her lower belly roll pressing firmly against the table edge. Unwilling to stop but unable to continue, finally the pig out grinds to a halt fingers splayed wide on the smooth rounded surface of distended belly as the last morsels of gluttony are swallowed. Sighing heavily, Lucielle licks her lips whilst lazily tickling her stomach unable to move. Alex chuckles from the other side of the room before starting to tidy some plates, playfully prodding Lucielle as he passed. The engorged blonde belches loudly and uncomfortably but can't deny that she was turned on immensely in her engorged state.<br>\r\n\"So sugar, what do you want for lunch?\" inquired Alex.<br>\r\nUnable to turn to look at Alex, Lucielle finds herself caught between not wanting to eat again today and really wanting to carry on forever. As she opens her mouth to speak another huge belch tears through her lips and noticeably releases pressure around her stomach. Sighing gently she smiles to herself before speaking again.<br>\r\n\"Surprise me sweetie\" clutching her stomach lovingly \"just make it huge\"</span></div></div>",

Alex was already hard at work preparing lunch, so Lucielle lumbered off to the living room to continue her digestion. The bulbous blondes body jiggled with each heavy footfall as she squeezed down the narrowing hallway. Her tight leggings getting subjected to even more stress as things sloshed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in a state of overstuffed ness, the rest of the morning passed by in a hazy blur for Lucielle. On the couch with the tube on, she just waited for her next meal to be delivered. As Lucielle sat there she noticed just how wide her hips had become. She was so round, her hips looked to be trying to escape the rest of her body. Sitting there, she rubbed and squeezed her fleshy hips, appreciating their size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppreciating her own blubber she almost didn't realize that her lover Alex was making his way to her carrying quite a large tray. \"Who's ready for lunch?\" He chimed. Lucielle's belly clenched, having a mind of its own, and telling it's owner it was as hungry as she was, despite not being as fully digested as it could have been. \"I thought you might be in the mood for even more grilled and greasy meat, so I cooked you up some burgers and dogs for lunch.\" He said with a smile as he placed the meal down on one of the tray tables, moving the whole thing in front of his humongous girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combination of seeing his massively wide blonde girlfriend filling up his couch, and her mouth watering stare at the lunch before her, was enough to get Alex slightly aroused. Lucielle didn't miss a beat and grabbed the first burger, complete with two huge juicy patties, dripping in melted cheese, slathered in ketchup. The thing was so big she had a hard time fitting it all in her mouth. She decided to just attack it and try and get the biggest bite she could. Streaks of grease dribbled down her soft chin as she continued to munch away, the grease finding it's way into her canyon on cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurger by burger Lucielle cleared the tray in front of her, moaning and breathing heavily as she went. Until there were only pools of grease and bits of melted cheese left behind. Alex, the eager feeder, was prepared through, and now had a steamy pile of hot dogs to replace the tray of burgers. Half the hot dogs were covered with chili and melted cheese, the other half were sauteed peppers and onions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle was giddy with excitement. \"Alex honey, you are so good to me.\" She cooed. \"And this food,\" She couldn't even attempt to hold back the body quivering moan that followed. \"So fucking good. Even these buns are to die for. How do you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butter my dear, lots and lots of butter.\" He smiled while grabbing and jiggled a roll of her belly that was flowing into her lap on top of her wide thighs. Lucielle picked up the first hot dog, noticing just how big they were. Alex wasn't kidding when he said he wanted to load her up with meat, these foot long hot dogs would do the trick. She took as big of a bite as she could, savoring the mix of buttery roll with the sensation of the meat and other toppings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing her lover was watching her, Lucielle couldn't help but put on a show. She opened up her mouth, forming a perfect round opening to insert her long hot dog. She pushed the long object slowly in as far as her mouth would allow, before sensually biting down on it, taking half of what was left into her mouth. She knew this was turning Alex on, and she had to admit it was doing the same for herself. She briefly thought about asking Alex to take her while she finished her meal. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lost in her own arousal, Lucielle was oblivious as Alex left the room again and even more oblivious to his return with a large platter in both arms. She did however notice as the pathetic remnants of hotdogs were dragged out of reach to make room for said platter to be placed on the floor between her delicately painted toenails. Steaming still and expelling the warm smell of grease, Lucielle, almost trance like, slid off of the sofa onto her knees to get closer to the mountain of food before her. Easily equal in quantity to the last two servings, the platter was piled high with more burgers and hot dogs that were coated in melted cheese and chilli which had congealed into a rich greasy calorie bomb waiting to be deposited onto the blondes huge hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing like she hadn't eaten in months, Lucielle groped at her already bloated belly and chewed hungrily on her lip. She was incredibly hot right now and she couldn't quite differentiate if it was more due to Alex or the thought of continuing to gorge herself. Still on her knees, she was sat on her feet which she found surprisingly comfortable despite the immense weight, possibly due to the fact her massive rear nearly touched the floor still even when perched upon her feet. In awe of the ballooning blonde before him, Alex was unable to resist any longer and had to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swift movement with Lucielle still distracted in groping herself, Alex swiped a large burger from the pile and, with little grace in his action, crammed the juicy meat stack against Lucielle's lips forcing her to instinctively eat. Unexpectedly she let out a loud moan of enjoyment as the flavours hit again and her autopilot took over, at least for the first burger as Alex was determined to partake in this particular round. As Lucielle inhaled food with no hesitation, Alex continued to supply getting more aroused with every bite taken until...<br>\r\nHer swollen stomach lurched forward unexpectedly, apparently heavily laden after the days labours causing the naturally bottom heavy blonde to capsize forwards, forcing her into an all fours position. Her flabby arms instinctively caught her before she landed face first and the room rang with the loud slap of her belly against the floor but Lucielle was undeterred as she now moved to push her face into the tray of food only inches from her. Nose wrinkling with each tremendous bite and cheeks barely given chance to empty, Alex was surplus to requirement in the feeding department as his girlfriend went into overdrive and was left with nothing to do aside from watch her immense figure wobble and jiggle from her exertions. The stubborn leggings remained at this point but they surely shouldn't have long. Although Alex was starting to have other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily, Alex made his way around Lucielle squeezing her belly rolls and hips as he went before parking up behind her and coming face to face with her enormous arse. Waves of fat rippled through the immense curves of fat at the slightest movement which transferred into her thick thighs and, with a slight increase of force also jostled her engorged hips. Hands still greasy from his temporary involvement at the feeding end, Alex firmly dug his fingers into the waistband of the leggings and pulled them down to expose the creamy mountain of fat beneath.<br>\r\n\"Alex?\" Lucielle faintly called back, mouth full of food still<br>\r\nHe didn't answer, instead removing his own bottoms as he massaged Lucielle's hips.<br>\r\n\"Wha...what are you *mhmph* doing *chew* sweetie?\"<br>\r\n\"You just keep eating babe\" Alex replied, giving nothing away as he forcefully penetrated the blonde heifer between the thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle practically screamed in pleasure as she bucked like an incredibly fat horse before cramming her face back into the pile of food before her, hungrily tearing through meat and cheese as she moaned deeply. At her size, Lucielle had little energy to thrust back but Alex derived his pleasure in other ways. Each thrust caused the enormous cheeks of Lucielle's backside to jiggle against Alex's body as he lent against them to get a better hold of the vast array of rolls before him wobbling up his girlfriends sides. Her thick thighs also squeezed his manhood as he pounded into her, generating extra friction along with the obvious pressure from the juicy limbs squeezing together around him. It was also vaguely clear that they were sat higher than usual due to the swelling of Lucielle's belly causing her to sit prouder in her all fours position. The blubbery blondes hind quarters were decorated with greasy hand prints at this point as sweat started to pour off both of them and Lucielle was no longer able to hold herself fully up with her arms and was more propped by her chins rubbing against the previously stacked serving platter as she greedily chased the last morsels of food in desperation before...<br>\r\nLucielle screamed again in ecstasy as the couple orgasmed simultaneously with Alex left grunting deeply, propped against Lucielle's quivering arse and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two collapsed side by side on the floor unable to move and barely able to speak. The much larger blonde lazily swatted a hand over the tray she had eaten from, finding success a few more times, each one causing an aroused moan to escape her lips. Her sex drive was well and truly intertwined with food at this point.<br>\r\n\"Sweetie?\" cooed Lucielle, still eating whatever she could find<br>\r\n\"Yeah LuLu?\" Alex cooed back with the blondes very occasional pet name<br>\r\n\"You took the leggings off\" she muttered back, breathing heavily<br>\r\nAlex burst into laughter suddenly aware of his 'error'<br>\r\n\"Yep, I guess I did\" still stifling laughter \"I guess we'll just have to start again with a fresh pair then\"<br>\r\nLucille audibly rolled her eyes at that but deep down was actually incredibly turned on at the prospect of bursting out of even bigger clothes.<br>\r\nThis was the life, mused the enormous blonde as she rubbed her rounded belly, and it was barely past lunch</span></div></div>",

Lucielle yawned widely, stretching and rolled from her hip onto her back causing her immense bulk to wobble in huge waves of fat throughout her body. Her tortured bed shirt rose up her fat belly rolls as she stretched, settling only a few inches below her heaving bosom leaving the entirety of her pale belly to be exposed to the slight chill of the room. Lucielle smiled as the chill gently touched her and she lazily stroked her belly.<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is I can finally weight myself again?\" Inquired Lucielle<br>\r\nAlex crawled onto the bed and straddled his girlfriends immense lap, playfully groping handfuls of belly fat from the heavy hang currently maintaining her modesty.<br>\r\n\"You most certainly can\" answered Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, the couple were assembled in Alex's living room, scales on the floor and remnants of the previous nights pizza binge scattered about.<br>\r\n\"I'm nervous babe\" said Lucielle, stood teasing the edge of her shirt and tugging it down her bulging stomach to no avail. In a standing position she looked enormous from all angles. Her naturally enhanced bottom half, after a few more weeks of gorging and stuffing, now looked like she had been hooked up to a constantly flowing hose pipe which had left her with an arse, thighs and hips that never stopped jiggling once she started to move. Her belly and muffintop were hardly small, even in comparison to her pear shaped assets, adding to her enormous girth and gave her an impressive roundness to boot. When left to hang her belly was able to reach past the half way point of her thighs.<br>\r\n\"Don't be nervous Lu, even you have a long way to go before you hit the capacity of this set\" Alex winked and pinched the blondes bulging muffin top.<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a challenge to me\" retorted Lucielle, licking her lips \"you better have so much food waiting after this, I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh you can bet on that sweetie. Getting off those scales will be your last steps today\" promised Alex<br>\r\nLucielle bit her lip and moaned under her breath, that was so hot to hear.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm ready to go hun\" Lucielle breathed out heavily, closing her eyes and cradling a portion of her belly and, with minimal hesitation stepped forward onto the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeep<br>\r\nBeep<br>\r\nBeep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Lucielle...\" Alex's voice broke the silence after the beep and the suspense was killing the enormous blonde on the scale.<br>\r\n\"What? What does it say?\" Lucielle tried to read the display but her belly more than covered the display and impeded her vision. What she didn't know is that even if her belly wasn't in the way her boobs were now so large that they blocked her view some inches in front of her toes as well and not in a fat saggy kind of way as they had maintained a perky round shape.<br>\r\n\"Ok, this is pretty crazy but it says that you now weigh...617lbs\" answered Alex. It didn't take a genius to know how aroused he was at that moment in time.<br>\r\nYou also didn't need a genius to tell how aroused the huge blonde stood on the scales was either.<br>\r\n\"No way...\" Lucielle slowly stepped off the scales, thighs rubbing together smoothly as she did, still cradling rolls of fat in her arms in admiration.<br>\r\nCompletely aroused by herself, Lucielle bit her lip again as she fondled her own fat. Then, without hesitation and surprising speed for her size she marched towards Alex, not stopping as she bumped her belly into him and continued until he was pinned against the wall by her extreme bulk.<br>\r\nLucielle leaned as far forward as possible over her own girth and whispered to her pinned boyfriend, feeling him swelling against her belly as she spoke<br>\r\n\"Feed me Alex, feed me so fucking fat that I break these scales too\"<br>\r\nUnable to resist that command, Alex forced himself out from under Lucielle's weight and made for the kitchen to start making good on his promise<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'I'll be so much bigger then.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA platter of fresh cookies and brownies had been delivered, the chocolate delights disappearing quickly. 'Oh and then 800, 800 fucking pounds, I'll be absolutely huge.' Lucielle had moved her hand to her ample hips, squeezing them sensually finally giving her plush sides a slap as her got more frisky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh I just want more. More! More curves! More food! More FAT! Oh fuck I want to get so fat!' Lucielle was shoveling food into her mouth at a brisk pace, taking breaks to grope her enormous rolls with both hands. Lucielle was so into it now, she was incredibly turned on by her cascading rolls of fat and the growing feeling of fullness in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh god, what if I make it to 900 pounds! My ass would be so huge.' Lucielle pictured what it would be like to gain another almost 300 pounds. 'Oh I bet I'd barely be able to wobble around at that size. Oh my God, my fat ass trying to squeeze around here at 900 pounds. I bet I couldn't even find clothes if I was that incredibly fat. My huge fat naked body, quiverying and jiggling at any movement, how could I not be incredibly turned on constantly.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle was doing more groping at this point than eating, getting more turned on my her flabby fat rolls. Plates were piling up as Alex was not slowing down his onslaught of sugary treats. He noticed his fleshy girlfriend was enjoying herself more than his food, and in speaking up snapped her out of her day dreaming trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to get scale bursting fat letting all these treats go to waste my darling.\" Alex stood, towering over his beaches beauty. \"Here let me free up your hands so you can continue.\" He said as he grabbed a big handful of belly and started to squeeze. Lucielle took this opportunity to dive back into the sweets that lay before her, filling her mouth between every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that scale goes up to 1000 pounds.\" Alex teased as his hands wondered all over lucielle's body. \"Just imagine what you'll look like at 1000 pounds. You'll be bigger than anyone I've ever met. Your ass will get so wide you won't fit through be able to fit through norm sized doors. And this flabby belly will no doubt be touching your knees. Hopefully your jugs can stay in the race, and grow into even more rip mellons. I can just picture it now, only being able to fit into an over taxed pair of panties and brassiere. Just a mound of flesh on this couch, spreading far and wide. I can see it now, you beging me more food, your appitite so verocous you can't control yourself. You'll be the epitome of sex. 1000 pounds of pure sexiness. I won't be able to control myself around you. I'll need to stuff you and bed you at the same time. God you'll be the hottest fucking piece of ass I'll ever see. I just want you to get fatter and fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle had really picked up her pace with all of Alex's dirty talk.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a day like any other, Lucielle was on the couch stuffing her face. She had long decided to abandon her job to chase her dreams of getting as fat as possible. Alex being an incredulous feeder was happy to supply his girlfriend with enough food to keep her satisfied day in and day out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most other days Lucielle was chomping her way through a precooked meal that only needed to be reheated, but at 850 pounds Lucielle found it hard to get her arse off the couch to reheat anything. Alex tried to leave her enough food in the living room to keep her well fed until he got home from work. This sometimes led to some meals that were a little cold by the time she got to them in the late afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the case today as Lucielle made her way through a chilled pan of lasagna. She took momentary pauses to chug some soda, and went back to work right away. That was until Alex came home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle had just taken a big bite as her feeding lover came into the room. \"Aye sheetie!\" She said through her mouthful. She wore a giant smile as she knew once Alex came home the fun would really started. The house would be restocked, and the fun of having her lover stuff her to max capacity was what she lived for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jiggled endlessly in excitement as Alex made his way over to her. \"What sort of goodies did you bring me today?\" Lucielle asked, knowing Alex always liked to bring home a special treat to start the night off right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lu, we need to talk...\" Alex said in a dejected tone. This is not what she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong honey? Was there an issue at the bakery? Don't tell me they are closing? Their cream cheese icing is the best in town.\" Lucielle's mouth watered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't stop at the bakery. I unfortunately have even worse news.\" Alex was getting a bit choked up. \"You know I love you, and think you are incredibly beautiful, it's just I've met someone else, or should I say two something else's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha what?\" Lucielle was completely surprised. Alex had been so faithful to her. He had helped her double in size and helped her fully embrace her love of the fatty life. In turn she had given him uncountable nights in bed. It's not everyday Alex would be able to find someone as amazing as Lucielle, a complete fatass with an endless appitite willing to get fatter and fatter and allow her plush backside to get hit when ever he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds like that had changed. \"I happened across these two lovely ladies, twins actually. It seems they have been competing against each other to see who can gain more weight. They each fattened their selves up to 700 pounds, and at their current size they need a little up pushing the needle further. As long as I agree to help them both evenly they will let me sleep with either of them. The kicker is one of them is chest heavy and the other has a belly bigger than I've ever seen. Also they are independently wealthy so I can quit my job and just worry about stuffing them endlessly. They are the friskiest fatties I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle couldn't believe her ears. \"I'm sure you've noticed that I haven't been as attentive to you these past couple of weeks.\" Lucielle hadn't noticed, but she had been too busy stuffing her face to notice. Alex had left the house well stocked each day, Lucielle didn't notice that Alex had been getting home pretty late most nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex how could you do this to me? I thought you loved me?\" Lucielle was almost in tears. \"I'm the fattest girl you've ever seen, and I'm only getting fatter. I'm going to be your 1000 pound princess. Those skinny 700 pound twigs don't have anything on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually they started their race right after college when each of them got pretty chunky, and it's only been a couple of years and they have already gotten this fat. By the time they are your age they are sure to be immovable whales.\" Alex said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is to be come of me?\" Lucielle questioned.</span></div></div>",

This was proceeded with a loud groan, and the sound of heavy footsteps. Then all of a sudden Lucielle saw a giant pair of boobs charging at her until they colided with her less impressive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Lucielle could see the smiling face that lied behind the two huge boobs. \"You're here!\" The flabby girl cheered. \"Cassie! She's here!\" She hollered off in some direction before turning her attention back to Lucielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow you are amazing. 850 pounds right?\" But before Lucielle could break her silence, another set of loud foot falls we're heard, and another engorged body appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\" She could only assume this was Cassie. She sure was belly heavy, but right now they were much more curious about Lucielle. They both looked at her like they were inspecting a piece of art. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure is fat.\" The chesty sister said as they both started to get handy, focusing in on her large hips and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were lost in the amazement of her bulk, Lucielle decided to speak up. \"Well thank you for letting me come and stay with you. I know this is kinda a weird circumstance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh where are our manners. My name is Tess, and this is my twin sister Cassie. We are more than welcome to have you here.

Her foot steps could be felt as she slowly approached the sinful kitchen, the source of all her excess calories of late. Each heavy foot fall sent quakes through the bottom heavy gals numerous extra pounds and rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of a greasy breakfast attracted Lucielle like a crow to fresh roadkill. Knowing her place, she took a spot at the table, her underwear clad bum spreading nicely over two dining chairs. Sizzling meat was enough to fill her mouth with enough saliva to fill a pint glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure his lady love didn't go a moment longer than she needed to, Alex quickly slid a plate covered in a large ham and cheese omelette with a generous amount of bacon in front of the hungry woman.

But of course Alex was at the ready, this time with a plate piled high with spiced sausage patties and potatoes au gratin. Lucielle just licked her lips before signing her fork back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lardy lady munched away her mind drifted away from gorging for only a moment. She thought back to the industrial scale she just subjected herself to. She now had to be weighed like cattle on a platform in the middle of the living room. The thought alone made her loins tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to set a goal for herself. In all these weeks and months as her weight skyrocketed, she had never really had a goal in mind, she had just fallen in love with food, and eventually all the pounds that came with it. Now things were going to be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk honey, here's what I'm thinking, eight pounds in eight days, that's my goal. That would put me at 625 pounds.\u201d Lucielle said between mouth full of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pound a day?\u201d Alex scoffed as he approached her, sinking his hands into her growing belly, causing her to squeal. \u201cThat's a little conservative don't you think? With an appetite like yours, you have to be at least at a two pound per day pace. I mean look at these rolls?!\u201d He slapped her thick stomach rolls gently. \u201cBigger by the day I tell you. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Now eat up, there is plenty more to eat if you want to reach your goal.\u201d He said releasing her belly from his warm fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle's goal was relatively small, but it was a start. In the back of her head though she still wanted to one day break the limit of that scale, 1000 pounds, but that day would be far off. For now she just ate with continued gusto as Alex served her another plate.</span></div></div>",

As the clock hands past one another repetitively, Lucielle showed no signs of slowing down. Between plates Alex just naturally transitioned his wide girlfriend into the living room for lunch, where she continued to much away at anything in front of her. Bowls of Chili, saucers of stew, cups of seafood chowder, Lucielle was entranced by all the different flavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate and ate and ate, until she looked out the window and realized the sun was setting on this late fall day. She had eaten the entire day away. Lucielle was used to having a big appetite, but she had never lost a whole day to it before. Something about her new personal goal, her gluttonous desires, they all lead her to completely stuff herself for hours on end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was realizing the time, she also realized just how full she was. Her belly, which had become quite soft and malleable as she grew, was taut as a drum, as it was the first few weeks her and Alex had been together, or the first few times she had gone out with the girls at the office. Lucielle leaned back, attempting the rub her vast stomach with her stubby arms. From the position she had leaned into, her hand could not provide her very good coverage. Her flabby upper arms colliding with her bouncing bosom, restricted her range of motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when Alex came to bring her another meal, was she able to request a thorough belly rub from her lover, a rub down that put her in such a place of pleasure she never wanted the moment to end. This was complete bliss for Lucielle. She had eaten to her heart's content, and now had her sensual lover at her side to help ride through her engorged state. The only thing better were their antics in the bedroom, which just thinking about got the heifer a little frisky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex broke the silence as he kept rubbing. \u201cThink you are going to have room for dinner babe?\u201d He said softly as Lucielle\u2019s eyes had rolled into the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a moment to find herself before being able to respond. \u201cA growing girl like me can\u2019t afford to skip a meal, can she?\u201d She joked. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get incredibly fucking fat if I\u2019m not pushing myself until the very end of the day, right?\u201d She said, this time staring right into Alex\u2019s eyes, a determination in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn straight!\u201d He shouted, giving her packed belly a nice slap. They both sat there with lust in their eyes, until a moment later Alex went in and planted a firm kiss on the juicy lips of the big blonde.</span></div></div>",

It had been a few weeks since they had all been together since there was work being done at the office, a few enhancements were needed, especially in their department. Alice and Jessica had already returned to work a week earlier, but Lucielle\u2019s space had not been finished yet, and she was returning to work Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle had been spending all her time with Alex, and after a few weeks she was glad to be seeing her friends again. They had agreed to meet at one of the italian joints they had been to in the past. Lucielle was running late, which was unusual for her. But now due to her massive size, she was moving much slower these days. It also didn\u2019t help that she needed to dress decently in order to go out to a restaurant. Alex had helped her into what seemed like the world's largest pair of leggings. It took the pair close to a half hour to get them on. It didn\u2019t help that Alex kept getting distracted by each bulge and roll he found on her tremendously thick legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came find a top that fit. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be funny that the clothes don\u2019t fit.\u201d Lucielle said as she tried something on that was several sizes too small. \u201cLike we are typical office hotties in our form fitting business attire, even though each of us is a walking land whale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re allowed to have THAT much belly showing.\u201d He said grabbing the large exposed belly roll and giving it a shake, causing the shirt to only ride up more. Lucielle huffed, as she didn\u2019t want to fuss with a wardrobe, she just wanted to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they found a top that matched her leggings as well as fit most of her rolls underneath it. It left very little to the imagination, but it worked. At just about 620lbs, Lucielle was a sight to behold, Alex even swelled with pride as he stood there and admired his girlfriend. That was until she started pushing him out the door. \u201cCome on! Hurry up! We are late\u2026 and I\u2019m hunnnngry!\u201d She shouted as the two made their way to the car.</span></div></div>",

She was used to the tight cordors and restrictions of her own home, but being out and about was different. She felt so big now. She was quickly realizing just how slow she moved, and just how much she lacked the ability to be quick or nimble. Even when she was cresting 350lbs she could still react fast, or spin around promptly if needed, but now those tasks were much slower, as there was just so much bulk weighing her down with every movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hostess stand she stood, slightly winded from the walk in, but at least the cool night breeze kept any perspiration a bay. \u201cI\u2019m here for the table under Gorge.\u201d In her trimer days, she would just let herself into the restaurant and look for her friends, but now that seemed like way too much effort, she would much rather be directed straight there from the chubby teen hostess. She followed the girl, who wore a black top and black jeans. She noticed how her love handles popped up over the sides of her jeans, and thought about how many free meals from the kitchen it took to develop such nice curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucielle started to grow tired from all the walking she finally spotted her friends sitting at a table not too much further away. She raised an arm to wave at them, which she instantly regretted as she just needed to sit down at this point. Her large arm waved in the open air, as the loose flab that covered it swayed back and forth in the same rhythm. The girls seemed to notice her and smile, but it was the shock in their eyes that she noticed next.</span></div></div>",

This little break from work seems to have agreed with your waistline, or should I say your back side. God how much have you gained?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle took a moment to scan her two friends. In the past few weeks, with almost non stop feeding, Lucielle had bilmped up 50lbs. Her friends had remained at about status quo, allowing Lucielle\u2019s figure to become the dominant one in the group. \u201cGees you\u2019re right, look how scrawny you both look. What have you been eating, bird seed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve just been having straight lard 24/7.\u201d Lucielle mockingly laughed at Alice\u2019s mean joke. But she had to admit to herself that she had grown leaps and bounds past her friends not only over the past few weeks, but past few months, even since she met Alex. \u201cDon\u2019t worry though, no matter what I seem to do, I just keep getting closer to the 500 pound milestone.\u201d Alice lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, 500 isn\u2019t so bad Alice. I\u2019m up to 520 and still doing great.\u201d Jessica revealed, an uncommon occurrence for her, but she knew it would make her friend feel better to hear it. \u201cHow about you Lu? Do you even have a scale that can weigh you? I know I need to use the one at the corporate gym anytime I\u2019m brave enough to check my weight.\u201d Jess chuckled.</span></div></div>",

She was nearly 100 lbs heavier that Jess, no wonder the blonde bombshell was so winded. Lucielle felt a little awkward. She felt proud of her accomplishment, but wasn\u2019t sure if her friends would feel the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lucielle, Jess had always come off as an unabashed glutton. She was always feasting in the breakroom, and the first to suggest they all go out for a big lunch. Yet she didn\u2019t show the same signs Lucielle did when she started to get turned on by her large body, and the appetite that fueled it. And then there was Alice. Lucielle knew that Alice, try as she might, wanted to lose weight, but woefully lacked the willpower to put in even the least amount of effort needed to start. Which is why her waistline continued to expand further and further just as quickly as the rest of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow, what sort of super power does that boyfriend of yours have?\u201d Jessica asked, trying to fill in the pieces of this puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell first off, he\u2019s an amazing cook. He also likes to make sure I\u2019m not going hungry. I mean you guys know how he is, we\u2019ve been together for over six months already. It\u2019s a good thing he likes booty, because mine has only been growing since we got together.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle wanted to tell them both how she really felt, how she wanted to get even bigger, how she wanted to gain a pound a day, how she wanted to bust that damn heavy duty scale under a half ton of her own blubber. But she wasn\u2019t ready to share her dark secret, not yet. She wasn\u2019t even ready to admit it to herself. She felt dirty for even thinking it.

But might I recommend our fried mozzarella triangles, they are a local favorite.\u201d Shelly replied, with the canned answer she had given dozens of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle shrugged, well as best she could with her fat shoulders. \u201cI guess we'll just get one of everything to share then.\u201d This was something Shelly had not heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of everything?\u201d Shelly repeated, making sure she heard the hefty woman correctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, one of each of your appetizers. There are only what? Eight? Ten? I\u2019m sure that we can handle that. We probably would have needed our own samplers anyways.\u201d Lucielle paused before continuing. \u201cYou girls know what you want to eat for dinner?\u201d Lucielle turning her attention back to her office mates. \u201cOr should we have her put the apps in now so they come out sooner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we need a minute.\u201d Alice spoke up to the waitress, which was enough for her to flip her notepad close and walk into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle acting like nothing had happened, carried on her normal conversation. \u201cEither of you been here before? Do you know what\u2019s good?\u201d</span></div></div>",

They'll have the same as me please Shelly\" Lucielle glanced at her friends as she ordered, throwing them a smile as she did. Jeez, they're so small since we haven't been together, they mustn't be eating properly whilst they've been on time off from the office thought Lucielle<br>\r\nTime to change that.<br>\r\n\"Okie dokie\" said Shelly as she scribbled down the extra orders \"your starters will be out in a moment\"<br>\r\nThe young waitress turned on her heels and strode off, a slight bounce of weight to her bum was noticeable under her skirt as she took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your mind all?!\" Alice and Jessica blurred nearly in sync<br>\r\n\"What? You two looked hungry so I'm fixing that\" the bigger blonde smiled sweetly before tuning back to the dessert menu, chewing her lip as she muttered to herself about various options sounding nice.<br>\r\n\"Well, it was nice knowing you Al coz I'm pretty sure we're gonna pop tonight\" said Jess through gritted teeth.<br>\r\nAlice couldn't bring herself to say anything and fumbled under the table to loosen the tie on her stretchy bottoms as genuine fear washed over her face.<br>\r\nAs the pair of whales and the considerably more dominate blonde beluga waited for their starters, they chatted about work, how the new office spaces were, what these new 'enhancements' were...<br>\r\nOf course, Lucielle filled in with tales of gluttony as well which Jess and Alice listened with an almost sick fascination because, despite their on the surface resistance, they were mightily impressed at their girlfriends gain.<br>\r\nAs the time passed Jessica and Alice became more relaxed about their imminent food related explosions however far too soon there came the call...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarching slowly towards them came Shelly once again, arms laden with plates piled high with starters and, behind her, was the first chubbier waitress who's arms were also laden with plates.<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the wait\" huffed Shelly as she started to unload herself \"you guys ordered a lot so takes a while\"<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, it's totally worth the wait\" chirped Lucielle who was practically salivating already as the plates came down.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, totally...\" apprehensively declared Jess as the larger waitress swapped in to deposit her set of plates<br>\r\n\"Well I hope you enjoy and just let me know when you're ready for your mains\" said Shelly in her waitress routine before walking off to take another tables orders.<br>\r\nThe chubbier waitress placed her last plate and stood herself up, exposing a slither of chubby belly beneath her shirt which she swiftly tugged down, blushing slightly through her sweating cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" she murmured and scurried off back to work, but not before her name badge was glanced.<br>\r\nCarri was her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, this all looks so good!\" Squealed Lucielle, inhaling deeply with her fingers laced together.<br>\r\nShe wasn't wrong.<br>\r\nThe apprehensive girls opposite her were starting to get suckered in by the copious piles of starters, each looked capable of feeding a regular girl's appetite on its own.<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does...\" cooed Alice as she reached for a spicy meatball that was bigger than her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Ohh my favourites\" said an enthralled and dreamy Jess who had half a chicken wing in her mouth as she skewered a dripping garlic mushroom.<br>\r\nLucielle didn't have chance to speak as she dove straight in to the food, a mozzarella triangle in each hand with a mouth full of some type of dense potato salad expanding her cheeks before she swallowed and loaded up again. Despite her immediate gluttony, it did not fly her by that her office friends had stopped complaining and were stuffing their faces as hard as Lucielle herself was. This brought a small smile to her face, she couldn't have her best friends wasting away as she grew like she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time ticked by, the piles of food started to deplete and the girls started to get more and more exposed with every mouthful. As the most decent of the three, Jess was just stretching her dress more by the second and, even with just starters, it was already threatening skin tight over her bulbous belly with her second roll forming a clear fabric indentation around her belly button. As the smallest of the group Alice was the most bloated at this point, not that it was slowing her down in the slightest. As she slid a slice of garlic bread down through her lips, Alice idly rubbed her expanding stomach, a thick roll hanging out from under her shirt. Alice was also the recipient of first clothing fatality, her stretchy bottoms had split around a thigh not long in but she was simply greateful for the breathing space at this point. And then there was Lucielle who, at this particular moment, was lent back in her chairs with a deep dish of soup to her lips slowly pouring it down her throat. Her current position allowed for her belly to be exposed to the air to her belly button as her new top was just too small even when she was empty. In the back her bloated hips bulged up and out making her appear wider than usual and they slowly jiggled with each chug of soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, the starters were gone and all that remained were three happy girls all rearing to go for their main courses.<br>\r\n\"I am so hungry now!\" declared Jess now, happily patting her bloated belly leaning back in her chair slightly as she did<br>\r\n\"Me *mmphm* too!\" shouted Alice through a mouthful of fried cheese, her last from the starters, as she swallowed and burped softly with a little giggle.<br>\r\nTheir engorged substitute matriarch sat across from them with a smile on her face, cradling her largely unexpanded stomach feeling pleased with herself for pushing her friends to actually indulge.<br>\r\n\"See how easy it would be to get this fat when you have that much fun?\" Lucielle interjected with a wry smile.<br>\r\nThe two smaller woman looked hungrily at the blonde trying to be shocked but too overcome with hunger to verbalise a protest as their stomachs rumbled and they simply nodded their coy agreement of unwillingness.<br>\r\n\"Wow, looks like you guys had fun\" observed Shelly who had now returned to clear their plates.<br>\r\n\"We certainly did\" cried Lucielle with glee, slapping her belly for effect \"and now we're definitely ready for our mains if you don't mind\" the huge blonde requested.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, I'll be right back with those\" said Shelly with a smile, removing the empty plates on her own this time as they stacked without their contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the life ladies\" whispered Lucielle as she glances a trio of waitresses heaving two deep plates each towards their table \"we're gonna eat well tonight\" mused the blonde with a Cheshire Cat grin as her friends nonchalantly rubbed their bloated bodies and licked their lips in anticipation as the new approaching smells hit their noses.</span></div></div>",

Her pose left her with boobs pressed against the table, cleavage nearly tumbling out of her neck and the bottom of her dress pulled so tight round her hips it looked fit to burst.<br>\r\n\"Just keep eating ladies, we've got all night\" called Lucielle through mouthfuls of pasta and chicken, sauce also running out from the corner of her mouth and down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungry as they were, their servers had barely cleared the table before the feasting began again, and boy did it go again. Onlookers would never believe that Jess and Alice had been apprehensive of this meal at first with their gusto but it was clear to them that apprehension had long been put to one side as the smaller girls tore into their mains like nobody's business. Lucielle was going about it at her usual pace which wasn't slow but she was in part distracted by her friends going to fat town across from her. It was just nice to see her friends indulging so much, after all, Lucielle used to be the smallest by quite a margin and now she outweighed them both considerably, even the immense Jessica. It was turning her on a little bit but she was also excited at the thought of the three of them ballooning together, particularly once she returned to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright with your meals?\" Shelly again<br>\r\nLucille swallowed \"yes thank you honey\" she said with a sauce covered smile<br>\r\n\"Good, let me know if you need anything else\" offered the petite waitress, about to turn on her heels again but...<br>\r\n\"More!\" came the shout from the other side of the table.<br>\r\nUnexpectedly Jess was asking for more and, still struggling to swallow her mouthful, Alice was nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n\"Ohh oh, ok\" stammered Shelly, whipping out her notebook and jotting the demand down.<br>\r\n\"Better make that three seeetie\" cooed Lucielle feeling a little pang of pride for the smaller girls at this point.<br>\r\n\"Coming right up\" smiled the waitress, taking off up the restaurant again to place their order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs three forks clattered down on empty plates, a fresh one piled higher than the previous two was placed before each huge office worker. Licking lips with desperate eyes, none hung around before diving in once again to continue the gluttonous feast of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point each girl was starting to look different from when she arrived also.<br>\r\nJess now had her bloated belly pressed firmly against the table edge, unable to bend over as fully as she had previously due to the mass of food sat in her belly. The effects on her dress were also a sight to behold as it was pulled skin tight around her enormous bulk looking fit to burst in multiple different places. The tautness had also eliminated the earlier indent around her middle which was now perfectly rounded out.<br>\r\nAlice at this stage was near naked from her bottom half down as her thighs had all but shredded her poor stretchy bottoms. Now with cellulite dappled thighs spreading wide on her chair with her bloated belly sat heavily on her thighs from above, the smallest of the three girls was only small in a relative sense as she looked fit to be rolled out of there.<br>\r\nAnd then there was the queen bee of fat. Shovelling pasta into her mouth for all she was worth, even Lucielle with her immense capacity was starting to food baby up at this stage and loving every second of it as she fattened and widened by the second, her shirt struggling to contain less and less of her as she did.<br>\r\n And then, as quick as it started...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urge, I'm full...\" groaned Alice, clutching her spherical belly in dull pain<br>\r\n\"You did good hun\" groaned Lucielle, stifling burps between words<br>\r\n\"Than...\" started Alice<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRPPPPPPP!\" a huge burp tore through Jess's lips as she lay back, enormous belly pushing her thighs apart and hanging from under her dress in her reclined position<br>\r\n\"Scuse you piggy\" teased Lucielle with a giggle, lightly poking the bloated middleweight in her exposed belly which pushes another huge burp out.<br>\r\n\"Ice cream\" grumbled Jess, massaging her surprisingly still soft skin in her mild food coma state<br>\r\n\"You're still hungry?\" cried Alice, blissfully ignorant of her own stomach growling despite it's size.<br>\r\n\"Ice cream\" reaffirmed Jess, eyes flickering and chewing her lip hungrily.<br>\r\nLucille had created a pair of monsters that night and she liked it.<br>\r\n\"Ok well where we gonna go for ice cream?\" asked the titanic blonde, also idly rubbing her exposed belly as she asked<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls giggled like on a drunken night out for much thinner counterparts and made for the door with Lucielle peeling off to pay for the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her immense hips swaying between tables, the 600lb blonde slowly made her way to Shelly, their server, and caught her attention with a small wave of her arm.<br>\r\n\"Oh hi\" stammered the petite waitress in awe of the woman in front of her \"I would have taken payment at the table if you wanted\"<br>\r\n\"Oh not to worry, we're heading out for ice cream now anyway\" smiled Lucielle as she counted the bill out of her purse<br>\r\n\"Wow, dessert after all that?\" Shelly outburst before catching herself.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm so sorry...\" turning bright red and averting her gaze faster than Lucielle could eat a buffet plate.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry yourself, I know I'm a big girl\" Lucielle said warmly, winking at the embarrassed server with a handful of belly fat oozing between her fingers.<br>\r\n\"This should cover it, and a decent tip as well for all your help\" Lucielle offered the wad in her other hand.<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" murmured the still coy Shelly \"you're too kind\"<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it, maybe treat yourself to something to eat whilst you're at it\" called Lucielle over her shoulder as she headed for the door to catch up her friends.<br>\r\nShelly breathed for the first time since her stupid comment once the huge woman had squeezed herself out of the restaurant's apparently too narrow door. Shaking her head at herself, the young girl counted money into the till as a small card slipped out from between them onto the floor. She bent over to grab it, her backside feeling a little tight in her skirt as she did, and glanced over the elegant business card. \"Gordge Inc\"<br>\r\nShelly had heard of the company but nothing about it. She shrugged, sliding the card into her skirt to keep safe. The staff seemed to enjoy themselves if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ladies, what are we having?\" Lucielle called, belly already calling out to be fed again<br>\r\nJess and Alice were stood in awe in front of a row of cabinets of ice creams in all flavours imaginable.<br>\r\nFruit flavours, ice creams with sweets sticking out of them, half a dozen different chocolate flavours, mountains of toppings and different sizes of cones and bowls were on show for any lucky patrons to indulge in. The entire shop also had a slight chill to it due to the volume of ice cream within.<br>\r\n\"We can't decide Lu, there's just too many choices...\" cooed Alice, practically drooling over a particularly decadent triple chocolate flavour before her. Jess wasn't much better as her entire contribution was audibly moaning whilst chewing her bottom lip.<br>\r\n\"Ok, lets sort this out then\" mused Lucielle \"hello? Hello? He...yes, hi sweetie\"<br>\r\nShe'd managed to catch the attention of one of the servers<br>\r\n\"Hi there, how may I help you tonight?\" rattled off the average heighted guy who didn't seem all that aware of the current patrons before him<br>\r\n\"First hun, if the three of us claimed a member of staff to dote on us til we drop would you still have enough staff for anybody else who might come in?\"<br>\r\nThe strange request piqued the guys interest and he looked up at the three girls before him, suddenly aware of the gravity of the next order.<br>\r\n\"Erm...I think we could manage if we did that...\" the poor guy didn't know what to do with thighs shredded trousers, belly fit to burst and hips hips hips that stood before him but he figured the safest bet was to let them eat what they wanted, lest it be him.<br>\r\n\"Great! We'll get seated and look forward to taste your ice cream!\" cooed the ever enthusiastic Lucielle who turned tail, bumped her colossal arse against one of the cabinets and dragged Alice and Jess to a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up girls!\" declared Lucielle as their first bowls were placed before them. It appeared the guy behind the counter had some sense as they had all received containers towards the larger end of the available spectrum.<br>\r\nAlice didn't need a starting flag as she was already diving in before Lucielle had finished talking. Jess needed even less time and was already stuffing herself with the cold sweet, that girl really wanted ice cream that night. Lucielle joined her friends in indulging, taking mouthfuls of strawberry, cookies and cream and an unexpected salted caramel flavour between them whilst watching the other two pig out. She was so pleased to be sharing the stuffing experience she had indulged in for the past weeks with her friends, she also couldn't help but imagine where they would all be in a few more weeks; likely much fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess finished her bowl first and was instantly rewarded with a fresh one which seemed to be mostly chocolate. Eyes wide, Jess scooped up the bowl and placed it to her lips, tipping her head back and sucking in the brown scoops slowly as they started to melt from her exhaled warmth. She had always been a notorious chocoholic which apparently had not subsided. Alice and Lucielle finished quite close together and were given similar chocolate filled bowls which they rolled straight into, albeit not as fast as their colleague who was nearly done with her second. Lucielle and Alice exchanged a look between mouthfuls and shrugged, opting to let their friend enjoy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoyment was definitely the tone here as Jess gained a third bowl and then a fourth bowl and then...<br>\r\n\"Are you ladies finished there?\" called a voice from the counter.<br>\r\n\"I think *hmpgh* so\" groaned Lucielle, burping into a clenched fist \"you full Al?\"<br>\r\nAlice was looking worse for wear at this point. Flushed red and cradling a throbbing belly, Alice nodded into her double chin unable to look at the pile of three empty bowls in front of her.<br>\r\n\"Well I'm *BUUURP* done too\" uttered Lucielle between heavy breaths, drumming her bloated belly and massaging an engorged hip in clear view of Alice's matching three bowls sat within a larger vessel licked clean \"Jess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was a different kettle of fish at this point.<br>\r\nBy special request Jess was currently emptying the tin formerly filled with triple chocolate that had been removed from the serving counter. Having inhaled four bowls the size of one of Alice's and a bowl larger than Lucielle's largest, the staff had conceded to allow the ice cream engorged woman to empty her favourite flavour for the night.<br>\r\n\"She's done\" bluntly declared Lucielle leaning back heavily in her seat, still playing with her taut stomach which no longer abided by her new top. In the silence she became aware that her leggings had actually popped a seam around her left hip leaving a patch of skin bare and trying to bulge out of their confines. Alex would be proud, she smiled.<br>\r\nJess finally came up for air as the empty tin slid off her rounded thighs and lent back, the girl really could eat when she tried. She was sporting an enormous food baby to boot as well which only made her enormous belly look even bigger. The extensive bloating had pulled her dress so tight at this point that it no longer touched her thighs and had no flow to it, serving only as a blue second skin to the engorged office worker.<br>\r\n\"That was so good...\" murmured the last to finish.<br>\r\n\"Yes it was Jessy\" smiled Lucielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good to be back with the girls, especially with work starting again soon for Lucielle which she was very excited for now. The three bloated heifers just had to find a way home and it was highly unlikely a single taxi could take their combined weight at this point...</span></div></div>",

Part of the new renovations was a new corporate attire, so Gordge had reached out to Lucielle before her return to get her size.

Hearing her measurements be three or four times the average person so ingrained just how much of a fat ass she really had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle showed up to Gordge in her well fitting business suit, that draped over her curves in an alluring fashion. Walking in the front door Lucielle could already see one of the new changes. The elevators were smack right there. Usually Lucielle had to walk through the front lobby and around the corner to get to the elevator, and after the short walk from her car she was usually quite tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle hopped in an elevator, and took a seat on one of the new benches. The extra deep benches around the perimeter of the elevator looked like they could fit four women Lucille's size comfortably.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*PING!*<br>\r\nThe lift doors slid open before Lucielle to reveal a smartly designed front desk area sporting a fancy sign displaying the Gordge Inc name hung behind the reception desk.<br>\r\nLucielle lumbered her way forward, her new suit groaning slightly due to its newness not allowing the same stretch that Lucielle's usual attire granted her. As her heavy footfalls pounded on the polished floor the familiar brunette sat behind the desk lifted her head to observe the new arrival to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley tentatively licked her full ruby lips to inhale the sugar that had collected there before wiping her hands together over the box of doughnuts before her to cleanse the sweet powder from her thin fingers. When she joined Gordge, Ashley had been a bit different from the rest of the staff there. She had very little office experience before starting there meaning she required a lot of training, not that anybody minded as Ashley proved to be a lovely girl, but soon got into the swing of her new position and now oversaw a good chunk of the staff, something that had probably been taken into consideration when appointing her to this particular floor. Stranger than her appointment despite a lack of experience was that, after many MANY months of working for Gordge, Ashley had remained beautifully thin. Prior to her appointment, Ashley had worked as a personal trainer but, following an unexpected accident at work, had to quit that job and desperately stumbled across her current position. Many of her colleagues had expected her to balloon almost instantly with endless temptation in the office and the inevitable crash of her metabolism as she stopped exercising daily, however, much to their surprise, Ashley remained as svelte as ever. If Lucielle remembered rightly, and assuming no drastic changes had occurred in her absence, Ashley was the holder of the prestigious title of 'lightest member of staff'. This of course was a made up title, but one that Ashley and her friends embraced equally in good jest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucielle! I didn't know you were back today!\" cried out the brunette receptionist with a huge grin. It was fair to say, as far as Ashley's face was concerned, her 'fattest' feature was her shapely plump lips which were often coloured in bright alluring colours to accent their size. She was otherwise thin of face, not to the point of appearing gaunt, but she simply did not retain fat on her face.<br>\r\n\"Heya Ash, it's so good to be back finally. I've missed this place.\" Lucielle smiled back as she leaned against Ashley's desk<br>\r\n\"Well a lot has changed round here, but you'll find all that out in your new orientation. We've all had to have one but they put on a good spread for it so I'm sure you'll be fine\" teased Ashley, brushing a curl of hair from her face as she did and playfully batted her eyes oh so innocently.<br>\r\n\"Thank god because I am starving!\" exclaimed the immense blonde as she eyed the box of doughnuts next to her friend and leant to grab one.<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\" cried Ashley with a feign of upset as she lightly slapped Lucielle's wrist \"these are mine, I've only had one box today!\" As she spoke, Ashley snatched a fresh doughnut and took a large bite.<br>\r\nThis knocked Lucielle back slightly, Ashley had eaten a dozen doughnuts that morning already? AND she was starting a second box?<br>\r\nRealising Lucielle's shock, Ashley laughed, cramming the last of her doughnut away and swallowing.<br>\r\n\"Told you you'd missed a lot\" and with that Ashley rose from her seat, knocking the 600lb blonde back even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough worthy of her face still, thin was not an appropriate description of the rest of her body. Wrapped in a tailored grey dress from the same service as Lucielle's suit, Ashley's figure and blown up. The brunette had swelled in all directions with hips, belly and a bulging rack building up a curvaceous hourglass figure that was straining her dress in all angles. Ashley spun in the spot to display her widened bum along with the thickness of her thighs which rubbed together slightly. Even her arms had thickened slightly giving her the most modest bingo wings to ever grace a woman's arms. Upon facing her colleague again, Ashley's belly sashayed as one mass after her feet stopped moving in a way that only a solid food baby could. Lucielle was impressed.<br>\r\n\"I'm finally getting fat!\" shrieked the much smaller but still plump brunette as she placed her hands on her swelled hips, giving Lucielle an unexpected glance of a new engagement ring adorning the receptionists left hand.<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know about FAT but it is about time\" teased Lucielle with a wink.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm 176lbs now I'll have you know\" huffed Ashley, pretending to sulk but struggling to contain her smile \"that's like nearly 60lbs up since you last saw me\"<br>\r\n\"Well you come talk to me when you're crossing 600 sweetie\" teased Lucielle again as she rubbed her belly through her suit jacket.<br>\r\nStill pretending to sulk Ashley sat back down and started on another doughnut<br>\r\n\"Anyway...\" said Ashley through a mouthful of dough \"lets see where you need to be first...\"</span></div></div>",

She waddled, as instructed, heaving one massive thigh in front of the other past several sets of doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle immediately noticed that every set of doors she past was just that, a set.

The blonde heifer was loyal to a fault when it came to significant others but Beatrice certainly could turn a girl were she single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith voluminous ginger locks pouring around her sculpted high cheek bones and resting softly on her shoulders, Beatrice stood a towering 5\u201d10 behind her desk without taking into consideration her stylish heels which only made her even taller.<br>\r\nIn stark contrast to all at Gordge, her height was her most dominant proportion as the rest of her body was thin to an almost obnoxious level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Lucielle, right?\u201d asked Beatrice again, standing straight exhibiting her tightly cut waist sandwiched between a modest but still noticeable combination of hips and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Miss, yes, I\u2019m Lucielle\u201d pushed out the blonde through her clouded mind as she wobbled behind one of the chairs, puffing softly with a slight flush coating her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice smirked, her ruby lips parting across pristine teeth as an almost hypnotic chuckle followed the lip movement.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t call me Miss, I\u2019m nowhere near old enough for that kind of title\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I...\u201d started Lucielle, still softly panting to catch her breath from the walk and that moment of clapping her eyes on her new HR rep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be starving, take a seat and I\u2019ll see what I have for you\u201d purred Beatrice as she practically dragged Lucielle into a seat before sauntering off to one side and busied herself with a sideboard that Lucielle hadn\u2019t noticed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe much larger blonde watched Beatrice as she worked, noticing the redhead\u2019s pert backside making a shape for itself in her tight tailored skirt despite its un-Gordge like size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to make this brief Lucielle because I am only here for one thing\u201d spoke Beatrice, still working away to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sounded ominous.<br>\r\nLucielle had worked long enough to know that new people in roles of responsibility wanting to do \u2018one thing\u2019 was usually trouble at the best of times.<br>\r\nLucielle\u2019s concerns, however, did not stop Beatrice\u2019s speech continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am here to make everybody\u2019s life here at Gordge as easy and pleasant as is physically possible\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis felt a lot like a trap and Lucielle had questions, but before she could get any of them out Beatrice delicately placed a silver tray on the desk loaded with pastries and cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like you to tuck in and let me know what I can do to make things better for you\u201d<br>\r\nBeatrice smiled as she balanced herself on the edge of her desk, next to Lucielle\u2019s chair, and watched the blonde as she transitioned from an audible belly rumble to reaching for something to eat to moaning with cream splattered across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, erm, I guess...oh my god, this is so good!\u201d moaned Lucielle, completely losing track of the conversation as flakes of pastry and great dollops of cream filled her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice laughed again as she rounded her desk and placed herself down into her ridiculously oversized chair, naturally meant for a more typical manger of Gordge, and clicked repeatedly at her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about, to start with, I just put you down for regular deliveries of food directly to your office and we can tailor things from there?\u201d chirped Beatrice with a warm smile and shining, happy blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle intended to contemplate the situation but subconsciously moaned instead before proceeding with her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes\u201d smirked Beatrice as she watched Lucielle devour food by the fistful \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you have to be restrained either, enjoy yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment caught Lucielle slightly, not realising she was holding back until it was mentioned.<br>\r\nNot one to look a gift horse in the mouth though, Lucielle grabbed the tray and kicked up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to break it to you Lucielle, but I\u2019m gonna have to hit the canteen up if you want anything else, you\u2019ve cleared me out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm, I don\u2019t...urrrp...\u201d groaned Lucielle as she licked her lips hungrily, tentatively groping at her belly as it ballooned out of the bottom of her shirt with her jacket barely reaching around her hips as it lay trapped beneath her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, don\u2019t worry\u201d cooed Beatrice, looking even more the opposite of her blonde colleague having discarded her own tailored jacket leaving her sculpted figure clad in just a shirt tucked into her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmmm\u201d mused Lucielle as she mindlessly pawed at her stuffed gut whilst her hunger still bubbled under the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, come on Lucielle, as your HR rep I\u2019m going to have to sort that for you\u201d purred Beatrice, positioning herself in front of the colossal blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d murmured Lucielle, considering the implications at play here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d smiled the redhead as she forcefully pressed her thin fingers against the softened mass of belly flab hanging out of Lucielle\u2019s shirt \u201cyou\u2019re not the only girl in the office who\u2019s belly I\u2019ve had to rub since getting here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I...burURRRP...mhmph...urgh, that\u2019s good\u201d groaned Lucielle as Beatrice tended to her stomach ache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow the only question is, do you want this adding to your file?\u201d asked Beatrice, genuinely for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle thought for a moment as she continued to chain burp as the pressure released from her overfilled belly at the redhead\u2019s delicate yet forceful touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle bi...URRP!\u201d belched Lucielle, tasting sugar on her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can add it and we can always be taken off or amended at a later date if you wish\u201d replied Beatrice, sensing Lucielle\u2019s apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm, sounds good\u201d murmured Lucielle as she settled into her seat, far more contented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d cheered Beatrice, hands on slender hips as she took to her own chair again \u201cnow, I don\u2019t have any other meetings today so you\u2019re welcome to stay if you\u2019d like\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle bit her lip as she considered the prospect of that, considering how the meeting had gone so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I go get my cupboards resupplied and you can decide from there?\u201d suggested Beatrice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle could only nod, her chins creasing as she did, with a small smile as the skinny redhead took off from her office in search of replenishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice was nothing like any Human Resources rep Lucielle had EVER come across before.</span></div></div>",

She seemed normal at first, but it wasn't long before she started making some unusual changes. It was extremely against the rules to eat during your shift if not on break, but she had that lifted almost immediately. It didn't change much, but then we started stocking the server stands with snacks, and everyone up front got their own refillable soda cup. It started slowly, but I soon noticed all their front end staff had put on a few pounds, especially the girls. Beatrice then put in a system to make sure everyone got a take home meal at the end of their shift, and so on and so forth. She pretty much wanted everyone there to get as fat as possible. It was all under the guise of employee satisfaction, but I heard from one of the older line cooks the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle was hanging on every word as she polished off every crumb from her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said HR got compensated for how much work load they had, and overweight employees generated a lot of paperwork. Reinforced chairs, additional health insurance screening, and the creme of the crop, disability. He told me disability was the end goal for greedy succubus' like her. It meant a ton of on going paperwork, and also that someone new would have to be hired to start the whole cycle over with again. The girls I worked with ballooned in the year I worked with her, and I remember one in particular that got so fat she could barely do her job. That was about the time I found a better cooking job. I'm guessing despite her success it was hard to keep up all of her ploys when you had a staff eating themselves into obesity and barely able to work. But Gordge, Gordge is the perfect place to employ her plan. They have even more resources to keep people working later into obesity, but I bet after a short while she'll have everyone there eating their way into the disability pool.\"</span></div></div>",

The entire office has been outfitted to accommodate any person of any size. Gordge does not want to seem like a company that discriminates based on someone's size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn these danishes are good!' Lucielle thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only are the furnishing upgraded, but we've made some other adjustments too in an attempt to make a happier work place for all. I think those would best be shown in your new office. If you would please join me, I'll show you the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle grabbed a couple last danishes for the road. Distracted by food, she didn't notice Beatrice now standing. Standing up, Lucielle could see the rest of her physique. </span></div></div>",

The word 'breakfast' alone was enough to entice Lucielle into following after the receptionist on her way to her first official work meeting upon returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gentle tap on a plain solid wood door emblazoned with a name plate 'Jenna', Ashley called out to her superior.<br>\r\n\"Jenna, Lucielle has arrived now\" reported the brunette through the door.<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" called the familiar sound of Jenna's authoritative voice cutting through the silence in its usual delicate manner \"come in, come in, I was about to start breakfast\"<br>\r\nAshley rolled her eyes playfully as she looked at Lucielle \"told you you'd make it in time\" teased the smaller woman as she pushed against the door, revealing the luxury office behind.<br>\r\nLucielle had never seen anything quite like it before, the plain decor proved elegant in its simplicity and also oddly welcoming for a place of business. Sparsely furnished, there was only a sizeable desk holding a dual screened computer along with some additional general office supplies along with a couple of chairs for any visiting staff or clients.<br>\r\nAnd, of course, behind the desk was an executive leather seat that could only be for the boss of such an establishment. This wasn't quite like any regular office chair, however, as it was frankly enormous. As far as size was concerned though, the chair was not the only large asset in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good morning ladies\" called Jenna as she turned the chair around \"it's so good to see you returning to work Lucielle, please take a seat both of you\"<br>\r\nLucielle in particular wished she'd got seated slightly sooner as she caught her first glimpse of her boss.<br>\r\nJenna had always been...big. By the time she was promoted to her senior position she was already cresting 500lbs, most of which dominating her immense belly, but, for a woman of her size, no part of her impressive frame could be called small.<br>\r\nThat was when she was first promoted though, now Jenna was...a little bit bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dominantly belly, Jenna was currently sat with a very ill fitting shirt covering her ample chest and little else of its projected covering. Inch after inch after inch of pillowy belly swelled out from under her shirt into a huge mass pooled on her thighs, covering them nearly to her knees and forming huge bulging rolls over her hips. Even given the size of her chair, Jenna's hips were starting to pour over the leather arms which only enhanced her girth. Although not entirely clear from her seated position, it seemed likely she was wearing very little on her bottom half, likely a necessity due to her size, but Lucielle was a well indoctrinated sympathiser when it came to dressing for comfort when a lady of largeness.<br>\r\nBy Lucielle's estimations Jenna must be sat well over 700lbs at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad to see you both, and so pleased you could join me for breakfast\" cooed Jenna, supported by the sound of her door swinging open again and the sound of squeaking trolley wheels came through.<br>\r\nAshley eagerly looked over her shoulder at the mountains of breakfast pastries piled up but Lucielle's nose told her what was there without having to even turn her head. The smells did entice her and brought a smile to her lips.<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you to your meeting now\" announced Ashley, going to stand from her seat.<br>\r\n\"Oh please stay, this actually involves you too sweetie\" said Jenna, her belly audibly growling as the pastries came into arms reach.<br>\r\nTaken aback, Ashley lowered herself down again and placed her hands on her lap whilst giving sidewards glances to the stacks of doughnut boxes piled to her right.<br>\r\n\"Besides, I know how fond of doughnuts you are Ashley\" teased Jenna, winking at the relatively svelte brunette sat opposite her with a casual hand gesture offering her permission to eat.<br>\r\nAshley eagerly threw herself at a box and had inhaled half a doughy treat before Lucielle could engage with her own offerings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being in a meeting, the three girls spent the first hour gorging on pastries, only punctuating their eating with smatterings of small talk.<br>\r\n\"Anyway\" started Jenna through a mouthful of buttery croissant, brushing crumbs off her shirt \"now that we have properly started the day we can look at why I called you both here\"<br>\r\nLucielle was aware of Jenna talking but continued eating as she listened. As a much more practiced fatty compared to Ashley, Lucielle's capacity allowed her to still be eating whilst Ashley on the other hand was some what halted. The receptionist had already been sporting a food baby when Lucielle had come in that morning and, mostly due to a ravenous hunger and blind enthusiasm, that had only grown. Her dress was stretched so tightly over her rounded belly it looked fit to burst clean in two across the beach ball curve pressing against it from between the brunettes curvy hips. At this particularly moment she was actually mildly comatose and moaning softly in a light sleep whilst cradling said belly.<br>\r\n\"How about just you and I talk then Lu?\" cooed Jenna as she shifted her weight slightly, eliciting a large groan from her chair.<br>\r\n\"I think that would be best\" giggled the blonde, a framed photo catching her eye on Jenna's desk.<br>\r\n\"Wow, is that you and Bo?\" Inquired Lucielle. She had spent some time outside of work with Jenna and her girlfriend and had always got on well with them both.<br>\r\nJenna chortled softly \"oh yeah, that was taken a couple of weeks back. You should come round for dinner some time and bring...Alex wasn't it?\" Lucielle nodded in acknowledgment, smiling softly that Jenna had remembered her boyfriend. It would be nice to get out and she figured if nothing else Alex would probably get on well with Bo. She'd always given off major feeder vibes in the past so they would have something to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what we've been building up to whilst you've been away is an internship scheme to allow young people to come into our fold and learn some business skills under our tutelage\" explained Jenna, slowly nibbling a chocolate danish that was nearly as big as her head.<br>\r\nLucielle listened intently from across the desk, leaning back into her chair as she pulled her shirt out from inside her skirt to expose her belly and slowly rubbed her swollen sides with both hands.<br>\r\n\"And the reason I wanted to talk to you and Ashley is because you have been nominated to spearhead the program\"<br>\r\nLucielle stopped in her tracks, looking squarely at Jenna as she spoke.<br>\r\n\"You want me to run an intern program?\" Lucielle asked in order to clarify what she thought she had just heard.<br>\r\n\"Yes, you and Ashley\" nodded Jenna in confirmation. The heavy laden brunette sat next to Lucielle groaned softly at subconsciously hearing her name and shifted slightly in her chair.<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you say Lu?\" asked Jenna, leaning into her desk causing a roll of fat to softly slap against the hard wood in front of her.<br>\r\n\"That sounds great Jen! I'm so flattered you want me to be a part of it\" squealed the blonde, nearly throwing herself upright with her excitement<br>\r\n\"Well you've always worked hard for us and uphold the values we have at Gordge so you seemed like the obvious choice to inspire some young people in business\" continued Jenna, smiling warmly at Lucielle's acceptance.<br>\r\nBubbling with excitement, Lucielle started to imagine the new role she had been offered. It seemed like a great opportunity and she always enjoyed training new staff who came through her office so an intern program sounded right up her street.<br>\r\n\"In that case then I hope you two can start to put some ideas of your own together and I will forward you the current list of applicants we have for the program\" said Jenna, leaning back into her chair and massaging a roll of belly fat.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jenna, I'm looking forward to getting into this new project\" cooed Lucielle, still brimming with excitement. She took to her feet with a little more exertion than she expected as a result of lifting the extra weight from her 'breakfast'. She nudged Ashley lightly to wake her and headed towards the door.<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again Jenna, you look well\" offered Lucielle as she grabbed the door handle with a sleepy Ashley following close behind.<br>\r\n\"You too Lu, I hope your return to work is as fruitful as your time off has been\" teased Jenna with a wink thrown at the enormous blonde, eying the immense jiggling arse leaving her office</span></div></div>",

So concentrated on finishing getting ready he completely missed seeing his girlfriend before him and continued obliviously until he walked square into her, bouncing sharply against her protruding belly.<br>\r\n\"Ooph, careful!\" giggled Lucielle, feeling her rolls of belly fat wobble from the impact.<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie, just trying to get ready for our big night\" smiled Alex, leaning in and kissing Lucielle's chubby cheek.<br>\r\nLaughing again, the enormous blonde pouted at her boyfriend before continuing with a great deal of over the top urgency \"well hurry up because I...AM...STARVING!\"<br>\r\nEach word prompted Lucielle to bounce on her toes with excitement and, in turn, each bounce caused vast rolling ripples through her ever growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmerised by her shifting bulk, Alex watched Lucielle's body moving, each jiggle and wobble visible even under her rather formal red dress. This particular moment felt like a testament to the couples relationship as Lucielle stood in a hallway where her hips nearly touched both walls at the same time as they prepared to go for a likely incredibly indulgent meal with the blondes boss. Alex was ecstatically pleased with how the past few months had panned out.<br>\r\n\"Hey, wake up sleepy head\" cooed Lucielle whilst playfully rubbing her belly to grab Alex's attention again as if he wasn't just ogling her second largest feature \"time to go\" cooed Lucielle again before turning around to make for the door.<br>\r\nAlex couldn't help but grow instantly hard as Lucielle's enormous arse bounced away from him, its sheer size making it only a few very small inches from hanging out of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this looks like the kind of place Jenna would live\" muttered Lucielle as Alex pulled up the paved driveway and parked to one side.<br>\r\n\"It is pretty fancy here, why don't you earn money like this?\" teased Alex, prodding Lucielle in the side allowing his finger to disappear into the fat rested there up to the second knuckle before retracting it again.<br>\r\nLucielle laughed at the tickle and stuck her tongue out at her boyfriend, choosing to ignore his quip about money<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you earned as much money as Bo then I could buy a house and you could keep me fed off your own wage instead of me having to pay my own food bill.\" Knowing the effect her words were having, Lucielle's eyes went doughy and innocent before carrying on \"I mean, I'm practically wasting away on so little food\"<br>\r\nUnable to maintain the seriousness any longer Alex lent over and kissed his girlfriend deeply on the lips and massaged her hip gently.<br>\r\n\"Well I assume you won't be going hungry tonight from how you've bigged up this dinner we're about to have\" mused Alex, looking into Lucielle's eyes<br>\r\n\"Hell no, Jenna wouldn't dare let us leave if I was hungry still\". Lucielle cutely tilted her head before opening her car door and slowly worked her way out of the car.<br>\r\nStanding straight and adjusting her dress accordingly she waited for Alex to come round to her so they could walk up together.<br>\r\n\"Come on then\" invited Lucielle, linking her arm around Alex's as they slowly walked towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING DONG*<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" breathed Alex \"that doorbell sounds more expensive than my entire flat\"<br>\r\nLucielle snorted under her breath at that comment. Knowing Jenna he probably wasn't wrong.<br>\r\nAs they waited for the door to open, they both became aware of the unmistakable sound of heels clicking up the driveway towards the door and, likewise, towards them.<br>\r\n\"Hey you guys! I'm not late am I?\" Called Ashley as she drew level with the couple, flattening her dress against her thighs as she came to a halt.<br>\r\n\"I hope not otherwise we're late too\" replied Alex, leaning forward to peer around Lucielle's belly to talk directly to the newcomer to the group.<br>\r\nThe blonde of the group rolled her eyes and muttered \"such a dad\" in fake annoyance at her boyfriend.<br>\r\n\"Hi Alex, good to see you again!\" Ashley excitedly called, waving with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\nThe couple hadn't spent much time with Ashley, but her friendly nature had always made Alex feel welcome and they were certainly friendly.<br>\r\nSpeaking of friendly, Ashley looked stunning on this particular night.<br>\r\nTightly packed in a shoulderless dark green dress showing off all kinds of cleavage, the petite receptionist was showing off her remarkable 'starter' curves and, for the first time since returning to work, Lucielle got a sample of Ashley's actual waist size. Due to the tightness of her dress it was clear that Ashley was already becoming quite pudgy across her middle despite being sub-200lbs, although that was a boundary she seemed content on hounding down at a vast rate of knots. Nestled above some chubby hips and below a moderate pair of boobs, a clear roll across her sides defined a roll of chub across her waist that, Lucielle imagined, would one day form a rather attractive double belly, assuming the brunette stuck to a solid diet of pigging out endlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObservations aside, patience starting to wane and appetites stirring in at least two of the individuals stood on Jenna's doorstep, Alex went to press the elaborate bronze plated doorbell but was halted as the door lock clicked and the door began to swing open, allowing light to pour out into the night air on the doorstep. Excitements rising, their host presented herself, poised within the confines of the door threshold.<br>\r\n\"Well come on in\" invited the warm voice of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Occupying the internal side of the doorway was Bo, Jenna's long term girlfriend and notoriously successful feeder.<br>\r\n\"Well then, you all gonna come in or not?\" Bo innocently asked, one hand on the edge of the door she was holding open for her guests<br>\r\nAdmittedly, moments before the door opened, the three people stood outside were desperate to get in but now...all three were slightly taken aback. You see, it had been a while since any of them had seen Bo, certainly a few months at least...but none of them could have expected the Bo that greeted them at the door.<br>\r\nAs seemed to come with the territory, Bo had never been thin, certainly not whilst Lucielle or anyone else from the office had known her, but it seemed that Jenna's eating habits had rubbed off on her black haired beauty recently. Much in the same vein as Lucielle, Bo was bottom heavy, like seriously bottom heavy. Due to the combined thickness of her immense hips, arse and thighs it was difficult to accurately put a number to Bo's weight but, if Lucielle recalled correctly, she had been 190lbs and surprisingly considerably smaller so she must be heading towards the mid 200lbs at least by now, if not the top end of that particular range.<br>\r\nSurprisingly though, her increased size wasn't actually the most shocking aspect of her appearance in this particular moment. No, it wasn't the black haired woman's current choice of hairstyle with layers of blue and blonde streaks accenting her natural black, rather her choice of attire.<br>\r\nThe thickly pear shaped woman stood in the doorway was wearing the grand total of a black lacy bra supporting her impressively perky breasts and a grey pair of short gym shorts straining around her hips and gently hugging the lower curve of her belly which was pinched gently by the stretchy waistband of said shorts. An underwear line was faintly visible, running across the girth of her enlarged arse cheeks and that was all for clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, I know you're all hungry\" purred Bo, giving each guest an alluring glance with her piercing blue eyes before strutting into the house, hips rolling in rhythmic bounces with her steps.<br>\r\nThe three guests looked at each other with a mix of confusion and awe before following their host into the lavish house, closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi guys, glad you could make it\" called Jenna from her seated position in what could only be called a living room due to the sheer size of the room and the quantity of seats scattered around the room. There was also a large wall mounted tv playing quietly in the background further suggesting it's purpose as a living or reception room.<br>\r\n\"Pleased to be here Jenna, thank you so much, both of you, for hosting us all tonight\" replied Lucielle, smiling ear to ear as she took a seat opposite Jenna.<br>\r\nContrary to her usual 'formal' wear of the office, Jenna was wearing little more than a tightly clung vest top and potentially some underwear, although her size made any hints of such an item completely hidden in her current seated position. All that could be said was she was not wearing a bra as her breasts sat atop her rounded belly.<br>\r\n\"Well we do love having guests, particularly those who enjoy the simple indulgences of life\" smiled Jenna with particular playful glances thrown at Lucielle and Ashley.<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, me and Alex are just here to watch three pigs gorge themselves blind\" teased the pear shaped Bo as she jiggled into the room, walking close to Alex and nudging him playfully as she passed.<br>\r\nThe only guy in the group that evening smirked knowingly, winking at Bo as she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group started to settle in for the evening, the room was filled with laughter and the sound of friends enjoying each other's company but, despite all this, Lucielle couldn't help but notice something.<br>\r\n\"Hey Jen\" called Lucielle across the room to her superior, the thought nagging at the back of her mind.<br>\r\n\"Yeah honey?\" replied Jenna, looking up from a whispered conversation she was having with Bo.<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering\" quipped the titanic blonde \"I feel like there's a slight inconsistency in the dress code for the night\"<br>\r\nAshley and Alex broke from their conversation briefly, suddenly aware of the truth that Lucielle had just pointed out. The three guests certainly did seem over dressed compared to their hosts.<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I'm glad you mentioned that\" replied Jenna \"we're going super casual tonight guys, a little birdy has informed me that, particularly for us big eaters, casual would be the...safest dress choice for the evening\"<br>\r\nAs Jenna spoke, Bo could be seen nodding with a wry smile behind her girlfriend, the tip of her tongue poking out between her lips with an all knowing hint to it.<br>\r\nConfident as ever and feeling assured by the declaration of casual dress, Ashley did not hesitate in standing and, in one well practiced motion, slid her dress off and tossed it to one side where it landed in an armchair. The brunette adjusted her strapless bra for comfort and then plopped back down and resumed her conversation with Alex without skipping a beat. In her new state of near nakedness it was clear that Ashley was definitely gaining weight with cute rolls on her sides and the noticeable crease of a developing muffin top consuming her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly taken aback, Alex looked to Lucielle for some guidance but was left standing as his huge girlfriend was, albeit less elegantly than Ashley, peeling her dress off to toss to one side. Rather glad she had opted to wear a bra after all, Lucielle discarded her dress and breathed out softly feeling oddly comfortable in her nakedness even with the surrounding audience. She glanced at Alex who was still dressed and nodded reassuringly at him whilst smiling warmly. With an element of reluctance Alex began to unbutton his shirt but was quickly scoped out by Bo.<br>\r\n\"Come on lover boy, you can stare at the fatties as much as you like just get your kit off!\" she cried across the room, following it up with a mock wolf whistle as Alex exposed his slightly toned top half.<br>\r\nGetting in to the spirit of things, Alex went to remove his jeans but was once again interrupted by the bubbly bottom heavy feeder.<br>\r\n\"You don't HAVE to take your trousers off man, you can keep that bit of dignity\" teased Bo as she jokingly covered her own crotch and pretended to blush.<br>\r\nLucielle had forgotten how much fun Bo was to be around, tonight was already proving to be a good night and this was before the food got involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ladies and gent\" addressed Bo, standing to one side of Jenna in order to speak to the room as a whole \"are we all ready to eat now?\" Everybody knew this was a loaded question but it still sparked a great deal of enthusiasm all the same. Ashley even cheered like she was at a concert demanding an encore.<br>\r\nChuckling at the reception her announcement received, Bo assumed full blown hostess mode.<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, get ready to get fat tonight!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Between Jenna's frequent excessive compliments on the subject and the senior staff members ever increasing waist, Bo's reputation in the kitchen was nothing short of infamous. Despite this, however, no one from the office had had the pleasure of indulging in whatever delectable treats were about to be served their way.<br>\r\nIt didn't take long though for Lucielle and Ashley to realise that 'getting fat tonight' was probably going to be a wild understatement of the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith surprising speed, the bottom heavy blue haired babe produced an unprecedented quantity of food, distributing various containers between the three hungry office workers whilst licking her fingers from the occasional dipping into foods that she herself wasn't able to resist.<br>\r\n\"Well then ladies, me and Alex are expecting a show\" cooed Bo, hands on hips \"get eating!\"<br>\r\nNone of the girls needed telling twice as they threw themselves into many different foods surrounding them.<br>\r\nAs the eating began it did not go unnoticed that Bo kept disappearing into the kitchen and bringing back with her more and more piles of food dripping in empty calories.<br>\r\nUpon placing her last items, Bo glanced at Ashley hungrily tearing through a large pan of lasagna currently balanced on her knees. Slowly and deliberately trotting over to the smaller brunette, Bo scooped up a sizeable bowl of dauphinoise potatoes before swiping Ashley's lasagna from her lap, much to the brunettes protest, before emptying the pan into the bowl and mixing the contents together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, so small and hungry\" Bo teasingly pouted, slowly lowering herself onto Ashley's lap, immense arse cheeks spreading further and stretching her short shorts \"you just close your eyes and let Bo take care of that hunger, ok?\"<br>\r\nLost in the moment, Ashley obeyed and found herself on autopilot receiving great spoonfuls of creamy cheesy potato mixed with pasta and mince. Bo smiled a Cheshire Cat smile from her perch and indulged the thin brunette, a line of cream trickling free from the corner of her lips as she moaned softly from the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle couldn't help but notice this moment before looking over to Jenna who was already covered in grease around her lips and on her hands from the fried chicken she was disembowelling insatiably. Jenna temporarily looked up from her feast, noticing her girlfriend and smiling fondly before addressing Lucielle.<br>\r\n\"Don't panic sweetie, we agreed she was going to...help Ashley tonight. I'm pretty sure I'll still be eating once Ashley's full\" Jenna bit her lip at this, giving her belly a full handed slap leaving a greasy hand print on her milky skin.<br>\r\nSatisfied she wasn't about to witness a very bold moment of cheating, Lucielle threw herself into stuffing herself, alternating between a tray of meatballs and the creamiest cheese drenched pasta the blonde had ever eaten. This relatively small selection did not last long at her hands before she had to reach for more, snatching up her own bowl of potatoes, scraping more meatballs into the mix for extra substance.<br>\r\nAs she continued to pig out, Lucielle could see, or more accurately hear, the consequences of Bo feeding Ashley to her left. Ashley was a phenomenally fast eater and was marching an incredible pace for Bo to feed, the pair of them obviously enjoying it. At that particular moment Ashley was having a bowl of meaty pasta pressed to her lips by the much larger woman on her lap, allowing her to inhale large mouthfuls of calorie laden deliciousness without exerting any effort. In return, Ashley had a large greasy turkey leg held to Bo's mouth allowing her to eat hungrily from the bone.<br>\r\nBlissfully unaware of her own eating, Lucielle only broke her attention from her two friends when her spoon hit the bottom of the bowl.<br>\r\nThen Alex got involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one smooth movement, Alex mounted his girlfriends immense belly, perching himself on top of her lower most belly roll with his legs straddling Lucielle's huge hips. From this position he then lent forward to whisper in the blonde's ear.<br>\r\n\"Well I think your 'pound a day' diet is shot\"<br>\r\nLucielle giggled at this, she hadn't thought of that as she mindlessly pigged out.<br>\r\n\"We might as well go big then, no point in holding back for a ruined diet is there?\" Cooed Alex, balancing a large bowl of buttery mashed potatoes with bacon in it alongside a platter of fried chicken.<br>\r\nLucielle hungrily stared at the food, licking her shapely lips, her breathing intensifying as she did causing her already sizeable bosom to heave against her struggling bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...Bo...\" groaned Ashley practically comatose \"get up, I can't...breath\"<br>\r\nThe two women were currently laid belly to belly, with Bo on top, and the combined weight of her own gluttony alongside Bo's much larger mass pressing down on her was causing difficulty for Ashley.<br>\r\nHaving eaten more than she expected, Bo laboriously heaved herself off the smaller brunette's lap and rolled into a seat next to her, massaging her slightly swollen middle and rolling her shorts down to expose her gut entirely, revealing a faint red mark around her girth highlighting the pressure from the tight fabric.<br>\r\nAshley was visibly sweating and struggling to cradle her overstretched stomach which had never been so full. The poor girl's cheeks were flushed and her thick eyelashes barely flickered as she breathed deeply, sucking in oxygen like it was part of the immense meal she had wolfed down not too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite earlier optimism, Jenna was also winding down, only idly chewing on some pasta leaving saucy remnants splattered on her lips and cheeks. Internally she couldn't help but be proud of her much smaller colleagues effort, but she was also aware of how much of an expert Bo was when it came to helping women find their indulgences and play on them to their limit. Jenna could not dispute though that she had indulged herself plenty and, although so heavily padded, was sporting something of a firm food baby herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen of the night though was certainly Lucielle. Although her enthusiasm was curbed somewhat she was still eating away with Alex spread out on her much firmer belly. Currently munching away on something deep fried and mopping up thick cheese sauce, Lucielle moaned between bites as Alex massaged her immense sides. Neither of them could remember when but, at some point during the feasting, Alex had removed his girlfriends bra and tossed it vaguely in the direction of her previously discarded dress. The lack of support in the form of garment, however, was substituted by the underlying firm belly that held her perky boobs without sagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the couple carried on indulging, Bo forced herself to her feet, stretching as she stood before slowly starting to cross the room. Vast quivering rolls shook her body from her thick thighs through to her bulging belly as she slowly made her way from her seat towards Jenna.<br>\r\n\"I hope you're all still...\" Bo let rip with a chest shaking belch, her walking having disturbed her settled state releasing the gas that had built up \"scuse me\" mumbled the pear shaped woman as she reached Jenna, playfully fondling her girlfriends bellybutton.<br>\r\nWith a moan breaking through Jenna's lips, Bo smiled before continuing<br>\r\n\"Well at least one of you is still hungry, I hope the rest of you are\" at this point, Bo glanced around the room at her bloated guests with her Cheshire Cat grin painted on again<br>\r\n\"You better be hungry anyway because dessert is on its way\" cooed the blue haired pear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trust me, you'll be able to handle much more than you think.\" She said patting her hand on the bloated girls shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo excused herself to grab the first few pitchers to funnel while dropping off the last funnel next to Jenna. Returning she announced, \"Ok, we have vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. They are all my own special concoction, guaranteed to have lasting results.\" She finished with a wink, dropping a pitcher of vanilla in Alex's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle couldn't hold back her excitement. She had heard of funneling before, but neither her nor Alex had ever brought it up, so it remained uncharted territory for them. Lucielle knew this was the only way to achieve even a higher level of being stuffed, and she was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've done this before?\" Lucielle asked softly, looking deep into Alex's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex took a big glup of nothing before confirming. \"Yeah, with one of my old girl friends.\" The two of them had never really talked about past relationships before. To Lucielle, Alex's life started the day he met her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've never done this before, so you might need to take it easy on me.\" Lucielle said with concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darling, you have nothing to worry about.\" Alex said with a smile. \"It's easy as pie. You just need to swallow. Here let me help you.\" Alex picked up the funnel and helped Lucielle get it comfortably in her mouth. Then he stood up, grabbing the cool pitcher and started to slowly pour in it the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweet liquid hit the back of Lucielle's throat and she instinctively started to glup it down as more and more entered her mouth. The thin and creamy vanilla drink washed across the top of her taste buds as it journied into her massive stomach. The flavor was so bold, it made the experience even more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex continued to pour as Lucielle started to get the hang of it and into a rythm. The vanilla cream started to fill her belly, giving her an even more in-depth feeling of being full. Lucielle moaned as she got over her nerves and started to enjoy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though the pitcher was only dripping drops of cream into the funnel, and Lucielle was taking her last few gulps. Once Lucielle realized she had finished the entire pitcher, she opened her eyes which she had closed early on as she started to enjoy herself. Sliding the now sticky funnel out of her mouth she could finally take a much needed deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking for the first time since the funnel first entered her mouth, Lucielle said...</span></div></div>",

A window had opened for their relationship, and things were not going to be the same after this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex promptly grabbed a pitcher of the chocolate shake and readied the funnel for round two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo had put all of her focus on Ashley, easing the growing girl through her first funnel session. \"That's it, just let it slide past your lips and down your throat. Like it's not even there.\" Bo cooed as she rubbed the smallest girls belly as it filled slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had been left to fend for herself, which she was ok with. She had forgone the funnel and just raised the large glass straight to her lips. Small beads of cream ran off both sides of her mouth as she tried to consume more than she could handle at once. But once Jenna got a flow going it was smooth sailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle eagerly popped the used funnel back in her mouth and made eyes at Alex letting him know she was ready. He didn't need to be told twice and started to pour the chocolatey liquid straight into Lucielle. Alex looked down, as he poured, at his monumental sized girlfriend. She had rolls and flab to spare. Over their time together she had become positively round. Her ass had continued to develop, bubbling out behind her, as well as spreading to each side. As her belly grew even more vast, it just made her whole body look more spherical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle couldn't help but use her free hands to explore the vast sea of fat that covered her body as she was filled even more. Again her eyes rolled into the back of her head, this time as she allowed her hands to grope and squeeze her softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her vision completely black, her hands felt nothing but soft squishly flab. She knew just how humongously fat she was, but she couldn't help being enamored with how soft her body had gotten. She could pick up a section of fat and give it a shake, causing ripples to send waves across her plush form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting this full, and relishing in how fat she was is all Lucielle needed to get excited. She felt like this was not the place or time for such things, but she couldn't help herself. She was reaching a level of fullness she had never felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she realized her chocolate voyage had come to and end all she could bring herself to muffle through the funnel was, \"Mooore!\" Lucielle didn't even want a break, she just wanted this feeling of fullness to continue. The specially created caloric drink did a wonderful job filling any gaps in her stomach, and even though she had quite the filling meal, she felt like she could easily polish a third pitcher off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex didn't skip a beat and grabbed a pitcher of strawberry and started to pour. The flavor of chocolate had just barely left her taste buds when a rush of strawberry filled her mouth. The refreshing berry flavor was a nice contrast to the chocolate and vanilla that came before, and Lucielle welcomed the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happy couple was in heaven right now. But it was about time to see how the rest of the party was doing.</span></div></div>",

In a bid to find comfort, the previously svelte brunette edged slightly to one side causing her distended stomach to shift sideways and rest along side her on the sprawling sofa, slapping against the leather with a sloshing motion. With a distinctly pregnant look to her figure, Ashley desperately pawed at her belly to attempt to ease her discomfort but was unable to achieve the desired effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah, slow down there babe\" advised Bo, sitting by the brunette's feet \"let me deal with that\"<br>\r\nAshley attempted to protest but was cut drastically short as Bo laid her hands on the faux pregnancy bump, causing the tone of her groaning to change dramatically.<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Ashley felt a great deal of relief as Bo firmly pressed her fingers into the surprisingly soft expanse of belly.<br>\r\n\"Better now?\" asked Bo, a slightly leading question<br>\r\n\"Mhmph\" Ashley groaned again but with a faint smile and an accompanying nod, resting her feet against the soft hip of her blue haired feeder.<br>\r\n\"Figured as much\" replied Bo, continuing to bear her fingers into Ashley's gut as she spoke \"you don't get a girlfriend as fat as Jen without knowing how to ease stomach aches\"<br>\r\nAshley nodded, really quite dazed and not entirely listening, opting instead to enjoy the moment of light petting easing her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Funnily enough, you'd look good as big as Jenna\" teased Bo, lightly patting Ashley's stomach for emphasis.<br>\r\nThe pat pushed a burp from the smaller girls mouth and she blushed at the thought; her as big as Jenna? She couldn't deny that she was enjoying her early steps on the fat girl ladder but being THAT big hadn't even crossed her mind at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still in there Ash?\" Bo asked, slightly concerned as the smaller woman seemed to glaze over.<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yeah...\" Ashley groaned again but in far less discomfort as she did.<br>\r\nBo chuckles, still massaging Ashley's belly before continuing \"sorry, my head has a habit of fattening every girl in a 5 mile radius if I let if do it's thing\"<br>\r\nAshley could only laugh as she gently caressed her own side, still caught with how soft she felt despite the immense binge she'd just had. She even recalled her stomach being near drum tight after the food portion of the evening.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, it's pretty impressive seeing a girl as thin as you used to be get so fat so quickly\" mused Bo, lost in her own world as she idly massaged Ashley<br>\r\nThe comment caught Ashley. Once upon a time, gaining a couple of pounds would have freaked out the former gym instructor but now...she got a real buzz out of Bo's observation.<br>\r\n\"I mean look at you chick\" mused Bo, glancing up and down the smaller woman's body \"one minute you're a fitness queen and then you're so belly dominant you can't even get off the couch\"<br>\r\nAshley suddenly got a pang of doubt at how much she'd let herself go in a short period of time but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a subtle motion, Ashley bit her lip and moaned softly under her breath. The brunette knew Bo's comments would have horrified the Ashley of a few months ago, she'd be humiliated, but now she was lapping it up and admittedly turned on knowing her former self would be so shocked.<br>\r\n\"Right fatty\" Bo declared, the word striking a chord with Ashley again as she warmed internally \"I'm bloody starving and you are not full\". This observation came with an accusing raised eyebrow and deliberate prod to Ashley's stomach. The blue haired pear's finger sunk into the expanded middle with surprising ease and proved the point nicely.<br>\r\n\"So, I suggest we get you another pitcher and I'm gonna get me a straw and a pitcher for me too\" and with that, Bo sprung from the sofa and marched to the kitchen, huge arse cheeks wobbling with each step.<br>\r\nLost for words, Ashley watched the jiggling rear turn a corner and realised her stomach was actually rumbling again. The receptionist cradled her bloated middle in her arms and smiled, feeling her thighs start to burn.<br>\r\n\"Ok, so what we're going to do Ash is...\" started Bo, carrying a tray of pitchers which she sat next to Ashley on the sofa before straddling the brunette and resting her own plump belly against Ashley's rounded middle. Without any expansion on her explanation, Bo simply fed the funnel tune back between Ashley's lips (with no resistance that is) and posed with a pitcher ready to pour. All it took was a small nod from Ashley and Bo titled the glass jug enough to allow gravity to take the thick chocolatey liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second cream hit Ashley's tongue, a deep sexual moan escaped her mouth, echoing around the plastic pipe between her lips. Subconsciously all she could think was her old colleagues back at the gym looking at her now, dressed in an overly taxed gym outfit with her belly rolling over her shorts and wobbling with every step she took. The other women there called out 'pig' and 'fatty' as she walked as one instructor came to confront her.<br>\r\n\"Jesus Ash, you're so fat!\" The female instructor strutted up to Ashley, who was blushing now, before grabbing two meaty handfuls of love handle and jiggling the engorged mass. At this point Ashley's cheeks were ablaze with embarrassment, but then, so were her loins...<br>\r\nBack in reality, Ashley was hungrily sucking on the funnel, lapping up thick cream like it was going out of fashion. On top of her was Bo, poised so as not to press too hard against her student, but still allowed her own stomach to press against the smaller girl, its warmth and softness giving Ashley and unexpected jolt as a straight girl.<br>\r\nBy now, Bo had also equipped herself with a pair of straws, one in a vanilla shake and the other in a strawberry shake allowing her to drink down both at the same time. She smiled down playfully at Ashley beneath her as she continued to pour into the funnel, the brunette's stomach stretching by the moment as she hungrily drank despite being categorically full but a few minutes before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without hesitation, Ashley wiped the pipe out of her mouth again and belched loudly followed swiftly with a giggle. God she was full and it was SOOOO hot.<br>\r\nBo had been drinking the entire time as well and was nearly finished with her pair of pitchers to Ashley's one, her belly showing signs of swelling already which did not seem to phase her in the slightest nor slow her down.<br>\r\n\"How you doing chubby?\" asked Bo of the smaller girl, delicately placing her hands on Ashley's belly which had expanded greatly from the one additional pitcher.<br>\r\nAshley burped again through flushed cheeks before answering \"oh my god, so good\" purred the brunette, laying back with a sultry look on her face.<br>\r\n\"You want more then?...\" asked Bo, half impressed and half concerned at Ashley's new found vigor.<br>\r\n\"Oh god, yes!\" cried Ashley, leaning back and opening her mouth wide, awaiting the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to wait long as Bo obeyed, loading her up again and then starting to pour in one fluid motion. Again, the receptionist moaned as the cream hit her and she went into an almost trance as she sucked down the thick liquid. Happy that Ashley was feeding again, Bo resumed her own indulgence, swapping her straws into new pitchers and drinking at pace once again.<br>\r\nIt wasn't until she had swapped her straws that she realised something about her partner in crime.<br>\r\nIt wasn't immediately visible but Bo could feel it between her legs; Ashley's belly was swelling as she drank. After the initial feeling Bo could clearly see each chug of shake running down the brunette's throat before sitting heavily in her stomach and causing her middle to swell outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley wore an inane grin as she drank and her eyes fluttered in time with her sucks, at least outwardly unaware of the fact she was growing as she drank.<br>\r\nWhat Bo didn't know was that Ashley was well aware and loving every second.<br>\r\nThe two woman continued to drink heartily in their half embrace, Ashley lost entirely in her self indulgence whilst Bo couldn't help but admire the brunette between her thighs. She was incredibly hungry for her size and, having seen that kind of appetite before, Bo expected big things in the young receptionists future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom heavy feeder found herself quickly drawn back by a lazy slap on her thigh, indicating that Ashley was finished with her pitcher. Delicately, the girl on top pulled the funnel from her cohorts mouth allowing her to drink in air freely.<br>\r\n\"Oh god Bo...\" Ashley's hands instinctively drew to her belly and she realised for the first time that night just how much she had consumed.<br>\r\nHaving binged like a woman possessed, only her belly had been affected that evening but the results were quite incredible.<br>\r\nAs a naturally curvy girl, Ashley's hips were naturally relatively large but after her evening of gluttony, the extent of her belly swelled enough to overtake the girth of her hips, giving her an immensely exaggerated apple shape at least temporarily. Whilst laid on her back, having not had chance to stretch, Ashley's stomach curved straight up into the air giving her the profile of a woman carrying multiple babies that were overdue. The sheer weight pushing down on her body caused thick rolls to sit above her hips and, despite the immensity of food consumed, the receptionists belly button maintained its depth.<br>\r\n\"Well well well...\" mused Bo, gently placing a hand on Ashley's belly \"aren't you the little piggy now\"<br>\r\nAshley groaned under her weight, lightly scratching at her belly as she did<br>\r\n\"Well, little maybe isn't the right word\" continued Bo, starting to tease the brunette below her \"I think we'll need to roll you out of here on that big belly of yours\"<br>\r\nAshley moaned deeply at this comment. The evening had unlocked a couple of monsters inside Ashley it seemed, firstly a deep desire to eat and secondly a sexual enjoyment deriving from been teased about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to move under her weight, Ashley wiggled slightly before settling in to caress her engorged belly, a sense of immense pride bubbling inside her. She loved feeling like this she decided and, more importantly, she needed to get Don (her fianc\u00e9) on board with this new life style of hers.<br>\r\n\"I think you're done for the night honey, any more and you'll burst\" Bo declared blankly, offering a gentle slap to the curving belly before her. Both girls watched as Ashley's belly actually jiggled despite its fullness, although the motion caused some discomfort supporting Bo's suggestion.<br>\r\nAshley simply nodded in response and rolled onto her side, allowing the sofa to take the weight of her belly. She could feel herself getting drowsy as she laid and was quietly aware of the fact that her belly now took up more space than her tight backside at the start of the evening.<br>\r\nBo perched beside her and lightly drummed on the brunette's belly which seemed to give her some comfort in her fullness.<br>\r\n\"You did good tonight chick, we should play together again sometime\" Bo chirped, winking at Ashley before picking up one of her pitchers and putting it straight to her lips to empty its contents.<br>\r\nAshley only nodded at this point and, from her current stance, got a clear view of Bo drinking who herself was now full enough to also swell outwardly with each chug.</span></div></div>",

In her seated position, her naturally enhanced arse was spreading widely across the floor in two bulbous cheeks. Much like Ashley, her arse was not effected by her binging tonight, not yet anyway, but the true impact was visible in the blondes dominating belly.<br>\r\nLucielle's time with Alex had done wonders for her waistline giving her a thick double rolled midriff that creased around her belly button and enhanced her muffin top no end. Now, however, her natural crease was gone, leaving only the slightest roll around her hips. The titanic blonde had consumed so much that night that her belly was near perfectly round on top her ever thickening thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my babe, I don't think you've ever been this full\" cooed Alex, tentatively stroking Lucielle's hips from behind her before sliding off the sofa and sitting next to his girlfriend.<br>\r\nUnable to speak as she focused intently on breathing, Lucielle closed her eyes gently to signify acknowlegement before letting loose a string of burps that smelled distinctly of cream.<br>\r\nWith a soft laugh Alex placed a hand on Lucielle's enormous belly and gently applied pressure, feeling the mass of food within. Much like Ashley, Lucielle still had an element of jiggle to her belly due to being more liquid than food at this point, leaving Alex feeling like he was sat next to a water balloon. A very fat, very overfilled water balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think our guests have enjoyed themselves, wouldn't you say Belinda?\" called Jenna from her seated position across the room.<br>\r\nThe evening guests all looked over at the largest woman in the room with a glimmer of shock being shared between them, albeit there was a lack of clarity whether the shock stemmed from Jenna STILL eating prior to talking or if it was at the use of Bo's full name.<br>\r\nShooting her girlfriend something of a glare, Bo stood up with something of a wobble and marched towards Jenna<br>\r\n\"I would agree Jennifer, and don't they look beautiful?\" Bo declared, arms spread to display the fruits of her labour for the evening with a slight bingo wing hanging under each arm as she did.<br>\r\n\"Well you are a terrible influence\" mused Jenna, rolling her eyes whilst playfully squeezing her belly, noting the reaction swim across Bo's face as she did.<br>\r\n\"They don't seem to mind\" Bo said innocently, shrugging causing a modest jiggle through her upper body before continuing \"I'd even hazard a guess that, if we invited them, they'd come back again\".<br>\r\nWith a faux innocence to her face, Bo crossed her arms behind her back and balanced on her toes whilst looking over her shoulder at her bloated guests, the pair of office workers groaning in their various positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled at Lucielle as she groaned, massaging her belly softly to ease her discomfort.<br>\r\n\"Well we can't thank you enough for tonight but I think we best be off\" said Alex, lightly patting Lucielle's belly as he spoke \"think it'll take someone a while to get home and I gather she has an important project starting on Monday?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Lu's intern program\" cried Jenna with a smile on her face \"I'm looking forward to seeing her work come together, she's done so well\"<br>\r\n\"I'm proud of her\" smiled Alex as he stood up.<br>\r\nIn true Bo style she jokingly gagged at Alex's soppy sentiment but poked her tongue out at him to take the edge off before breaking down laughing.<br>\r\nLaughing in response, Alex grabbed Lucielle's clothes before offering an arm out to the beached blonde who graciously grabbed him.<br>\r\nWith some effort, Lucille managed to get to her feet and stretched after being sat for so long.<br>\r\nWhen stood it could not be denied that the blondes belly looked even bigger where it hung heavily down, forming a prominent indent central to her lowest roll, and proceeded the rest of her figure by quite a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Lucielle had found her feet, Ashley was also staggering onto her feet whilst contending with her own immense belly. The pair looked quite the sight stood mostly naked in their state of bloating and couldn't help but smirk at each other before grasping at their respective bellies which had become newly uncomfortable from shaking.<br>\r\nAshley forced her dress over her head and attempted to pull it down as far as possible which resulted in the brunette looking even more pregnant than she did without the garment.<br>\r\nLucielle opted to not bother with any additional clothing and instead started to make for the door with a slow trudge, generating vast waves of fat wobbling through her entire body. Ashley followed close behind, groaning as her stomach jiggled with each step, still internally enjoying the situation a little more than expected as she reached the door.<br>\r\n\"Thanks again!\" called Alex as he followed on last, throwing his shirt on clumsily as he left to fend off the cold.<br>\r\n\"Bye lover boy\" cooed Bo \"you keep making that girl fat you hear?\" shooting vibes only a fellow feeder could.<br>\r\n\"You bet Belinda\" shouted Alex as the door closed behind him.<br>\r\nAllowing her entire body to deflate slightly at her name being used again, Bo glared at Jenna \"that's your fault\"<br>\r\n\"Woops\" mumbled Jenna, looking away without trying to smile.<br>\r\nBiting her tongue, Bo grabbed a still full pitcher of chocolate shake and sat herself over Jenna's lap, slowly edging the glass towards her girlfriends lips. As she did Jenna closed her eyes and hungrily awaited the sweet liquid to come, feeling her stomach gurgle softly under her many layers of fat.<br>\r\nWith this in mind it's no surprise that she was shocked to find the glass not to her lips after a patient amount of time.<br>\r\nEven more surprised was the dark haired manager when she opened her eyes to see Bo straddling her and hungrily drinking from the pitcher.<br>\r\n\"You know\" started Jenna, pinching a sizeable roll of Bo's belly that was nearly in her face \"you keep drinking like that and I'll end up being the feeder in this relationship\"<br>\r\nBo tipped her head back, finishing the pitcher swiftly before belching solidly.<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, would that bother you?\" teased the much smaller woman as she rubbed her belly<br>\r\n\"Maybe not\" cooed Jenna, chewing on her lip before pulling Bo in for a deep kiss.</span></div></div>",

Kicking off her 4 inch heels one at a time the brunette groaned softly as she settled on her feet and idly placed a hand on her distended stomach. The taxi ride home had done little to allow her to digest any of her feast but Ashley could tell that, at least internally, she was slightly less distressed than how she left Jenna's house.<br>\r\nSlowly waddling down the lengthy hallway so as to not shake her delicate stomach too much Ashley became aware of a slither of light escaping from around the living room door.<br>\r\n\"You awake still babe?\" called Ashley into the darkness.<br>\r\nHer call was met by the quiet sound of somebody rising from a sofa and the door swung open to reveal her fianc\u00e9 stood within the confines of the bare wood frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon had originally been a client of Ashley's when she used to be a fitness coach, working as his personal trainer.

Don proved to be quite the romantic as time passed, often surprising Ashley with flowers and home cooked meals along with the occasional weekend away when he could afford it.<br>\r\nThe two loved each other dearly and went from strength to strength as the months rolled by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside their relationship, the two still frequented the gym together either to work out or where Don would hang out in clear view of Ashley as she worked through her daily duties. Anybody looking in could see that Don provided something of a positive influence on the already fit Ashley and, as the months rolled into years, Ashley became more toned, eventually sporting an impressive set of abs along with some sizeable biceps and thighs that could break bricks.<br>\r\nAshley's toning seemed to only enhance Don's physical attraction to her and their romance deepened, until finally Don dropped on one knee and asked his muscular girlfriend for her hand in marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappiness ensued for the couple as they started to plan their wedding, excitement growing by the day.<br>\r\nSadly though, Ashley's infamous work accident came into play, striking her down in her prime and leaving her unable to walk for 3 months.<br>\r\nDon was attentive as ever whilst Ashley was stuck on bed rest, doting on his wife to be like a princess without a second thought. An unwitting side effect of her spoiling combined with a greatly reduced exercise regime was the loss of her muscle tone but, contrary to expectation and paranoia from Ashley, Don maintained his attraction to the brunette even as she developed a layer of pudge around her stomach from her inactivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the months continued to roll by though, their wedding plans began to slow down as the couple was able to spend less time working on arrangements. Don was able to take on Ashley's old fitness coach job giving him direct access in helping her rehabilitate and, in turn, loose her injury induced puppy fat just in time for her new job as receptionist at Gordge Incorporated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening beautiful, you have a good time?\" Don was warmly spoken despite his deeper voice and exuded a gentle nature despite his dominating size. The 6 foot 4 muscle bound man walked towards his fianc\u00e9 from his framed pose in the doorway and raised his arms to initiate a hug.<br>\r\n\"It was so good babe, I've never eaten so much in my life\" cooed Ashley with a warm smile as she nuzzled into Don's tight chest, cheek against his naked pectoral.<br>\r\nContact was made as Ashley mused about her quantity of eating and, unintentionally, Don found himself rather shocked.<br>\r\n\"Jesus babe\" outcried Don, taking a step back and placing both hands on his fianc\u00e9e engorged belly \"did you swallow Jenna's yoga ball or something?\"<br>\r\nAshley snorted rather loudly, hands placed on her back causing her to push her belly out slightly further than it currently protruded.<br>\r\n\"Jenna? Yoga? Her fat ass would burst a yoga ball honey\" mused Ashley, laughing as she did before strolling past Don and passing into the living room before heavily dropping onto a sofa cushion. Don turned the corner of the room just as Ashley was shelling her dress once again to allow her body to breath like it did at Jenna's.<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Don entered the room again and sat next to Ashley slightly more delicately than she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo...all this was from tonight huh?\" asked Don, gently prodding Ashley's spherical belly causing the young woman to groan softly with a little tickled giggle.<br>\r\n\"Ooph, yeah this is from Jenna's\" cooed Ashley in response, glancing face to face at her fianc\u00e9, smiling cutely \"I feel so sexy babe, it's really arousing being this full\"<br>\r\n\"Uh huh...\" muttered Don, not all that convinced \"it's not uncomfortable then?\"<br>\r\n\"Not REALLY, its more pleasant now I've stopped eating for a while\" replied Ashley, gently caressing her belly with her finger tips<br>\r\n\"Well if you're happy\" Don muttered again \"hey, do you fancy going to the gym tomorrow?\"<br>\r\nAshley almost did a double take at that question, glancing at her stomach and then back at Don.<br>\r\n\"You do see how full I am right?\" teased Ashley as Don laughed nervously.<br>\r\n\"I suppose, I just thought it might help you digest a bit, plus it helps keep that body healthy for longer\" quipped Don, attempting to hold in a much stronger opinion.<br>\r\nLong had Don made it known he was concerned about Ashley's colleagues and their general lardiness and the possible influence it may have on his fianc\u00e9e but, until tonight, Ashley had mostly resisted well and maintained her delicate physique.<br>\r\nNow though, a fresh wave of concern washed over him suddenly realising Ashley may be about to fall off the bandwagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know about the gym sweetie but I'd be up for a different kind of cardio, if you know what I mean\" looking lustily at her man, Ashley managed to slowly drape a long leg over Don's lap whilst pressing her belly against his abs.<br>\r\nDon managed to resist visibly cringing and composed himself before replying.<br>\r\n\"Not tonight babe, I'm pretty tired. I was only staying up to see you in\" said the muscle man as he slid out from under Ashley's advance and headed towards the door.<br>\r\nUnsure if she should feel dejected or not, Ashley sidled back into a seat of her own and forced a smile at Don.<br>\r\n\"Ok sweetie, I'll see you in the morning then?\" called Ashley over her shoulder<br>\r\n\"Will do babe, I love you\" cooed Don before blowing a kiss into the room<br>\r\n\"Night, love you too\" replied Ashley, grinning more enthusiastically now as she gently pawed at her naked belly fighting a strong wave of tiredness in her comfort<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Don moved towards their bedroom he couldn't help but think that he needed to make sure Ashley got back to the gym and soon, she was dangerously close to hitting fat territory and that was a concern.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMorning sweetie, you have a good weekend?\u201d called Lucielle to an approaching Ashley, leaning against the receptionists\u2019 desk as she spoke.<br>\r\nIt became apparent very quickly however that Ashley, this morning at least, was not happy.<br>\r\nPractically storming towards her desk with her heels clicking against the floor with each step, Ashley\u2019s face was that of a raging thunderstorm. The moment was slightly defused due to Ashley\u2019s newly accumulating pudge jiggling around her hips and more prominent boobs.<br>\r\nDrawing level with Lucielle, Ashley shook her head sternly with an angry pout adorning her ruby lipstick lips before circling round her desk and slamming a box of company provided doughnuts down in front of her chair.<br>\r\nLucielle stood slightly dumbfounded before the angry brunette but, with hunger in her eyes in the presence of two dozen doughnuts, stretched a hand out to grab a particularly plump chocolate glazed doughnut.<br>\r\n\u201cDonf eben!\u201d screeched Ashley through a mouthful of an undetermined number of doughnuts, dragging the box closer to herself and grabbing a fresh pastry in each hand.<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, nobody likes Monday\u2019s Ash but you are way grumpy\u201d mused Lucielle, placing her hands on Ashley\u2019s desk and filling the receptionists forward view with tightly constructed boobs and belly, the latter straining a poor button up shirt more as the blondes belly surged towards the desk in front of her.<br>\r\nSwallowing hard and sighing, Ashley places the remaining held doughnut on her desk and looked to her larger colleague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Lu, I\u2019m just so tired and hungry. Don dragged me to the gym three times after Friday night and he\u2019s a total dick for it\u201d grumbled Ashley, resuming her doughnut and chewing slowly with a line of jam escaping her mouth only to be retrieved by her finger.<br>\r\n\u2018Wow\u2019 breathed Lucielle in her head before addressing her curvy friend.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry babe, that sucks\u201d said Lucielle reassuringly, sloping round the desk and wrapping an arm around Ashley\u2019s shoulder as she ate leading the brunette to lean against her friend, continuing to eat doughnuts with her head resting on Lucielle\u2019s hip.<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t wanna talk about it\u201d declared Ashley, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand \u201cwhen do the internship people get here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh they\u2019re already here, Jenna\u2019s giving them an introduction in conference room five\u201d replied Lucielle, bouncing herself onto her feet to give Ashley space to stand.<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I guess we best head on down\u201d smiled the smaller receptionist, practically skipping out of her chair and towards the conference room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd lastly, before I hand you over to your program coordinators, I hope you find Gordge Inc to be a place you can thrive and become young professionals in the world of business\u201d concluded Jenna, stood at the front of the room addressing the six young women sat before her.<br>\r\nLucielle and Ashley were already familiar with the women before them, having combed over their applications extensively, but were both elated to be meeting them in person for the first time.<br>\r\nWell some of them anyway, three of the individuals before them were actually familiar faces.<br>\r\nFor Lucielle, there was the recognisable couple of young waitresses she had met when she had gone for dinner with Jessica and Alice a couple of weeks back; Shelly and Carri.<br>\r\nDressed smartly for their young ages, 19 and 18 respectively, the two looked most nervous of all the girls there with Shelly particularly shifting her weight backwards and forwards on her chair. She caught Lucielle\u2019s briefly, eliciting a small friendly wave from the bottom heavy blonde. Blushing, Shelly glanced at her knees and didn\u2019t look up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley also recognised one of women in the audience, although far less pleasantly.<br>\r\nDanielle was something of a bitch. Currently sat back in her chair with arms folded and one leg crossed over the other, the 5\u201910 brunette wore something of a cocky smirk across her delicate lips, emerald eyes burning through her glasses and focusing on Jenna as she spoke. Ashley knew the now 24 year old from her trainer days when she was a client looking to drop some weight which had led to the pair clashing frequently, particularly with Danielle feeling intimidated by the well toned and muscular Ashley back in her fitness prime. However, with Danielle now thinner than Ashley, and with a striking half sleeve tattoo on each arm protruding from the tailored cap sleeves of her shirt, the taller woman internally felt dominance was hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis then left the remaining three women, including the largest of the group.<br>\r\nPauline was something of a weighty marvel, her hourglass shape was very apparent even from her seated position and her tightly fitted three piece suit was stretched in all directions by curves and bulges. Sitting at approximately 260lbs she was by far the heaviest intern on the program, even outweighing Ashley by 80 or so pounds.<br>\r\nDescending in size led to Codi who was a little...unexpected in comparison.<br>\r\nWith jet black shoulder length hair framing a delicately chubby face and a side cut that covered part of her face, Codi was an out and out goth. With thick eye makeup and full dark red tinted lips, Codi was quite an imposing figure in the room as she glanced forward quite blankly whilst patting her black and red striped dress down and smoothing it across her lap which comprised of some visibly thick thighs. Stretching back slightly also provided view of a gently curving stomach which, despite her dark exterior, made her appear typical of a Gordge office girl.<br>\r\nLastly, and rounding out the package, was Sarah who for all intents and purposes was a stowaway in the intern program. Having stumbled across an advert for the intern program, Sarah applied immediately having just graduated in business at the tender age of 21, and was promptly accepted onto the program. Little did anyone at Gordge realise however that Sarah would then be getting on a plane and flying from England to partake in the program. After much discussion and searching it became apparent that Sarah had stumbled across an unintentional foreign applicants advert that had not been intended to ship out and had been removed upon realising the mistake. Not before the blonde Brit could finish her application and secure herself a fully paid position with accommodation and board in the states though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, allow me to introduce to you your program leaders, Lucielle and Ashley\u201d announced Jenna, stepping to one side and allowing Lucielle and Ashley to step forward.<br>\r\nBrimming with excitement, Lucielle took the lead allowing Ashley to stand to her side.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning ladies, we\u2019re so pleased to finally meet you all, I hope you\u2019re as excited as we are to start this new venture at Gordge\u201d announced the blonde to the awaiting audience.<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get to know you all better but first things first myself and Ashley are going to take three of you each and get the all important admin sorted\u201d continued Lucielle, smiling widely at the women in front of her.<br>\r\nThe pair had been working towards this none stop since her return to work and it was a beautiful thing to finally see it all come together.<br>\r\nWith a cheeky sideways smile at Ashley, the titanic blonde continued.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, lets get started!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This brought her face to face with a panic stricken Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you were going to take Danielle!\u201d hissed Ashley, noticeably frustrated with the situation.<br>\r\nLucielle pondered for a moment before remembering their discussion a few days before.<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, sorry babe!\u201d mumbled Lucielle having to bite back a giggle at her blunder \u201cI totally forgot, we can\u2019t swap now though\u201d<br>\r\nAshley seethed and went to continue her rant but the two leaders found themselves surrounded by their new budding prodigies, cutting the imminent conversation short before it could start.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine sweets, just keep smiling\u201d called Lucielle over her shoulder as she led her team away.<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s face was a picture as she scowled after the jiggling blonde but quickly relaxed to cover her frustration as she took in her group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly, Codi and Sarah followed behind the immense team leader as she sashayed down the corridor, hips much closer to the walls than you would expect. Certainly closer than the three interns expected anyway.<br>\r\n\u201cWow she\u2019s big\u201d exhaled Sarah, her delicate accent cutting the otherwise silent walk.<br>\r\n\u201cWow you\u2019re not...American\u201d stammered Shelly, shocked at this revelation having been too nervous to acquaint herself with any of the other interns. She had, apparently foolishly, hoped that she would be with Carri at least on the first day.<br>\r\nCodi spat a disgruntled groan completely lost for words at the two naive youngsters and maintained her silence, opting instead to fixate on smoothing her dress as she walked accenting her chubby stomach as she did.<br>\r\nIgnoring the vocalised distaste of her gothic companion, Sarah instead giggled at the young waitress\u2019 observation regarding her accent.<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite chick, England\u2019s more my home turf\u201d smiled the blonde Brit, extending a hand to Shelly<br>\r\nShelly found herself feeling more relaxed instantly and took the slender hand extended to her.<br>\r\n\u201cSarah\u201d smiled the Brit again as she introduced herself<br>\r\n\u201cShelly\u201d nervously added the youngest member of the group<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure to meet you Shelly\u201d Sarah cooed, tightly grasping Shelly\u2019s hand and leaning towards her \u201cdon\u2019t be so nervous, it\u2019ll be fine\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle smiles to herself as she led the three interns following her, they were already bonding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCodi rolled her eyes as the other two girls started to bond and slowed her pace slightly to allow them to get closer without involving her. Whilst holding Shelly\u2019s hand still, Sarah turned to look at Codi.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Codi right?\u201d ushered Sarah, trying to welcome the goth girl.<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u201d grunted the black haired girl, still not wishing to be involved.<br>\r\n\u201cWell come her silly, we\u2019re going to be working together so we might as well get used to each other\u201d invited the Brit, reclaiming her hand before offering it to Codi.<br>\r\nReluctant at first, Codi eventually shook the hand offered to her and felt a slight twinge of warmth.<br>\r\n\u2018I guess she isn\u2019t too bad\u2019 mused the goth to herself<br>\r\n\u201cSee, not so bad was it chick?\u201d posed Sarah, offering a follow up smile to test the waters.<br>\r\nCodi stiffened up slightly \u201cjust don\u2019t call me chick, ok?\u201d<br>\r\nTaken aback by the rebuttal of her pleasantries, Sarah shrugged it off and smiled \u201cno worries! I\u2019m just so excited to be here, I\u2019ve never been to America and Gordge sounds like such a great company to work for\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say\u201d muttered Codi, mostly to herself, eyeing how skinny Sarah was particularly against the backdrop of the office they found themselves in.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to interrupt you guys, it\u2019s so nice to hear you getting to know each other, but we\u2019re here now and unfortunately we\u2019ve got to get some serious things done\u201d called Lucielle as she nudged the door to her office open, presenting the large space to the three girls who were all knocked back as the walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been freshly refurbished, Lucielle\u2019s office was a huge largely open space furnished with a desk, her personal leather exec chair (which was wider than any other chair of its type the three interns had ever seen) and a medley of chairs for meetings, three of which were set facing her desk for the interns.<br>\r\nAlongside this there was also a second desk in one corner with its own leather exec situated behind it, a sofa against one wall, a large \u2018mini\u2019 fridge undoubtedly filled with a range of food and drink predetermined by Lucielle for snacking throughout the day.<br>\r\nAmongst other furnishings though was a wide spread platter of pastries that was nothing shy of typical for the office waiting for the four girls to delve into.<br>\r\n\u201cSo ladies, if you\u2019d like to take a seat we can get started\u201d invited Lucielle, heavily landing in her own seat causing an noticeable \u2018poof\u2019 of stress from her seat cushion with her enormous arse tightly packed between the arm rests of her chair.<br>\r\n\u201cOh and please, do take something to eat\u201d smiled Lucielle as she herself grabbed a dense chocolate filled pastry of some description before taking a large bite and softly moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter swelled from within Lucielle\u2019s office which prompted smiles from all who passed as she processed the budding interns, preparing their credentials and uploading them on the office intranet.<br>\r\nVery much led by Sarah\u2019s bubbling enthusiasm, Shelly had relaxed considerably and Codi had, for lack of a better phrase, removed the stick from her arse as the girls bonded with each other and Lucielle.<br>\r\nAs the \u2018boring\u2019 paperwork side of things came to a close, chitchat started to flow and the girls all became oblivious to how much they were eating.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re from England, Sarah?\u201d asked Lucielle as she inhaled another doughnut<br>\r\n\u201cMhmph\u201d nodded Sarah, hovering a hand in front of her mouth as she bit into an eclair \u201cyeah, it\u2019s crazy been here but I\u2019m loving it so far!\u201d cooed the blonde as she reached for a danish to chase her eclair down with \u201cthese are so good!\u201d enthused the blonde as she took a bite of the flakey pastry.<br>\r\n\u201cYou said it\u201d purred Codi as she reached for a bear claw that was nearly as big as her head. The chunky goth couldn\u2019t help but notice the svelte Brit was no longer flat stomached at this point, although the irony of her own bloating was lost on her as she pulled coyly at the hem of her dress to cover her thighs slightly more than previously.<br>\r\nShelly was sat quietly, slowly pulling a cronut apart and placing small pieces in her mouth having made something of a pig of herself, not that anyone noticed or judged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to be honest girls, now that that\u2019s all done there\u2019s not a lot planned for the rest of the day\u201d mused Lucielle \u201cwe had set aside today for your admin because we expected it to take ages but we\u2019ve flown through it\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAww, and we were having so much fun\u201d grumbled Sarah with a slow roll of her eyes<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right\u201d spat Codi as she idly traced her stomach through her dress \u201cso can we go now?\u201d asked the goth, adjusting herself in her seat.<br>\r\n\u201cSadly not\u201d chuckled Lucielle \u201cthink my boss would give me a hard time if I let you off so early, it\u2019s not even been lunch yet\u201d<br>\r\nThis stirred the young waitress at the end of the line of interns<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! But we\u2019ve eaten so much already\u201d groaned Shelly.<br>\r\nLucielle chuckled again, smiling at the youngest of the group \u201cdon\u2019t worry sweetie, you don\u2019t have to eat all the time\u201d<br>\r\nAgain feeling oddly reassured, Shelly smiled and relaxed in her chair a little.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, how about you guys just relax for a second and I\u2019ll go find something for you guys to do\u201d Lucielle announced, heaving herself from her chair which pinched around her arse cheeks slightly as she rose \u201cwon\u2019t be a second\u201d bounced the bulging blonde as she headed to the door and made a sharp jiggling left turn.<br>\r\nSat in silence as Lucielle lumbered away, the three interns glanced at each other in varying states of fullness.<br>\r\n\u201cWow, she really is fat\u201d cooed Sarah with Lucielle\u2019s girth engraved in her brain at this point.<br>\r\n\u201cKeep eating like that Union and you won\u2019t be far behind her\u201d interjected Codi with a wry smile painted on her lips<br>\r\nPerplexed, Sarah lent forward with a slight scowl to confront the goth \u201cUnion?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCheck your flag chick\u201d nonchalantly purred Codi as she bit into another bear claw, winking at the skinny blonde.<br>\r\nThe thought process glazed across Sarah\u2019s face before the penny dropped and she laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well, maybe being fat when you\u2019re THAT happy isn\u2019t so bad\u201d mused the Brit, daydreaming slightly as she spoke.</span></div></div>",

After your success at university we figured the best place for you would be on the front line so you\u2019ll be taking part in business meetings, dealing with clients directly and negotiating profitable deals\u201d<br>\r\nOvercome, Sarah lost her until now rock solid composure and descended into squealing excitement<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, I\u2019ve always wanted to be part of a business team!\u201d outburst the svelte blonde \u201cdo I get to go on business lunches and smooth talk with clients?!\u201d<br>\r\nChuckling at Sarah\u2019s enthusiasm, Lucielle temporarily placed her post it down to respond<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe not straight away but if you\u2019re capable I\u2019m sure you will in the near future\u201d nodded the much larger blonde<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Sarah to bubble in her excitement, Lucielle turned to Codi.<br>\r\n\u201cCodi\u201d proceeded Lucielle \u201chaving taken into account your natural flair for fashion and design we\u2019ve decided to put you with the branding team where you\u2019ll be helping to build our new image. We\u2019ve recently undergone a big refurbishment and are still trying to nail down our new theme\u201d<br>\r\nMuch more relaxed than her foreign colleague, Codi simply nodded before speaking.<br>\r\n\u201cSounds cool\u201d the hefty goth bluntly interjected before giving in to her second wind and reaching for a doughnut<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, last but by no means least\u201d teased Lucielle as she scrunched her note up and tossed it towards the bin, looking sweetly towards Shelly \u201cyou\u2019ll be working alongside me sweetie as my personal assistant\u201d<br>\r\nHaving been very quiet to this point, Shelly perked up slightly at the position she had been offered. Although she hardly knew Lucielle and had in fact offended her last time they spoke before today, the ex-waitress found an odd comfort in knowing she would be working alongside the titanic blonde woman rather than a complete stranger.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d stammered the youngest member of the team \u201cI won\u2019t let you down\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know you won\u2019t sweetie\u201d smiled Lucielle as she leaned back in her chair, fighting the urge to indulge any more from the remaining feast before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with all that done and out of the way there really is nothing else for you ladies to do today\u201d mused Lucielle with an idle scratch of her bulging side beneath the tight confines of her buttoned shirt.<br>\r\n\u201cSo we can go?\u201d asked Sarah, wiping a chocolate smear from the edge of her mouth to between her lips; an unapologetic tell of the chocolate muffin she had just devoured.<br>\r\n\u201cYou certainly can, might as well get out and enjoy the rest of your days and we\u2019ll start you properly all off properly tomorrow\u201d replied Lucielle <br>\r\nApparently not needing to be told twice, the three intern girls promptly rose from their seats and made for the glass door dividing Lucielle\u2019s office from the main office floor.<br>\r\n\u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d called Sarah over her shoulder with a small wave to match as she passed through the door and disappeared out of sight behind the frosted glass.<br>\r\nCodi slunk our without a word whilst Shelly uttered a simple \u2018bye\u2019 in her meek and timid way,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite contented with how the day had gone, Lucielle smiled to herself and closed her eyes for a moment.<br>\r\nThe moment was indeed short lived though as her mighty stomach began to grumble beneath her shirt, prompting the bottom heavy blonde to crack one eye open again.<br>\r\n\u201cWell this won\u2019t do\u201d she spoke to herself \u201cAlex would have a fit if he could hear me this hungry\u201d<br>\r\nSitting properly in her chair, Lucielle glanced briefly at the picture on her desk of her stood with Alex. It was early in their relationship for sure, if she remembered rightly she had only been around the 480lb mark when it was taken and certainly much smaller than the queen of gluttony she was now...<br>\r\nLosing herself in her memories and blissfully unaware she was massaging her own belly, Lucielle swiped up her desk phone and punched in a quick internal code<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Jenny, yeah it\u2019s Lu, could you get a conference platter sent to my office please? Thank you!\u201d<br>\r\nAs the phone clicked down, Lucielle again smiled to herself as she waited for her food to arrive, casually rubbing the immense covered surface of her belly in idle self adoration.</span></div></div>",

Ashley knew that Lucielle\u2019s team had taken off some time before lunch and, as it was now around 5pm, she had expected something along these lines but the end result was quite remarkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking completely unphased, Lucielle was perched in her desk chair with her shirt completely untucked allowing for an impressive roll of pale belly fat to sit heavily on her thighs. Despite the release of her shirt, the white material was still pulled tight around her vast sides and bulging hips which had the knock on effect of leaving her buttons clinging on for dear life over the much rounder expanse of belly trying to surge forward to join the exposed lower roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you\u2019ve been busy babe\u201d teased Ashley, pulling a chair alongside the bloated blonde, prodding her exposed flank for effect.<br>\r\n\u201cWell you look just as busy if I might add sweetie\u201d retorted Lucielle, making a clear observation towards the bloated state of her colleague.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well, I just have stress eaten like a thousand doughnuts after we split\u201d confessed the brunette, sounding caught between disappointed with herself and ready to do it all again.<br>\r\nAlthough the exaggeration was obvious, it was apparent she had eaten a lot of a girl her size seeing as she had been in work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was the case for a growing girl like Ashley, her dress had already started the day tight but was now even more so. Wrapped tightly around a bulging belly curve, the poor garments hem line had risen a good inch or so up the brunettes thighs and was now so tight around her rear that her underwear was visible from any distance. Ashley had really been pounding the doughnuts today, that\u2019s for sure.<br>\r\nThe fat girl aesthetic was not helped by the half empty box of a dozen doughnuts she had brought with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sue me\u201d declared Ashley \u201cI eat my feelings now so I expect mobility aid by the end of the week as it will be required\u201d. As if to labour the point, she defiantly took a large bite of her next doughnut with a slight up turned nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle chuckled softly as she reached for more of her own food.<br>\r\n\u201cI say we celebrate tonight. We had a successful first day and we\u2019re finally on the move with our internship program!\u201d suggested Lucielle, staring intently at the smaller girl to her side.<br>\r\nWith an unexpected amount of eagerness Ashley replied.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, we totally should. I had a crappy weekend and we both deserve to be happy\u201d replied Ashley, the defiance running strong at this point.<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d cheered Lucielle \u201cwhat do you want to do though?\u201d she asked, not wanting to scare Ashley\u2019s enthusiasm away too easily.<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d started the brunette before being cut off by the chime of her phone receiving a text message \u201cjust a sec\u201d she paused as she grabbed her phone to read the message.<br>\r\nLucielle could see from the changing expression on her face that it was not a happily received message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh, stupid Don wants to go to the gym again tonight and wants to know when I\u2019m finishing work\u201d groaned Ashley, her reluctance clear as the weekends resent was kicked up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of how to constructively advise her friend, Lucielle awkwardly rearranged her bulk around her chair before clearing her throat<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m no expert on these things Ash but if you don\u2019t want to go to the gym just tell him, you guys are engaged after all\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess\u201d murmured Ashley, fiddling with her ring as she spoke, noticing it\u2019s slightly tighter than it used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliberations continued for quite some time, turning into a full blown conversation with pros and cons been thrown between the two bloated beauties, all whilst food flowed a plenty into their waiting mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Alex could beat Don in a fight?\u201d asked Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cYou what?\u201d spat Lucielle, unable to get her head around where that came from<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just thinking, what if I came and lived with you guys for a few months, Alex makes me enormously fat so I can\u2019t go to the gym and then we tell Don\u201d elaborated Ashley with far too much sincerity in her voice.<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d pondered the blonde member of the party \u201cas sweet as Alex is and as good as he is at doing diabolical things to a girls waistline I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be much good in a fight\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShame\u201d mumbled Ashley around a mouthful of doughnut<br>\r\n\u201cJust be honest with him babe\u201d Lucielle offered up whilst nudging Ashley\u2019s phone towards her \u201cits entirely up to you\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh, fine\u201d complained the brunette, unlocking her phone and opening the message from Don to reply...</span></div></div>",

As she awkwardly bounced from one high heeled foot to the other as a way of resisting the cold slightly, the other two members of their party exited the vehicle behind them, much to the audible relief of Lucielle's car suspension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are we just going to stand out here all night?\" Jessica sharply interjected, brushing up against Ashley from behind.<br>\r\nThe weight behind Jessica's stomach knocked Ashley off balance slightly, causing her to totter a couple of steps forward which was enough of a green flag the rest of the group needed to jiggle their way towards food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening and how may we serve you tonight?\" asked a middle aged Hispanic man just inside the door.<br>\r\nObviously on autopilot he didn't look at the fresh patrons as he spoke but was taken aback when he did finally glance upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucielle!\" outcried the man, throwing his arms in the air \"hermosa dama, it's been so long!\"<br>\r\n\"It has!\" replied the titanic blonde at the front of the group, returning the man's gesture resulting in her belly been exposed even more<br>\r\n\"I see that boy has been keeping you fed, I hope we dont disappoint tonight\" mused the server, offering a slight bow of his head<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you couldn't even if you tried\" laughed Lucielle as she, again, tried to straighten her shirt <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, its not just me tonight\" mused the blonde as she sidestepped slightly to reveal the rest of the group \"I've brought some friends with me, we're celebrating, particularly...this one!\" clarified Lucielle as she dragged Ashley to the front of the group causing her to stumble and allowing her developing assets to wobble slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me get you a table and you ladies can start to celebrate\" announced the man, disappearing further into the restaurant as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling ear to ear with her own feeling of success, Lucielle turned back to the group<br>\r\n\"I hope this suits you guys, I know the food here is fantastic and I figured our little Ashley could do with a pick me up\" said Lucielle, squeezing Ashley's shoulder as she spoke<br>\r\n'Damn' thought Ashley 'Lu did know Mexican was her favourite'<br>\r\nDread swimming through her mind at what Don would have to say when she got home, the brunette found herself quickly engrossed in her own hunger and also inspecting her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrightly decorated with wall length murals of stereotypical Mexican scenes, the surprisingly large restaurant felt exceptionally homely, even as a complete stranger. A smattering of other customers could be seen throughout the open plan dining area, not what one would call a crowd, and were all in the throws of their meals or conversation. Amongst the noise, Ashley could also make out the faint sound of a Mariachi band in the background playing through the concealed speakers in the corners of the room.<br>\r\nNone of these things quite compared to the intoxicating aromas wafting through the place though. Ashley had long adored Mexican cuisine, considering it her favourite by quite a margin. Back during her bodybuilding days, Ashley took great pride in loading her cheat days and muscle bulking meals with obscene amounts of Mexican calories to impressive results on her figure. She once jokingly declared her six pack was made of tortillas and fried meats to a room of in-awe gym clients. Since taking up work at Gordge though she had limited her intake greatly, indeed, Don rarely even had the stuff in the house so as to avoid temptation for the long since horizontally expanding brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww no, whats up Ash?\" cooed Alice, innocent of the situations that had arisen between the receptionist and her fiance.<br>\r\n\"I erm...\" stumbled Ashley, feeling foolish for bringing up the problem and not wanting to paint Don in too dark a light, he DID only want the best for her after all.<br>\r\n\"She's just been in a bit of a funk with all the stress of the internship, not had much time to let off steam because of it\" interjected Lucielle, an internal sigh of relief rattling through Ashley.<br>\r\n\"Mhm\" breathed Jess from the back of the group with a slight air of disgruntled attitude with her meaty arms folded over her impressive gut \"like what we do is 'letting off steam'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a negative nancy\" chastised Alice. In an odd turn of events over the past few weeks, Alice's confidence regarding her weight had blossomed, fortunately for her as her weight had also continued to blossom.<br>\r\nThis proved to be in stark contrast to the still larger Jessica who found herself plagued by the conflict suffered by many women; wanting to eat to her heart's desire but not wanting to gain any weight. The issue became even more complicated when taking into account Jess's recent tendency of going home from work and downing ice cream by the pint in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the wait ladies, your table is ready\" announced Miguel (as the girls had been informed by Lucielle their server was called).<br>\r\n\"Thank you Miguel\" smiled Lucielle with an almost sickly sweetness as she squeezed past the hispanic man and proceeded through the restaurant<br>\r\nAs the four ladies made their way past other tables, Ashley couldn't help but notice how much she had grown recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, in the grand scheme of things and given her current company, her weight gain to date can hardly be considered vast, the brunette became very aware of how often she had to turn slightly to allow her hips to pass through gaps she would have once thought easy to pass without such a motion.<br>\r\nIt also dawned on Ashley just how much her thighs rubbed together nowadays. Never one to sport a true thigh gap, there was at least once a time where her thighs weren't so tightly pressed against each other, particularly, not as far south as they currently were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her thoughts, Ashley was blissfully unawares of their arrival at their table in one corner of the restaurant, only been drawn back to reality when the smell of food hit her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are ladies\" announced Lucielle as she stood at one end of the long table adorned with a feast traditionally fit for a few more than their current party size.<br>\r\nTraditionally speaking anyway, and if we know one thing about Gordge employees they are far from traditional eaters.<br>\r\nEspecially not with a burrito eating queen in their midst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked on completely dumbstruck and the quantity of food before them, mindlessly salivating as her stomach growled from within the confines of her dress.<br>\r\n\"Swear to God Lu, you will not be happy until we're all as big as you\" groaned Jess, awkwardly tugging at her dress whilst trying to ignore her own stomachs' demands<br>\r\n\"And we'll love you all the same Jessy Pie\" teased Lucielle as she poured a tequila shot out for each of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" squacked Alice with a big smile across her face as she took one of the glasses from Lucielle \"thanks for organising this\"<br>\r\n\"Pffft\" snorted Lucielle as she passed out the remaining drinks, leaving herself with one \"I didn't organise this, this is just how this place does celebrations\".<br>\r\nUnseen by the other girls, Lucielle raised her glass slightly to the watching Miguel and threw him a wink of appreciation. The Hispanic man smiled to himself before returning to the table he was wiping down at that particular moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway!\" declared Lucielle, raising her glass in the air \"thank you all for coming tonight, now lets get our eat on!\"<br>\r\nAs the blonde spoke, Ashley tentatively nursed her glass as she saw two distinct paths before her of how the night was going to progress. Lost in thought, she stared through the golden liquid to the bottom of the glass knowing that this one drink would dictate the rest of the night...</span></div></div>",

Now, Lucielle was well aware that Ashley used to be a bodybuilder, remnants of that life were still apparent when the receptionist joined Gordge, but intoxication on its own level had impacted her serious nature leaving her to sarcastically quiz her friend instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should because you'd win because I was one!\" shouted Ashley again, leaning over the table towards her friend and invading her personal space far more than she would dream of doing were she in control of her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, well...\" started Jessica from the other side of the table, her mouth partly full with nachos and beef \"if you were a bodybuilder then why are you so FAT?\"<br>\r\nThe whole table burst out laughing at the dark haired woman's inflection on the dreaded F word, including Ashley who was still leant over the table and blissfully ignorant of her stomach gently slapping against the table with each laboured inhale of laughter, her dress doing little to conceal her bloated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Past tense Jessica, jeez\" sighed Ashley whilst rolling her eyes, slowly pulling her legs up to her bum and clumsily sitting heavily on the table \"anyway, if I'm fat then YOU must be fat too!\" screeched the brunette as she lazily attempted to hurl her handful of food at Jessica, falling short of her target and it landed rather wetly on the surface of the table instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, having been relatively quiet at this point, snickered whilst lathargically spooning mouthfuls of cheesey meats into her waiting mouth, occasionally alternating with a bite of tortilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not wrong Ash\" mused Jessica, at peace with herself now she'd got tipsy rather than her usual angsty self.<br>\r\n\"I know right!\" grumbled the brunette on the table, chewing her lip and reaching for the spirit bottle<br>\r\n\"That's enou...\" started Lucielle, looking dizzy, but was cut short as Ashley rambled on still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, aren't we all fat? Like, really?\" questioned Ashley, lost in a perculiar drunken philosophy moment as she continued to flail around looking for comfort in her current position.<br>\r\n\"Erm...\" thought Alice aloud before being cut off also<br>\r\n\"I mean, Alice is fat, Jessica's fat, Lucy Elly is REALLY fat...\"<br>\r\nUpon clumsily referring to her friend, Ashley turned on her bum and flopped towards Lucielle, landing boobs and face first against the blonde's immense belly.<br>\r\n\"I love you babe!\" cooed Ashley, looking doe eyed at Lucielle as she began to knead her friend's belly fat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused whether to feel her usual arousal or feel weird that her friend was now groping her, Lucielle attempted to slide Ashley back onto the table.<br>\r\n\"I mean, I love you too ba...\" attempted Lucielle before drunken Ashley returned to the fray<br>\r\n\"And Alex loves you too! Like he really loves you, he loves that you're fat, he's making you fat!\" cried Ashley, refusing to let go of her new toy in Lucielle's belly<br>\r\n\"I know sweetie, I know\" replied Lucielle, looking desperately to Alice and Jessica for some back up with their friend.<br>\r\nNeither of the fellow colleagues seemed to understand the urgency of the matter though as they continued to stuff their already considerably stuffed faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don doesn't love me fat\" murmured Ashley, resting her chin against Lucielle as she spoke rather somberly<br>\r\n\"Ok, I think its time we got you home sweetie\" assured Lucielle, attempting to lift Ashley up enough to escape her grasp to no avail.<br>\r\n\"Why doesn't he love me fat Lu?\" asked Ashley, tears starting to well in her eyes as she spoke<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that's not true honey, come on, we'll get you home and maybe you guys can talk?\" offered the bigger blonde, trying to defuse the situation before a full blown breakdown occurs.<br>\r\n\"He won't listen to me!\" cried Ashley, this time with a proper blubber to her voice as tears streamed down her face, taking lines of mascara with them<br>\r\n\"Shhhh, its ok\" sighed Lucielle, this time allowing Ashley to sink down against her as she pulled her phone from her bag and dialled Alex's number<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Jessica suddenly became aware of the situation before them as the sound of Ashley's cries cut through to them.<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, Alice looked at Jess for advice who simply shrugged before diving back into the enchillada before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey honey, can you come pick me up, Ashley's having a hard time of things and needs to get home\"<br>\r\n\"No problem, I'll be there in 15\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, hows it going?\" asked Alex as he strolled towards the warzone that was the girls table.<br>\r\n\"Its been better if we're honest sweetie\" replied Lucielle, looking rather downtrodden with a now sleeping Ashley laid against her front.<br>\r\n\"So I gathered\" nodded Alex \"She coming home with us or we taking her home?\"<br>\r\nLucielle shrugged, dislodging Ashley some and causing a line of drool to leak onto Lucielle's exposed belly.<br>\r\nShuddering at the warm and wet sensation the blonde continued.<br>\r\n\"She couldn't decide before she crashed out so I guess if we set off and see if she wakes up? Is that ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Course it is\" said Alex with a slight smile, reassuringly squeezing his girlfriend's meaty shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quite some time, the two girls had managed to get into Alex's car and, much like an over tired toddler, Ashley had not even stirred.<br>\r\n\"Who knew Miguel was so strong eh?\" joked Alex with a whisper so as not to wake their passanger.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he's carried heavier customers than Ash, shes still only a shrimp in comparison to most of their customers\" mused Lucielle, thinking of herself the first time she had regaled the place.<br>\r\n\"True\" nodded Alex again, concentrating on driving in the dark as they went whilst also avoiding any bumps where possible so as not to disturb Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" started Lucielle \"remind me to text Jess tomorrow morning will you?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, why?\" asked Alex, slightly perplexed by the request<br>\r\n\"Just need to remind her that if she keeps eating whilst there's a crisis going on she really will be as fat as me\" Lucielle bluntly said.<br>\r\n\"Obviously\" teased Alex sarcastically. Although he knew there was a joke in there he also knew that Lucielle begrudged having to help their friend out on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the tension, Alex stretched a hand out and gently rubbed a monstrously thick thigh next to him \"she'll be ok\"<br>\r\nLost in her own thoughts on the matter, Lucielle simply grunted and nodded<br>\r\n'I hope you're right' thought the blonde, as she watched the streetlights go by</span></div></div>",

Despite the seriousness of the moment she couldn't help but smirk at the state her friend was in. Usually one to take great pride in her appearance, Ashley certainly was a sight at this point as she attempted to remove strands of hair from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...ok\" Ashley mumbled again, rather confused. Last thing she could remember was taking a huge bite of a burrito and that must have been a long time ago by the feels of it.<br>\r\n\"You had any thoughts about what Lu asked you before you got in the car?\" asked Alex, taking considerably more caution on the road now.<br>\r\n\"Huh? Question?\" Drawing a complete blank Ashley couldn't for the life of her remember, inadvertently answering the question anyway.<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, I've got to get home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving responded to the question, Ashley fished her phone out from a handbag, which had been used as a pillow, and was greeted with a bombardment of notifications with Don's name on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\" mumbled the receptionist, mostly to herself, as she slumped heavily back in her seat with an uncontrollable urge to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the situation starting to deteriorate again, Lucielle intervened.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to? You've had a pretty rough night\" asked the blonde, concern growing for her friend.<br>\r\n\"No, no...I've got to sort this\" quietly mused Ashley as she texted Don.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry I didn't text back. Coming home now xxx'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after the message was sent, it flashed up as 'read' with a reply not far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank god, I was worried about you, see you soon xxx'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he wasn't too mad at least, sighed Ashley, sensing upset may be just around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're sure Ash\" murmured Lucielle from the front, pointing up a street for Alex to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her key in the door, Ashley tentatavely wandered into the home her and Don shared. Memories of their live together covering the walls and furnishings.<br>\r\nThe walk up the hallway made Ashley feel queasy from all the memories flooding her still drunk head but she knew that her and Don had to have this discussion now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards a light in the living room, Ashley kicked off her shoes on the way and placed her handbag on a shelf, the noise of which alerted Don to her presence.<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, her fiance was stood before her in the hallway, his body language giving nothing away in the moment and his face remaining composed as ever.<br>\r\n\"Look, Don, I'm really sorry that...\"<br>\r\nAshley found herself cut off as the air was squeezed out of her by her muscular fiance as he'd closed the gap between them and embraced her tightly.<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry, you're home now\" quietly asserted Don, squeezing her that bit tighter as he spoke.<br>\r\n'Home' felt like a perculiar term at this point to the brunette, but she accepted it and hugged her fiance back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatience seemed to settle upon the house.<br>\r\nRather than demanding answers as she'd expected, Don had bundled Ashley into the shower, helped her uncoordinated self get into her pyjamas and had even got her a big glass of water and some toast for the alcohol.<br>\r\nAt this particular moment they were sat together, albeit on opposite sides, of the sofa in the living room in eerie silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" started Ashley as she put her plate down and sipped from her glass<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I've been so hard on you lately\" announced Don, eyes not moving from the spot he had fixated on since they had sat down<br>\r\nStill expecting a knock back, Ashley found herself more thrown by the calmness coming from her fiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...really want the best for you Ash and this whole situation just doesn't seem...right?\" A quizzical tone caught the end of his sentence as Don placed a somewhat reassuring hand on Ashley's knee.<br>\r\n\"I know, its new to me too, I'm just...\" started the brunette, laying her own hand over Don's<br>\r\nHe flinched slightly at the touch but continued all the same.<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I can do to help you at the moment, I mean, I guess you're going through something at the moment and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, slow down there\" said Ashley, a certain sternness in her voice \"This isn't like a phase Don, I actually like this. I'm enjoying this\"<br>\r\nTo emphasise her point, Ashley pinched her hip and gave the roll a little jiggle.<br>\r\nKnowing she'd indicated something, Don broke his stare from the wall and looked at her only to see her maintain her pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, the muscular man recomposed himself before carrying on.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I get that but are you sure that this is...definitely what you want?\" Realising the gravity of the situation, Don knew he had to pick his words carefully.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Ashley's stubbornness on the situation was not for tolerating questions.<br>\r\n\"This is definitely what I want\" asserted Ashley, folding her arms defiantely with a glass clumsily pressed against one side under her boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Ashley's confidence even knocked her as she had never truly admitted to herself that she was actually enjoying gaining weight. Her first glimmer at Jenna's party with Bo feeding her had opened the door for sure but this was her first moment of commitment to the cause and...it felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess I can try and deal with it then\" said Don, tentatively and nowhere near as confident as Ashley.<br>\r\n\"I don't need you to deal with it Don, I need you to accept it and like it too\" pushed Ashley.<br>\r\n\"Maybe with time, I don't know...\" stumbled the gym instructor, losing his way in light of Ashley's assertiveness on the matter.<br>\r\n\"It's got to be now, not later\" mumbled Ashley, not wanting to upset Don but also desperately needing to be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, Ashley stood up and placed herself before Don<br>\r\n\"Look, its not so bad\" she announced before rolling her bedshirt up and resting it under her boobs \"See? Touch it, go on\" teased Ashley, actually feeling things start to improve.<br>\r\nUnsure and completely out of his comfort zone, Don tentatively reached his hand out towards his fiancee's distended stomach<br>\r\n\"Oh for god's sake, how long does a girl have to wait\" teased Ashley, rolling her eyes before grabbing Don's hand so it didn't move and walking square into his palm so he couldn't help but squeeze her chub.<br>\r\n\"See?\" asked Ashley again, gently managing Don's fingers so he kept hold of her whilst quiet moans unintentionally escaped her lips as she had flashbacks to that night with Bo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...I guess its not so bad actually\" said Don, breaking Ashley from her trance enough to notice him actually smiling a little as he took control of his hand back and continued to play with her middle.<br>\r\n\"I told you!\" smiled Ashley ear to ear, leaning slightly towards him before springing forwards completely and perching on her fiance's lap.<br>\r\nHer landing made a certain situation aware and Ashley couldn't help but smile a little more<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're DEFINITELY enjoying this now\" teased Ashley again whilst taking hold of Don's other hand and placing it on her hip<br>\r\nHer fiance flushed a deep shade of crimson as he realised himself before smiling softly and taking full hold of Ashley with both hands.<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong\" mused Don.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in what felt like a long time, the couple actually enjoyed each other's physical company. Not in a explicitly sexual way, but just embraced and being close to each other.<br>\r\nAshley had her feeling of dread lifted for the first time that night since leaving work and actually felt like she had been wrong about Don's feelings on the situation, the she had just been crazy to think he was ready to break things off over this weight issue.<br>\r\nThat is, until things came crashing down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was now sat facing forward on Don's lap with his arms around her waist and hands laid squarely on her stomach, both were happy and smiling.<br>\r\n\"We can totally work with this Ash\" whispered Don in her ear<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" grunted Ash, turning slightly to look at her fiance.<br>\r\n\"I like this so if we just manage your weight maybe and then...\"<br>\r\n\"No Don!\" exclaimed Ashley, pushing herself up \"I want to keep gaining weight! I've never felt so sexy and if you can't handle that then this isn't going to work!\"<br>\r\nNot realising where he had gone wrong Don looked confused and unsure of what to say<br>\r\n\"Can you accept that?\" shouted Ashley, sensing where this was going<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...\" answered Don, honestly, looking into his lap now<br>\r\n\"Well then don't call me until you know\" Ashley stated plainly before turning on her heels and making for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley stumbled out of her taxi with tears streaming down her cheeks she was glad she'd had the sense to pick up a coat to put over her pyjamas. She was less pleased however that she had put her high heels back on.<br>\r\nAfter paying the driver she turned towards the house he had pulled up outside and strode towards the door with out hesitation.<br>\r\nStanding on the doorstep she waited after knocking, pulling her coat tighter around herself as she did, still sniffing to herself.<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the door before her opened and a warm cushion of air swaddled her that she looked up to see...</span></div></div>",

Not liking fatness was a peculiar affliction in their eyes and, not surprisingly, not one they had come across all too often.<br>\r\n\"Well for starters, get your little ass over here next to us\" suggested Jenna as she jabbed Bo in the hip to move along, a much easier task for the smaller of the two love birds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley tottered over, still wearing her heels as she plonked herself in the parting gap between the two women<br>\r\n\"Secondly, get those monstrosities off your feet, never understood why you girls where those things\" mused Jenna, rolling her eyes as she spoke<br>\r\n\"Never heard you complain when I wear my platforms\" interjected Bo with a coy smile and a wink<br>\r\n\"Yes well...\" started Jenna with a slight blush before remembering the situation \"less of that Belinda, we have a friend in need here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the faux scolding on the chin, Bo shifted slightly to allow Ashley some more space before taking the girls heels away.<br>\r\n\"Now you listen here Ashley, you can stay here as long as you need or want\" assured Jenna, placing a hand on her leg \"don't even be thinking about work either\"<br>\r\nAshley went to interject a point but was cut of sternly<br>\r\n\"Not a single thought\" glared Jenna, not willing to accept anything other than compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo returned at this point with a concerned but friendly face to her.<br>\r\n\"Your phone was going ballistic in your handbag hon so I grabbed it for you\" said Bo, handing the device to Ashley \"seems that fiance of yours is keen to talk\"<br>\r\n\"Urgh\" groaned Ashley as she looked at the phone, a call coming through as she groaned<br>\r\nFeeling bad about walking out she cleared the call off before sending a text to Don<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm safe, staying with friends. I need space'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message was, again, instantly read and then followed by a line of dots indicating Don was planning on replying.<br>\r\nThe phone continued to display this for a while but then disappeared completely which suited Ashley enough for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving all this Jenna squeezed the receptionist gently before offering up her thoughts<br>\r\n\"Good idea, don't let him stew because you might fix it\"<br>\r\n\"Pffft\" scepticism had taken over Ashley at this point along with her upset making her unwilling to believe there was a fix for this particular problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and Bo proved to be exceptional hosts as ever, even for their unannounced guest.<br>\r\nIn short time a room had been put together for her, fresh linens, towels and an optimistically large change of clothes but the thought was what counted at this point.<br>\r\nAshley felt cared for here and that was enough for the brunette at this point.<br>\r\nAs the three women chatted away to take Ashley's mind off things, her phone buzzed again, this time to indicate Lucielle had texted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey sweetie, hope things went ok, call me if you need anything'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to well up again, Ashley took to responding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not great, staying with Jenna and Bo'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't in the mood for a lengthy discussion and left it at that.<br>\r\nThe phone did vibrate again but the potential content did not interest Ashley enough to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fill her in tomorrow at work if you'd like?\" offered Jenna<br>\r\nAshley simply nodded at the suggestion and continued focusing on whatever film it was that the trio were half watching.<br>\r\nSean Bean had just died so nothing new or distinct there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know you girls went out to eat but do you want something now?\" asked Bo, continuing her good host routine.<br>\r\n\"Meh, sure, might as well carry on down the path that's brought me here\" cynically mused Ashley as her stomach did groan softly at the suggestion of more food<br>\r\n\"Coming right up\" half smiled Bo as she wobbled toward the kitchen<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Ashley instinctively curled up and cuddled up against Jenna and a surprising passage of time passed before she realised her mistake.<br>\r\nFlinging herself back in shock she couldn't apologise fast enough.<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I'm so sorry Jenna, you're being so nice and helping me out and I go and do that\" Ashley descended into a slight hysteria at her foolishness but quickly found a hand holding hers<br>\r\n\"Don't be so silly\" assured Jenna, gently pulling Ashley back towards the middle of the sofa \"If you need to cuddle up against me to feel better you go for it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely in awe of Jenna's kindness and understanding Ashley did manage to settle back down and, again, instinctively cuddled against her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Bo returned with a selection of food for their guest but found her efforts to be futile.<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe, she needed something a bit bigger than that to help her tonight\" teased Jenna<br>\r\n\"Pfft, leave you alone for 10minutes and you snuggle up to the first girl that appears on our doorstep\" joked Bo before sitting down and placing the food on the table before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoking between themselves, the two larger women nibbled away at the food that Bo had brought for Ashley who still remained asleep between the two of them.<br>\r\n\"Think she'll be alright?\" asked Bo of her girlfriend. Jenna had known Ashley from day one so was probably more qualified to assess that one<br>\r\n\"She'll be fine\" bluntly put Jenna as she bit into a sizeable fried drumstick \"she's a strong girl and anybody would be lucky to have her\"<br>\r\nBo nodded in agreeance as she picked at a lone dorito<br>\r\n\"She is cute though isn't she?\" mused Bo, looking over Ashley's face<br>\r\n\"Now who's flirting with the guest?\" retorted Jenna, giving an accusing glare over her drumstick with a hint of mischief in her eyes</span></div></div>",

rubbed her eyes and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is...10:23\" chimed Bo as she nudged a plate to one side before taking up a coffee cup and taking a delicate sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm late for work!\" cried out Ashley, suddenly lost to frantic mania as she scrambled around achieving nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah\" called Bo as she jumped up from her chair and grabbed Ashley by the shoulders \"you're taking some time off, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley screwed up her face a touch as she thought back to the previous night.<br>\r\nLots of alcohol.<br>\r\nArguing with Don.<br>\r\nGetting frisky with Don.<br>\r\nRunning out on Don.<br>\r\nComing to Jenna's house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\" mumbled the receptionist as she slumped inward on herself and against Bo who took her weight rather deftly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sit down Ash, there's a good girl\" assured Bo as she walked Ashley to a kitchen stool and sitting her up at the table \"There we go, not just relax, you want anything to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow full caught up on the previous nights events the last thing Ashley wanted to do was eat.<br>\r\nHaving finally realised her own feelings on her latest bodily acquisitions and to then be so suddenly rejected by Don for those beliefs, Ashley found herself very confused about the whole thing.<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh\" sputtered Ashley, shaking her head as she did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're sure, I do make a mean waffle as I'm sure Jenna's told you\" smirked Bo from across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising she was on a losing battle to

to do anything at this point.<br>\r\nHowever, her mind had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't believe we'd fall out of me wanting to gain weight\" whispered Ashley, holding surprisingly strong

understood what was been said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean not everybody likes fat girls, we know that much, but its also supporting the lifestyle even if you do like it\" explained Bo, continuing to stroke Ashley's arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\" muttered Ashley, still as confused as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, lets go simple\" started Bo \"you, very obviously, are enjoying this new walk of life right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded as she looked to Bo intently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but you've had time to think about these things, Don hasn't\" continued Bo \"and, at first look, he's not your stereotypical chubby chaser, I mean, that guy is solid workout wise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he is\" responded Ashley on autopilot as she found herself flashing over many a memory of Don working out and showing off his well worked body to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So to suddenly drop this on him that you actually enjoy being fat is probably too big a bombshell for him to process all at once\" said Bo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\" considered Ashley as she gently pulled her arm from Bo so as to avoid falling asleep at her delicate touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo smiled, mostly to herself as she stood from the table and adjusted her slightly ill fitting bed shirt.<br>\r\n\"I'm no expert, I mean, I love me the fat girls but sounds like you two might not be so busted just suffering from information overload\"<br>\r\nAshley nodded slowly at this.<br>\r\nDon did actually seem to get into things when he was squeezing her tummy last night and it definitely stirred a reaction, maybe he was just struggling to keep up with a decision that Ashley herself had only just made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo could see the thought process flowing through Ashley and nodded to herself<br>\r\n\"Hey, who knew I was so wise, particularly so early in the morning\" mused Bo as she started to walk out of the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get some breakfast?\" asked Ashley, cautiously having literally just declined the offer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought you would never ask\" smiled Bo as she padded back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then Jenna said 'well if you won't honour the 'all you can eat' promise then I shall take my specific dietry requirements elsewhere!'\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAshley burst out laughing with tears streaming down her face as she howled, rocking back and forth in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while since I've had someone to share these stories with, Jenna usually asks that I don't\" mused Bo as she lent against the worktop, arse spreading immensely against the cool edge as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're so funny\" chuckled Ashley as she scooped another forkful of waffle and syrup between her lips, subconsciously rubbing her belly as she did.<br>\r\nAlthough she was wearing a very baggy shirt for her figure, it was one of Bo's hand-me-downs, the effects of the morning, and early afternoon for that matter, binge were apparent compared to how the brunette had started the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True\" nodded Bo with a smile \"You ready for a top up, short stack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley giggled softly at the name before leaning back in her chair, fingers splayed on the covered surface of her stomach.<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure, think I'm full\" purred Ashley, quite content at this point as she rubbed her belly gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you don't want em I guess I'll just have to eat these then\" teased Bo as she loaded up a fresh plate of waffles and walked it to the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, maybe I could have...\" started Ashley, readjusting herself in her seat and swiping her fork up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, these are mine now\" asserted Bo as she heavily sat down again and tore a waffle in two, folding it delicately before feeding the whole thing into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww\" groaned Ashley as she slumped again slightly, twiddling her fork between her fingers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling as she swallowed the other half of her torn waffle, Bo winked before proceeding.<br>\r\n\"I'll make you some, don't worry\" reassured the blue haired pear \"greedy girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled softly as she got comfy, looking over Bo as she very hungrily tore through her stack of waffles, curiousity spiking as she watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal with you and food?\" asked the brunettte innocently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" mumbled Bo through a mouth of pastries as a line of syrup ran down her chin and across her second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're definitely bigger than the last time I saw you\" tiptoed Ashley as she watched her friend swallow and wipe her chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, I'm a naturally gluttonous person and Jen is a bad influence on people\" retorted Bo simply before biting into her next waffle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't like it on you or?\" asked Ashley, resting an elbow on the table and her chin in her hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, turns out I do actually really like it on me, just needed Jenna to unlock that realisation\" mused Bo<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not convinced, Ashley lent back and folded her arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously\" started Bo with a wry smile \"a girl does not get to look like this if she doesn't enjoy it\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, Bo pushed herself up and whipped her shirt clean off and tossed it to one side<br>\r\n\"See?\"<br>\r\nSlightly taken aback, Ashley couldn't help but stare over Bo's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bottom heaviness was no mystery to anyone who knew her and, needless to say, a single chair could not contain all of her arse which bulged impressively over the edges of any such furnishing.<br>\r\nAlongside her rear was, of course, her bulging hips which were only fractionally behind her ass and were topped with a meaty muffin top to boot which was currently getting a gentle squeeze from Bo herself as she posed for her guest.<br>\r\nAlthough slightly less known than her backside, Bo's thighs were pretty legendary within her friendship circle sporting a delicate coating of cellulite around their impressive girth.<br>\r\nMore surprising to most though was Bo's upper half, sporting an impressive belly that exceeded the limit of her now discarded bed shirt alongside some modestly plump boobs and meaty arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" mumbled Ashley under her breath in awe of her friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ash, I'm taken\" teased the mostly naked host as she sat back down to finish her waffles, not replacing her shirt in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring, another question sprung to the brunette's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, personal much\" feigned Bo, throwing a cheeky smile to indicate her joking \"276 though seeing as you did ask\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's like 90lbs heavier than me\" declared Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, genetics play a big part in me being THIS big for my weight sweets\" added Bo \"you should see my sister, curves for days that girl and shes not even fat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded slowly as it all sank in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you still want some more waffles?\" asked Bo, dropping her fork heavily to bring Ashley back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley thought for a moment before simply nodding \"please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick of her hair, Bo stood and padded to the oven once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Ash, I think you'll be just fine\" purred Bo<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly able to smile sheepishly, Ashley waited patiently for her waffles, lost in her mind as she did</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"God, that Ashley is such a flake\" sneered Danielle, having just heard the news that her supposed internship leader was nowhere to be seen for the fourth day on the trot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so cruel Dani\" chimed the ever chirpy Sarah from behind her desk, backed onto the bitchy brunette's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's supposed to be showing us how to be business women and she's not even professional enough to turn up\" spat Danielle from behind her computer, the screen reflecting sharply in her glasses to show that the demeaning woman was only flicking through Facebook as she condemned her superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like we're on a time limit here, I mean, back in England we do these things called work placements where you spend a week in a place of work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Urgh, does she ever stop talking about England?' thought Danielle, continuing to idly scroll through her social media without a care in the world for what the young Brit opposite her was saying to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh\" grunted Danielle in the hopes that a simple placative response would be enough to spur the blonde into carrying on her tale without further involvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I know you're not listening so I'm just going to stop talking\" announced Sarah with something of a wry look, knowing all too well that her colleague had not been listening to her at any point.<br>\r\nFortunately, Sarah was too much the optimist for Danielle's grating attitude to have an effect.<br>\r\nThat is, unlike the poor soul who had just entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, erm, Lucielle wants to speak to us all in her office so could you guys come through...please?\" stammered the ever shy Shelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, how exciting\" mused Sarah with a warm smile \"We'll be right through sweetie\"<br>\r\nDespite the younger girl's quiet tendencies, Sarah had taken quite a shine to Shelly and often tried to make the easily flustered individual apart of the group.<br>\r\nShe didn't like to assume, it wouldn't be British afterall, but Sarah hoped that Shelly at least felt a smidge more comfortable when in her company, certainly more than some individuals anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, fat cow WOULD make the meeting in her office\" groaned Danielle as she stood and brushed herself down, smoothing her skirt gently against her shapely legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're so trim it won't bother you in the slightest\" retorted Sarah in a rare glimmer of bite.<br>\r\nDanielle momentarily stiffened at the incursion but quickly took it in her stride before pacing after Shelly, high heels clicking sternly on the floor behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning ladies, sorry for all the disruption lately\" started Lucielle as she welcomed the six intern girls into her office \"it has proven quite the challenge managing you all whilst Ashley has been away but I think we're starting to work through the teething pains now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the girls simply nodded whilst an audible tsk came from Danielle's scornful direction<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already formed a not too flattering opinion of Danielle, Lucielle brushed the sound effect off before continuing with the meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I've been talking to Jenna and I think we've found a way to make this all work that bit smoother\" announced Lucielle as she casually reached for a doughnut before her \"please, help yourselves\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive of the girls dove in to varying degrees of enthusiasm whilst Danielle lent back in her chair with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway\" continued Lucielle as she bit into her doughnut \"to streamline, we've decided that Carri will be joining myself and Shelly for the time being and Codi will be moving to work alongside Pauline on the front desk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to remain professional, it was clear that the two youngest interns were pleased to be working together.<br>\r\nIt was not lost on most of the group that the two were close friends and also deeply nervous of their positions so it would no doubt help them both greatly to be able to work alongside each other once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess excited at their pairing, however, were Pauline and Codi.<br>\r\nAs far as character profiles go, these two could not be more polar opposites.<br>\r\nCodi was a rather subdued goth girl with a snarky attitude to boot whereas Pauline was the quintessential plump girl, all smiles and cheer whereever she went.<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the two girls had not spent much time together to this point and neither was relishing the prospect of having to work so closely together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know you've all started to settle into your initial positions but unfortunately sometimes changes have to be made for the good of the company\" said Lucielle, sensing the momentary tension between the polar opposite girls before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly munching on their doughnuts, or, in the case of Danielle, scornfully burning a hole in the wall behind Lucielle's head, quiet chitchat started to swarm through the group as Lucielle made some notes on her computer, three doughnuts disappearing in the process.<br>\r\nIt wasn't long, however, before the titanic blonde addressed the group once again<br>\r\n\"Ok, does anybody have any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence befell the group once again until a delicate thin arm raised into the air.<br>\r\n\"Hi, I just wondered what was going to happen with me and Danielle now that Ashley isn't here to mentor us?\" asked Sarah gently, a little surprised at the lack of mention of herself or Danielle for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes\" started Lucielle \"you two are a slightly more complicated case so I wanted to talk to the pair of you in private if that's ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just so I know\" smiled Sarah as she lowered her hand again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle simply nodded, her eyes not moving from their predetermined spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other girls piled out of the office, Danielle and Sarah made their way to seats much closer to Lucielle's desk.<br>\r\n\"So as I mentioned, your situation is a little more complicated as Ashley was going to be directly mentoring the two of you with how the business is run and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that\" asserted Danielle, cutting across Lucielle's line of conversation rather sternly \"Ashley is only the receptionist here so how can she possibly mentor us on business?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing full well Danielle was something of a firecracker given her history with Ashley, Lucielle was well prepared for any mutinies against her friend, all the more defensive given the delicate situation following her break up.<br>\r\n\"Well for your information, Ashley is an essential part of how Gordge operates\" asserted Lucielle, rather more bluntly than she may have preferred \"Ashley organises everybody's appointments, manages essential client files and is in control of the companys' annual budget, second only to accounting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, ok\" gasped Danielle, under her breath, taken aback by the full frontal assault in response to her far from innocent jab against Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the same, given her absence, Jenna has constructed a very special task for you both\" continued Lucielle, clasping her fingers together around the peak of her impressive belly as she spoke.<br>\r\n\"In line with both of your obvious potential and abilities, Jenna has compiled a mock company system for each of you to run\"<br>\r\nThe two interns nodded intently, keen to impress and succeed for their respective reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this in mind, you will be meeting with and securing clients, managing budgets and stock whilst also managing a team of AI staff members that will present their own challenges for you\" concluded Lucielle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AI staff?\" asked Sarah, a look of confusion on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't fully understand it myself but from what Jenna has told me that the system interacts with you and sets up problems not unlike real staff, all through your computer in an 'instant messager' style\" explained Lucielle to the still confused Sarah, not looking too convinced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're basically setting us up as managers?\" pushed Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is basically it, thank you Danielle\" nodded Lucielle \"we're not expecting you to grasp it straight away, afterall, managing isn't as easy as it may look but hopefully your talents will shine through soon enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself over a perceived advantage at simply understanding the task, Danielle cockily rested back in her seat, arms folded and one leg crossed over the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thank you for the opportunity here\" beamed Sarah \"does this mean we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sarah, you will get to have business lunches IF you can get any clients\" teased Lucielle, remembering the Brit's earlier enthusiasm for such things<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" hissed Sarah softly, excitement bubbling up as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that is all sorted, do you have any questions about the task ahead of you?\" asked Lucielle again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah simply shook her head with excitement whilst Danielle practically strode out of her chair, heading straight for the door without even speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, well check your emails when you get out there and all will be explained on how to start the project\" shouted Lucielle so that both girls heard, even the tall brunette already half way back to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Danielle, I just wanted to wish you good luck, this task sounds really exciting\" bounced Sarah, having finally caught up to the leggy brunette<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle simply grunted as she took her seat again and went to her emails.<br>\r\n\"Mhm you too\" muttered the brunette \"just don't get suckered into this office's weird fat dynamic, I can't concentrate if you ended up so fat your belly hangs out on your desk\"<br>\r\nAssuming a joke, Sarah retorted in kind<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, I don't wanna see your thighs bursting out of your skimpy skirts either\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle didn't reply at this point, furiously hammering away on her keyboard instead as acrylic nails flashed red back and forth over the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Strange girl' thought Sarah as she took to her own keyboard with much less aggression.</span></div></div>",

as the pair began to work through their exciting new task.<br>\r\nSadly for the Brit, however, her enjoyment hadn't been QUITE as subtle as she had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can pipe down as well, this isn't easy\" bluntly spat Danielle, frustration bubbling more as the tattooed brunette angrily clicked her mouse repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where are you stuck?\" asked Sarah, genuinely wishing to offer some guidance.<br>\r\nDespite the task having a competitive element to it, the younger girl saw no reason why she had to fall out with Danielle over it, not to say the two were on a study basis of friendship by any definition at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know\" sighed Danielle, thrusting herself away from her desk to stretch her long thin legs under her desk as her arms fell either side of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come to you then\" chirped Sarah, hopping from her chair to saunter round their adjoining desks to look over Danielle's computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes, Danielle shoved herself further out from her desk as Sarah shimmied in front of her.<br>\r\nAs the young blonde got to examining where Danielle had become stuck, she couldn't help but find herself vaguely examining the pert bottom of her colleague as it floated in front of her.<br>\r\nDespite her earlier quip about Sarah getting fat, Danielle did have to admit that Sarah wasn't shy in the looks department.<br>\r\nNot Danielle attractive but she was ok for an English broad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what's happened, you've swapped order numbers with quantities so you're spreadsheets are calculating the company as bankrupt\" declared Sarah with a, perceived by Danielle, sanctimonious air to her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh screw you\" hissed Danielle, putting her in the firing line as least subtle of the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to help\" retorted Sarah, feeling a little hurt as she turned to face Danielle, folding her arms as she did to assert some dominance over the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well really you're just been a show boaty bitch\" sneered Danielle, standing from her office chair and assuming the same stance as Sarah, making a far more imposing figure with her height advantage, heels or not \"I don't need your help Notting Hill so back off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah quietly seethed as her cheeks began to flush.<br>\r\nSarah and Codi had established something of a playful banter between themselves with the whole 'Union' nickname, but Danielle's reference felt much more menacing as the blonde looked her up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought\" goaded Danielle as she slowly lowered back into her seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah also returned to her seat, quickly enough to avoid Danielle seeing the full heat of her cheeks, before returning to her own task.<br>\r\nDespite really wanting to, Sarah thought better of informing the girl opposite her that she was considerably further ahead than she was in their task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Danielle had finally worked out what she was doing wrong and, much to the hurt of her pride, Sarah had been right.<br>\r\nThat didn't matter though as the brunette was now steaming through her workload at a much more acceptable pace.<br>\r\nNeedless to say, she felt much more at ease as she repeatedly clocked Sarah disappearing to the break room and reappearing with some form of sweet confection or another either in her hand or disappearing into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you, keep eating like that and you can get a different desk far away from me\" muttered Danielle in the direction of Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll park my new desk next to the stick up your arse\" Sarah bit back with a stinking glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unlike the Brit to throw such vicious words at people but the events of earlier had riled her up and her feelings towards Danielle were far from her usual sunny outlook on others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle rolled her eyes, lashes batting slightly as she did before going back to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I'm not so paranoid about my figure that I have to deny myself the odd nice thing\" continued Sarah, placing a slice of cake down beside her keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffffft\" spat Danielle, holding back the urge to laugh rather undignified \"you have been to the break room...nine times in the past four hours\"<br>\r\nThe brunette had paused momentarily to consult her notebook where she had tallied each one of Sarah's trips.<br>\r\n\"Don't need to be paranoid when you are riding head long into Lucielle territory with that appetite\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned that her movements had been tracked, Sarah swallowed hard before responding to the allegations.<br>\r\n\"Well how about you show me how it's done? Prove its so easy to avoid the break room and then you can mock my fat arse all the live long day\" challenged Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ain't going to happen\" mused Danielle \"I don't eat shit like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then lose your right to complain at me enjoying myself\" nodded Sarah, feeling a victory within her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering her options, none of which included losing, Danielle finally threw herself up out of her chair.<br>\r\n\"Fine! If it'll shut you up\" announced the brunette before marching swiftly towards the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skinny bitch\" muttered Sarah, taking another bite from her cake as Danielle stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus this place is disgusting\" mumbled Danielle as she slid into the break room.<br>\r\nThankfully nobody else was there to witness her moment of sin as she slowly paced around the room, observing all the things the fat asses of the office had lying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCakes<br>\r\nDoughnuts<br>\r\nPastries<br>\r\nA quick glance in the chrome double fridge showed an array of takeout left overs and meals some of the other girls had brought in, prepared from home<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe content of food aside, the portions were the only thing that shocked Danielle more, no wonder everyone was so huge here.<br>\r\nA twisted grimace painted across her face, Danielle found herself unintentionally gravitating towards a plate of muffins sat on the table.<br>\r\nA delicate hand written note simply reading 'eat up' was proving more tempting than she had hoped but, still not willing to lose out to Sarah, Danielle reached out and grabbed a rather voluminous double chocolate specimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do\" grumbled Danielle as she quickly made for the door again, desperate to not be seen on her scandalous crusade as she bolted back to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? One trip and I am done for the day\" declared Danielle triumphantly as she sat down opposite Sarah, taking something of a victory bite from her muffin<br>\r\n'Damn this thing IS good' thought Danielle, her will power ensuring she didn't gulp the whole thing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will see how you fair throughout the day\" plainly spoke Sarah as she continued on with her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare to eat your words, least they have no calories\" replied the rather snooty Danielle as she delicately nibbled at her muffin some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" replied Sarah with a complete lack of enthusiasm, fingers working the keyboard as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is\" said Danielle, becoming slightly unnerved as to who she was speaking to more at this point.<br>\r\n'Damn muffin, I'm gonna have to work extra hard at the gym tonight'</span></div></div>",

away at one of the computers that had been set up for herself and Carri in Lucielle's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarri, however, seemed less sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm really understanding this program...\" stammered Carri, still nervous and eager to impress all in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on\" replied Shelly as she glided in front of her friends computer so as to take a look \"ok, it's simple really, once you've inputted an appointment you just press the enter key and it will upload to Lucielle's...erm, the boss's calender automatically\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe correction made Lucielle chuckle, even if she was technically the girls superior she had mentally decided that being called 'the boss' wasn't something she would insist upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, that makes more sense\" murmured Carri as she resumed typing herself for a moment before receiving a rather satisfying ping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" cheered Carri, losing her keenly guarded work ethic for a moment of celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle clapped softly from behind the girls to mark her approval of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could be wrong but I think that sounds like a good place to call it off for lunch now ladies\" cooed the hefty blonde from her desk seat, adjusting herself slightly which in turn produced a hearty groan from the furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already?\" asked Shelly, checking her watch before giving the dial an authoritative tap with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, an army marches on its stomach and I'm sure you've realised by now that this office is no different\" purred Lucielle as she felt a hunger start to build within her.<br>\r\nIt was definitely lunch time by her reckoning and she knew full well that Alex would not approve of her skipping a meal for something as trivial as work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, time flies\" muttered Carri, still rather nervous having only worked in her new position for a few hours after the reshuffle that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly does\" smiled Lucielle as she labouriously heaved herself up from her chair \"How about we order in from the sandwich shop down the street again Shelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, that place was really nice\" mirrored Shelly having had lunch there a few times prior to Carri's reassignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, Shelly had had lunch with Lucielle every day since starting the intern program and it was starting to show.<br>\r\nAlthough having only worked there a few days, Shelly had found herself indulging in the office's universally accepted past time of eating and, apparently, her nerves had led her to indulge more than she normally would have.<br>\r\nAs such, a delicate layer of bloating had started to form around her usually slender middle.<br>\r\nLargely completely unnoticeable, Shelly caught the odd glimpse of it when getting ready for the day but, up to now, it hadn't bothered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly is\" replied Lucielle as she gently stroked her own immense belly through the fabric of her work shirt \"how about you take Carri with you, I'll phone my order ahead so you two will just have to pick what you want when you get there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" smiled Shelly.<br>\r\nHer nerves really did subside when she was with Lucielle and she almost started to feel comfortable in her role as her assistant.<br>\r\nHopefully her nerves would only improve now that Carri would be working alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it not weird working with somebody that...\" started Carri, unsure of how to proceed as the girls climbed out of Shelly's car having now pulled up at the sandwich shop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"fat?\" finished Shelly, knowing full well her friends sentiment.<br>\r\nShe hadn't been the first to ask, lets just leave it at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\nCarri shrunk into herself a little, she didn't want to offend anybody but it was impossible to deny that Lucielle was a big girl.<br>\r\nMost of the girls at the office were some degree of big when she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not bad really, I mean we do know her, remember?\" retorted Shelly as she grabbed the door to the sandwich shop, holding it to let another customer out first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarri squinted for a moment as she tried to remember before it finally dawned on her.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, at the restaurant\" nodded the younger ex waitress as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" smiled Shelly as she browsed all the options available in the glass counter \"I mean, we wouldn't have even applied for the internship if Lucielle and her friends hadn't come to the restaurant that night when she left her business card\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True\" muttered Carri as she also browsed the many sandwich options, slightly more distracted by the smells of the shop which were new to her unlike her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get you ladies?\" called a dumpy middle aged woman from behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I believe I'm picking up a delivery for a Lucielle from Gordge Inc?\" started Shelly, recalling that Lucielle was on first name basis with this particular sandwich shop.<br>\r\nCome to think of it, Lucielle had been on first name terms with ALL of the shops they had ordered lunch from that week and Shelly hazarded to guess that that was not the limit of her close food contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, she's on the phone now, still ordering\" smiled the server, all knowing of Lucielle's eating reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd probably go out of business if not for you girls over at Gordge\" she joked as she lent against the counter \"What can I get for you two whilst Karen finishes with Lucielle's order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly laughed at the suggestion that Gordge alone kept this place afloat, as true as it might have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I have two french baguettes, one as a BLT with ranch dressing and the second with turkey, bacon and jack cheese please\" asked Shelly, realising that she would probably return to this particular shop again giving her another chance to order something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\" nodded the serving woman as she rang the order into the till \"and you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarri flinched slightly at being directly acknowledged but recovered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, could I have the cheeseburger please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can if you're sure\" teased the woman behind the counter, a hand on one flared hip now as the other rested on the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarri nodded before having a thought \"could I have extra onions on that too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir server simply nodded with a smile as she finished inputting the order before leaning back to peer into the back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucielle done yet?\" shouted the woman, holding onto the front of the register as she did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet!\" called another woman's voice, an air of exasperation to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first woman simply rolled her eyes before looking back to the young girls before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls best take a seat, this could take a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god you're back\" cooed Lucielle as her door swung open, allowing in the thick aroma of the food that had been ordered which was deeply inhaled by the blonde heifer behind her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, who got the cheeseburger?\" asked Lucielle, all too familiar with all the smells currently bombarding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was me\" muttered Carri, slightly bemused at her senior's ability to pick out an individual item amongst the onslaught of smells<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice, hope you brought your appetite\" teased Lucielle as Shelly gradually emptied Lucielle's order onto her desk, leaving just her own and Carri's sandwiches<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am kind of hungry\" admitted Carri as she sat in her chair again just in time for Shelly to place a large box into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarri looked shocked, she'd only ordered a cheeseburger so how could she possibly have such a large box.<br>\r\nUpon opening it though, all became clear.<br>\r\nEven having worked in a restaurant for three years prior to the internship, Carri had never seen a burger so big as the damn thing was nearly the size of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can always save some for later\" whispered Shelly \"just keep it on your desk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarri's stunned look slowly melted away as the smell of beef and cheese wafted into her nostrils and she got a sneaking suspicion that little of the burger would survive past lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, very little of anything survived past the lunch hour the three girls had.<br>\r\nNo cheeseburger remnants, no second sandwich as Shelly had intended and certainly nothing Lucielle had ordered.<br>\r\nAll that did remain in the office were three very happy workers, albeit with an air of sleepiness to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, shall we carry on for a little bit before home time girls?\" asked Lucielle, rubbing her now exposed belly generously with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan\" replied Carri on autopilot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving never heard Carri speak first in all the time she had been at Gordge, Lucielle was slightly taken aback but she did manage to conceal her surprise so as not to scare the poor intern before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long now ladies\" purred the contented Lucielle, still cradling her engorged belly as she turned to face her computer screen slowly.</span></div></div>",

and dumping her handbag not far past the overly packed furnishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the sentiment was a well known one, its utterance was becoming more and more frequent, particularly once the typically angry brunette had got home.<br>\r\nShe often vented her frustration under her breath through mouthfuls of pastries or leftover takeout food that some of the other girls had 'kindly' left in the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, despite her persistence only a two short weeks back that she wouldn't use the break room again, Danielle had folded.<br>\r\nTwice again on the day of goading that had caused her first venture.<br>\r\nMultiple times every day after that without fail.<br>\r\nAnd, more importantly, each and every time she left with something entering or hanging out of her mouth as she refused to eat with the other blimps of the office even if they were keeping a watchful eye on her frequent trips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle was pissed at herself for letting Sarah get under her skin and FORCING her to go to the break room and show her how to resist the many temptations left out for the ambling heifers she worked with.<br>\r\nThe brunette intern was also (partially) convinced that Sarah had set this as a trap to detract from her own trips to the break room which, being honest, had worked if that was the intention as Danielle no longer counted how many times her colleague left her desk for something to eat.<br>\r\nInstead that tally was left open for how many times Danielle herself left her desk and committed culinary sin in the eyes of the gym junky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly at this moment though, Danielle was pissed with herself for still being stood on her feet as she mentally moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an angry puffing sound exhaling from the leather bound cushion, Danielle flopped into the cool depths of her sofa instantly feeling better for no longer holding herself up.<br>\r\nLost in the comfort, the leggy brunette slowly stretched herself out across the length of the sofa, resting her head on one of the brown arms before casually flicking the tv on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding nothing but trashy 'reality' programs, Danielle could feel herself becoming aware of a tightness around her hips and middle.<br>\r\nDisgruntled at the thought whilst being semi-aware of what was causing it, Danielle tossed herself onto her back and took hold of her skirt clasp before slowly parting the opening in the material and allowing herself to breath outwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly relieved, Danielle couldn't help but smile softly as she kicked her skirt off, allowing it to slide off the opposite sofa arm onto the floor with a soft thud before coming to terms with what had just happened.<br>\r\nLeft in just her button-up shirt which she proceeded to slowly unbutton, Danielle found herself face to face with the problem that was haunting her since joining Gordge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a naturally shapely and curvaceous woman, Danielle did not relish the view before her as her stomach was looking just a little more weighty than she would have liked.<br>\r\nCompletely enhanced in her own mind, Danielle was far from even chubby compared to the woman that started at Gordge, but the evidence of a slight softness combined with the gentle outward bulge of said softness was a little too much for the brunette to accept.<br>\r\nThe evident pale red band where her skirt had pinched her slightly bloated middle for the duration of the day did not aid the aesthetic in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning at her own near non-existent weight gain, Danielle threw herself up from the sofa, discarding her shirt in the process and stormed off to the bathroom.<br>\r\nAs the now underwear clad office worker crossed her flat not even an inch of wobble betrayed her recent spell of gluttony but Danielle was too far gone to think rationally as she slammed the bathroom door before starting the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving washed most of her day's troubles away, Danielle now stood in her steamy bathroom eyeing the outline of herself in the over-sink mirror as condensation slowly disappeared from the edges of the glass.<br>\r\nSighing heavily, Danielle slowly traced the flaming floral patterns dancing around her upper arms and shoulders.<br>\r\nWhilst quite intimidating, Danielle's tattoos had being a gift to herself once she had reached her goal weight after working with that bitch Ashley<br>\r\n\"What a great trainer she's turned out to be\" sneered Danielle to herself as she wrapped herself a little tighter in her towel before grabbing a smaller one to start wringing her hair with, content the first wouldn't slip over her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst fiddling with her brunette locks, Danielle caught a glimpse of her scales resting against the sink.<br>\r\nShe hadn't used those in months, probably years now that she thought about it, but something was proving quite alluring about dragging the things out and taking a step onto them.<br>\r\nDanielle shook her head though before continuing on with her hair, feeling the urge to drag her eyes away from the glass scales beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smattering of anger rising in her throat, Danielle threw the towel she was drying her hair with to one side before bending down and dragging the scales out in front of her.<br>\r\nProdding the cold surface with her toe to activate the machine, she huffed with impatience, clinging the larger towel to her body having loosened the knot from under her arm.<br>\r\nEventually, the scales beeped their awakened chime as the display flashed blue before settling to an unladen '0.0lbs'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring tentatively at the scales, Danielle felt herself drawing slightly closer to them, one foot with her perfectly painted red nails raised ready to step and discover her fate.<br>\r\n\"Urgh, get yourself together Dani!\" her internal monologue screamed as a slight recoil pulled her foot back to the ground.<br>\r\nBreathing slowly to reclaim her nerves, Danielle once again raised her foot before slowly stepping over the scales.<br>\r\nHer teeth taking hold of her lower lip, the brunette then forced her foot to start descending, jumping slightly as her big toe caught the cold glass unexpectedly.<br>\r\nA digital beep rang through the steamy bathroom as her whole foot planted against the glass and, feeling much braver now, Danielle readied herself to step fully onto the glass platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING DONG*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" howled Danielle as she jumped back off the scales, the movement causing her to partially detowel and expose herself to a non-existent audience.<br>\r\nOpening the bathroom door with a billow of steam following her, Danielle glared at the front door as if trying to peer through the wood to see who had interrupted her in this pivotal moment.<br>\r\nAlmost on cue though, and without showing themselves through the solid material, the doorbell chimed through the flat again.<br>\r\n\"For god's sake\" huffed Danielle, discarding her towel completely causing her to briefly wander to her bedroom completely naked, before grabbing a thin robe which she threw over her shoulders hurriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely tying the thin material together over her front before whipping the door open, Danielle's mood continued to smolder at the unsuspecting guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi there, delivery?\" stammered the acne ridden teenager stood in the shared hall outside her flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" scalded the unimpressed brunette as she leaned against the doorframe with her arms folded, well aware the poor boy before her was caught up giving her the once over rather than doing his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food delivery, from Wui's? You ordered Chinese earlier for delivery at 6?\" continued the startled delivery boy as he attempted to recompose himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? I've never ordered Chinese food from any Wong's\"<br>\r\nDanielle knew after she'd said it she'd got the restaurant name wrong but she didn't care, as if she hadn't eaten enough that day to then be told she'd apparently ordered take out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can assure you we received an order to be brought to this address at this time and...\"<br>\r\nPatience well and truly ran out, Danielle closed the door in the kid's face before striding back towards her sofa.<br>\r\nNo sooner had she sat down a whimsical ping radiated from her phone signifying a text.<br>\r\nExasperated as she was, Danielle was a sucker for her phone and for all she knew it was a notification from Tinder or one of the other dating apps she used to flex her femme fatality upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly though, it was a confimation message.<br>\r\nFrom Just Eat.<br>\r\nSaying her delivery from Wui's Chinese had just been delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing heavily, Danielle threw herself up from the sofa and went for the door<br>\r\n\"Screw you Sarah\" she muttered as she opened the door again, only to startle the delivery boy still stood at her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't shout at me again please...\" begged the boy as he adjusted his delivery cap nervously.<br>\r\nFortunately for him, Danielle didn't speak at all, rather she simply snatched the bag from his hands before slamming the door shut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping heavily back onto the sofa for the third time that night, Danielle dug into the bag of food she'd just recieved, groaning at every step as more containers came out than she could have even guessed she had pre-ordered.<br>\r\n\"We have got to get back to the gym girl\" mumbled Danielle to herself as she cracked open a serving of sweet and sour pork before taking another sweep of the tv channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly though, she had declared that fact every day since promising it to that first break room muffin and she was yet to follow through on any of those occurrences.</span></div></div>",

shelling her shoes from her chubby feet.<br>\r\nHaving spent a large part of the day eating with Shelly and Carri, Lucielle was certainly feeling fuller than when she\u2019d left that morning, not that the feeling was a bad thing in the hulking blonde\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvening baby, how was work?\u201d called Alex from the other end of the home as the unmistakeable sounds of kitchenware clattering around echoes down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh it was fine\u201d chirped Lucielle as she started up the hall in search of her boyfriend, hips shaking violently with each step as her immense bulk jiggled under its own momentum \u201cjust a quiet day with the girls\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiles to himself all knowing at what that meant, becoming quietly aware of Lucielle\u2019s thundering footfalls coming closer.<br>\r\n\u201cThey still good on the lunch run?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cOh they manage, not as good as you though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex wiped his hands on the front of his jeans and turned just in time to see Lucielle side step through the kitchen door so as to allow her enlarged hips to fit through without wedging her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you certainly look well for it sweetie\u201d cooed Alex as he glanced over Lucielle\u2019s end of day state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle laughed again, taking on a coy attitude as she playfully turned on her toes slightly with a flirtatious smile.<br>\r\nTrying not to become mesmerised by her rhythmic swaying, Alex refocused on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are the chances you still have some space in that belly of yours?\u201d asked Alex, taking on a coy facet of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you find out yourself?\u201d teased Lucielle, biting her lip slightly to accentuate the tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex didn\u2019t need any more of an invite then that.<br>\r\nApparently Lucielle\u2019s teasing nature had been provoked with her own sentiment as well as, with a sultry slowness to it, she softly tucked her fingers into the hem of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing full well that Alex was watching her, the blonde then slowly pulled on her skirt, edging it inch by inch down her pale bulging love handles.<br>\r\nAs the thick rolls of fat swelled out of her restrictive leg wear, her downward progress halted with the hem now trapped at each side under the hanging extents of her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing Alex a teasing half smile through her fringe, Lucielle then moved her hands from her hips and around her front, gently caressing her roundness as she went.<br>\r\nFingers crawling down her belly, she then proceeded to dig under her skirt again, taking a firm hold of her currently tucked in belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as slowly as with her skirt, Lucielle proceeded to untuck her immense belly one pale bulging inch of stretch mark riddled flesh at a time.<br>\r\nAs her huge belly hung heavily in front of her tree trunk thighs free of its confines, the blonde took to gently kneading her belly fat between her chubby fingers, quietly moaning as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFascinated as his 600lb girlfriend fondled herself, Alex forced himself to refocus himself.<br>\r\n\u201cA belly that soft definitely isn\u2019t full I think\u201d purred Alex, fluidly opening the fridge door, grabbing a tray of large chocolate and cream eclairs before stepping up against Lucielle.<br>\r\nBefore anything else could be said, one such eclair was raised to Lucielle\u2019s lips pausing only momentarily as her reflexes kicked in to accept the sweet treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, the kitchen was filled with the sounds of an exceptionally heavy blonde woman moaning as cream and pastry filled her mouth, stopping only briefly as the remaining piece of eclair followed the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019a girl\u201d purred Alex as he slowly traced the soft skin bulging between the flaps of a tightly buttoned shirt stretched to its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle either couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t talk at that moment as she swallowed the sizeable mouthful of pastry in her mouth, licking her lips of any residue only to have a second eclair fill the void within her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutonomous tendencies taking hold, a third followed closely behind only to have a fourth chase it down, all the while as Alex gently teased Lucielle\u2019s deep belly button whilst groping her heavy lower belly roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment seemed to last a long time, travelling in slow motion as the couple drew close with Lucielle dangling on Alex\u2019s every feeding motion untill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING DONG*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one second babe\u201d cooed Alex as he handed the eclairs to Lucielle accompanied with a playful slap to the belly as he strode towards the front door, leaving Lucielle to her own devices.<br>\r\nThe blonde was almost oblivious as Alex walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there mister, got some food here for ya\u201d chirped a rather chipper delivery girl as Alex opened the door \u201cyou having a party in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that\u201d smirked the currently unabashed feeder as he obscured his lower half with the door to avoid suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u201d smiled the delivery girl as she began to hand over box after box of piping hot food.<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t go unnoticed that the delivery girl was packing some extra poundage, although Alex supposed that was to be expected given her line of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last few boxes were handed over, the girl at the door caught a glance of the heifer sized blonde in the kitchen at the other end of the house currently glutting herself on eclairs with her belly hanging free.<br>\r\nThe sight, although not repulsive, did send a flicker of self questioning through the delivery girls mind though as she considered her own extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for all that\u201d said Alex as he counted out the money from his wallet \u201cdon\u2019t forget to get yourself something when you get back, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of eating after spying Lucielle made the girl squirm slightly, even if the prospect of blimping up that much was unrealistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slid the door shut again, Alex turned with a huge grin on his face.<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry babe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just finished her eclairs, the answer was obvious coming from Lucielle.<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet I am\u201d purred the blonde as she turned to face her boyfriend approaching, her girth clear as the edge of her hips disappeared behind the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve never had to order a second time in one sitting before\u201d observed Alex as he rubbed Lucielle\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUUUURP...mhm...URRP\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle was far too concentrated on filling her face to talk, a quite remarkable thing seeing as she\u2019d not stopped eating since that first eclair.<br>\r\nThe softness in her belly had also reduced considerably as the night drew on, although that is hardly surprising given the sheer quantity of food the blonde had consumed without moving an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, two huge takeout orders is impressive but there was all that pasta and pie that I made for you as well\u201d cooed Alex, continuing to dote on his girlfriend verbally whilst massaging her much firmer belly \u201cnot to mention the fridge load of desserts you\u2019ve inhaled as well\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle felt considerably turned on hearing just how much she had eaten, even if a full sensation was starting to build up, even more so in reflection at how much she\u2019d eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to mention you burst nearly every button on your shirt\u201d teased Alex, taking on a more whispering tone now as he learnt against Lucielle\u2019s fat rolls to talk into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat broke the blondes concentration, leaving her to moan softly as she recalled each individual button bursting off her rounded gut as the calories mounted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThought you\u2019d like that\u201d mused Alex as he rolled away from his girlfriend into the barely large enough part of sofa left for him next to Lucielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you just enjoy fattening me up\u201d purred Lucielle with a sideways glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww damn, you got me\u201d remarked Alex, trying to bite back too large a laugh before it escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle rolled her eyes with a soft tut before hunkering down slightly in her seat, accentuating her usual double belly slightly even in her stuffed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is kind of hot though, right?\u201d returned Lucielle with a playful glimmer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely is babe\u201d smiled Alex before leaning in for an deeply passionate kiss, an arm laying across the peak of Lucielle\u2019s belly as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning girls\u201d chirped Lucielle as she walked into her office, still feeling a little tight after her immense feast from the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey boss!\u201d returned Shelly and Carri with mixed levels of enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde superior slowly made her way around her desk and delicately, or at least as delicate as a woman of her size can, placed herself into her executive chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour breakfast should be here shortly\u201d declared Shelly without breaking eye contact with the paperwork she was skimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww you\u2019re so sweet you two, thank you\u201d replied Lucielle even if the thought of food did raise a minor question in her mind after the extent of her feasting the night before.<br>\r\nShe\u2019d barely been able to find a shirt big enough that morning to cover herself in the aftermath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the least I hope you got something for yourselves\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh we did\u201d smiled Shelly, knowing all to well the routine there in that Lucielle would not allow anybody to go hungry on her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle simply smiled in her content for the situation, little moments of flashback reminding her of the night before.</span></div></div>",

Such asset growth was highlighted this morning with her poor panties nearly completely swallowed by her bulging cheeks which she proceeded to hook out for comfort. As the fabric snapped back to its usual position the stretchy edges bit firmly into the soft flesh beneath.<br>\r\nAs ever her thighs also carried extra weight along with her waist maintaining her well known middle heavy appearance.<br>\r\nDespite her penchant to letting her clothing hug her lower belly curve, the combined increase in girth as well as the increase of weight around her middle had made this long impractical so Bo took instead to exhibiting her growing belly and allowed it to hand free over her waistbands at all times<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready babe!\" called a familiar voice from outside the bedroom which instantly pricked up Bo's ears<br>\r\n\"Oh absolutely\" she cooed in response, adjusting her fuller bra before leaning back onto the edge of the bed causing her sizeable rear to spread even wider.<br>\r\nAs approaching footsteps could be heard outside the room, Bo bit her lip with a wild allure in her eyes, her heart pounding in her chest almost audibly as the person appeared in the doorway before her.<br>\r\nAnd there, completely naked, stood Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, here stands oddity number two of the past year.<br>\r\nAfter Ashley's unexpected arrival on their doorstep, Jenna and Bo had taken her in and helped her get over her breakup with Don.<br>\r\nThe three became exceptionally close in this time and spent a great deal of time together over the weeks and months and things were going great...up until Jenna came home to see Bo and Ashley entwined with each other on the kitchen floor.<br>\r\nAnd now the weird part, as Jenna promptly joined the two<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough no official label was ever given to what spawned from that day it was pretty reasonable to assume that the three had formed some crazy love triangle type arrangement which, in turn, had led to their living arrangements with the three STILL living in Jenna's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove triangle arrangements aside though, this particular arrangement had also led to interesting occurance of the year number three which was currently stood in Bo's doorway.<br>\r\nAshley had got fat.<br>\r\nPartly fueled by her post-breakup sadness but mostly encouraged by Bo's insatiable doting and Jenna's immensely deep bank account, Ashley had blossomed into quite the fat girl.<br>\r\nThrow in a dash of her crashing metabolism ending her body builder career once and for all and the results were the 331lb bombshell stood before Bo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer figure had quickly morphed into that of an hourglass, her weight distributing evenly top and bottom giving her some bodacious curves in her early gaining days.<br>\r\nAs the food kept coming and her appetite cried for more though, the rest of her started to catch up and developed her not quite dominant belly, rounding out her figure.<br>\r\nNow, stood on the edge of the bedroom, Ashley was a sight to behold and certainly unrecognisable from her former thin self. With thick thighs, bulging wide hips and an unexpected F cup rack, she was still unmistakeably hourglass shaped.<br>\r\nWhen empty, her belly formed a slight second roll around her waist that hung heavily over her crotch along with immensely thick love handles topping off her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her current stance, her enlarged boobs hung slightly as round melons atop her belly, her prominant double chin was delicately smooth and adorable and some surprisingly thick bingo wings adorned the underside of her arms where biceps once formed.<br>\r\nShe was Bo's pet project to boot and absolutely loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing vast curls of her brunette hair over her shoulder, Ashley strutted towards Bo before stopping inches away from her, her body continuing to jiggle a good two seconds after she'd stopped<br>\r\n\"So?\" questioned Ashley, lips curled with her fingers digging softly into her hips<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\" responded Bo before whipping her arms around her second girlfriend's thicker neck and pulled her in to a deep kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while though, Ashley pushed against Bo's shoulders and resumed her hands on hips stance<br>\r\n\"Urgh, always the gooey romantic\" groaned Ashley, with a playful look in her eyes \"can't get fat on kisses babe\"<br>\r\nWith a mild tut in her voice Ashley bent to open a drawer, giving Bo a delightful view of her arse along with a demonstration of how far her belly hangs, and stood again with a funnel in hand<br>\r\nDropping the implement into Bo's thickened lap, Ashley awkwardly clambered onto the bed, assuming a position with her head against the headboard and her legs trailing down the bed.<br>\r\nIn this position her belly also sat on her thighs, deepening the roll around her waist and hips<br>\r\n\"So?\" asked the heavy brunette again expectantly<br>\r\n\"Oh you're so in for it today babe\" teased Bo as she proceeded to bring six pitchers of protein powder infused shakes onto a nearby dressing table<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked over with an intrigued look in her eye before leaning slightly forward, carressing Bo's mammoth hips<br>\r\n\"Only six?\" asked Ashley, coyness dripping off her tongue<br>\r\nBo chuckled at this before pushing Ashley back down onto the bed<br>\r\n\"So lazy, she wont even humour chewing these days\" said Bo to an imaginary observer as she routinely placed the tube into Ashley's mouth and grabbed the first pitcher \"There's real food after these if you're even still hungry\" teased the feeder over Ashley's lap<br>\r\nAshley would have responded but the delicious liquid hit her tongue and blind euphoria took over as her eyes rolled back in her head and she hungrily sucked on the tube between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife since Don had been amazing and she'd never been more in love with anything before the concept of getting fat.</span></div></div>",

It had been a few months since she\u2019d last taken to the scales and a lot had happened since then. Her and Alex had gone strength to strength in the past year and her waistline had beared the brunt of that continuing romance.<br>\r\nLucielle loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Alex...<br>\r\nAlex was unashamedly admiring Lucielle enormously. <br>\r\nShe was the girl of his dreams in every sense of the word and had quite frankly exceeded expectations. After the day she sent him flying in the restaurant, Alex had known he needed to have Lucielle in his life and here they now were, waiting for the beeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady Lu?\u201d asked Alex, his own anticipation building immeasurably at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle simply squawked and clenched her fists as she waited to be read the number<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, here goes...\u201d said Alex as he peered around Lucielle\u2019s protruding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence once again fell on the couple but it was soon broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you are going to LOVE this\u201d declared Alex, playfully pinching Lucielle\u2019s side as he spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! What is it?!\u201d demanded Lucielle, far too excited for politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then\u201d mused Alex \u201c7...2...3\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle just looked down at Alex in complete shock, words lost entirely as she gawked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep\u201d nodded Alex plainly as he stood up and looked over his 700lb girlfriend in admiration.<br>\r\nAnd didn\u2019t she look every single pound of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, clothes had become rather trivial for Lucielle, partly out of comfort and partly due to them lasting two minutes at most when she did wear them. Work had become interesting from the side of things.<br>\r\nNow was no exception mind as the immense blonde stood in some pale blue panties and a highly taxed white vest top.<br>\r\nClothes were just a distraction against the inches and inches of fat blubbery skin though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBottom heavy as ever, Lucielle\u2019s arse bulged behind her in cellulite dappled mounds atop hugely thickened thighs, equally cellulite coated.<br>\r\nHer panties were stretched within an inch of their life, mostly disappeared between the enormous curves of flesh whilst stretched so thinly they were near seethrough.<br>\r\nHer thighs were so heavy that they formed great thick rolls that both members of the couple fawned over as they tapered into deeply dimpled knees atop thick smooth calves.<br>\r\nEven her feet were fat at this point with chubby toes to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs impressive as Lucielle\u2019s bottom half was, at 700 plus pounds it was impossible for the rest of her to not gain a huge amount of weight.<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, her enormous double rolled belly hung heavily over her crotch and more than half way down her thighs. Filling her top half even more were her immensely love handles; thick bulges of fat curving into her heavy belly hang whilst swelling due to the huge weight piled on top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplit by a deep belly button, her upper roll was adorned with rolls of back fat before been topped with an impressive pair of boobs, currently only supported by her own belly and contained within her poor vest top which barely stretched over said chest, never mind any of her expansive belly.<br>\r\nOn the side of all this, Lucielle also sported some meaty flabby arms alongside adorably chubby cheeks and a triple chin to drive Alex wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think then?\u201d asked Alex, genuinely intrigued as Lucielle remained silent<br>\r\nAs the blonde smiled warmly to herself, she slowly stepped back off the scale, every inch of her jiggling as she did.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Lu, I\u2019m dying here!\u201d insisted Alex<br>\r\nSuddenly and without warning for a girl her size, Lucielle turned on her heels and dropped heavily on top of Alex.<br>\r\nI mean, all 723lbs of heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinded and squashed between his huge girlfriend and the poor groaning sofa beneath them both, Lucielle smiled beautifully before kissing Alex deeply.<br>\r\nHands a plenty as he pawed over Lucielle\u2019s bountiful fat, Alex felt himself growing in arousal to whole new levels, only to have Lucielle break away to look deeply in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou keep feeding me Alex, seriously, I want to get SOOO fat\u201d pleaded Lucielle \u201cI have NEVER been so happy as I am now and I can\u2019t wait to get fatter\u201d<br>\r\nThe blonde was biting her lip seductively at this point as she looked her boyfriend over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think I can do that\u201d smiled Alex<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d purred Lucielle as she labourisly rolled off of her boyfriend sending her body into a violent jiggle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot needing to be told twice, Alex sprung up from his seat and grabbed a dense two tiered chocolate cake layered in cream cheese frosting from the trolley he had brought in.<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Alex mounted Lucielle\u2019s huge belly, knees tucked into the roll of fat over her hips before breaking off a large chunk of cake ready to feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s to the oncoming 800lbs then\u201d mused Alex as he brought the cake to Lucielle\u2019s plump lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde chuckled, causing ripples of fat to wave through her belly, jostling Alex on his perch, before responding.<br>\r\n\u201cMhm, for a start\u201d purred the blonde, hungrily tearing a mouthful of cake from the chunk before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was moments like this that had led Lucielle to take large chunks of personal time off of work lately, not that anybody minded, and fortunately for her someone had taken over the intern program.<br>\r\nThe only question now though, is who?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah had had an exceptional year.<br>\r\nHaving fluked her way onto the internship program in the first place she could never have dreamed to have got this far in just 12 short months, but here she was, sat at the top of the pyramid now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll credit to her mind, Sarah had worked her ass off getting to where she was now, not to mention having to fend Danielle off of the position as well, so was more than deserving of her position.<br>\r\nIt had helped that, unlike Danielle, Sarah was much more pleasant to be around which had scored her major brownie points in the short time she had worked that.<br>\r\nIt had also gone in her favour that she was willing to partake in all aspects of the office's usual running, including the girls frequent and over indulgent breaks as well as being no stranger to dip into meals and spreads prepared for meetings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work's like a slave and eats like a manager\" Jenna had once said about Sarah and she couldn't be more right.<br>\r\nSarah had one hell of an appetite when it came to business and food alike so it was only natural that she would succeed at Gordge.<br>\r\nIt goes without saying though that she had also gained status for her figure as well over the course of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah's delicate British metabolism fell by the way side of the constant torrent of American grease and fat she had ballooned incredibly beyond her once svelte figure.<br>\r\nAlthough possessing a general thickness all round, the blonde Brit had proven to be rather middle heavy with a soft spherical belly jutting ahead of her whilst a shelf like arse led up the rear like a pair of babies fighting under a blanket.<br>\r\nAnyone who looked at her face or below her knees would think that Sarah had barely gained a pound during her tenure at Gordge but they couldn't be more wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brit's wildly contrasting figure, aside from been quite the turn on for herself, had also proven to be one hell of a hook for her boyfriend.<br>\r\nThat's right, Sarah had bagged herself a guy as well as a promotion.<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Jacob had proven to be a prolific feeder after falling head over heels for Sarah and the pair had been going out for nearly 6 months now, even if most of that did consist of stuffing the young Brit until she could hardly breath.<br>\r\nA year's worth of empty calories combined with sitting on her fattening rump all day every day had certainly done a number on Sarah's figure and, based on the last time she weighed herself, she had already crossed the 15 stone mark (210lbs according to Jacob) making her one of the biggest gains of the past 12 months with little competition, even from the biggest women at the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you tonight then hun?\" panted Sarah as she heavily lent against the doorframe of her office as Jacob stepped out in front of her, cockney accent still lacing her tongue even after a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better had do babe, I've got plans for dinner\" teased Jacob as he bumped up against his bloated girlfriend before taking her into a big hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooph careful, I've barely swallowed lunch\" moaned Sarah as she gently embraced her boyfriend in return, one hand idly cradling her bulbous belly as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob couldn't help but smile at that as he cupped both hands on Sarah's belly where it hung heavily and free of her shirt and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you don't burst a button off this shirt tonight then I will have done something wrong\" smirked Jacob as he noted the tightness of Sarah's shirt already with buttons nearly stretched to their limit over the peak of her rounded belly as things were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just won't be happy until you can roll me around will you?\" teased Sarah, admittedly not put off at the thought of that herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaaybe not\" cooed Jacob, deliberately avoiding the answer even though they both knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the couple continued to tease each other, Danielle strutted past them and huffed her discontent at their romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Sarah knew that most of Danielle's problem was Sarah's weight which was rather ironic given Danielle had hardly maintained her figure.<br>\r\nOver the course of the past 12 months, Danielle had also suffered at the hands of the office routine, developing herself quite the swelled hips and rear arrangement to accompany her rapidly thickened thighs and arms.<br>\r\nShe was no slouch in the midriff department either as, particularly noticeable when wearing tight dresses, she had developed a chubby layer around her previously trimmed stomach as well as filled out in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo most people, Danielle was still stunning and actually suited the extra office weight, but Danielle herself was a different story.<br>\r\nEven her two cup size increase wasn't enough to quell the brunette's rage about her increasing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the same though, Sarah didn't care as she was quite happy with how her life was going, rapidly increasing weight and all.<br>\r\nHaving noticed the general consensus on her first day and, now that she was a part of it, Sarah could really see why the women here enjoyed being fat so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHIS was a life she could get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bid Jacob goodbye for now and made her way back to her desk chair, which groaned loudly as she sat again, a devilish thought crossed Sarah's mind as she scanned her desk of the remnants from her lunch.<br>\r\nUnable to find what she was looking for, Sarah delicately picked up her office phone and hit speed dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Pauline, could you bring me a tray of doughnuts please and would it be possible to order my usual from Dominos? Thank's Pauline, you're a peach\" purred Sarah into the receiver, all thought of her hefty lunch nearly gone as her hunger grew fresh inside her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lumbering was unmistakeable, there was only one person in the office that large that walked that slowly. The panting and grunting had an all to familiar sound. The hallways were wider than most, but it was only she that tested the limits of them. Lucielle only thanked her lucky stars her office was one of the closest to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle had just come back from one of her many days off, and folks in the office we're sure to be happy to see her, but Lucielle had other priorities to attend to first, number one being getting off her feet. The only soul she had seen so far was Ashley at the front desk, though the thickened girls eyes were rolled into the back of her head as she sipped on a milkshake from an impressively large vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally in her office, after passing through the double door, of which she was of only a select few to be granted, Lucielle crashed on the couch she used as an office chair. After her success with the intern program last year, Lucielles work load some would describe as... light. She had no need for a desk or a computer. Her office was just a couch with a side table and a phone. All the work she needed to get done happened between her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her receiver, she dialed a three digit extension and waited for an answer. \"Hi Codi, yes it's me Lucielle. What was there for lunch? Oh that sounds tasty, can you bring me four plates of that? Also please let Sarah know that I'm here so I can get an update on the new interns. Thanks.\" Then she clicked down the receiver.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh good Codi, you're here.\" Lucielle said excitedly, as the girthy goth waddled through the double doors of her office, carrying a tray with four plates. \"Oh wow that looks good. Put it down here beside me.\" The young employee did as she was instructed, eyeing over her superior as she got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knew Lucielle was a marvel to behold, there was no one fatter in the whole company, and the blonde bombshell was only getting bigger. For women who really gave into the corporate culture around here, Lucielle was the shining example of what could happen if everything went right for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCodi was no slouch when it came to Gordge's corporate culture. She had started as a chubby intern a year ago, but had showed so much promise that she had received a full time offer after the program had ended, much like some of her other interns, Sarah, Danielle, and Pauline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPromise wasn't the only thing she had going for her, the formerly only chubby goth, had joined the ranks of the full time fatties. Never one for aligning with mainstream culture, Codi had a laissez-faire approach when it came to eating. When food was around she didn't count her calories, or stick to salad, that was so industrialized. Instead she ate what she wanted, when she wanted. And when it came to working at Gordge there was always food within arms reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this Codi had packed on some serious weight. At first she was a little disappointed, mainly because she couldn't fit into her favorite black and red striped dress anymore. But once she got her full time gig and had a monthly clothing allowance as part of her benefits package, she never turned back. Now a year later Codi looked like an inflated version of herself. Today she wore a gray suit, but it was the darkest gray you could imagine that wasn't black. It hugged her curves in every direction due to its tightness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs had certainly rounded out quite a bit, meeting almost all the way to the knee in her tight skirt. Her rear was stretching the fabric as much as the polyester would allow. Her formerly small belly has expanded into quite the pooch. It hung in front of her, giving the slightest jiggle if moved quickly enough. Codi still sported her jet black hair, but had learned to wear it not all in her face, it seemed like the corporate world was rubbing off on her. She still styled in her dark red eye catching lipstick though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plumper Codi was nothing when it came to the sheer enormity that was Lucielle, but it did paint a picture for the young goth if she continued down this road for sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCodi could only watch as Lucielle dug into her first plate. Her ass was digging into the couch so far, and her hips were spread over two of the large couch cushions. Her belly was so large it filled her lap almost out to her knees. Even her thick arms looked like boulder on each side of her, framing her large melon shaped chest. She sat there, almost three times larger than her underling, eating four plates of lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Codi dear, do you mind grabbing me a drink and a few snacks from the break room? My meeting with Sarah should be any minute now. Thanks love.\"</span></div></div>",

You are shamefully thin for a goth\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle rolled her eyes as Ashley's voice danced through her office door.<br>\r\nSince moving in with Jenna and Bo, Ashley had not only become unexpectedly fat but something of an outrageous flirt.<br>\r\nFortunately for her though, most of the other girls took it well within their strides and Ashley was loyal enough to her little romantic triangle that she rarely acted on her roguish comments.<br>\r\nNot that that stopped her frequent teasing and words of encouragement around the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of thin\" purred Ashley as she rounded the doorframe, holding the door for her exceptionally curvy self with a well manicured hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talking to yourself honey?\" asked Lucielle as she continued to attack the portions of food Codi had just delivered for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley laughed, knowing full well she had nothing on her blonde friend even with her immense weight gain over the past year.<br>\r\n\"Well as good as Bo is there isn't a girl in this office who can keep up with you Lu\" retorted Ashley as she jiggled across the room, every roll of fat and blossoming bulge glaringly visible in her obscenely tight dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle would have blushed were she unaware of her status amongst the other girls.<br>\r\n\"You're hardly small fry these days Ash, nearly 150lbs in a year is impressive\" complimented Lucielle as she eyed the smaller girl coming towards her.<br>\r\nIt was no mystery how Ashley had grown so quickly but the sheer amount was quite baffling, particularly given how well it had distributed around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know, if only I could eat more though\" sighed Ashley with a twinge of humour and a much larger portion of deep yearning \"how do you think Alex would take to having a second desperately hungry woman at his beck and call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think his bank account can handle our combined appetites honey\" Lucielle plainly put as Ashley squeezed herself in next to the titanic blonde as best she could given their combined girths, thick rolls of fat pushing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, true\" sighed Ashley again \"well with regards to that how would you both like to come round to my place tonight? Jenna's putting on quite the spread as a celebration for the first successful year of the internship program and you are kind of integral to it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle scoffed at Ashley's underplay of her role in the program \"I think you mean I was program leader\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Past tense sweety, Sarah has that title now\" winked Ashley, eying the British born blonde through the glass partition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in Sarah\" called Lucielle, granting Sarah the invitation she wanted to enter her superior's office<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, you wanted my report of what's happened whilst you were...off?\" started Sarah, only to be interrupted as Codi once again came in, dragging two trollies piled high with various foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in good time Sarah, first we eat though\" beckoned Lucielle as the trollies were parked before her couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I bring more?\" asked Codi, all too familiar with where the answer was likely to go<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, if you don't mind\" smiled Lucielle as Sarah glanced over the trolley before grabbing a rather large chocolate pastry in each hand, her spherical belly still hanging proud over her skirt waistband and clear of the confines of her button shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for god's sake, get your goth backside in here pigging out with us!\" cried out Ashley, watching Codi wobble back out of the office with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you all coming to the internship success celebration party tonight or not?\" asked Ashley again, polishing off yet another buttery pastry as she nudged an empty serving trolley away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" cried Codi who was sat on the floor having long untucked and unbuttoned her strained shirt to expose her rounding belly and plump breasts sitting heavily within her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count me in\" purred Sarah as she lazily tickled her belly which, given the fact she hadn't stopped eating all day, had caused two of her shirt buttons to burst from her garment, leaving a flapping gap to gaze upon her swelling stomach which now sported an impressively deep belly button against the perfect roundness of her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case then, smile ladies!\" called out Ashley as she engaged the camera on her phone and pointed it towards the four engorged women<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Four girls ready to get fat tonight' was the typed caption that Ashley layered over the photo before sending it to Bo to mark the girls attendence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley barely had chance to smile before a sharp buzzing indicated the response, a like minded picture with Bo exposing her own plump midriff and hips stood in the kitchen of their shared home<br>\r\n'Here I was scared that all this food was going to be just for you ;)'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley bit her lip at the obvious flirt before putting her phone away.<br>\r\nShe'd respond in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you still want my report Lucielle?\" groaned Sarah as she reached for a particularly tempting bear claw from amongst the scraps of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest girl of the group pondered this question for a while before answering<br>\r\n\"I think you've done a lovely job in my absence so lets not worry about so much paperwork huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah simply smiled and nodded in response, not one for over complicating a job if it didn't need to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four girls continued to snack and talk amongst themselves, the unmistakable figure of Danielle sauntered past the glass fronted office space.<br>\r\nThe narcy brunette took a moment to glance at her co-workers before shaking her head and strutting off on whatever errand she was headed for.<br>\r\nStill heavily in denial, Danielle chose to ignore the prominent wobble radiating through her own figure as she stormed off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Honey, I'm home!\" called Lucielle as she closed the front door behind her, catching her bulbous arse as she does.<br>\r\nThe heavy set blonde giggled to herself as her arse jiggled from the knock as she dropped her handbag, took off her coat and stretched the lethargy from her engorged body after a tiresome first day back at the office. Renovations had been completed at the office which had allowed Lucielle to return to work, albeit regrettably, and she was starving. Compared to the weeks of constant decadence with Alex cooking for and feeding her, Lucielle was wasting away despite having two breakfasts, a three hour lunch with Alice and Jessica and two dozen doughnuts as a return to work present from the management. However, her return home was marked with the smell of cheese and herbs wafting from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her nose, Lucielle lumbered down the hallway past hanging photos of her and Alex documenting their time together and, unintentionally, the blonde's impressive weight gain to date. Officially, Lucielle hasn't moved in with Alex but their relationship dictated she spent a large amount of time there which in turn led to some girly aspects bleeding into Alex's house from myriades of stuffed animals to cushions and throws on all flat surfaces to Lucielle's cute pink fluffy slippers which were residing partly under Alex's sofa at this particular moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex sweetie?\" Lucielle called out again \"your blondie bear's home and really really hungry\"<br>\r\nAlex had never called Lucielle 'his blondie bear' but she was feeling particularly cute and playful at this point. Her stretching had freed her button shirt from her tight skirt leaving the hem of said shirt floating around her stomach which now hung free as she wandered through the house towards the kitchen. As she idly scratched the underside of her belly Lucielle suddenly became aware of voices coming from the kitchen and quickened her laboured waddle marginally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got closer, Lucielle was able to determine that there were two voices in the kitchen, one being Alex and the other being...a woman? Lucielle didn't recognise the woman's voice and found herself confused, Alex had never had guests in the entire time they had been dating and never even mentioned friends particularly and now there was a woman with him in his house whilst she was at work? Lucielle rounded the hallway corner with a large swing of her hip causing her to knock a table as she passed. The noise briefly silenced the talking from the kitchen but it soon returned with laughter. Now with something of a sulk on and marching her fat legs faster then she'd moved in many weeks, Lucielle bore down on the kitchen at quite some speed for her size. With the door in sight, Lucielle could see Alex walking back and forth doing various cooking tasks whilst wearing the apron that she had bought him with the quirky slogan \"you can trust my cooking, my girlfriend is fat\". Sat at the table, back to the door, Lucielle could also now see the second voice. Red hair flowed down her back and fat bulged at her sides making her figure dominate the chair she was sat on. She was smaller than Lucielle sure but she was also scarfing down Alex's food like it was going out of fashion which was not acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" shouted Lucielle as she bowled into the kitchen, folding her arms and scowling like thunder.<br>\r\n\"Oh hey baby, you hungry?\" asked Alex, dishing up another plate by the cooker ready to serve to the blonde filling the doorframe.<br>\r\n\"Don't baby me! What's going on here?!\" screamed Lucielle, too angry to even notice her stomach was roaring at the smell of food filling her mouth and nose at that moment.<br>\r\n\"Woah woah, what do you mean? Nothing's going...\" Alex could barely get the words out before he was cut off by Lucielle barging into him with her full weight forcing her boyfriend against the counter.<br>\r\n\"I go back to work and on the first day you bring some other woman in to do god only knows what?! I can't believe that you would do...\" mid scream, it was Lucielle's turn to be cut off.<br>\r\n\"Hi, erm, sorry to interrupt\" it was the red head at the table who had now found her feet and was only a few steps behind the arguing couple.<br>\r\nLucielle turns to face the girl behind her with a glare which throws her off slightly causing her to fidget nervously.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's just that...\"</span></div></div>",

He totally didn't know I was coming but wanted to surprise you once he did know, he loves you to pieces so he says, you're definitely his girlfriend looking at the size of you and I wish I had an ass as big as yours\", realising she was rambling Amy looked to her toes again and continued fidgeting, thighs rubbing together as she moved from chubby foot to chubby foot.<br>\r\nDisarmed by the nervousness of the red head, Lucielle felt cautiously trusting of her. Hands on hips, the hulking blonde took steps closer to Amy before, finally, the two were touching faintly by the impressive respective curves of their bellies.<br>\r\n\"Leave us alone Alex and order some pizzas\" growled Lucielle over her shoulder, not breaking eye contact with Amy and aware of their bellies rubbing gently together as the girls breathed.<br>\r\nWith a deep sigh of relief, Alex scarpered and disappeared out of the kitchen, tail firmly between his legs as he feared for his sister he'd left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, just to be clear\" Lucielle started, pulling up two chairs and sitting down to a loud groan of wood beneath her weight \"I totally believe you're Alex's sister\" Amy exalted for the first time since Lucielle had entered the kitchen and found her way back to her chair which also groaned, albeit quieter than Lucielle's pair, as a curvaceous belly settled on thick thighs.<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god, I was sooo freaking out there that you thought...\" Lucielle cut off the bloated redhead mid flow.<br>\r\n\"Ok sweetie, how about we just get food drunk and THEN we can talk, ok?\" suggested the blonde, reaching for a large pot of creamy pasta, tucking in before a question could even be asked.<br>\r\nWithout hesitating and with a sigh of relief, Amy grabbed her own corresponding pot of pasta and began to feast away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so Alex used to try his recipes on you?\" asked Lucielle<br>\r\n\"Yep\" Amy replied, swallowing pasta as she did<br>\r\n\"And you've just got divorced from a guy who enjoyed your weight at first but was constantly trying to make you lose it?\" Lucielle found herself oddly fascinated by Amy and she seemed more than happy to oblige as if still proving her innocence. The belly dominant redhead was considerably smaller than Lucielle but still had one hell of an appetite having already outeaten the blonde at this stage.<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Anyway, as a last goodbye I piled on like 15lbs, declared I loved my fat self and walked out of there. I've not been able to see Alex properly until now since the divorce so thought I could surprise him\" responded Amy, sucking in a string of spaghetti as she did. \"I knew he had a girlfriend but had no idea you were this beautiful, he never tells me the important things\" Amy rolled her eyes at this point with a smile between her rounded cheeks.<br>\r\nLucielle feigned a blush at this point \"gee, thanks. You're not exactly a slacker in the looks department\" obviously belly heavy, Amy was also thick in the thighs and hip department, her only shortfall been her chest which lagged behind her otherwise ballooning body. Sporting some tight tracksuit bottoms and a red strappy vest top, underwear lines were clear pinching into her fat and accentuating curves and bulges all over her body. She was also a bit chubby of face but not drastically and her fiery hair billowed down her shoulders and back.<br>\r\n\"Well thank you\" giggled Amy.<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, I'd totally fatten you up all day long if I was your jerk of an ex husband\" retorted Lucielle, looking closely at the redhead.<br>\r\n\"Well you're doing a good job so far if I may say so\" Amy leaned back in her chair end exposed her rounded belly, both hands rubbing in small circles on the tightened surface.<br>\r\n\"Well the night is young yet, you still hungry?\" Inquired the pear-shaped blonde<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

everyone else had walked away after all - and decided to accept the situation for what it was.<br>\r\nAlthough Alex still lived across the hall and she did catch glimpses of him coming and going, usually with great masses of food with him, Naomi didn't have the courage to ask him what had happened...until one day she needed to know where her friend had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the rest from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, thoroughly embarrassed and internally vowing to never be confident again, Naomi was vegged out on her sofa drowning her sorrows in ice cream in silence.<br>\r\nAt least ice cream didn't care that she was shy, its biggest offense was running out far too soon which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh\" Naomi groaned as her spoon hit the cardboard bottom of the cartoon sat on her tanned thighs, trailing elegantly out of her booty shorts.<br>\r\nAwkwardly standing and clumsily dumping the empty cartoon into the bin, Naomi went in search of more non-judging snacks.<br>\r\nReturning with a family share bag of chips with a look of contemplating pizza, Naomi dropped back into her butt indented seat before tearing open the bag of salty potatoes.<br>\r\nStill sat in silence with storm clouds brewing in her mind, Naomi nearly screamed the place down as her flat door opened to reveal Lucielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sorry if I made you jump\" said Lucielle, letting the door close behind her as she spoke to Naomi<br>\r\nNaomi stared back like a deer in the headlights, hand half into the bag of chips next to her.<br>\r\n\"Alex lent me your spare key?\" offered Lucielle, noticing the fear in the poor girls eyes which, in hindsight, wasn't all that surprising.<br>\r\nRelaxing slightly, Naomi's body visibly unclenched which Lucielle took as a hint to approach a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I've spoken to Alex and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't trying to steal him ok?\" blurted Naomi, unexpected to herself as much as anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle smiled a half smile at the outburst before continuing.<br>\r\n\"I know, he's explained it all and...sorry, can I sit down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi hesitated for a moment before nodding her acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex didn't mean to freeze you out, which I believe he's already told you, he just got a little caught up with things\" continued Lucielle as she heavily took a seat opposite Naomi in love seat that seemed ill equipped to handle Lucielle, with metal joints groaning under her weight.<br>\r\n\"He actually kinda hopes you're gonna keep hanging out with him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi's mind was going ten to the dozen at this point, processing everything.<br>\r\nFor one, Alex's girlfriend was absolutely huge which may go some ways to explaining why he never tried hitting on her.<br>\r\nSecondly, thank god Alex still wanted to be friends<br>\r\nThirdly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you'd maybe give me a shot too\" smiled Lucielle reassuringly, glossing over Naomi's processing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wants to be friends after thinking I was stealing her boyfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, is that triple chocolate fudge brownie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Naomi was totally freaked, how did she know that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just saw the spoon on your coffee table, looks a lot like triple chocolate fudge brownie ice cream if I am not mistaken\" mused Lucielle with a hungry smile curling her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi nodded, still unsure of how to proceed with the large blonde girl across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got good taste girl\" purred Lucielle, trying as hard as she could to not lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\" replied an evermore confused Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chips too?\" asked Lucielle, less Sherlock Holmes and more Captain Obvious as she noticed the bag nestled against Naomi's hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I eat when I'm nervous, ok?\" defended Naomi, odd bursts of courage seeping into the conversation despite her previous pact with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preaching to the converted sister, you might have noticed I'm pretty fond of the food stuff myself\" probed Lucielle, sensing an opening now she had Naomi talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head smirked ever so slightly as the obvious was once again stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might be a little crazy, and totally out of your comfort zone, but how about we get some pizzas in and just girl it out?\" asked Lucielle, going for broke at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery hesitant now, Naomi considered her options.<br>\r\nShe had just been angling for pizza before Lucielle had arrived, and the thought did sound really good.<br>\r\nBut then, that would involve socialising which was not Naomi's idea of a good time with pizza...</span></div></div>",

This is gonna be so good!\u201d cheered Lucielle with a surprising amount of enthusiasm, much to the shock of her foodie friend for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so\u201d muttered Naomi as she curled herself up a touch more at the outburst of the exceptionally large blonde woman sat across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk well if I order then I\u2019ll get changed into something a little more comfortable and we can take it from there, sound like a plan?\u201d asked Lucielle with a warm smile across her cheeks, a hand sprawled across her belly as she hit back rumbles of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah ok...\u201d replied Naomi, still nervous as all hell and somewhat thrown at having somebody in her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything in particular you want?\u201d asked Lucielle, attempting the bridge the gap as best she knew how to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I...I like everything really\u201d said Naomi, feeling her own hunger bubbling up at the thought of imminent food, particularly the pizza she had been craving so much since escaping Alex\u2019s apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl after my own heart\u201d teased Lucielle as she hammered away on her phone, ordering like a woman possessed as her tongue idly wetted her lips at the thought of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I...erm...\u201d started Naomi, politeness dictating she had to offer something at this point but was quickly silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, this is my treat, by means of an apology if nothing else\u201d smiled Lucielle, still ferociously typing into her phone.<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, I suggested it so only fair that I pay\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi couldn\u2019t argue with that, free food was one of the few perks she could enjoy on her torrent of failed dates since moving to America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd...done\u201d announced Lucielle \u201cnow, get yourself comfy because we are in for the long haul\u201d<br>\r\nThen, with surprising grace and an audible complaint from the seat, Lucielle got to her feet and made for the door to cross the hall again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a bunch, my love to the boys!\u201d called Lucielle after the delivery boy as she closed the apartment door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing back into the living room, Lucielle took a deep breath as she inhaled the thick stench of grease and cheese wafting through the air.<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry Naomi, Alex usually orders and portion sizes are lost on me at the best of times\u201d<br>\r\nThe blonde chuckled softly as she returned to the seat that she had claimed for the night, her great rear spreading out and against the arms in plush bubbles of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou order from these guys often?\u201d asked Naomi having noticed the driver hadn\u2019t been shocked at the quantity of food he was passing into the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, totally\u201d replied Lucielle as she clumsily bunched her hair into matching messy buns on either side of her head, giving her the silhouetted appearance of Minnie Mouse assuming the cartoon character had been a 600lb blonde woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense\u201d mumbled Naomi, scratching her bare left arm whilst tugging her vest top down to cover her chubby stomach a little more than it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, get tucked in otherwise there won\u2019t be any left for ya\u201d smirked Lucielle as she greedily swept up a huge pizza and a family share bucket of chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi couldn\u2019t help but crack a smile.<br>\r\nAs impressively huge as Lucielle was, looking every pound of it in a skin tight T-shirt riding high up her belly and shorts that looked barely able to contain her immense lower half, it seemed implausible that the blonde could finish off the mountain of food between the two girls.<br>\r\nThe thought didn\u2019t stop Naomi from taking her first share though as she grabbed her own pizza, tearing off two slices and sandwiching them together before taking a big grease dripping bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, you go girl!\u201d cheered Lucielle as she caught a glimpse of Naomi\u2019s technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound halted Naomi mid bite with crimson hair cascading around her full cheeks, a wave of anxiety washing over her as it suddenly dawned on her how \u2018on show\u2019 she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry honey\u201d rushed Lucielle, realising her mistake \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to stare, I just love a girl who can eat\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...ok\u201d murmured Naomi as she slowly nibbled at her edge of pizza, feeling terribly shy realising Lucielle was paying attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it\u201d reassured Lucielle as she resumed to her own glutting with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarginally content that Lucielle had stopped watching her, Naomi went back to taking decent sized bites.<br>\r\n\u2018This is so weird\u2019 thought Naomi as she went through her pizza at a surprising anxiety fuelled rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew that was a meal\u201d sighed Lucielle, leant back in her seat with her hands rested on her taut belly, cheeks puffing outward with gentle breaths of fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u201d grunted Naomi through a mouthful of meat, a half eaten tray of sliders perched next to her on the sofa as she hungrily chewed away at the thick burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill going huh?\u201d purred Lucielle \u201cI\u2019m impressed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks?\u201d responded Naomi with some hesitance, still bemused at how into eating Lucielle was despite sitting opposite her for an entire meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from Naomi\u2019s appetite, Lucielle couldn\u2019t help but be fascinated by the size of the tanned beauty\u2019s food baby was as if hung against her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d asked Lucielle, picking away at a tray of fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi shrugged, lips still locked around one of her diminishing burgers before nodding slightly.<br>\r\nLucielle smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn appetite like yours and some obviously incredible genetics, how are not the size of...well, me\u201d asked Lucielle quite bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi swallowed hard whilst sweeping up the last burger with her svelte fingers before replying.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have gained a bit since coming here\u201d admitted Naomi, taking a large bite of cheesy bread covered meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? How much?\u201d asked Lucielle, curiosity getting the better of her and realising that Naomi was far more talkative with food in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, probably near on 30lbs\u201d shrugged Naomi, adjusting the visible side strap of a red bra, causing her sizeable chest to jostle uncontrollably for a moment, waves rushing through her exposed cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s pretty impressive\u201d mused Lucielle as she tried to imagine the girl before her with 30lbs less on her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHigh compliment from someone such as yourself\u201d retorted Naomi with an almost wry look, the distraction of food allowing some confidence to seep out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeow\u201d teased Lucielle as she gulped down most of a bottle of coke that she had been nursing for 20 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much did you weight?\u201d asked Naomi rather reserved again as she resumed her efforts on her burger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d chuckled Lucielle as she patted her belly, ripples of fat rolling into her hips.<br>\r\n\u201cWell once upon a time I was about 290 but now I\u2019m pushing 600lbs\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...\u201d thought Naomi, a soft whistle escaping her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty great to be honest, get to eat whatever I want whenever I want\u201d purred Lucielle, getting lost in her own thought as she daydreamed about her gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see the appeal\u201d mused Naomi, slipping down the last of her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t hurt to cut loose once in a while you know\u201d suggested Lucielle with an awkward shift of her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi considered that one.<br>\r\nShe had, admittedly, had enough fun that night to not hate it but reservations were her strong suit at the best of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you don\u2019t need to make any serious life changing decisions now, just enjoy the moment\u201d smiled Lucielle, groping at her belly a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell tonight has been pretty nice\u201d admitted Naomi, lying length ways on the sofa, feet dangling over the arm closest to Lucielle with her head on the opposite one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it hun\u201d replied Lucielle \u201cand it\u2019s nice to have such great company\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi creased inside, she\u2019d barely spoken and yet Lucielle thought she had been good company?<br>\r\nMaybe the titanic blonde going out with her only friend wasn\u2019t so bad after all.</span></div></div>",

Jessica was a fairly new addition to the company since she'd joined a week ago, but she was already quite plump. Weighing in at a hefty 350lbs she had a large round, squishy belly that strained the buttons on her business suit, wide plush hips and a big jiggling butt that completely filled out her tight work pants. Not to mention she also had a impressively sizable chest that filled out her e-cup bra like two great soft jiggly balloons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I wonder when lunch break is?\" Jessica thought aloud as she pat her softly gurgling gut fondly. She and her fellow employees had already been working about half the day already so she had reason to think about food. Though when she glanced at her watch, it was indeed only a few minutes until lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grunted softly as she struggled to unwedge her great doughy thighs and rump from between the chair's armrests. It took a few moments and failed attempts before she popped her jiggling lower-half free from the confines of her chair. Soon enough she was waddling her way to the employee lounge for her meal. As she got there the excessively plump young woman literally bumped into one of her co-workers! She'd been so preocuppied with her thoughts that she hadn't seen where she was going and bumped her tubby tummy into an equally flabby gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd said gut belonged to Lucielle, whom Jessica would often talk to and spend time outside of work with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm sorry Jess, I hadn't seen you there!\" Lucielle said with surprise as their bellies squashed and jiggled together on impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! It's fine. I guess i wasn't paying attention either.\" Jessica smiled, both women backed up a bit so their flab wasn't so close together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you today?\" Lucielle asked as she went through the door first, then Jessica following. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been fine and you?\" she responded kindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been alright, just tired.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two curvacious chubbies had eaten were done with their meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Jessica, would you like to go out with me after work to eat?\" Lucielle asked as she rubbed her taut tummy. </span></div></div>",

Um, Luci-*burrrp*-elle, could you help me up?\" Jessica had managed to eat so much that her gut had weighed her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle gave a giggle at her friend's expense. \"Ok, here,\" she grabbed Jessica's hands and pulled, managing to heave her to her feet moments later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Jessica said with a slight blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...*gasp*...p-problem...*pant*...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both bid goodbye to each other and waddled, with their ponderously full bellies in hand, back to their desks. <br>\r\nNow, for a bit of back history about Jessica; you see she wasn't always the big butterball of lovely fat we know today. After she had entered her teenage years, she had developed quite an appetite and had gone from average to very curvy then bordering on chubby. Jessica also came from a very nurturing middle-class family so naturally by the time she got out of highschool she weighed around 210 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, during college was when her real glutton was unleashed. During college she'd managed to pack on around 130 lbs. And the last ten pounds was added on just months before she got her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica made her way to her office when...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her shirt had started to ride up on her protruding middle, as her well fed belly tried to escape the confines of the shirt. Jessica pulled down on her shirt, trying to cover her exposed blubber, until POP! The bottom button popped off and fell to the floor. Her fat middle surged forward even more. She waddled over to the escaped button and tried to pick it up. Slowly she bent down. Her round butt stuck straight into the air. As she bent down farther her pants ripped right along her long crack, as her thick cheeks pushed outward. \u201ccrap.\u201d She said, but she didn\u2019t stand up again as she was nearing closer to the button. She was only a few feet away when suddenly a force prevented her from bending any farther. Her stacked belly rolls were simply too big and fat for her to reach the lost button. Sweat started to drip down her forehead as she tried as hard as she could to grab it but her effort was pointless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at her nearest coworker, Jenna, who was sitting at her desk. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Jen, a little help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh yeah, no problem.\u201d Jen said. She swiveled 90 degrees in her office chair. Jenna had been working at the office for a few years now and was always pretty friendly to Jessica. She stuffed the rest of her twinkie in her mouth and made an attempt at the button. She still stayed in her chair as she reached downward, because she was much to fat and lazy to stand up. Jenna had at least 50 pounds on Jessica so her reach wasn\u2019t any better. Her even fatter gut significantly constricted her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Err* sorry I can\u2019t get it either. Guess its lost forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, this is the only shirt that fits me.\u201d Groaned Jessica as she struggled to stand up straight. \u201cDid my pants rip too?\u201d She asked as she shifted around to show Jen her backside. Her pants had a large rip down the middle, revealing her large panties, which were starting to disappear in between her two big mounds of butt flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, pretty badly. But don\u2019t worry, same thing happens to me all the time. Actually there\u2019s a great tailor that specializes with girls like us that can get you into something that really fits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? That\u2019s great, what\u2019s his number?\u201d Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know we should just go together, I\u2019ll introduce him to you. I actually need to see him too.\u201d Jenna said. She had clearly outgrown her shirt. Her bottom spare tire was completely exposed as the remaining two buttons on her shirt held on for dear life. Her endless amount of cleavage was on display as her jiggling breasts were about to burst free from the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great! How about Saturday?\u201d said Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaturday\u2019s perfect, it\u2019s in the mall so we can get lunch after we\u2019re done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u201d replied Jessica. She waddled her way back to her desk.</span></div></div>",

Are we gonna eat now or go to the tailor first?\u201d asked Jessica. Jenna shoved the last of her burger in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo lets go now, we\u2019ll eat again later.\u201d Said Jen. She pushed back her seat. \u201c*burp* Can you give me a hand?\u201d Jenna asked. Her fat was too much for her to lift on a full stomach. Jessica stuck a chubby hand out to aid her seated friend. Jenna pulled her weight up slowly. Being over 350 pounds, Jessica was a big enough anchor for Jenna to pull on. Finally Jenna was upright. They waddled their way through the mall, stopping once at cinnabon. Eventually they made it to the tailor. They were both pretty exhausted from the short stroll. Both women had become very accustomed to their sedentary lifestyle so walking had become quite an ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese malls *pant* are so big, *gasp* I don\u2019t know *wheeze* how they expect people to walk so far. We should\u2019ve *huff* used those scooters to go this far,\u201d said Jenna, unaware of just how short a distance they had traveled. The only reason she was going to need a scooter was because she had gotten to lazy to haul her overfed butt around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re *pant* so right,\u201d said Jessica, who was well on her way to being in Jenna\u2019s situation. They walked in to the tailor shop. The front of the shop was a regular clothing store with a small lobby area with a couple couches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we just gonna pick stuff off the rack?\u201d asked Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, none of this stuff is going to fit us. We\u2019ll see him in the back.\u201d Replied Jenna. She walked to the desk at the front of the store and spoke to the cashier. <br>\r\nShe then sat down on the couches with Jessica. \u201cI made an appointment, He\u2019ll be out in just a sec\u2026 By the way, his name is George.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. This is cool. I\u2019ve never been to a tailor before.\u201d Jessica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeorge is great. Do you want a brownie?\u201d asked Jenna pointing to the plate full of brownies in between the two couches. George specialized in larger ladies and he knew what his customers wanted. The two fatties devoured the entire plate just in time for George to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello ladies!\u201d George was a thin, greying man, somewhere in his fifties. He dressed smart and wore stylish thick framed glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi George, How\u2019ve you\u2026 *err* ugh *huff*\u201d Jenna was trying to lift herself off the couch but was having some trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Lynn! Help please!\u201d George called over the cashier to give Jenna some help. Lynn the cashier rolled her eyes. This wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done this. Lynn and George each grabbed one of Jenna\u2019s chubby hands. They pulled mightily as slowly Jenna\u2019s heavy mass rose from the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, *pant* How\u2019ve you been?\u201d Jenna asked. Jenna gave him a hug. George tried to but had some trouble with her big fat belly in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know same old same old.\u201d He turned to Jessica. \u201cAnd who is this?\u201d Jessica barely was able to lift herself off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my friend Jessica! She\u2019s also a coworker.\u201d Jessica and George shook hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Jessica. You know Jenna\u2019s actually my best customer. Friends of her get special treatment.\u201d Said George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, well I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In one corner there was a large desk covered in papers and fabrics. On the other side of the room were two large chairs and a table covered with cupcakes and cookies and sweets. Jessica was very impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou girls can take a seat over there, I\u2019ll be ready in just a sec.\u201d Jenna and Jessica waddled over and sat in the two big comfy seats. They immediately started stuffing themselves with pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t eat too much, I don\u2019t want you to outgrow the clothes I haven\u2019t even made yet!\u201d George joked. Both women decided to ignore it. \u201cSo which one of you will I do first?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess, why don\u2019t you go first?\u201d Jenna proposed. Jessica lifted herself from the comfy seat and walked to the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do I do?\u201d asked Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell just remove your clothes and I\u2019ll measure you.\u201d Jessica promptly removed her shirt and pulled down her pants. Leaving her in just her bra and panties. George walked over to her with a long measuring tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Jessica, tell me. Why are you here? It\u2019s funny, every customer has a story.\u201d George asked, as he started to measure her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was coming back from lunch.\u201d George measured her big chubby arms. Her arms didn\u2019t have a pound of muscle on them, but they were big bags of fat that hung a few inches when she lifted her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of the stories start like that,\u201d George joked. He put his hands on her bra. Her boobs were jammed in the cups of the bra, as flesh oozed out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I was walking through the office my shirt was getting pushed up on my stomach.\u201d Jessica continued. George then undid the clasp of her bra. The bra fell <br>\r\nto the floor and her boobs fell to there natural position sending ripple throughout her flabby chest. Her boobs laid on either side of her protruding belly. Jess looked over at Jenna, feeling a little uncomfortable with George touching her. Jenna was too busy eating pastries to pay attention to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d George said. He wrapped his tape measure around her uppermost layer of fat which extended from the puffy flesh that propped up her breasts, to the numerous folds of jiggling love handles, all the way around to the big sagging bags of fat on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen when I tried to pull my shirt down over my belly, a button flew off.\u201d Jessica said. George then looked over her panties. He pulled on the waist band and let it snap back. This caused a large ripple throughout her flabby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to lose the panties.\u201d George said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll need a little help.\u201d Jess said as she lifted her huge stomach revealing the front of the panties. George then pulled them down past her engorged thighs and cankles. She then promptly dropped her heavy spare tire, which jiggled violently as it smacked her thick legs. George wrapped the measuring tape around her wide hips and large rounded butt which wobbled with just the slightest touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen when I reached down to grab the button my pants ripped right down the middle!\u201d Jess said. George was almost done as he measured her juicy thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I realized that they were the only work clothes that still fit me.\u201d George was now finished with Jess's measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Jess, you\u2019re done for the day. Put your clothes back on and Jenna can you come over here?\u201d George said. Jessica got dressed and then sat back down and ate pastries. Jenna on the other hand was still struggling to get out of her chair. She had eaten so much that her gut stuck out from under her shirt. George helped pull Jenna, who\u2019s hips were wedged by the chair, up. George called Lynn from the front desk in to help out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the deal, take it off.\u201d George said. Jen whipped off her shirt and pants. Jessica was stunned by Jenna and all her naked glory. Even though Jess was very obese herself, she wasn\u2019t very aware of her size, so seeing Jenna naked was quite shocking. Jenna was covered in fat. She was fat in parts that Jessica didn\u2019t even know could be fat. Her shoulders were big and soft. Her back had so many folds of flabby indulgence. She had folds under her butt on her thighs. She had love handles up to her armpits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a big hole in your panties, you know?\u201d said George. He and Lynn were both pulling down her panties for Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Better get new ones.\u201d Jenna\u2019s butt stuck out like a shelf of fat. You could\u2019ve eaten off her shelf butt if there wasn\u2019t a roll of back fat on it. Eventually George finished the mighty task of measuring all of Jenna\u2019s curves. The problem then was getting her clothes back on. George and Lynn tugged her panties up her thighs but struggled when they got to her puffy hips. Jenna had to lift her massive belly up in order for the panties to slide over her gelatinous waist. Finally Lynn and George got the shirt and pants on Jenna\u2019s obese body (although they wouldn\u2019t button). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the clothes should be done in a week and a half,\u201d George said. Jenna and Jessica both nodded and walked out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for lunch?\u201d Jenna asked.</span></div></div>",

Since Jessica and Jenna had started spending more time together, it was only natural that Lucielle would become friends with Jenna as well, though the past few months had led all three of their waistlines to explode outwards in circumference. Jenna, the fattest of the three, previously weighing in at 400lbs, was now around 440lbs, and was she MASSIVE! Her billowing belly rolls stuck out almost three feet in front of her, while her huge, jiggling orbs of butt fat stuck out a couple feet, her hips were almost as wide as her belly\u2019s circumference, and waddling a few steps made her tired out much more easily now. Jessica, however, had ballooned from 350lbs to 400lbs, matching Jen\u2019s previous weight. She now had a huge gut, very thick thighs, and equally large, heaving breasts that jiggled at the slightest touch, along with the rest of her flabby mass. Lucielle, being the smallest of the trio, had started off at a plump 280lbs, but now she was a complete blimp at 320lbs, her huge ass and thick thighs being the largest on her frame, though they were followed closely by her billowing double-rolled pot-belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three usually were found eating whenever they spent time together, and, this did not bode well for their waistlines. One this particular day, the three overfed ladies were waddling their way from the break room, huffing and puffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*pant* Oh, why\u2026*wheeze* is this p-place\u2026*huff*\u2026so, so big!\u201d asked Jenna as she carried a pile of treats back with her, much like Lucielle and Jess were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! *pant* I never knew it was this\u2026*wheeze* bad before!\u201d huffed Lucielle, swaying her humongous hips, her belly jiggling with the motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyou\u2026*huff*s-said it\u2026*wheeze*\u2026g-girls! *gasp*\u201d Jessica intoned her own misery as they continued their short, though quite tiring trek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they each reached their desks, then plopped their bloated butts into the chairs, which creaked in protest. They sat on their well-padded behinds until the end of the day, where they all voted to meet up afterwards for a buffet dinner. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all had changed into much more comfortable clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I was totally about to burst out of those khaki\u2019s.\u201d Lucielle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may be time to introduce you to my friend George.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me and Jenna\u2019s tailor. He\u2019s soooo great. He does my whole wardrobe.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I may have to visit him cause my biggest shirt is already down two buttons.\u201d Lucielle responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they entered the restaurant. They walked up to the employee at the front. She had seen these three whales before. There was no doubt she would have to alert the chefs of their arrival. The trio paid for the buffet and waddled to the food. They grabbed the extra large plate at the buffet (the restaurant knew its audience). The extra large plates could easily hold 3 normal plates of food. The girls piled food on to the plates until a mountain of food was made. Their hands started to tremble under the weight of so much food. They then found their seats. They were lucky enough to find a booth that Jenna could fit into. There was still a tight fit as Jessica\u2019s hip fat pressed against Lucielle\u2019s. The feast commenced in a blurr of silverware and armfat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys did you know it\u2019s my sisters birthday today!\u201d Jessica said with a mouthful of pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Happy birthday to her. I guess were celebrating tonight.\u201d Lucielle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we gotta eat as much as possible if it\u2019s a celebration! Don\u2019t hold anything back.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. Well ladies\u2026 It\u2019s a celebration. Lets make it a feast!\u201d Jessica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued to feast. They went through several plates with ease. Belts started to be loosened, buttons popped. The ripping of fabric was muffled by the hundreds of flabby pounds lying on top of it. Eventually though the eating started to slow. After the 4 extra large plate, the girls carefully waddled back to the buffet. This time much slower than the times before. Lucielle massaged her engorged stomach that felt a bit more firm than usual due to the large ball of food in it. Jessica was trying to loosen her belt more but was struggling to reach around her enlarged belly rolls. Finally they made it back to the buffet. It was quite a trek the fourth time around. Lucielle noted to sit closer to the buffet next time. Jenna greedily reached for some more mashed fried chicken. However she struggled to do so as her middle jammed against the buffet table. She struggled to reach past her protruding round belly. She turned to her side and just barely snagged a few pieces of chicken. Clearly those extra 40 pounds had an effect on Jenna. They then made their way back to the seats. All three of them were breathing heavily as they sat down. They managed to eat through two more plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod that *wheeze* buffet is *pant* so far away.\u201d Lucielle groaned. They managed to get through another plate. When they tried to get another plateful they met resistance. The three positively bloated women had eaten so much that they could barely lift themselves up. Thay had no energy to go to the buffet. Yet they still had some room in them for a few more plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys *huff* we cant stop now.\u201d Jessica gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. *gasp* I\u2019ve got an Idea.\u201d Jenna groaned. She looked over to an employee who was standing by. She waved him over with her huge pudgy arms. When she finally got his attention, he came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter ladies?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe and *wheeze* my friends need someone to fill our *pant* plates for us. We\u2019d be willing to *gasp* pay extra for it.\u201d Jenna said. The man called over <br>\r\nanother employee who was female. She eyed the three bloated buddies. All three women\u2019s cheeks were covered in some sort of sauce. They all had their bellies completely exposed. Jenna\u2019s gut had taken started to ooze onto the table. All of their laps had been completely consumed by their monstrous bellies. They were stranded at the table, anchored down by their excessive over consumption. The employee, who actually was the manager, contemplated their situation. She knew that women like these were there best customers. She also knew that these women probably had friends who were of a similar size. As disgusting as it was to look at the three piggish women, she knew they meant good business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no problem ma\u2019am. It\u2019s just 20 more dollars. If you or your friends ever need help just tell someone and we\u2019ll accommodate for you.\u201d She said. It would turn out to be the best decision she\u2019d ever made as the restaurant became incredibly successful as the word spread throughout the local areas obese women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Jessica said as they waited for they\u2019re plates to arrive. Finally they had eaten all they could. Jessica sat read faced and breathing heavily as she rubbed her huge gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never *burp* eaten so much before.\u201d Lucielle said. They had to request some assistance with standing up and walking to their cars. They did manage to get home and digest their meals fully.</span></div></div>",

Her hips spread lusciously out and around her waistline, encompassing more than half of the somewhat spacious communal walking area. Behind her, two shapeless blobs of butt blubber bounced buoyantly behind her, and with every awkward heaving motion that the gluttonous gal managed to make every inch of her flabby form echoed its movements for minutes on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlabs upon slabs of flab made up her entirety, with a multiply-tiered though low hanging stomach that surged and swelled well down in front of her thighs even when standing. Her breasts had become so engorged that they had no choice but to rely entirely on the custom-built bras that Jess had to order. Her legs, so thick and meaty, that it was getting difficult to squeeze through even the most spacious of doorways now. Even this walk to Jenna\u2019s desk, though never exactly easy even some months ago, was beginning to become an arduous battle with her own slothly behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 Hey Jen.\u201d She whined, leaning against the cubicle wall, \u201cOh I\u2026 I gotta catch my breath\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna, seated on a chair that had been custom-ordered specially for her and her mighty rump, had no choice but to lean back when at her desk. Her keyboard was placed idly on her tummy, though not too high because her swollen arms couldn\u2019t bend very well these days. Her face was round, and as she bent over to hunt-and-peck at the keyboard, her third chin became very prominent. The act alone caused gentle beads of sweat to grace the brow of the enormous employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t that much bigger than Jessica was nowadays, no doubt the amount of time spent together amounting in an evening of sorts between their great girths. However, if it were possible, Jenna was more bottom-heavy than Jess had ever been. Her wide hips brushed against the cubicle walls unless she walked in the precise middle, her fellow co-workers stopping to stare at her magnanimous ass as it bobbed and jiggled with every half-step that the giga-glutton took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS\u2019okay\u2026\u201d she was actually out of breath due to the exertion of craning her no-neck to see the letters on the keyboard, \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 whassup girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica inhaled deeply, her chest and abdomen rising until they caused much unneeded pressure to build up on her already ill-fitting blouse, \u201cYou wanna\u2026 go grab some lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d the bottom-heavy blonde huffed in response, \u201cJus\u2019 lemme\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe held out her hands lethargically, Jessica knowingly grabbed at them with her own as she attempted to pry the massive marm from her seat. It was no easy task lifting a woman of Jenna\u2019s great size, even if the two were only a few pounds apart. Their great guts squished and slapped against each other. Jess\u2019 grasp on Jenna soon devolved into a bulky bear-hug, forcing their breasts into a mushy mound of four massive mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, Jess!\u201d Jenna whined, \u201cThat hurts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJus\u2019\u2026Jus gimme\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica could feel Jenna\u2019s weight rising from her chair, which only made it seem harder in the long run. Ultimately though, she would have to give up. Her friend was much too fat and she was far too out of shape to help anyone out in anything physical. Ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she didn\u2019t simply just give up. By the time her grasp gave way, Jess was already mid-tug on Jenna\u2019s supple shape. So when she relented, Jessica was sent flying backwards into the cubicle wall\u2014utterly crashing through it like a big fat cannonball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJEN!!\u201d she hollered out as the wall came crumbling down around her, cowering beneath her fat arms as little chunks of drywall peppered her like a chalky meteor shower<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, Jessica!\u201d Jenna hollered out, struggling to remove herself from her seat under her own power, \u201cJust\u2026 Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d replied a quiet, shaken voice, \u201cI-I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good\u2026 that\u2019s good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think Christie is\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Once she came to set her eyes upon who had bumped into her, she smiled. The rotund office drone faced a small woman, with pretty blue eyes and blonde hair. Jessica also noted the girl look to be perhaps a couple years younger than she was and with a classically even proportioned hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Jess smiled, \u201cI should have been paying more attention.

I\u2019ll just follow you okay?

It was nice, all things considered; good food and drinks, soft background music, and a friendly bartender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was currently working on her third (or was it fourth?) plate of hotwings, her margarita only half full as she ate, her big bulging gut straining the buttons on her blouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Laurie watched intently, though keeping her glance discreet enough so her recent catch wouldn\u2019t notice. Well, they weren\u2019t technically dating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least not yet.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something Laurie hoped to change by the end of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh this is all so good, Laurie! How\u2019d you find this place?\u201d asked the hefty heifer as she stifled a belch, her hand giving her belly a pat as she leaned back and sipped her margarita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly just stumbled upon it one day. Great isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, squirming in her chair slightly as she saw the belly pat. Laurie loved little things like that. \u201cSo hey Jess\u2026how do you like working at Gordge? You been working there long?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuurrrp\u2026I like it,\u201d she smiled, returning her attention to her food now, \u201cIt\u2019s got pretty good pay for the amount of hours, and everyone seems pretty nice. Haven\u2019t worked there too long, been on board a few weeks now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled, nodding along as she listened to Jessica\u2019s answer, happily noticing that she\u2019d finished her plate. \u201cHey, waitress? Can I get another margarita and a steak over here, please?\u201d she asked, hailing over the skinny waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing. It\u2019ll be right out!\u201d she replied as she went to fill the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blanched slightly at this, having already eaten enough to feel comfortably full, \u201cEr, you don\u2019t have to order any more for me, Laurie, I wouldn\u2019t wanna impose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense! You\u2019re not imposing,\u201d the gay FA woman reassured, \u201cI want to do this. I want to make sure that you get your fill; besides, you don\u2019t <i>have</i> to eat it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotund woman sat there a moment mulling it over, rubbing her big billowing tummy thoughtfully, pressing in on her soft flanks here and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well\u2026\u201d she began, starting to lose her resolve, \u201cI guess I could go for ONE more meal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie grinned, squirming in her seat as she saw this perfect specimen of obese office worker give in to her gluttony. \u201cGreat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica whimpered slightly as her overstuffed gut gurgled unpleasantly, the pale pink flesh taut beneath her chubby hands; the steak had been much bigger than she\u2019d thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-ooohh\u2026mmph\u2026okay, I th-think I\u2019m done\u2026uurrrp\u2026now\u2026\u201d she puffed, leaning back in her chair.

This woman could really eat, given the right push; she\u2019d gorged herself on four servings of spicy hot wings, three margaritas and a 8oz steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want some pie?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie's long black car pulled into the driveway of Jessica's moderate suburban house. Laurie's curvacious form exited the car first and foremost from the driver's side, her hourglass figure giving an ever-so-slight jiggle as she pulled herself out of the car. She walked over to the Passenger's side door and opened the door, extending her arm to help the swaying hog that was Jessica out of her car. There was a brief pause in getting her out. Her distended stomach which peeked through every gap between her buttons had gotten stuck against the dashboard. The buttons strained and jiggled, and the blouse nearly burst, but fortunately for Jess' dignity, the blouse held and she was able to stumble drunkenly out of the car. The maragaritas, though delayed, had their effect on Jessica's sobriety, and it took Laurie's soft arm to steady her enough to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Laurie helped her over the threshold of her house. There was the living room, which was filled with boxes and boxes of sweets and junk foods: Strewn, ripped-up chip bags, and ravaged boxes of donuts and actual cake platters here and there. Laurie took a moment to admire the obese woman's monument to her couch potato lifestyle  that was her living room. \"I like your place, Jess!\" Jessica murmured out something to the effect of \"Thank you,\" but it came out as some slurred garble. Laurie helped her onto a couch. She turned to Jessica. \"You want me to get you something to eat?\" Jessica nodded. There was a drunken filter of intoxication across her eyes, but also something else, something that spoke of bodily desire. Laurie was a good reader of emotion, and could spot that look from a yard away. She dissapeared to the kitchen, fetched one of the family-sized bags of Potato chips, bringing it over to Jessica. When Laurie entered. Jessica seemed to be in a half-lounging, half sitting pose on the couch. Her left hand was teasing the edge of her blouse, and her right hand was steadying her on the couch arm. Laurie knew it. The bait was planted before she even need to cast her line. She walked back towards the couch, but she put every pound of her lower body weight into a wiggle-strut, causing her boobs and, especially her ass, to bounce with each step. Jessica's eyes became more desiring with each step. Laurie gave a half-smile, bringing her right eye into a narrow proto-wink, in which the eye was ever-so-slightly closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled herself slowly onto Jessica's feet, ever so delicately. \"Turn around, Jess.\" Jessica mumbled, \"Yes ma'am..\" Laurie could tell, Jess was trying to conceal herself, but that was a slip. Jess' drunken mind couldn't catch it, but Laurie could. Jessica flipped over, reclining on the couch arm, facing Laurie. This was a new couch ordered from PlusCo, a furniture company who fashioned furniture that would remain sturdy, even for a whale like Jessica. \"Open wide,\" Laurie spoke. Jessica opened her mouth and closed her eyes, resting her hands on her packed-to-the-brim balloon that was her stomach. Laurie leaned atop Jessica's cankles and rested the chips on her left, lardy leg, and began feeding her, chip by chip. She ever so delicately lowered each chip into Jessica's mouth, and when within range, Jessica's waiting maw snapped up the chip. After a bit, Jessica moaned, almost orgasmically. \"More..\" Laurie smirked a little and gave a sexy chuckle. \"Yes...baby..\" Laurie figured that she had Jessica wrapped around her finger and could, at this point, use any name she desired. She fed Jessica chips in handfulls now, instead of lowering them chip by chip into her waiting, lardy maw, lowered the pile to her mouth,which she bit into and munched on, as if you were feeding a cow by hand. Each handful seemed to make Jessica more lusty, more desiring. Laurie began to get a little frisky, and when the bag was about halfway down, she gave her inner thigh a good, long, hard stroke. Jessica leaned her head back and moaned. \"Mmm, mommy, yesss....\" She chomped into the pile. Laurie undid her shirt's top buttons and spoke. \"Will you eat out of the bag, like mommy wants you to?\" Jessica nodded. \"Yes, mommy..\" Laurie put the bag of chips to Jessica's mouth and she began eating from it like a cow would eat from a feed-bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bag quickly reduced to crumbs, Jessica's blouse could take no more. The buttons burst and scattered to and fro and exposed her great mound of a stomach, and her skirt ripped open, exposing her lingerie. It wasn't particularly a G string, but it was some fanciful type of underwear that gave a bread-around-twine effect near her fatty thighs. Laurie fully undid her shirt, exposing her great, hefty E cup bra. She rubbed Jessica's stomach. Jessica pulled herself up, emitting a great jiggle across her body, and began giving Laurie a passionate, wet kiss, which Laurie returned in quick succession. Both undid each other's bras. Jessica's were moderate C cup breasts with a large areola about the nipple, where Laurie's aerola and nipple were quite smaller atop her gargantuan breasts which Jessica began rubbing as Jessica allowed herself to be pushed back down, slowly, but gently, by Laurie, who continued the kiss, putting her tongue down Jessica's throat. Jessica gave an orgasmic moan and began undoing Laurie's panties, pulling them off of her shapely legs and moved her right hand from Laurie's mammoth breasts to her vagina, quickly and rapidly flicking her finger in and out, each time rubbing the inner lip. Laurie moaned and returned the gesture of undoing Jessica's panties, which got a little hard around the thighs, but she pulled enough to get them off. She began moving to gently nudge Jessica's meaty, ham-like legs aside, a gesture which Jessica finished by moving entirely apart. Jessica ceased fingering her and grabbed onto Laurie's large breasts with both hands as Laurie brought her vagina down, beginning to slowly but surely bring her vaginal lips across Jessica's vagina which was seemingly buried otherwise in a mound of fat, which jiggled during the scissoring motion. Jessica moved her face to just above Laurie's gratuitous ass, and began licking her lower back. Both girls moaned simultaneously, and Laurie moved her ass a bit upwards. Jessica began putting her tongue into Laurie's ass, while, at the same time, Laurie had hit Jessica's mid-lower labia with her vagina--Jessica's G spot. Both girls squirted at the same time and gave a moan of climax, covering both's nether regions. Laurie moved her tongue into Jessica's spray-covered vagina and began licking. Jessica's prior moan seemed as though it were a hummingbird's tweet, as her next climax grew greatly in volume. Jessica returned the favor, licking Laurie's Vagina which had moved directly to her face, and Laurie had matched the volume of Jessica's climax, seeming to one-up them. At this point, though, the whale had enough. Her sweaty, spray-covered body had given backwards and she began panting, hard, as though this hog had just ran a mile by normal standards--although this mountain of blubber would never be able to achieve such a feat. Laurie came forwards and rested atop Jessica's mound of fat that was her stomach. She was fairly sweaty as well, although much less so, as she was still in some semblance of shape thanks to her semi-regular workout schedule, although she never aimed to -lose- weight with this, only to maintain her curves. Both women fell asleep, with Laurie resting atop Jessica's worn-out, exhausted, sweaty, blubber-covered figure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first to awaken was Laurie. She gave a quiet yawn before she opened her eyes and pulled her torso up. The sweat had long cooled off of her body. She then turned her eyes to Jessica's obese body. She smiled at the memory of the night before, getting a surge of arousal. She then took a moment to simply survey the wonder that was Jessica's naked body, with its great, thick wad of fat about her belly, her legs which were fatter than hams at the thighs, and her lardy, lardy arms, as well as the sausage-like fingers that rested atop Jessica's great, fat stomach. Truly, Laurie thought, I've come upon a magnificent specimen. She carefully pulled herself off the couch and groggily walked to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prepared herself a cup of coffee, taking hers black. As she sipped, she prepared to cook for Jessica; She had dreams, big dreams. She peeked into Jessica's vast Pantry. It was crammed to every nook and cranny with food, bursting with fattiest food that would make a nutritionist recoil in fear and dread, and if one peeked far back enough, they would see a bit of health food, long ignored, long neglected. Laurie scanned through it for some pancake mix, and she found some: Instant chocolate pancake mix from Panco. Laurie smiled and shut the pantry. Eventually she moved over to the refrigerator, taking a long sip of her coffee. As she set down a pan, quietly, as not to awake Jess, she took out some bacon and some frozen biscuits. While she put the biscuits in the microwave oven, she set up two pans: One for the chocolate pancakes, one for the bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's eyes opened to the sound of a loud beeping. She peered out over her fat-laden cheeks. She lifted her head a bit to get a bit more visibility, some of the squished fat receding back to its normal place, Jessica receiving a bit more of a normal field of vision, although she still saw her cheeks blocking the peripherals of her sight. She pulled herself up. Her mind turned back to the night before. It was a blur, but she could remember something. It came to her--Laurie, on top of her. She blushed and smiled a bit with some embarassment. Part of that was the margaritas--part of it was some desire she had below that. Deep in the mind, it kind of clicked--She was always \"the fat girl, the porker, the dare.\" She had only had a few men--all bets by friends, saying \"I bet you wouldn't hit that.\" Her mind couldn't go any further, at the moment -- She smelled the smell of fresh-cooked bacon, a sure-fire way to wake her up. She pulled herself up, ignoring her naked state, to Laurie in lingerie, pulling herself up. Laurie was setting down some biscuits and two cups of coffee. \"Morning, Jess.\" she spoke. The caffeine had awoken her, and she sounded like someone who had their faculties together. Jessica nodded at Laurie. \"Morning, Laurie.\" Jessica blushed a bit. She was embarrassed at her boorish behavior. \"Uh--Sorry about last night, the margaritas--\" She was cut off by Laurie. \"Ah, it's all right.\" She smirked and winked. \"I didn't mind it one bit.\" Jessica chuckled. Laurie spoke again. \"I made breakfast.\" She had indeed. There was a veritable array of bacon, biscuits, and--chocolate pancakes? It was like Laurie knew Jessica's taste buds. Jessica rushed up with a speed thought nearly impossible of a woman of Jessica's blubber. Laurie continued. \"By the way, I didn't know how you liked your coffee, I just put a little milk and sugar in there. Jessica nodded. \"I take my coffee any which way-- As long as it's none of that decaffinated stuff.\" She pulled herself to a seat at the dark-brown drink, and began sipping. She piled food on her plate. Laurie took some, too--She had made plenty of everything, and while not as big as Jess, she was still a girl of decent size, who certainly never missed her meals. The two took breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet, at first--Jessica ate hungrily and ravenously, digging through the near-mound of bacon. Eventually her pace slowed to a graze, and the conversation opened up by Jessica. \"I hate to make this awkward, I really do--But..what does this make us?\" Laurie paused amid her eating, taking a moment to swallow the bacon in her mouth. \"I don't know if I'd commit immediately--That was, after all, an accident--but I'd say this makes us dating. Of course, if you want.\" Jessica nodded. \"I...I'd like that.\" The thought from earlier finished. These men had rejected her for her weight, ignoring her, and even actively insulting her for it. This woman--though of the same sex, this woman would take her. Something in her brain clicked. She felt as though this was natural, as if she were sliding into part of her brain that had existed for a while. She'd give it a try, she determined. Laurie picked up the conversation. \"That's good. I have to admit, I find you...sexy.\" Jessica perked up her head. \"Sexy?\" Laurie nodded, giving a nervous chuckle. \"Uh--I don't really know how to say it, but...I really find your, uh...body type attractive..\" Jessica nodded. \"So, you like fat girls.\" Laurie nodded, chuckling. \"Yeah, yeah I do. I like 'em fat, and I like 'em getting fatter.\" Jessica nodded, chuckling. She put her hands to her naked stomach. \"Well, I don't think I'm losing any weight anytime soon.\" Laurie nodded, and continued eating, going for a second plate--She'd eaten more than normal already, but she didn't really notice--nor care, even if she had. The two proceeded to finish the whole buffet of bacon, biscuits, and pancakes, both absolutely gorged out of their minds. \"Well,\" Laurie said, \"This really was a great time. I'll see you...Next week, same time as last night?\" Jessica nodded. \"Sounds like a date, babe.\" Laurie stood up and gave Jessica a long, thick kiss, before re-clothing and setting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She shoved a fist-full of donuts, about two-and-a-half--the half being the crumbled bits of one donut-- into her lardy mouth. She flipped out of the memo and looked at the workload ahead of her--tracking shipments, writing correspondence. She sighed and swivelled her chair around, as it groaned under her weight, prepared to reach for the other half of that one donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found it waiting for her and pushed into her maw by a hand she quickly connected to Laurie, a brand new nametag on her shirt. Jessica mumbled through the donut. \"L-Laurie? What are you doing here?\" Laurie slid her finger down Jessica's lower lip, as Jessica swallowed. \"I got a job here! Logistics.\" Jessica nodded, leaning up and kissing Laurie by the mouth. After sharing a brief, wet kiss, the two spoke. \"Well, good! I'm happy you're here! C'mon, I've got to show you around.\" Jessica pulled herself up and waddled her fat-laden body forward, beginning to break a sweat by the time she reached the end of the hall. She led Laurie to the break room, panting by that time. \"This is the...break room. We keep our lunches and our snacks here.\" Laurie nodded at the mountain of junk food. Jessica parked her blubbery rear on a chair, grabbing her pizza from the fridge and beginning to dine on it with a bag of chips and a can of coke. Laurie nodded and grabbed a pile of junk-food. \"Figure I'll just scrounge for lunch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy scrounge, it was more of a junk food buffet. Of course she didn't eat nearly as much as a seasoned veteran of the office, but she still had a heartier appetite than the thinner interns. By the time lunch was over, Laurie took an armful of junk food and wandered out. \"Well, better get back to my office. See you date night!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess smiled and waddled breathlessly back towards her office. She could tell Laurie was loving it already.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jess' sleek, black vehicle pulled into the parking lot. She pulled herself up after struggling with the seatbelt, and getting it around her planet-sized stomach. She carefully pulled herself out. She wore a more formal button-blouse this time around, as the relationship had taken a more serious undertone and any pretense of just being friends dropped away. The two had agreed to meet at a slightly more upscale place, the <i>Villa Romagna,</i> Jess' stomach was stretching the blouse to screeching as she waddled up. Her rather large breasts rose and fell as the walk wore her out, the buttons straining to contain them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door, slowly and lethargically, and entered. A young brunette with perky breasts that stretched her work shirt greeted her with a bubbly, high voice. \"Hello! Table for one?\" Jess replied, \"Uh, actually, I'm here with a \"Laurie.\" The young blonde nodded. \"Oh! She said something about someone else coming, I'll bring you over.\" The young woman wheeled about, and Jess couldn't help but notice that the woman's ass strained her skirt. She was lead up to the booth. Jess' heart sank slightly at the sight of the booth, until she saw Laurie. She was in a stunning black dress which hugged her curves, which had expanded ever-so-slightly in the first week, causing some rolls to be visible, but not too obvious. Laurie smiled her bright smile and waved. \"Jess!\" The young blonde laid down a menu while the landwhale recieved a kiss from the blonde-haired beauty. \"So, how's logistics?\" queried Jessica. Laurie nodded. \"It's good. Boss is on my ass, but that's bosses.\" Jess replied, \"Yeah, that's true.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to open her mouth for her next statement, but the Waitress interrupted: A blonde girl whose face was very similar to Laurie's, but her body was like that of a great, doughy loaf of bread: A fattened, obese form, pronounced even more by her white work-shirt which screamed at every seam. \"Hey, sorry to interrupt. I'm your server, Katie. Do we know what we want?\" Jess spoke first. \"I'll have some red wine.\" Laurie followed. \"I'll have a coke.\" The obese waitress jotted down their orders, her heavy breathing preceeding a breathy statement, sounding as though she had run out of air at the end of her sentence. \"Mhm, gotcha. We know what we want to eat yet?\" Laurie made a noise of indecision, and then followed it with \"Give us a bit.\" The blubbery woman nodded and proceeded away, fanning herself with her notepad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica opened her mouth, but only a \"Hmm\" emerged. \"Can't remember what I was gonna say.\" Laurie leaned in. \"You have to have their Chicken Parm. It's to -die- for.\" Jessica nodded. \"I'll take you up on that.\" The waitress returned, her forehead glazed heavil with sweat, and  handed the women their respective beverages. Jess wasted no time on sipping from the large glass of wine. \"So, we..\" She stopped, taking a sharp gasp of breath. \"We know what we want?\" Laurie nodded. \"I'll have the Chicken Alfredo.\" Jessica followed. \"I'll have the Chicken Parm.\" The waitress nodded. \"Alright, sounds good.\" She took the menus and dissappeared into the back. Laurie reached over subtly and stroke Jessica's inner right thigh. She gave a short moan, and followed. \"Laurie, we're in public..\" Laurie chuckled. \"And? It'd be so hot.\" Jessica nodded. \"Maybe. But I'm hungry.\" Laurie grinned. \"Why not fuck AND eat?\" Jessica raised an eyebrow. \"Mm. We might have to try it sometime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was overwhelmed with screaming from the door, which couldn't muffle half of what was said. \"SIT DOWN MY ASS! You get the hell back out there and do your fucking job, you stupid whale! I don't pay you to sit down and eat!\" The obese waitress hurried out of the kitchen like a whipped dog with a basket of bread, a whip-thin woman slamming the door against the wall beside and staring daggers into the woman's back fat. The fat waitress set the basket down. \"S-Sorry...\" She waddled back to the kitchen. The whip thin woman slammed the door shut. A few customers who were leaving hurried out a bit faster.  A short while later, their food arrived. The obese waitress was absolutely drenched in sweat. She didn't even speak, she only panted, mumbling a few words through them. \"H'r's th'....Chicken parm...\" She handed over an absolutely massive portion of Chicken Parmesan, with three massive breasts swimming in marinara sauce and parmesan cheese blanketing the top, and an obscenely large bowl of Chicken Alfredo. \"Enjoy...\" she mumbled before she hurried back to the kitchen. She was going a bit too slow for the manager's liking, who proceeded to shove her through the mantle by her obese, fat-roll covered flank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began eating. \"Welll...That was awkward..\" Laurie spoke up. \"That manager lady is a bitch. I don't like her, reminds me of my health freak room-mate.\" Jessica nodded. \"I agree. Poor gal.\" Jessica was going at her normal pace, but this chicken parmesan was large, even for her portion standards. Laurie ate away with vigor, but could barely put a dent in her Chicken Alfredo. \"This place has rediculous portions. I forgot, it's been so long since I ate here.\" Laurie nodded. \"Well, if you can't finish that, maybe we could save it for later...\" She winked. Laurie grinned devilishly. Jessica barely managed to finish the Chicken, by that point, her blouse was strained to bursting. The thinner woman who was at the front earlier came to them. \"You guys need anything else?\" Jessica was about to say \"Just the check, please,\" when Laurie spoke. \"Can we actually get two slices of Cake, and a box for this?\" Jessica's eyes went wide. \"Uh, what?\" Laurie chuckled. \"C'mon, Jess. You can eat it. I know it.\" Jess sighed. \"I really do have no will-power. Okay.\" Laurie nodded, and the hot brunette went to the back. She soon came out. She was followed by the obese waitress, with the bitch-manager on her heels. \"I've HAD it with your lazy ass! You get the hell out and lose some weight, you stupid tub of lard! Either come back when you can walk for a day in your life, or do the world a favor and keel over from a heart attack!\" The fat waitress ran out, sobbing hard. The brunette indignantly set down the cake. \"Enjoy, ma'am.\" She stormed behind the whip-thin woman. Every customer in the restaurant could tell that the bitch-manager was about to get some well-deserved chewing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of chewing, Jess slowly but surely made her way through her slice. She laid back and moaned as she finished her slice, followed in similar fashion by Laurie finishing her slice of cake. \"Oooh, god. I over-did it.\" Jess nodded. They got up and paid their check to the lone waitress who was not embroiled in the world war developing in the back. Shortly following them out the door, literally hurled out, was the bitch-manager, who stared daggers at the obese waitress who sobbed off to the side over a cigarette, and then at Jess. Laurie turned around and stared daggers back at her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie happily drove a stuffed and drunk Jessica home. The next day she recounted the night before several times in her head. Jess was so hot. Laurie couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how her belly looked all swollen, straining against that top Jess was wearing. She pictured all the empty plates and glasses that were surrounding Jess on the table at the end of the night. Laurie struggled to focus at her desk, distracted by her arousal, squirming slightly in her desk with her hand gripping high up on the inside of her clenched thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a heavy sigh, Laurie got up and walked down the hallway to the bathroom. Checking that all the stalls were empty, she discreetly dealt with her arousal. \u201coohhnnngg...\u201d she quietly moaned inside the stall. As she composed herself in front of the mirror above one of the sinks, she dabbed at her glistening skin on her flush red cheeks. Laurie admired herself in the mirror as she fixed part of her make-up. Laurie had always been a very pretty girl, but today her hair was extra perfect, and her boobs looked so good in her blouse. She wanted to see Jessica. Well actually, she wanted to pounce on Jessica and tear her clothes off, but she could settle for just seeing her. And that\u2019s when she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bathroom she didn\u2019t turn to go back to her desk, instead she walked out of her office and to the stairwell, her first stop was the vending machine and then the building directory that was displayed on the wall. She swiftly began to climb the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy not just go and talk to her now? She hadn\u2019t gotten Jess\u2019s number, so it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to just go up to her office and maybe ask her what she was doing for lunch, right? She had heard a couple jokes and snide remarks from some of her older coworkers about \u201cthe fat chicks at Gordge\u201d but Laurie hadn\u2019t had any interaction with the Gordge inc. office just 3 floors above her cubicle. At least not until she bumped into Jess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked into the Gordge office she found someone at the front desk. She was a chubby buxom young woman. Laurie was about to speak before she noticed that the woman was on the phone. She waited for her to finish, giving herself an opportunity to admire this secretary\u2019s plump figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig breasts, plump arms, a thick, chubby midsection. This girl was very cute. But when she put down the phone, Laurie had to regain her focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I uh, well I\u2019m Jessica\u2019s friend. I was hoping to just stop by her desk real quick and say hi.\u201d Laurie said. Her voice quivered as she wondered if that would really work. Laurie knew her office were such sticklers about security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure, her cubicle\u2019s all the way down there on the right side.\u201d The woman said with a smile. Laurie thanked her and started walking past the desks and cubicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Laurie very much enjoyed her first trip through the Gordge offices. So many bellies bulging against blouse buttons, wide ballooning butts straining against skirts, fat pillowy hips and thighs packed tightly into office chairs, sweet faces framed by chubby cheeks and soft double chins, blue cotton contoured over round, hefty, and jiggling breasts. Laurie was like a kid in a candy store. All the flabby muffin tops, the creaking, fraying, ripping, stretching fabric, the groaning desk chairs being crushed under obese blubbery bodies, the butt cracks and belly buttons peeking out among slivers of fat. Laurie struggled to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she reached Jessica\u2019s cubicle. She took her time, slowly soaking in the image of Jess at her desk. Lifting a vanilla with sprinkles doughnut to her lips, she shoved half of it into her chubby cheeks, swallowing quickly before wolfing down the rest in two quick bites. Watching Jess in profile Laurie admired the way her plump and flabby arms tightly filled out the sleeves of her light purple blouse. Her beautiful breasts sat heavily on top of her belly, forming a shelf to catch all her lost doughnut crumbs and sprinkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jess,\u201d Laurie said trying to act cool, as if she wasn\u2019t soaking right through her panties. Jess turned to her left and stopped sucking the sugar off her adorably chubby fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey Laurie! What are you doing here?\u201d she said with a welcoming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to stop by and see if you had even bothered to come in today, after last night.\u201d Laurie joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah, I wish! I actually nearly slept through my alarm this morning but after a few of these, I\u2019m feeling better.\u201d Jess said as she picked up a very large Starbucks coffee cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good to know. I was also wondering if you were doing anything for lunch?\u201d Laurie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday? Well I usually go out with Jenna and Lucielle over there\u201d she pointed to two large woman sharing the cubicle across from her, \u201cbut I can ditch them for one day\u2026 or even better yet you can tag along with us!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had remembered the day quite vividly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess had been waddling back to her desk when Lucielle stopped her. \"Oh, Jessy, the boss wants to see you, she said it's important.\" Jessica: Looked at her with a bit of surprise; the current woman who ran their branch of the corporate business had never once wanted to see her before. <i>Oh, I hope this isn't anything bad. D-did I do something wrong, did I mess up?</i> Jessica thought as she turned around and waddled her 350+ lb bulk towards the woman-in-charge's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman she now faced as she sat down opposite from her was definately \"Large and in charge.\" The woman was massive! she had three chins, almost bordering on four, her arms were fulls of thick flab, her breasts were large and heaving; the suit she wore looked like it were designed for a hippo or and elephant than a woman. The suit the boss-woman wore shored an ocean of cleavage, and it threatened to burst off from her wide frame from the slightest movement, the buttons having impossibly large gaps showcasing bulging pale flesh between them. she possesed a grand gut, far bigger than what Jessica could've imagined, and though it was hidden behind her desk, this woman also no doubt had a huge bottom half to match. Jessica was astounded at this woman's sheer size alone; she couldn't have weighed less than 600 lbs, perhaps even 650 lbs, though she looked a few years older than most of the employees, perhaps in her mid-thirties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica glanced at the nameplate resting on the desk, and had found out this woman's name to be Hilda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, I've been monitoring your progress with the time you've spent with us, and I must say, you've been doing really well; your actually a bit ahead of schedule with your workload.\" Here she smiled and leaned forward, causing a very audible creak from the distressed chair she was occupying. Jessica sighed with relief, glad to know that she was going to keep her job and that she was doing well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good!\" jess chuckled a bit, \"I was so worried, I'd thought that I'd might've made a mistake, or was being laid off\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course not! you're doing quite well, and I've decided to reward you. I\"m promoting you to coporate executive\" Hilda said cheerfully, causing her breasts to jiggle slightly as she moved her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was again surprised, and it took her a moment to find her voice. \"Th-thank you! I...I don't know what to say.\" she smiled widely <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more, you start as executive tomorrow; congratulations! and I hope you continue to work as well as you have been\" Hild outstretched her hand, and Jessica took the chubby appendage, shaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, after a few days of this, Jessica had less work, since she'd been promoted and since her co-workers were always seemed to be offering to take on whatever work she needed to take care of. she now had little to no documents, report, or paperwork, and was free to sit back and relax, all the while her friend and co-workers, most notably Lucielle, continued to bring her treats. Jessica was also quite frankly unaware of the effects all of this were taking on her body. </span></div></div>",

But due to her employee\u2019s willingness to take those pesky things off of her hands for her, Jessica found herself with a lot of free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to spend at the vending machines every day, time to afford an extra-long lunch, time to screw around on the internet in her office, you get the point. So as long as she punched in on time and made sure to at least <i>appear</i> as if she were the diligent worker that Hilda had thought her to be, Jessica had it made in the shade!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, women such as Jessica (as in women with big appetites, impulse control issues, and lots and lots of free time) often found ways to occupy themselves in ways that weren\u2019t exactly healthy to a girlish figure\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so six weeks later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica lowered her incredibly bulky booty into the overloaded office chair. She had broken it\u2019s springs last week, removing the bounce from the appliance\u2019s neck. Not that it could support its owner\u2019s great weight on even an empty stomach, but it meant that Jessica now had to plop herself down uselessly into her chair inbetween each and every sitting. The act of physically removing herself from such a low spot on the ground meant that she was simply not getting up as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was exhausted, the long walk from her office to the company break room was a journey indeed. Her face, swollen and triply chinned, glowed beet red as sweat poured down her forehead and into the many crevices on her upperbody. She was gasping, panting, wheezing for air to reach her pathetic lungs; but it was worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith chubby sausage fingers, Jess tore open the first of many Hostess snack cakes with a greedy glee that of a child on Christmas morning. Lifting one thick arm, she stuffed an entire Ho-Ho into her mouth\u2014taking decadent sloppy bites of the dark chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had already eaten the cookie bouquet that Lucielle had brought her this morning, as well as the cobbler that Alice had made. And Mellissa\u2019s birthday cake had gone pretty fast too, with Jessica only getting about half of it before it was all gone. And even though she had promised Victoria that she\u2019d wait to eat the pasta she\u2019d made (after Jess had begged and begged her to) Jess had already eaten that too\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no mystery as to how Jessica had expanded so quickly\u2014easily putting on thirty pounds since the month had started. With how much she ate in a given day, combined with how sedentary her lifestyle was becoming, Jess\u2019 already fat form was blowing up faster than a parade float on thanksgiving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly typing on her keyboard with one free hand, so as to make her screensaver disappear, Jess hardly noticed the amount of strain it took to lean her heavyset shape. She was simply too fat to type with the keyboard facing her already, instead having to sit the computer sideways so that she might have a fair shot at reaching it without damaging her back. Of course she didn\u2019t mind, and in fact had done it unconsciously in her desperate attempts to make herself as comfortable as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fat face still flushed, she burbled and switched off, allowing her non-chocolatey hand a turn at the snacks while her other one opened the mini-fridge she had been given upon her promotion. She grabbed a soda and cracked it open, downing almost the whole can in the first drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her latest snack, Jessica resumed her day-to-day routine of lethargy. Her eyes lazily traipsed the computer screen while one hand idly scratched her belly\u2014occasionally giving it a little rub. She would continue doing this all day, if she had a mind to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her friends taking care of all her work, as well as supplying her with enough food to feed an army every week, it was no wonder that Jessica had such an easy lifestyle where she was free to gorge herself into a hoggish bliss\u2026</span></div></div>",

It seemed as soon as she got done eating one morsel, another was immediately given to her; she was practically stuffing herself all day, and there was never a moment during her work hours where her belly wasn\u2019t full to bursting. Now sure, Jess may have been promoted and had given into her gluttony and lethargy, but that didn\u2019t mean that she let all the power go to her head; she was still the kind, sweet, slightly naive and gullible butterball she was prior to her promotion to the corporate executive. She happily accepted anything she was given, and ate with utterly wild abandon. The next few weeks or so, considering it was just starting to be November, everyone was inviting her over for numerous hearty meals, and giving her leftover candy they\u2019d had from Halloween, as well as baked treats and confectionaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Jess was lazily leaning back in her chair, rubbing her overtaxed, stuffed gut. It was taut as a drum and only one button was left on her shirt, struggling to contain her large breasts as she gasped for air from how painfully full she was, and her plump face was red from the exertion of glutting herself to bursting point. Just then, Lucielle and Alice walked in, bringing more food. Jessica groaned as she saw how large the portions were, as they only seemed to get bigger and bigger each day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jess, I thought you might like a slice of this pumpkin pie I had left over from a few days ago, so I saved it for you\u201d Alice said cheerfully, placing the large container on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I brought your favorite; banana pudding with cookies and whipped cream\u201d Lucielle cooed, placing the large bowl next to the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh urm\u2026th-thank *pant* you two, I\u2019ll be *wheeze* sure to eat them later\u2026\u201d Jess said with a smile, rubbing her strained stomach. She wanted to be polite, despite the immense, discomforting, gurgling indigestion she felt roiling in the depths of her swollen gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave, Alice and Lucielle waddled their bulks back to their own offices, leaving Jessica to try and wait out the digesting of her overtaxed stomach. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sat back in her chair, content to not get up for a long while; she was exactly like a beached whale, able to do nothing but lay there and moan at her discomfort.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated brunette held and massaged as much of her belly as she could reach, letting out numerous burps to try and relieve the intense pressure she felt inside her abdomen.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*burrrp* ugh, i'm so full...*urp* I need to learn not to eat so much... Oogh.\" she moaned, wincing as she pressing on her belly slightly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed in a strange combination of utter bliss and great discomfort for Jess as she kept her gut stuffed to the brim at every waking moment, though she had found taking short naps helped with digestion somewhat. When her friends came in to talk to her though, her extremely bloated state made her very unresponsive and incoherent. They just set down what ever it was they had to give her, be it food or paperwork, and leave.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now sat there giggling and smiling as she completely gave in to hoggish bliss, and her bliss seemed to now fully take over the feeling of her uncomfortably full belly.

Slabs of fat laid on top of each other, from her enormous boobs to her last belly roll. Her blubbery flesh oozing out of her clothes and chair. She undid the bottom buttons of her shirt so that her big belly was free. Leaving just two buttons to cover as much of her flabby boobs as possible. She was the definition of \u201cletting it all hang out\u201d. Just then Lucielle walked in to her office. Alarmed by the massive pile of naked flesh that was her friend she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it a bad time?\u201d she asked. Jessica looked over, unaware of her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not at all.

It was just sitting in the fridge.\u201d Lucielle placed it on Jessica\u2019s desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh, Lucie did you gain some weight?\u201d Jessica said. The way Lucielle ate she was pretty much always gaining weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!... Well maybe just a little bit.\u201d Lucielle joked, while holding her belly playfully. She was about to joke about Jess\u2019s weight but decided it was maybe a little more serious of a topic than her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can you lend me a hand with something?\u201d Jessica asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah of course, what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to unzip my pants.\u201d Jessica asked pointing to her waist. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to find the zipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh okay,\u201d Lucielle said, a bit shocked by the request. She walked around to Jessica\u2019s side of her desk. Jessica put her hands under the immense crevice made by her gut and her thighs. She lifted her flabby rolls up and sure enough there was her pants zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it.\u201d Lucielle said as she dug her hand into the flabby maw that is her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 thank you.\u201d Jessica moaned, as the tension around her middle was relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso another thing for you is this\u2026\u201d Lucielle watched as Jessica started to pull herself towards the cake placed on her desk.

It was here that Alice finally got a good understanding of Jess's true size. <br>\r\nBoth women were dressed in comfortable, everyday clothing. Jessica though, she had managed to put on so much weight lately that her clothes looked anything but comfortable; the former figure-hugging tanktop she now adorned had become nothing but a tight piece of cloth wrapped around her bulbous breasts, her huge multi-rolled gut on full display. She also wore some jeans that, previously, fit her quite well, but nowadays she quickly grew out of breath just from the immense effort it took to struggle her wide, plush hips and round, globulous rear into them, leaving them unbuttoned and unzipped as her gut covered the flaps of the pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is nice, isn't it Jess? George actually knows how to take care of his customers, especially larger girls.\" Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, it sure is\" Jessica replied, taking a few donuts from a nearby platter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down, awaiting for their appointed time to be measured and fitted for their new clothes. They nestled themselves into the chairs, Jessica letting out a slight groan as she wedged her fat hips in between the armrests, snacking on the complimentary pastries left for the customers to indulge themselves while they waited. She had cleared a whole plate and had started on another when they were called by the secretary for their appointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Jef, Lef go\" said Alice as she scarfed down a couple donuts, having sampled a few, and standing, helping Jessica to her feet. Both women were out of breath from the effort, Alice almost losing her balance as she finally got her much heavier friend to a standing position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank *huff* you *wheeze*\" Jessica put a hand to her chest, trying to steady her frantic breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem...*pant*\" Alice said, panting slightly from the effort it took, though not nearly as much as Jessica. Alice took yet another look at her friend, and thought about something for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gosh, she's getting pretty big...not to mention heavy! Though I don't want to say anything, since she's been so nice to me and everyone else, even after getting promoted, she's still a down-to-earth kind of gal...besides, she seems to be enjoying herself, I suppose...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waddled their hefty frames into the back room, which was much like the waiting area, except there were long table completely covered with pastries and desserts and small snacks of all varieties, and not to mention George had hired a couple more assistants, both looking quite chubby, probably put on a few during their time working there, as well as needing to bulk up a bit in order to help the significantly weightier women that often came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one of us should go first then?\" Jess asked, turning to face her much smaller friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should go first Jessy, it was your idea to come here, after all you invited me.\" Alice said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Alice. you're so sweet\" she smiled, hugging Alice, their belly rolls squashing together, and their breasts smooshed and jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you're welcome Jessica.\" Alice went and sat down, happily eating a few pieces of cake here, or some candy there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Jessica was helped out of her ill-fitting clothes by the plump assistants, taking extra care as the two women put Jessica's garments aside for later, then George appeared, ready to take Jess's measurements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tailor chuckled as he could wrapped the measuring tape around her breasts, then her bulbous, jutting gut that jiggled at the slightest disturbance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems you've filled out a bit since last time my dear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I have, a big girl like me needs to eat\" Jess giggled, causing her abundance of flesh to wobble and shake. She was not exactly aware of just how BIG she was. In her mind, she was merely chubby, when in reality she was becoming quite obese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked on with some shock, gazing at Jessica's under-wear clad body, it seemed a bit larger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Jessica was done being measured and it was the heavy sweetheart's turn. she lifted her large butt from the comfy armchair, and made her way over to George, one assistant helping her undress while the other one went to help Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice was measured, Jessica contentedly glutted herself on pastries and sweets, the amply fleshed out assistant on standby to help her stand if need be and to also fetch her more snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge made some small talk with Alice as he measured her bulging butt, her thick thighs, her plump belly, and her balloon-like breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, both women had been measured and they left, being told that their newly fitted work clothes (as well as a couple casual clothes for Jessica) would be ready in a few weeks' time. </span></div></div>",

She really loved eating Carrie\u2019s delicious food at work, but Carrie never brought enough food for a whole meal. The idea of having 3 or 4 courses of Carrie\u2019s delicious cooking was a dream for Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica picked up a burger from McDonalds to eat on the way to Carrie\u2019s. She pulled up to the house and opened the door of her large SUV. She shifted her bulging gut as she attempted to squeeze her overfed frame out of the car. Jess had change out of her work clothes and slipped into something more comfortable. Her thick overly plump legs were wrapped in Jess\u2019s massive pink track pants. Her swollen overfed upper body was covered rather tightly by her enormous white V-neck t-shirt. Her outfit wasn\u2019t as classy as Jess may have liked but due to her recent gaining they were the only clothes that fit her besides her dirty work clothes. She made a note to visit George, her tailor, soon. She waddled over to Carries front door. Carrie opened the door for Jessica.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jessy, come in. we almost started without you.\u201d Carrie joked. She lead Jessica into the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Melissa were seated in the dining room. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Jess, How are you doing?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d Jessica said. She sat down at the large table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I\u2019ve been looking forward to this all day.\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get the food from the kitchen.\u201d Carrie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my first time being here. Carrie really knows how to decorate, not as much as she knows food though.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Carrie\u2019s had me and Al over quite a bit recently.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d come over every day if I could.\u201d Alice said. They all laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that Jessica wasn\u2019t the only one in the office that had fallen for Carrie\u2019s cooking. Jessica was a bit surprised by how fat Alice and Melissa were. They had always been fat before but they had clearly gained significantly more weight recently. What Jess wasn\u2019t entirely aware of was that Alice and Melissa had been going to Carrie\u2019s house for dinner at least twice a week ever since Carrie joined the office. This had caused them to balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had eaten herself all the way to 415 pounds. She could barely fit her plump overfed butt in her seat at the table. Her bloated belly filled up her whole lap. Her breasts had swollen into to massive melons resting on the top of her numerous fat rolls. She was practically bursting out of her tight outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had reached 425 pounds thanks to Carrie\u2019s delicious cooking. Her belly had certainly grown as it hung over the edge of her chair. Melissa\u2019s cute, greedy face had become rounder and her second chin thickened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was taken aback by her friends appearance but she would quickly forget about it as the food hit the table.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019ll be fun!\u201d Jess didn\u2019t even have to think about it. After the magnificent meal she just had there was no way she could say no to more of Carrie\u2019s cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I will.

See you then.\u201d Jess said as she waddled back to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Jess returned to Carrie\u2019s house. The immense woman knocked on Carrie\u2019s door. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Jess. How are you doing? Please come in.\u201d Carrie said. Jessica waddled her hefty figure inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m great. Dinner last night was amazing.\u201d Jess said. She followed Carrie into the kitchen. \u201cWow this is some kitchen Carrie.\u201d Carrie\u2019s kitchen was impressive. It was clear Carrie took her hobby of cooking very seriously. There were shelves full of cookbooks and an endless number of appliances, some of which Jess had never even seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh thanks it\u2019s a mess right now, I started early on the cooking so you wouldn\u2019t have to wait.\u201d Carrie said. She picked up a thick heavy cookbook. \u201cI figured I\u2019d just go through some this cookbook first. It\u2019s got some Italian, some Mexican, and some great desserts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, that sounds good I guess. What do you want me to do?\u201d Jess said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere follow me.\u201d Carrie walked to the living room. \u201cYou can just sit on the sofa and watch TV. I\u2019ll just bring the dishes in as they are ready.\u201d Jess was stunned. In the living room was a rather large TV, some lounge chairs and a sofa, but what caught Jess\u2019s eye was the coffee table in front of the sofa that was covered in delicious food. The smell was intoxicating to Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that sounds great.\u201d Jess said. She shuffled over to the sofa. The springs cried as Jen sat her immense body down. She turned on the TV and took her first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you have to leave at anytime?\u201d Carrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 no not really.\u201d Jess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Well you can just spend the day here. You can even stay for dinner if you want.\u201d Carrie said. Seeing as it was 10 am it was clear that the two had a long day ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jessica started to eat. The first course went pretty fast. Carrie of course had more dishes ready just in time.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did you think?\u201d Carrie asked. Jess rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really liked it. The mashed potatoes could\u2019ve used some more flavor but that\u2019s it really.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat well I have more for you.\u201d Carrie said, placing plates in front of Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Wow that\u2019s fast.\u201d Jess said, not expecting such a continuous stream of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, enjoy!\u201d Carries said, going back to the kitchen. Jess continued to shovel food into her big gut. She was really enjoying herself. Not having to move a muscle as food just kept coming in. Jess loved the feeling of filling herself up (which was getting harder and harder to do as the years went by). Her taste buds experienced an endless pleasure as more and more of Carrie\u2019s delicious food passed her lips. A few hours went by and it was time for lunch. Jessica decided she\u2019d take a break from her endless binge so that Carrie could eat something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica tried to lift herself off the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Carrie asked, as she ate lunch in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBathroom.\u201d Jessica said. Jessica struggled though as her bloated 460 pound body clung to the sofa. The hefty porker started to sweat as her feeble muscles attempted to lift her blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere let me help.\u201d Carrie said, seeing her friend in distress. Slowly Jess rose off the couch. Jess clumsily wobbled towards the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

Jessica nodded. Of course Jess wasn\u2019t exactly okay. For starters she was massive. Her body was doughy blimp. Also though, Jessica was on pace to eat the most food she had ever eaten in a day. Her belly had been stuffed for hours. Never before had she felt so full. She never let her body digest. It was a constant stream of food entering her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll bring more plates in five minutes.\u201d Carrie said, as she returned to the kitchen.

Massaging the massive ball of food in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy that was a lot of food.\u201d Jess thought. She thought about how her day was going. She was in a bit of pain. Breathing heavily, drenched in sweat her stomach felt numb from the onslaught of food being packed in to her system. She let out an enormous belch and smiled. Somehow Jessica was really enjoying all this. Sweet, kind, harmless, Jessica thoroughly enjoyed this act of indecent, excessive, and piggish gluttony. She hadn\u2019t even considered the consequences of such extreme eating (that was true for most of her life).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie!

The bar was a favorite of the rising obese population nearby, so it was perfect for the three whalish women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice managed to park right in front of the bar.<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m not very late.\u201d She thought. Alice struggled to lift her enormous frame out of the car.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was harder than usual.\u201d She said as she finally got out of her seat. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just low on energy, I am starving after all.\u201d Alice waddled into the bar. She spotted Jess and Melissa sitting in a booth in the back of the room. Alice struggled to fit into the booth. Melissa awkwardly tried to scooch her immense flesh to make some room for Alice. The booth had been designed to accommodate larger customers but Alice, Melissa, and Jessica had far exceeded that size. The three had managed to eat their way beyond thick, curvy, chubby, fat, bbw, obese, and morbidly obese into a whole other category of size. The booth was packed with the trio\u2019s excessive rolling fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys what are you talking about?\u201d Alice asked. <br>\r\n\u201cOh were just talking about work.\u201d Melissa said. The three girls started to drink beers and eat large orders of the greasy but delicious bar food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took quite a while for them to get tipsy off of their beers. Because of their enormous amounts of blubber and the large amount of food in their stomachs it took a lot of alcohol to get properly drunk. After a couple of hours they did finally manage to reach a state of inebriation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s just so hard to get any work done.\u201d Jessica complained. <br>\r\n\u201cHow *burp* so?\u201d Melissa asked. <br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s just such a pain to get around the office.\u201d Jessica put her hands on her belly flab.<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Alice replied.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s just so hard to focus when I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n\u201cI always find myself wishing I had something more to eat.\u201d Melissa said. Their appetites had become so large that even the constant snacking couldn\u2019t satisfy their bellowing guts.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Jessica couldn\u2019t you just fix it? You are the boss after all.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah just like allow more eating in the office.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess I could. It may slow down work with all that eating though.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to work as it is though.\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n\u201cHmm I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice pictured her ideal perfect fantasy. She was sitting on a large bed. It was a romantic setting. Her overweight body propped up by a collection of pillows. Alice\u2019s body was roughly 300 pounds. She was in sexy underwear and a slightly transparent loose dress. Surrounding Alice on the large bed was numerous platters of food. She grabbed the food around her and started to stuff her face. Her left hand grabbed a big handful of fries from a platter on her left. As she shoved the fries in her mouth her right hand grabbed a big slice of cake from the right side of the bed. As she made her way through the plates and platters more food seemed to show up from nowhere. Alice was so comfortable as she indulged her endless appetite. Her body grew fatter and fatter. Her big belly swelled in her lap as it oozed over her thickening thighs. Cakes, burgers, pastries, burritos, fries, nachos, chicken wings, Alice made her way through a never ending stream of various dishes. Her flabby body got bigger and bigger. Her large bottom grew wider. Alice was starting to take up more and more space on the bed. There was less room for dishes as her engorged gut and thick legs oozed more and more on the mattress. She started getting very big. Her enormous butt sunk deeper in to the soft bed. Her once loose fitting dress was pressed tightly against her gut. It slowly rode up her ballooning body until it barely covered her top belly roll. She continued her indulgent fantasy until suddenly she heard a large grown as the bed broke under her obese body. Alice snapped out of her brief daydream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Melissa was also picturing her greatest fantasy. She was in a beautiful castle, sitting on a golden throne. Her obese body was dressed in a fancy royal dress as it sat comfortably in the large throne. In front of her was a small table and a long line of people. The line seemed to go on forever and each person in line was carrying a plate of food. Melissa demolished the plate of food on the table in front of her. Immediately a servant removed the plate and the first person in line placed a dish in front of her. As she finished the next plate she yelled \u201cNEXT!\u201d one servant removed the plate and another servant quickly wiped Melissa\u2019s face with a napkin until the next dish hit the table. She went through plate after plate. The long line of people moved fairly quickly but the end of the line was nowhere in site. Melissa greedily consumed. She ate faster and faster. Her belly was getting fatter and bigger. The rest of her body started to fill out the frame of the large throne. Tears could be heard as her bloated gut pushed against the outgrown dress. Her massive middle became more visible as the dress gave way to her increasing flesh. Melissa continued her eating until finally the dress gave up and her belly oozed forward, no longer held back by the confines of clothes. Her massive gut filled out her entire lap reaching all the way to the end of the seat. The peasants and servants around her stared at her not sure how their royal queen would react. They had never seen such a sight of their obese queen\u2019s naked blubber rolls spread over the seat of the throne. <br>\r\n\u201cDid I say to stop?\u201d Melissa yelled harshly. The serving and eating continued but Melissa struggled now that her massive belly had been let loose. Her multiple spare tires served as a mighty obstacle for her arms to reach the food in front of her. She tried to lean her hefty upper body forward but couldn\u2019t. Finally one person, having watched his queen squirm and struggle to reach past her swollen belly, placed his plate on her top of her great fat rolls. Melissa happily scarfed down the food from atop her fat. From then on every plate was placed on her hefty gut. Melissa had become an eating behemoth. Her massive porky bottom and thick flabby thighs filled every crevice of the luxurious throne with soft pale flesh. Her gut reached past her thighs all the way over the edge of her seat. Her clothes had been torn to shreds as they still managed to hang over Melissa\u2019s rippling fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica too imagined a glimpse of her greatest fantasy and her purest desire. Jessica found herself in a room full of food. She wasn\u2019t sure how big the room was since she couldn\u2019t see past the tall mounds of food. Next to Jessica was chair. Jessica was a plump 300 pounds. She was in a casual outfit. She sat down and started to eat from the surrounding piles of food. Jess ate for a while in the chair. It was the most wonderful food she\u2019d ever eaten. She started to get bigger and bigger as she gobbled down the enormous quantities of food. One by one buttons started popping off her blouse. Fat started to pile on to her already plump frame. Her belly grew larger and larger as her fat rolls swelled. Her breasts became so plump with flab they stretched her shirt. The rather small chair she sat on groaned under her enormous body. Her round butt had grown too wide for the chair and her plumped up cheeks hung over the side of the chair. Jessica was a total pig. Her blouse was now completely open as her naked fat hung freely. Her face and enormous breasts were covered with various crumbs and sauces. With a complete lack of grace, she simply grabbed handfuls of food and shoved as much as she could into her mouth. Her clothes ripped more and more. Her pants rip right down the middle as her large butt and panties pushed outward. The chair started to groan more and more until finally it gave way. Jessica fell backwards as the chair collapsed under her. Driven by her incredible appetite and gluttony she wasn\u2019t even phased by the accident. She struggled to get up on her knees. From her knees she continued to shovel food into her mouth. Her clothes were barely clinging to her flabby body. She was on all fours with her butt to the sky as she devoured the endless amount of food. Eventually her meaty shoulders and girthy thighs ripped her clothes clean off. Jessica still sat hunched over in nothing but her bra and panties consuming more and more. Her chubby cheeks were covered in icing as crumbs fell into her various crevices of fat. Jess got so much fatter. Eventually Jessica stopped propping herself up with her hands, instead she just laid on her knees and bloated belly. She used both hands to shovel food into her. Her 500+ pound body rippled as she gorged herself bigger and bigger. Her panties and bra snapped right off her body as her big inflated butt rippled free from the fabric. Jessica was an enormous glutton. Her overfed belly sprawled out on the floor from under her hefty frame. She had become a messy, naked, 600 pound pig of a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women had snapped out of their fantasies as a waitress approached their table.<br>\r\n\u201cWould you gals like some more or-<br>\r\n\u201cYES!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though affter much tugging and squirming, it was clear that both women were much too fat, and their weakened muscles didn't seem to help either.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, help\" Alice panted.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One sec.\" Melissa heaved her ludicrously round, flabby body up from her seated position and began pulling on Alice, wrapping her hands around Alice's middle.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof!

Her thirst on the way up had been quenched by a pepsi that she had gulped down, and she prepared her daily feast; Multiple twix bar wrappers sat on the floor and she was biting into her tenth bar, going through it like clockwork. A mountain of Lays bags sat behind her in her own, personal feasting cabinet. She ate with wild abandon, and her habit was this, just about every day. The morbidly obese woman ensured to sit in her chair with care, not wishing to repeat today's earlier fluke.She wondered what kind of a lazy bastard designed such a flimsy chair.. <i>Joining this office was the best decision I ever have made,</i> thought Jessica. She looked at her mini-fridge, knowingly full of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucielle held a scale and some measuring tape as she walked through the hallway.

And...*Pant*..What's that...*Huff* Scale for?\" Lucille shook her head. \"This company has done great under your management, but the problem is you need to be alive to see your management.\" Jessica spoke. \"W-Well, it's not like i'm about to die, is it?

It came up after a bit:Lucille read out the number:  \"552.\" Jessica stared in disbelief as Lucielle wrapped the yellow tape around her waist, an extra-long tape. \"Seventy six, Jess.\" Jessica's emotions became a flurry, and her carefully constructed world had come crumbling down at these sounds. Had she not truly been as 'chubby' as she thought? Had she let herself go that far? Lucille looked at her, concernedly. \"Please, Jess.

She felt his hands sink into her blubbery ass and gave her a push, freeing Jessica\u2019s massive form. Her body jiggling as she stumbled into her office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she straighten her dress, she turn to Tom. \u201cThank you love.\u201d Kissing him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for my fluffy angel.\u201d. Tom said coming in for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, too fluffy for the door.\u201d Jessica said seriously. \u201c Maybe I should loose a few pounds, before I am get fluffy even for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, the fluffier you are harder I am.\u201d Tom said squeezing her ass. Jessica giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it we agreed we don\u2019t want the office to know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, you might want this!\u201d Tom smiled showing Jessica\u2019s underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grabbed her underwear, looking surprised then mad. \u201cNot at the office.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean you are going sit on me tonight?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c How is that punishment?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The two ladies struggled to exit their seats. They had grown quite large under Carrie\u2019s influence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had put on even more weight on to her large gut putting her at 440 pounds. The greedy piggish woman struggled as her gut pressed against the edge of the table. Having such a prominent belly made her especially wedged in the booth. Her upper roll of fat had oozed several inches on to the table. Below the table Melissa\u2019s doughy flab had become so swollen and overfed it had taken up her entire lap space. The bottom layer of her stacked ball of soft flesh that protruded from her torso spread over her lap so much that her excess blubber hung over the edge of the booth bench. She awkwardly shuffled down to the end of the booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was always the less gluttonous one in her friendship with Melissa, but since her discovery of Carrie\u2019s incredible cuisine that dynamic had changed. Alice had managed to reach 450 pounds after pigging out on Carrie\u2019s food so much. At Carrie\u2019s house Alice\u2019s appetite had increased to overtake her always indulgent friend Melissa. Fortunately for Alice, her body had grown more proportionally than Mel\u2019s and so her gut had not trapped her in the booth like her friend. She scooted down to the edge of the bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant employees looked over to the struggling obese beauties. They were used to such a sight since the restaurant was a destination for the fattest ladies of the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a situation at table 5.\u201d The manager said. Four employees came over to help. Two of them came over to Melissa. One grabbed the waist of her pants. Her muffin top was hanging over it but the employee dug into her fat to grip it. The other employee grabbed her hands as the two employees pulled her free from the booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the booth Alice was glued to the seat. Her immense blubber butt made it hard for Alice to get up on her feet. Two employees grabbed her chubby hands. They struggled to lift the large woman. Fabric strained as Alice shifted out of her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank *pant* you.\u201d Alice said as she stretched her weak muscles. The 4 employees stood around the two massive women as they left their table. The plodding whales slowly made their way to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you noticed that Jessica has gained some weight?\u201d Alice said. She pulled her pants up. There was still a few inches of her plump crack revealed above her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Jess is huge! *Pant* she can barely *gasp* move.\u201d Melissa said. She felt a cool breeze on her belly. Her gut had outgrown her shirt and hung naked, jiggling over her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess *wheeze*\u2026 Apparently she *burp* eats at Carrie\u2019s\u2026 er-ugh\u2026 on the weekends.\u201d Alice said. Her soft swollen breasts jiggled with each step. At one time they would have a nice bounce in unison with Alice\u2019s stride. Now they had grown so full of fat and had become so heavy with doughy flesh that they weighed down on top of her bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine spending a whole *burp* day with Carrie in the *wheeze* kitchen.\u201d Melissa said. They finally made it to Alice\u2019s car. The two lowered their immense bulks into the two front seats. The car sunk under the hefty friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be a *pant* dream.\u201d Alice said. Her massive flab folds struggled to fit into the drivers seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew, I think I need to go to the Tailor soon.\u201d Melissa said. Her engorged gut rubbed against the glove compartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Alice said.</span></div></div>",

George knows how to run a business.\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what it is about my clothes recently. They just fall apart like they\u2019re made of tissue paper.\u201d Jess said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they never fit, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gained all that much weight recently. Yet everything is too small.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s just the fabric. It\u2019s so cheap but it rips and shrinks with just one wash. All the material nowadays is much worse than it used to be.\u201d Melissa replied. Of course really it was just that Carrie had caused them all to gain so much recently, but they were painfully oblivious to their absurd change in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s ready to see you now.\u201d A woman who worked there said to them. The three fatties were sitting on the three sofas that were in the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clets go then.\u201d Alice said. A swarm of employees came over to help them get off of the sofa. Alice, Melissa, and Jess were slowly lifted up after a few tries. The party of employees shepherded the three blimps into the back of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if it wasn\u2019t three of my favorite customers.\u201d George said. He went over to give them a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh *pant* George, you\u2026 You\u2019re too *wheeze* sweet.\u201d Alice said. George barely got his arms around the sides of each of their bloated bellies. The thin man sunk deep into the endless folds of flesh that each girl had accumulated. He was a bit taken aback at the vast increase in each girls girth since their last visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who\u2019s is going to go first?\u201d George asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will I guess.\u201d Jessica said. Alice and Melissa waddled to a corner of the room with two very wide seats and many tables full of sweets. Alice and Melissa heavily plopped down on the large chairs. A group of George\u2019s helpers followed them. Alice and Melissa just sat there like obese sweaty pigs. They were already tired and out of breath from the walk from the parking lot. The big butterballs sat like to mounds of hungry flesh. They were too fat to reach any of the treats that surrounded them but luckily two employees started hand feeding the pastries to them. Another person asked them what clothes they were planning to order and numerous other questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the middle of the room was Jessica. One of George\u2019s helpers started feeding her pastries as well. Quickly two more helpers came over to undress her. Jessica was capable of taking her clothes off but George didn\u2019t want her to get all flustered by that much activity. Her pants and shirt came off fairly quickly. That\u2019s when George came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Jessica what brings you here?\u201d As if he even needed to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my clothes have been tearing left and right recently.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you think that\u2019s happening?\u201d George asked. He had another assistant hold his measuring tape on the other side of Jess\u2019s gigantic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gained much weight recently.\u201d Jess said. George measured all over the huge woman. He couldn\u2019t believe how fat she had gotten. She had rolls of flab hanging everywhere. He barely had enough tape measure to reach around her incredible torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s odd. Anyway how have you been?\u201d George asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. My friend loves to cook and she\u2019s been making meals for me recently.\u201d Jessica said. George was struggling to squeeze his tape measure between her absurdly thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah what kind of meals? Can you give me an example?\u201d George asked. He knew what his customers were interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yesterday she made me 3 chickens, some mashed potatoes, some crabcakes, deviled eggs, a milkshake, brownies\u2026\u201d Jessica went on and on. She started to drool as she retold her entire meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you step on this scale?\u201d George asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you weighing me?\u201d Jess replied. She had never been weighed by George before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new thing we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s so we can predict how big your clothes will need to be when you get them. It\u2019s just something for our records.\u201d George said. Jess thought about it and didn\u2019t see anything wrong with his reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do I weigh?\u201d Jess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c478 pounds.\u201d George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c478 pounds!\u201d Jess said as she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s pretty small compared to most of my customers.\u201d George said. That wasn\u2019t entirely true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? So that\u2019s not even that bad? 478 seems higher than usual.\u201d Jess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess you\u2019re fine, you have nothing to worry about. Now go get your clothes back on.\u201d Jess had some help getting back in her clothes as she waddled over to the seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d George asked. Alice volunteered. A few helpers assisted her as she stood up. She was then undressed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest butt I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d One of the assistant\u2019s said as she stripped off her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Thank you.\u201d Alice said. She figured this was a compliment about her curvaceous figure. Really though the assistant just couldn\u2019t believe how inflated her fat rear had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Alice you look different for some reason.\u201d George said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think my breasts got larger.\u201d Alice said. In reality her entire body had gotten much larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe measuring went as usual. The same occurred after with Melissa. Finally though all three girls had been successfully measured. They slowly waddled out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour clothes will be ready soon!\u201d George shouted as they exited the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d They replied.<br>\r\nThe three gorged giants waddled to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to eat at Carrie\u2019s later.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m starving.\u201d Melissa added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we\u2019re supposed to be at Carrie\u2019s in 2 hours. Why don\u2019t we stop by the food court before we leave?\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could use a snack.\u201d Melissa replied. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica, Alice, and Melissa continued to excessively gorge themselves, mostly on the delicious food of Carrie. After a few weeks they were ready to pick up their new clothes from George, the tailor. <br>\r\nThe three ladies picked up their clothes and returned to their homes to try them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa waddled to her bedroom.<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s try something on here.\u201d Melissa stripped out of her ill-fitting clothes. She sat on her bed with her belly dripping over the edge. First she pulled on her pants. They fit relatively well.<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if I can fit my belly into this.\u201d She pulled her pants up over her bulging gut. Her large belly apron wobbled and jiggled as she attempted to cram in her pants.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess that\u2019s not too surprising.\u201d Melissa said. Truth be told there wasn\u2019t a pair of pants in the world that could fit over her massive fat rolls.<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s try this shirt then.\u201d She said. She slipped her flabby arms into the sleeves. Now she just had to button it. She had to look in the mirror to see past her bulging middle. She struggled to reach her arms around her big stack of belly fat. After sucking in as hard as she could she managed to get the first few buttons.<br>\r\n\u201cErr this isn\u2019t fitting like I thought.\u201d Melissa said. She struggled to fit the fabric over the roundest part of her belly. She noticed her soft flesh sticking out of gaps between the buttons of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jessica was also trying on some clothes. She was trying to pull her pants off the ground and over her legs. Unfortunately her massive belly and thighs was making it hard to grab the pants.<br>\r\n\u201cErrr.. so close.\u201d She was desperately bent over sticking her wide rear in their. SNAP! Her panties suddenly snapped right off her crotch.<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least those weren\u2019t new.\u201d Her two shapeless cheeks jiggled as the underwear fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Alice was having trouble of her own with her new clothes. She was looking at her rear in the mirror.<br>\r\n\u201cJust a few more inches and they\u2019d fit.\u201d Alice said. She had managed to fit into a shirt and pants. Unfortunately her pants still revealed three inches of her enormous butt cheeks. She shuffled her large hips and pulled on the waistband. Her butt was so packed into the pants that it actually bounced like two big beach balls. The tight pants actually gave her blubbery bottom some shape as opposed to the wobbling shapeless orbs of fat they actually were. Slowly she actually managed to cover a few more inches until finally\u2026 POP! The button of the pants flew straight off.<br>\r\n\u201cDammit!\u201d Alice cursed. The pants actually fit over her rear now but she was left without a button. <br>\r\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s still pretty tight, but it could work.\u201d She said admiring her tremendous butt and hips. She waddled over to the button on the floor. She bent over to pick it up but stopped when she heard a loud rip. The seat of her pants had ripped right down the middle, exposing her panties and crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa finally buttoned the last of her shirt up. <br>\r\n\u201cThat fits!\u201d Melissa celebrated. She went to her sofa to sit down. As she sat down her belly oozed out, filling up her lap space. POP POP POP! Almost all of the buttons of her shirt flew off as her gut surged forward.<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap.\u201d Melissa said. She rubbed her naked fat rolls. \u201cCan\u2019t you learn to cooperate?\u201d She said to her obese belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica struggled to fit into her new clothing but finally she managed to get some on. She felt the fabric stretch of her curves and bulges.<br>\r\n\u201cSure feels a bit snug but that\u2019s okay right? I should see how it looks.\u201d Jessica said. She waddled into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. She couldn\u2019t really see past her immense breasts without a mirror. She was surprised to see her new shirt and pants were riddled with rips and tears. Jessica was so fat that she really didn\u2019t even notice the subtle tears and rips in her clothes.<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s certainly a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she exited through the second automatic door, She felt a sudden impact on the right side, as though someone had run into her. She turned and looked. It was a woman in a North Face jacket and Jeans, who smelled of Tobacco smoke. \"Ohp! Sorry honey!\" The woman chuckled and spoke with a voice that was a bit higher than Jessica. \"Oh, it's alright, My fault. I should have been watching where I was going.\" Jessica replied. \"No, I'm sorry, I got in the way. What's your name?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman spoke, putting her right hand to her pocket. \"Anna. Anna Varnes. You?\" Jessica then replied, \"Jessica, Jessica Patterson.\" The two women shook hands. \"Well, Nice to meet you. Hey, want to hang out? I was getting ready to go to a yoga class, and you're more than welcome to come.\" Jessica, after thinking a little about it, spoke. \"Eh, sure. I don't really have anywhere to be.\" The two ladies walked to the parking lot, Anna pointed out her car. \"Follow me, I'll show you to the place.\" Jessica found her car and hopped in, cranked the ignition, and followed Anna's red honda civic to a 2-story building with a muscular arm holding a dumbbell on the top, with the words \"Gerrald's Gym\" emblazoned on either side. Jessica took out her gym bag, buried within a box, also containing a water bottle, which she took and went inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed in a horribly ill-fitting tank-top that hugged every single fat roll on her body, and a pair of green shorts that seemed to be airtight that caused her fatty thighs to balloon out below them, Jessica waddled uncomfortably behind Anna into a wide, spacious room with mirrors on every side and a large audio system in the middle. Standing beside the audio system stood a whip-thin woman in about her 40's, with a face that was rather long and tan, leathery skin, dressed in a blue tank top and a pair of black yoga pants. As the time ticked to 8 PM, the instructor turned to the class and spoke. \"Namaste, class, welcome to Yoga. I'm Adrianna. Today we're gonna focus on breathing.\" It seemed that every single letter of every word she spoke was elongated, held out. She initiated the class with multitudes of positions that Jessica only understood by seeing what Anna did. She followed suit, but she wobbled in her stance a lot more. Soon she heard the instructor's voice beside her. \"Calm. Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth. Slow your breathing.\" Jessica did so, and she found that she still wobbled, but her heart rate was starting to stabilize. A similar pattern followed through the class. By the end, Jessica was somewhere between a slight glistening of sweat and a flood of sweat. She followed Anna outside, drank the last of her water, and while Anna lit up a cig...</span></div></div>",

Chelsea lifted her head and looked Miranda into her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea... please come into my office! We have to talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde thin lady felt negative vibes and carried her 110 pounds (50 kg) on her 5\u00b45 (163 cm) fram inot Miranda\u00b4s office as slow as she could. Closing the door behind her Chelsea sat down on the chair her boss had prepared for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda mustered her boss with her eyes... at 35 years of age her boss was quite a bombshell even though no real competiton for Chelsea in her own mind. Looking at the photos on the desk and wall Chelsea could see her Hispanic-based boss was a slim and trim lady in her university days. But 2 pregnancies had done her toll and Chelsea could see the small potbelly that Miranda\u00b4s suit sported while the raven-haired Latina took her own seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea\" her boss started \"I know you have great references but your attitude is a no go! There are so many complains that you leave your seat for smoke breaks so often... There are already rumors you spent more time smoking than working, you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it\u00b4s not my fault this state has a strict anti-smoking rule! And I need my cigs to stay calm and concentrated.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I see, Chelsea... It\u00b4s not that I don\u00b4t understand you but you have to stop it. By the way... you remember the questionaire you filled out when you apllied over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I do? What\u00b4s the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea... you stated to be a non-smoker... Have look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde took the copy of the questionaire Miranda passed over. Yes, there it was... She picked \"NO\" being asked about her smoking habits. Chelsea shrugged... How could she even think to get away with such a lie just to look much better and more responsible to improve her chances to get the job? But how could anyone expect such a slim person like her to be a non-smoker for real? All the girls she had under her belt as captain of the cheersquad smoked like chimneys to stay slim and trim... So was it her fault that soemone belived a lie that was obvious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay...\" Chelsea said rather quiet and insecure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, you obviously lied about that matter just to get the job. You know what... we have a strcit anti-smoking policy over here and we do not sign up smokers at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay... I\u00b4m going to be fired any second went tthrough Chelsea\u00b4s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I undestand you Chelsea. You wanted that job so much after graduation... and I must say aside from the time you are absent for taking puffs you seem to be a talent! So I might offer you the following: You promise that you will quit smoking immediately and I\u00b4ll cover you, okay? But I want you to sign a contract in which you agree to the term you will get fired if you ever spent working time for smoking issues. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea hadn\u00b4t to think twice... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u00b4s what I wanted to hear! I\u00b4ve already written down everything before, so here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper was handed over and Chelsea signed it with relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing now, Chelsea... Your cig pack, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde\u00b4s hand slid into the right side pocket of her black jeans. Seconds later the pack of cigs was handed over to Miranda who took a pair of scissors destroying each of the cancer sticks in front of Chelsea\u00b4s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u00b4s all for now, Chelsea! Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for my second chance, Miranda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... we all did stupid things at a young age, didn\u00b4t we?\" Miranda laughed before Chelsea stepped out of the office closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing back at her place Chelsea went thought the files, doing the calls needed and answered the mails coming in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, just before her break, Chelsea felt uncomfortable though... The cravings for nicotine finally hit her like a steamhammer... Oh man, she wanted to have a cig so badly. But she knew she couldn\u00b4t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new mail appeared on Chelsea\u00b4s screen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u00b4m doing my break now. What about you joining me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea looked at the sender information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mail came from...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1:<br>\r\nMiranda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2:<br>\r\nFelicia (co-worker, brunette, 5\u00b44 (163 cm), 120 pounds (55 kg), same age like Chelsea) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In an office, any ordinary office though especially this one in particular, someone taking the time out of their night to make a meal to bring in for a select few or (preferably) all of their coworkers to enjoy was a real treat. Not many people had the kind of patience and warm heart required to willingly set aside their free time to make a meal just to watch it be choked down by the usually unappreciative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was a welcomed exception to that rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReportedly, Carrie had no formal culinary education.  That being said, no one in the entire office would believe that for a moment. She was talented, a natural in front of the oven, and seemed to never spare an opportunity to remind her friends and coworkers in and of as much. Every other day, and according to those more fortunate than most, on the weekends when she afforded herself some overtime Carrie would bring in the biggest, richest meals to satisfy the knotted stomachs of her dear overworked coworkers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if someone was so lucky to get on her good side, rather her better side as no one could conceive a seriously negative thought to attach to Carrie\u2019s personage, she would sometimes invite her coworkers over for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it bluntly, it was no surprise how Carrie had amassed every two-hundred or so extra pounds that clung to her girlish figure. The meals she made for her guests were fantastically fattening, so rich and creamy that no one in their right minds could pass up an offer. And delicious to say the least, or so Carrie had been told a million times throughout her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an office bursting at the seams with rampant gluttony and monstrous appetites, it was no surprise that Carrie soon became very popular very quickly amongst her fellow coworkers. However she always preferred the sweet, lovable Alice over them all. She was softspoken, polite, and always brought her best manners over with her when Carrie invited her over. As the two grew closer and closer, Alice found herself seated at Carrie\u2019s dinnertable more and more often. These trips to Carrie\u2019s caused her so much immediate satisfaction, yet did little to quell the whalish woman\u2019s weighty woes, fueling her dietary drive even further in a strange variation on the typical morning after experience\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa watched from across the lunchroom table as Alice, oddly enough, nibbled at a salad. Though she showed little to no actual interest in the leafy meal, every time Alice would look up to see Melissa looking at her, she would dive back in with a practiced enthusiasm. Every now and then she let out a little \u201cMm, this sure is good!\u201d as if just to make sure that everyone knew what she was eating. After one such instance, Melissa\u2019s curiosity had gotten the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Al, what\u2019s the idea?\u201d she asked tersely, crossing her arms over her billowing belly as it hung off the edge of her chair between her legs, \u201cYou had a salad on Friday too. What\u2019s going on. Have you been talking to your sister again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice shrunk visibly, her cherubic cheeks glowing bright red as if soaked in embarrassment extract. Her heavy shoulders bunched up and her neck disappeared beneath her excess skin. Her bright blue eyes darted opposite to her friend as she lifted one chubby arm and another forkful of her salad into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Alice said unconvincingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Al, I\u2019ve known you for five years now, and I\u2019ve never seen you pick up a salad in any one of them.\u201d Melissa quickly amended, \u201cExcept for a) after you talk to your crazy bitch sister, and b) whenever you think you\u2019ve gained weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice shrunk further into her roundness, dropping her little plastic fork back onto the now abandoned plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 trying to eat a little healthier is all.\u201d Alice squeaked, such a soft voice coming from such a rotund form, \u201cI think I\u2019ve\u2014\u201c here Melissa groaned, \u201c\u2014put on a little too much weight recently\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh stop it, you look fine!\u201d Melissa said as she bit into a donut, \u201cAnyway, who cares. You\u2019re still skinnier than I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not <i>trying</i> to be skinnier than\u2014\u201c Alice huffed, exhaled in exasperation at her friend\u2019s lackadaisical attitude towards what (to her) was a very serious plight that she had dealt with all her life, \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 trying to eat healthy, okay? It\u2019d be a nice change of pace, is all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Melissa\u2019s ears perked up, the 350 pound beauty suddenly more attentive and alert than she had been all day at her desk. She leaned in over the table, forcing her great breasts to pool into melon-sized mounds of soft jiggling flesh on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why do you say that?\u201d she asked greedily, \u201cThere some new restaurant opened up in town that I don\u2019t know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice snorted, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s called Carrie\u2019s kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever heard of it.\u201d There was a beat as Melissa realized that Carrie\u2019s kitchen was not the name of some new, probably rustic-themed, restaurant but Alice was in fact referring to the kitchen of Carrie, one of the newer ladies that had been hired on recently, \u201cOh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Alice said almost sharply, \u201cShe invites me over all the time now and she makes all this food\u2026 and I always feel bad if I don\u2019t eat it all, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa, who\u2019d probably never felt bad over anything she\u2019d ever done in her entire life, looked more hungry than sympathetic. \u201cIs it any good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s the best food I\u2019ve ever had in my whole life!\u201d Alice gushed despite herself, \u201cYou remember the Christmas party last month?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, when Christina ate so much she barfed in the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, she made <i>all</i> of that. Except the pizzas. B-But you know what I mean!\u201d she said in a hushed voice, \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t stop going over there, soon enough you\u2019re going to have to widen the doorways just to get me in the front door!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa winced at the thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you going to do, Al?\u201d Melissa asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno\u2026 I mean, I can\u2019t just keep going over there and stuffing myself til I pop.\u201d She caught herself quickly, \u201cBut at the same time, I don\u2019t want to hurt Carrie\u2019s feelings\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So it was decided, without much reluctance on any party involved, that Melissa would join Alice and Carrie that Friday night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough in truth, neither Melissa\u2019s attendance nor invitation went without ulterior motives. Alice had invited Melissa because, hopefully, that meant that Carrie would focus more on her rather than Alice; leaving simply sated rather than grossly overfed without having to be the bad guy and refuse Carrie. Melissa, on the other hand, had agreed simply under the premise that Carrie\u2019s food was divine. She had brought food into the office all the time, and loved it. But an entire dinner table full of the stuff? The thought alone made Melissa\u2019s stomach growl and her mouth salivate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo on Friday night, after much mental physical and cosmetic preparation, the two overfed office gals carpooled a la Melissa\u2019s painfully cramped sedan, arriving at Carrie\u2019s place a good five minutes before they were expected. Dressed as casually as possible for two cuties so corpulent and round, they heaved themselves out of the car (much to the vehicle\u2019s relief) and tottered up the walkway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile both had opted for casual clothing, Alice had taken the invitation a little more seriously. She dressed in a light blouse made of stretchy material and shaded in light purple. The tight, stretchy fabric hugged every inch of her swollen chest and bobbing belly as both bounced about leisurely with her every belabored step. Wrapped around her lovehandles and the lowermost section of her multiply-tiered tummy were some elastic pants that Alice had lucked into while wandering around in the maternity section. They looked normal enough, though with her awkward belly-front gait one could have easily mistaken her for a heavily pregnant, heavily fed mother-to-be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had taken the meaning more literally, opting for some of her most casual clothing available. She wore jeans, quite possibly some of the largest ever made, wrapped around and over her legs and stomach. The extremity with which the denim withheld the onslaught of massive, jiggling blubber made her walk awkward and stiff-legged\u2014not unlike a flabby bride of Frankenstein. Above her sausage casing, Melissa draped her gut in a simple, large, and low-cut sweater that managed to make her look even larger. Black may have been slimming, but \u201cslimming\u201d wasn\u2019t a word equipped to tackle the 350+ pounds of Melissa\u2019s greedy gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice place.\u201d Melissa huffed as she wrestled with her legs\u2019 lack of circulation, \u201cLong walkway though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt gets easier.\u201d Alice lied, already quite out of breath, \u201cJust\u2026 let\u2019s get to the doorbell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more awkward, heavy steps later and the two were at the front door. Alice extended one flabby finger and pressed deeply into the softly-lit button, a polite chime ringing inside the abode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing!\u201d a voice cried from the other side of the door as heavy footsteps neared the porch, \u201cHold on a second ladies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung wide open to reveal Carrie, dressed in a long-sleeved frock and some sausage casing of her own. She was quite top-heavy, and somewhat shorter than Alice. So while she appeared somewhat rounder than either girl, Carrie certainly looked more youthful. With her long brown hair and her deep green eyes, Carrie was quite the looker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you made it!\u201d she said emphatically, \u201cCome on in, dinner will be ready in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we can just go\u2026\u201d Melissa paused as she wriggled her way through the door, \u201cStraight to the table then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can.\u201d Carrie said with a smile, \u201cI hope you\u2019re both hungry!\u201d</span></div></div>",

As both women waddled out of sight, Alice made a dash (rather a swift and rather awkward hobble) down the hall and to the left. The bathroom was just as neat and meticulously clean as she had remembered, and she had been here so many times that she hardly had any trouble making use of it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her business was finished, Alice heaved herself from the toilet and over to the sink to wash her hands. While doing so, a picture caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird\u2026\u201d Alice said aloud as she took the frame off of the counter and into her still wet hands, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was four little girls, each in varying shapes and sizes. The oldest couldn\u2019t have been but about seven while the oldest was somewhere around thirteen. The oldest one was definitely a little chubby, and shorter than the string-bean next to her. In fact, the only reason Alice suspected her as the oldest was how developed she was at even such a young age. Could it be\u2026 no\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are Carrie\u2019s baby pictures!\u201d Alice cooed aloud, \u201cWell at least one of them anyway. I never knew she had a sister. Or three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stared at it for a moment more before putting the frame back where she found it, drying off her hands, and leaving. As she waddled down the hallway, taking up much more space than was necessary by anyone who wasn\u2019t an overfed porker, Alice couldn\u2019t help but glance at the few photos that dotted the walls here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until Alice entered the living room where the pattern struck her, causing her to totter back into the hall and check for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, there was definitely a pattern\u2014</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yes, Alice immediately dug into her plate. It was hard not to. She had been eating herself round for the past few years of her life already, so it had become something of a habit to eat food when she saw it. And with how good Carrie\u2019s food was, Alice didn\u2019t see how she could possibly resist it. Plus it would have been rude not to indulge in dinner tonight. She\u2019d made such a fuss about bringing Melissa over and Carrie had cooked so much\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, Alice found herself resting her fork down lightly on the napkin by her plate. Beside her, Melissa ate rapidly and with great fervor. Every now and then their doughy arms would collide with her friends\u2019 wild movements and swinging motions. It was no mystery who was getting the most out of the meal, and Carrie seemed to pick up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice?\u201d the sweet woman had asked in an almost matronly manner, \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d she sounded, looking past Melissa at Carrie who seemed genuinely worried, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she picked up her fork again, which satisfied her hostess, though she could only nibble at her plate. Whenever Carrie made eye contact with Alice (or looked like she was about to), the swollen sweetie would pick up her fork and take a big hearty bite before swallowing. Had anyone paid much attention that night, they would have noticed that the portioning was quite off for three people\u2014with Alice having eaten only one plate, Carrie having seconds, and Melissa leaving not a scrap for anyone to take home (as Carrie was wont to suggest)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women sat at the dinner table, Carrie at the head while Alice and Melissa sat together facing the sliding glass door. Carrie made coffee for everyone, but only she and Alice would have a cup. Melissa was too full\u2014fuller than she\u2019d ever been in her entire life. Her belly, already big and round, had swollen to a taut swell that cut angrily into the obstructing table. She had slid back noisily earlier in the meal to allow herself some comfort room, and was now contentedly playing with her fully-exposed tummy; kneading the soft fat that hung so lazily from her waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Melissa moaned thickly to herself as she digested, a big smile spread between her chubby cheeks, \u201cAlice was right, Care. You make some mean dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie smiled from behind her coffee cup, swallowing her drink before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thank you Melissa, I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it.\u201d She said before turning, \u201cAlice, did you enjoy it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blobby blonde looked up from her half-drunk mug as if from a daze, smiling unconvincingly in Carrie\u2019s way with a little nod that flexed her second chin. Alice hadn\u2019t actually eaten much at all, having barely nibbled at her plate before scraping it off onto Melissa\u2019s. She\u2019d been doing it all night, Carrie dishing out more and more only for Alice to slide it onto Melissa\u2019s plate when no one was looking. Inwardly, she apologized to her friend as she sat there, stupidly rubbing her stomach and burping quietly to relieve the great pressure that Alice had helped build up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was just something about tonight that was different. Alice had already been wary about losing weight, but seeing those pictures on the wall\u2026 Of Carrie\u2019s sisters, how much they had changed\u2014how much they had <i>grown</i> over the years\u2014wasn\u2019t exactly reassuring. One night a week might not seem like much now, but what if Carrie started asking them over more and more? How could Alice refuse such a sweet woman who had just moved to town without hurting her feelings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice, sweetie, are you alright?\u201d Carrie asked her friend from across the table, reaching across the unphased Melissa to put a hand on her flabby forearm, \u201cYou\u2019ve been awfully quiet tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Alice repeated with some trepidation, \u201cI was actually just thinking that\u2026 I, um, don\u2019t really know all that much about you.\u201d But she quickly tacked on, \u201cNeither of us do, for that matter. You um, invited us over and we barely what you do on any night other than Friday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie laughed generously, sending her shoulders and chest bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, I suppose now\u2019s a good a time as any for us to get to know one another.\u201d She agreed with an unsuspecting smile, \u201cI\u2019m from Arizona, I\u2019ve got three sisters, and I\u2019m really not used to living in New England.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell us about them!\u201d Alice pounced over-enthusiastically before shying back down, \u201cY-Your sisters. Tell us about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Carrie said with a slightly surprised expression, \u201cUm\u2026 Well there\u2019s Gloria, she\u2019s an accountant in Phoenix. And then there\u2019s Anna who also lives in Phoenix. And my youngest sister Courtney lives in Tempe while she\u2019s studying at ASU.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded, completely uninterested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a, uh, photo of them or something?\u201d Alice asked rather awkwardly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 I guess. They\u2019re all over the house, but I think I can pull something up on my phone?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was obviously a little put off by Alice\u2019s sudden interest in her sisters. She had been having Alice over quite regularly for the past few weeks or so. The two had been bonding for some time over their mutual level-headedness, and for such unexpected behavior to pop up out of nowhere understandably raised an eyebrow or two. But never the less, Carrie expertly whipped out her phone and skimmed through for pictures pertaining to Alice\u2019s sudden interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s Gloria.\u201d She said, outstretching one of her arms to show Alice a woman relative to her own size. Perhaps a bit bigger. She was dressed in clothing not unlike her own, and Alice recognized the meek features and sensible style. Surely she and Gloria might have a lot in common if they\u2019d ever met. But goodness if her belly wasn\u2019t big\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Anna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next of the sisters was certainly much bigger than the last. Easily outweighing her by a good\u2026 fifty pounds? If Alice could see them together she would be able to say for sure. She was much rounder, but also shorter than Gloria had been. With a big belly that hung well down to her knees. She had large doughy shoulders \u2013woof, that tank top was <i>not</i> a good idea\u2014and a certain unmistakable lack of discrepancy between her chins and neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and here\u2019s Courtney. It\u2019s a little older, but here\u2019s her last month at her birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s jaw dropped at the sight of Carrie\u2019s \u201clittlest\u201d sister. She sat with two skinny girls on either side of her on the couch, taking up a great deal of space with her overall expanse and enormity. She wore a cone hat with \u201821\u2019 in big red letters, while her roomies wore similar ones. They were all clutching tequila in their hands, and Courtney had rested the cake on her gigantic stomach. It was an ocean of lightly tanned blubber. It spread her legs apart and hung out of her hoodie, pouring (from what Alice could tell) right off the couch by a good inch or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2026 they look\u2026\u201d Alice felt faint\u2014is <i>this</i> what Carrie\u2019s cooking did to people?!\u2014\u201cNice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I love \u2018em.\u201d Carrie said fondly as she looked at the pictures herself, \u201cHonestly, I wasn\u2019t too happy about moving all the way up here. But I suppose they\u2019re gonna have to learn to live without their big sis. I mean, I can\u2019t pack their lunches for them every day like I used to when we were kids anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie laughed, and Alice laughed too, but hers was tinny. Nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow!\u201d Carrie suddenly said, \u201cLook at the time, it\u2019s really late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice panicked and checked her phone. Sure enough, it read 11:43! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m putting in some hours tomorrow and I\u2019ve gotta be ready by six in the morning.\u201d Carrie apologized, \u201cBut it was nice having you two over, thank you so much for coming. We should really do this again sometime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes\u2026\u201d Alice said with a smile as she nudged Melissa (who was still kneading her stomach) out of her chair, \u201cWe really should (not. Ever. Again. Or I\u2019m gonna wind up like your sisters!)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, actually I was thinking of having you two over again on Tuesday?\u201d Carrie ventured, \u201cI know, you must be getting so sick of me, but I was thinking maybe we could\u2026 do this a little more? It\u2019s good for me to hang out with friends. We\u2019re friends, right Alice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right.\u201d She answered nervously, \u201cFriends.\u201d (big fat friends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie smiled jovially, \u201cThat\u2019s so great. Listen, I\u2019ll talk to you Monday about Tuesday. Thank you again for coming over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone said their goodbyes, Alice walked Melissa to her car before plopping down behind the wheel. She gulped, her eyes wide in anticipation and anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething <i>had</i> to be done about this Carrie situation. If the other sisters were any indication of how much Carrie liked to cook, and how <i>much</i> Carrie liked to cook, Alice would have to redouble her efforts in making sure that she was under control. The thought that anyone so young as Courtney could be so large would normally make Alice think twice, but considering that she\u2019d lived with Carrie all her life, Alice could completely understand. If that were <i>her</i> and Carrie had been pumping her full of food for years Alice would be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe shuddered, dismissing the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething had to be done before Alice needed a forklift to get in and out of her apartment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On Monday, Alice was dreading coming to work. She was so conflicted about how to handle her situation with Carrie. On one hand she had really bonded with Carrie but on the other hand she really didn\u2019t want to end up a total blimp like Carrie\u2019s sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the office Alice and Melissa sat in their two desk cubicle. <br>\r\n\u201cCarrie\u2019s dinner on Friday was aaaaammaaazzzing, right?\u201d Melissa said to her slightly less overfed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh yeah I guess.\u201d Alice said with a lack of enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going again tomorrow right?\u201d Alice tried to interject but Melissa talked over her. \u201cOh my god I can\u2019t wait, that food is to die for.\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about it made Melissa clutch her massive gut. She didn\u2019t have the same concerns as Alice did about these feasts at Carrie\u2019s. Melissa was a gorging machine. She put no value in the consequences of her tremendous eating habits, for all she cared about was stuffing herself with delicious fattening food. Needless to say she was excited for her next trip to Carrie\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see those pictures of her sisters? Wasn\u2019t it weird that\u2026\u201d Alice stopped as Carrie walked over to their cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey gals, I brought muffins!\u201d Carrie said holding a large plastic container. She always brought great food from home for her coworkers who were never ones to turn down food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooo, gimme.\u201d  Melissa practically ripped the muffins out of Carries hands before she could even hand them over. Melissa tore the top of the plastic container and took one of the dozen or so chocolate chip cinnamon doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you gonna come over aga,\u201d Melissa interrupted Carrie\u2019s sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice you HAVE to try these they\u2019re amaaaazing.\u201d Melissa said, handing her a large muffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 yeah sure.\u201d Alice took the muffin, figuring it would be rude to not try one of Carries muffins in front of her. She took a bite, which was quickly followed by another and then suddenly it was gone. Alice couldn\u2019t believe how good it was. See, Carrie noticed Alice\u2019s lack of enthusiasm towards her food on Friday. Carrie, wanting to impress her newfound friend decided to kick up the quality of her food. She really wanted Alice to like her, and one way Carrie made sure of this was to make sure she liked her food. She had dug deep into her cookbooks and pulled out her very best recipe\u2019s. She made sure Alice wouldn\u2019t second guess coming over to Carrie\u2019s house routinely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as Alice swallowed the last of her muffin Carrie asked:<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you guys gonna come over for dinner tomorrow?\u201d Alice thought about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dead set on saying no about 5 minutes earlier, but damn if that muffin wasn\u2019t the greatest thing she\u2019d eaten. Alice\u2019s will power wasn\u2019t particularly spectacular as exampled by her big obese body that had only steadily increased for years now. Alice really liked Carrie and her food\u2026 how could she say no? She\u2019ll just go this one time she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I look forward to it. And wow are these good muffins. Are you coming to Mel?\u201d Alice said. Melissa had almost finished all the muffins. She looked up at Alice with about 2 and a half muffins crammed in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWah?... ah yah, *gulp* definitely.\u201d Melissa said as crumbs showered onto her flabby cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, see you later.\u201d Carrie said as she waddled away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice smiled warmly across the table as Carrie regaled both of her hefty houseguests with stories. She\u2019d gone from what had happened earlier this week, to how she felt about Christina, somehow circling back around to a story from her childhood, and was now working on a panging yarn that was as dreadfully long as it was irrelevant. Though Alice was anything if not polite. She wouldn\u2019t say a word to draw attention to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was always the hardest part\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I was on the phone with Corporate and Jess says that I\u2014\u201c as Carrie gabbed, Alice quietly scraped a majority of her chicken onto Melissa\u2019s otherwise full plate, the brunette behemoth stirring slightly as she noticed a forgotten piece to her meal \u201d\u2014So I have to call up Bradford <i>again</i> just to make sure he wants 60 orders instead of 50!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s smile expanded in an attempt to make believe she had been following Carrie the whole time, instead of slowly sliding the majority of her meal onto Melissa\u2019s plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, neither of them had been any the wiser. Carrie was far too caught up in socializing with her new friends to notice that one of them was pawning off her third helping on the other. And Melissa, said other friend, was far too greedy to think too hard about it. She\u2019d seen Alice passing her portions once or twice and remained silent (honestly thankful for the gift) but usually Alice was more deft\u2014despite what her great size might have let on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice smiled generously, guilt and appetite waging war on her conscience for giving away such a loving and tasty meal, Carrie\u2019s story broke in laughter. Then she noticed Alice\u2019s empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, Alice!\u201d Carrie said shocked, \u201cThat\u2019s your third plate! Are you still hungry? I could get you some more of anything you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh no, that\u2019s\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little of everything? Come on, we\u2019re almost done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal had begun, several hours ago, with a fully stocked pan of chicken breasts. They\u2019d been stuffed with goat cheese (which was a lot more appetizing than it sounds!) wrapped in bacon, slathered in American Swiss, peppered and spiced accordingly. There had been twenty breasts some hours ago. For sides, Carrie had prepared home-made (and very very <i>very</i> buttery) mashed potatoes and filled two serving bowls with tonight\u2019s portions. Then she\u2019d made some texas toast (again, very buttery) and garlic bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie herself had eaten until seconds. Alice had \u201ceaten\u201d thirds, but between what she\u2019d slipped to Melissa she had actually only eaten a single serving herself. Each serving had two breasts. So that\u2019s four for Carrie, One for Alice\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 moar\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd almost fifteen for Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her incredible disregard for her surroundings, safety, or girlish figure, Melissa had eaten twelve bird breasts, as well as all the trimmings that came alongside it. Claiming almost an entire loaf of texas toast and innumerable garlic breadsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut was taut and round with her decadence, shiny with sweat as she struggled to digest her accidental overindulgence. Surely she couldn\u2019t have gotten this full already? Though, in all honesty, most of it had been a blur\u2026 a blur of cheese and pleasure\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked unpleasantly at her friend, having hoped to maybe pour this down Melissa\u2019s hatch as well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, I suppose if you\u2019re full Melissa we don\u2019t have to have dessert.\u201d Carrie said with a smile as she gathered up the dishes, \u201cI can send you and Alice home with a slice of pie if you want. Or maybe one of you would like to take it home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, we couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Alice said with a grimace, fathoming that this was one of the many ways Carrie must have inflated her sisters with food, \u201cWe\u2019re both, um, very <i>very</i> full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Carrie said sadly, \u201cWell it\u2019s cherry. I\u2019m allergic to cherries. I made it for you two, but\u2026 well if you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll keep til next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa will take it home!\u201d Alice said confidently, patting her friend on the flabby shoulder, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Mel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2014WhUUUURP?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good!\u201d Carrie said happily, instantly renewed and jovial, \u201cI\u2019m glad you both like my cooking so much! It seems like so long since I\u2019ve had to cook for anybody. It\u2019s nice having you two around. Hey, what do you say we do this again on Friday? I mean, if you\u2019re not doing anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019d be wonderful!\u201d Alice said happily, enjoying the perks of friendship with Carrie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK\u2026Kay\u2026\u201d Melissa moaned, suffering from the drawbacks of the very same \u201cfriendship\u201d\u2026</span></div></div>",

Alice really enjoyed her friendship with Carrie but really wanted to avoid eating her food. Melissa, who is great friends with Alice, is only okay friends with Carrie but she was in love with her food. This lead to a recurring event of Alice and Melissa coming to Carrie\u2019s for dinner, Alice talking with Carrie all night while Melissa would eat Carrie\u2019s food for both her and Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor months this occurred 2-3 times a week. Alice and Carrie were becoming better and better friends while Melissa could pig out like never before. After a few months, Alice had actually gotten her weight down to 300 pounds. Melissa on the other hand, had become even more of a blimp. Her weight soared into the 400\u2019s as she kept glutting her flabby bloated body. She became a helpless eating machine. For her whole life Melissa had never been able to truly satisfy her raging appetite, but at Carrie\u2019s she reached new heights of piggish indulgence. Melissa still loved the unhealthy excess that was her daily consumption of food but her body was getting so large so fast she could barely function at work. Every other night she would be at Carrie\u2019s barely able to speak as her tremendous belly was filled to the brim. Alice couldn\u2019t help but worry about her friend.

As such, Melissa's mammoth stomach continued to be packed to the very brim and mountains of blubber continued to steadily pile themselves on her huge bloated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURRRRPPPPPP...oh gosh...HICC...what a MEAL...HIC...everything was so delicious...HIC...and plentiful...HIC...and RICH...URRRP...I can't believe how amazing...HICUURP Carrie's cooking continues to be...HICCC...I just can't get enough!\" After a particularly explosive night of gorging herself at Carrie's, Melissa was woozily reclining in Alice's car on the way home, having stuffed her stomach to the point of stupidity and was unable to even sit straight. Her hugely overglutted belly surged into the sky like a mountain and was beginning to pour over her knees, in a truly gigantic single spare tire. Melissa had a look of ultimate satisfaction as she sleepily massaged the titanic rich load of food that sat heavily inside of her. \"HICCC...I could easily...HICC...do this every day...UURRRP\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat off-hand comment got Alice thinking, however. Her flourishing relationship with Carrie now made her eager for their dinners together, and she figured that if Carrie didn't mind, (which Alice knew she wouldn't) they could make dinners an every-day occurrence. That way, everyone could be happy, Melissa could stuff herself into oblivion every night and Carrie and Alice could have a good time together. \"Say, Mel, that's a good idea. You want to go eat at Carrie's every day? It's on our way home from the office anyway.\" Melissa, despite her engorged state, immediately perked up at the suggestion of gluttony like this every day. Struggling to lift her head to see over her giant gut, she squinted curiously at Alice and licked her chops greedily, giving her bubbling belly a few happy pats \"HIIIICCCC, ya mean that? Every day like this...HIC...mmmm so much foood...HIC HIC..Let's DO it!!\" Melissa and Alice grinned at each other, and their unwitting partnership was taken to the next level.</span></div></div>",

Alice passed another box of Carrie's baked goods over to Melissa, who belched a thank you and grinned greedily, her shirt now permanently inadequate at covering her massively gigantic gut. At that moment Carrie puffed in bearing two heavy bags of her baked goods, to Melissa's obvious delight. \"Hey y'all! What's good?\" Carrie sang out as she strategically placed the baked goods easily within Melissa's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice grinned back and finally brought up the subject she and Melissa had discussed last night in the car: \"Hey Carrie, Mel and I have really loved coming over for dinners every other day. You're so kind.\"<br>\r\nCarrie beamed \"Why that's so sweet of you to say! I've so enjoyed making new friends here and finding people who enjoy my home cooking, especially you, Mel.\" Melissa patted her gut greedily and said: \"UURP! you bet! everything's so incredible, I can't stop...omphgulp...eating and eating and EATING...UURP. I could do it *munch* every day!\" Moving from box to box, Melissa gorged herself frenetically, as if Carrie would suddenly take her delicious baked goods away from her gaping maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie beamed even more brightly and, true to her giving nature and Alice's expectations, immediately answered: \"But of course! Why didn't I think of that? I'd love to cook for you two as often as you can come over. Being so far from family makes a gal hungry for some good friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa squealed with delight but Alice wanted to make sure it wasn't an undue burden for her friend: \"Only if you're ok with it, Carrie, I know cooking so much is a real time-comittment and I don't want to be a pest...\" Carrie cut in with a genial wave of the hand: \"Quiet, Alice, I won't have any of that talk. It's not like I got much more exciting to do after work. I'd absolutely love to cook for you guys! Come by around 7:30 tonight, kay?\" Carrie then shuffled out of the room, leaving Alice looking forward to another evening with her friend and Melissa to gorging herself blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...uh, Mel, you sure you're ok?\" Alice cast a worried glance at her co-worker as their long dinner-get together with Carrie stretched into its third hour. Alice, as usual, had continued to pass off many of her plates to Melissa, who gorged and glutted herself with zealous ferocity, but was now slumped in her extra-wide chair, her hands desperately clutching her supergorged gut but her dazed and greedy eyes roving the table for more: \"*burbleHICC* yeshh, don't worry 'bout me...HICC...mah schtomach's handled worse...HICCCC...ohh mannn...whats for dessert...HICUUURRP?\" Even Alice was shocked at Mel's insane gluttony, but the girl was beyond all reason. Her calling in life was to eat, and eat until her stomach could not handle one more crumb of food. In a similar way, Desert came and went in a similar fashion, with Mel managing to shovel serving after serving of cheesecake into her great bubbling gut. Finally leaving and collapsing into Alice's car with a slosh and a gurgle, Mel moaned with discomfort and ecstasy: \"SO GOOD...*burble*...HICCCC...I can't believe...HICC...Imma be doing thishh...*sloshHICCC* EVERY DAY...UUURRRRP...thishh is my dream come truee...HICC.\" Mel settled back comfortably and plopped her hands limply atop her giant belly and drifted off into a food-induced torpor. Alice just shook her head in disbelief at Melissa's massive appetite and in mild concern about how much bigger she'd get if this kept up for any amount of time. </span></div></div>",

It wasn't all that much but it was something for the obese former cheerleader. Passing most of her lunch and snack meals off to Melissa was really working. Her body was still so soft and flabby, but at least her clothes fit better and she felt better than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'm...HIC...so hungry.\" Melissa whined while they were on their way to Carries, beads of sweat already forming on her fleshy neck: \"It's been what? 30 minutes since we left the office...HIC *pant*?\" In the intervening two weeks since their daily meal with Carrie had begun, Melissa had been enjoying herself immensely, especially since she also went to lunch with Alice most every day, where Alice had quietly feigned fullness and allowed Melissa to gorge herself on the rest of her meal. Now, Melissa was not a completely dull person and had quickly caught on to Alice's supposedly stealthy passing off of meals, but Melissa being Melissa, she welcomed the charity and an implicit, unspoken symbiotic relationship had grown up between the two fat women, one struggling to become less so, the other hurtling headlong into gross preponderance. Indeed, with such a constant stream of food flooding into Melissa's stomach, the past two weeks saw the greedy glutton blow up even faster and become even more eager for eating, to the point where her stomach was nearly constantly packed to the very brim with rich eatings. Her belly was even more gigantically packed with soft blubber, and Melissa seemed in no way ready to stop, indeed her appetite seems to have hit the accelerator. Though there already was an obscene amount of food crammed into Melissa today, she was as eager as ever to begin yet another large gorging session.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Melissa\u2019s wide ass was rapidly too large for the dining room chairs, but always thoughtful Carrie had provided a wide bench, and here Melissa had parked herself for hours, practically shovelling mountains of food into her belly, which now gelatinously poured across her lap and over her knees and was stupendously swollen with food. A great bubbling belch erupted from deep within the vat of her superstuffed stomach: \u201c*burbleUUUURRP* more pleaseee...HICHILP!!\u201d Mel expectantly patted her mammoth gut as Carrie leapt up to bring Mel another huge bowl of alfredo pasta. Thanking Carrie with a rich hiccup, Melissa continued to shovel food down her throat, oblivious to the creaking of her bench, deaf as she was to all but the call of her bottomless belly. Suddenly, the wooden bench abruptly broke, and all 468 pounds of Melissa collapsed to the floor with a *GLOOSH* as Mel gave a frightened squeak, but managing to not spill the rest of her alfredo pasta, which she rapidly gulped down at an frenetic pace. Belching thunderously, Mel leaned her superswollen body against the wall and clutched at her giant gut with glee. Food-drunk beyond reckoning, Mel just wanted to keep cramming herself with as much food as her gut could possibly hold. Smiling cutely, she gave her huge belly a few healthy slaps: \u201cbubbleHICCCHILP!! oopsies...shorry Carrie..HIC...say...HIC...ya got any more pasta...sloshUUURRPPP.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie\u2019s daily dinners with Melissa and Alice were now commonplace, and though it was quite a great deal of work for Carrie to keep making the huge dinners, she thought nothing of providing as much hospitality as possible for her two friends. After another month, Alice and Carrie became as close as friends could get, often talking for hours upon hours during their dinners together. Further, Alice lost another batch of weight due to giving her dinner portions, as well as surreptitiously \u2018sharing\u2019 most of her other meals with the hapless Melissa, who nonetheless adored all the charity and spent her time glutting her gut to its maximum possible capacity every chance she could, and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Melissa, the four weeks of gigantically rich feedings every day, plus eating most of Alice\u2019s food, caused her weight to skyrocket even further, and the end of the month found Melissa looking absolutely HUGE, sitting comfortably just past the 500 pound threshold. Her belly, as usual, bore the massive majority of her fat, and it was becoming so gigantic that Melissa\u2019s center of gravity was distinctly centered two feet into her gut, making walking any distance a great struggle. However, the administration at Gordge had seen worse and heavier cases, and so looked benignly on Melissa\u2019s outrageous eating. And what an eater she was! Greed and gluttony became all consuming for the young office-worker, and there wasn\u2019t a minute that she wasn\u2019t eating, thinking about eating, or dreaming about eating. The more she ate, and the bigger she got, it seemed the more she wanted to keep eating. Though Alice grew more than a little worried at her co-worker\u2019s accelerating gluttony and the astronomical size of her blubbery belly, Carrie, on the other hand was overjoyed that someone so enjoyed her cooking, and took special care to make sure Melissa was continually surrounded by food, whether at her house or at the office. She even took to inviting Melissa over for lunches on the weekends, and on those days the greedy glutton stuffed away two massive feasts into her rapidly growing gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Melissa was gasping for breath after a marathon lunch with Carrie. it was late afternoon, nearing dinnertime, and Alice was due to arrive soon. Today she had absolutely outdone even her vast expectations. Laying slumped on the dining room floor, Melissa grasped what little of her mammothly glutted burbling gut that she could, sweating like a sinner in Church, but nevertheless had a stupidly satisfied and self-indulgent smile plastered on her face: \"UggghhhHIILLP...now THATSHH a meal...burbleHILP!! So much RICH...HICCC fooddd...It\u2019shh all soo gooodddd...HICCC*sloshURRP* *gasp* I am SO full, Carrie...HIICC...I might just burst...uugghhh my stummHIICCC...HIILLP.\" Mel's belly groaned and burbled with indigestion and overload that came from her crazed gluttony. Gasping for air, Mel whined and pathetically tried to rub the tension from her massive gut, but crazily giggled with unrequited greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie shook her head knowingly: \u201cOh Mel, I hope you haven\u2019t spoiled your appetite for dinner! I worked so hard cooking up a storm while you were eating lunch, I\u2019d hate it to go to waste. You know how Alice and I eat so little! Look, you can even start early if you like and take it slow. I\u2019m already setting the table!\u201d Carrie gestured to the kitchen counters, which groaned with yet another vast feast. \u201cLook! I got Pasta Alfredo, Buttermilk Chicken, Shrimp scampi, and so much more! Oh yes, also...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa\u2019s eyes had been glazed over when Carrie had begun to speak. She was gasping at the<br>\r\n gargantuan weight of her gluttony and woozily hiccupping and was giving anyone who could see a conceited, self-indulgent smile, one hand resting limply on her explosive belly,which had incredibly bloated far beyond its normal gigantic size. Her belly was one incredibly giant mountain of vastly overswollen, overgorged, overfilled, and overglutted blubbery fat, permanently way too vast for Mel to handle. Despite this, and despite the oh-so-rich squelching of her stupendous stomach begging her to stop, Mel had snapped out of her catatonic state and had perked up as soon as Carrie began speaking about eating and by the end, interrupted her, wiping drool from my lips, her hands drumming the top of her mammoth gut eagerly: \u201cHICCHILP\u2026alright\u2026that\u2019shhh enough\u2026HICHILP*gloosh* don\u2019t tell me any moorreee...BELCHHILP...I\u2019ll have it all...HIILLP... gimme everything...bubbleUURRP.\u201d She grinned at Carrie wickedly, her eyes on fire with determination and greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie chuckled, but her eyes flashed a smidge of worry \u201cI know how much you love my cooking Mel dear, but don\u2019t feel obliged just because I cooked it. I know you ate a big lunch, and I\u2019d hate to impose any more on your full tummy.\u201d Understatement of the century though it might have been, Carrie\u2019s kind soul wanted to make sure that Mel had a way out if she so chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry your head...HILLLP...\u2019bout my stummHIC...HICHILP!\u201d Mel shot back, slapping the sides of her superswollen gut incredibly, stupidly impatient to begin eating again. \u201cHILP!! I have room for...HIC*burble*...everything you\u2019ve made...HILP...and ANYTHING...HIC...you wanna give me...*bubble*HILP!! Alice or no Alice...URRP.\u201d Mel gripped the swollen flanks of her gargantuan belly and wiggled her gut back and forth, her hands singing deep into her fat despite her gorged state. An explosion of rich bubbling erupted from the mountain of food from Melissa\u2019s previous meal, the disturbance jostling up a few more belches and hiccups as well from the  depths of the overglutted vat of her gut: \u201c*burble*URRP...See Carrie..*slosh*HILP...plenty...HIC...of...HICCC*bubble* oh goodness...UUURRP*squelch*...spare room...HICHILP*gloosh*\u201d Melissa struggled mightily and rolled herself into a roughly sitting position on the floor,spreading her fat legs as far apart as she could to allow her giant belly to spill with impunity on the floor, mentally preparing it and herself for this new onslaught of rich eatings. \u201cHILP!! Iet\u2019s get to it, Carrie..HIC!\u201d Mel grinned and clapped her fat hands like an excited child, the clapping causing ripples to arc their way through her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie matched Melissa\u2019s grin with an equally wide one of her own and speedily set down a large platter of buttermilk chicken in front of the stupendously fat young lady, who began tearing into it as if she hadn\u2019t eaten in 3 days. And so dinner began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Melissa ate...and ate...and ate. Carrie had neglected to mention that Alice had texted her earlier, informing her that she was on a clothes-shopping day to celebrate the loss of even more of her excess weight, and that she would be eating dinner at home. Overjoyed at her friend\u2019s joy, good hearted Carrie however also didn\u2019t have it in her to cancel dinner for Melissa, for she saw how much obvious delight she took in cramming all of Carrie\u2019s delicious goodies into her mammoth stomach. And oh BOY did Melissa cram. Choking down massive bite after massive bite, Mel was so eager to stuff as much as she could into her bottomless pit, that half the time she didn\u2019t bother chewing before forcing in another giant mouthful. At least six times she nearly choked in her effort to cram as much as humanly possible into her mouth for increasingly heavy, rich swallows. Obviously, Mel was in euphoric paradise. Surrounded by such gigantic amounts of rich gluttings all to her own and all the time in the world, she utterly lost herself in the joys of feasting, despite her stupendously swollen state resulting from the mountain of food that already sat heavily in her giant stomach. Nevertheless, bowls, plates, and trays and platters piled high with supremely rich and well-made food were in quick succession funnelled into Mel\u2019s cavernous gut and slid across the floor to Carrie without any second thought. Melissa\u2019s belly rapidly began bulging farther and farther out, pushing the gorging, gluttonous girl ever back slumping against the wall, and pushing her tank top permanently above her vast gut, exposing her entire massive quaking vat of churning blubber for all to see, her superswollen stomach sloshing and bubbling more and more clearly with futile efforts at proper digestion. Melissa was sweating profusely with the effort of glutting, her gut violently churned and ached as she packed more and more inside, but she did NOT stop until the end, until it was all done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not exactly ALL done. Carrie had some more desserts and spare dishes prepared, but Melissa had well and truly reached her stupendous limit. Profoundly food-drunk and woozy out of her mind, it was obvious she was in no state to do anything under her own power. Hastily calling on Alice, who lived closeby, Carrie slowly coaxed the loopy Melissa, who probably appeared more food than girl by this point into the back seat of her SUV. The car itself groaned to support the Quarter-ton girl with God knows how much food crammed into her monumental gut as Mel collapsed heavily with a thunderous *GLOP*. What puzzled Carrie is that Mel just couldn\u2019t stop giggling through uncontrollable belches and hiccups, and gripping any fold or handful of her belly that she could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs short as it was, it appeared that the trip had sufficiently revived Melissa to the point of being able to stagger to Alice\u2019s door on her own. Belching a goodbye to the exhausted Carrie, Melissa stumbled into Alice\u2019s condo, just barely able to balance the vast counterbalancing weight of her mammoth gut. She peeked into Alice\u2019s living room, where the now-250 pound former-cheerleader was relaxing with a light TV dinner and some flattering clothes that clung to her mighty, increasingly shapely bosom. Hearing Mel\u2019s decadent hiccup, Alice looked up confusedly at Melissa\u2019s quadruple-chinned face, which was creased into an dopey smile, yet her eyes screwed near shut from the effort of walking. Melissa giggled at her confussion: \u201cHIIIILLPPP...hehehe Hayy Aliceee...HIIILLP...I\u2019m BAAAACKKKK *burble*\"</span></div></div>",

It also revealed to Alice for the first time the true enormity of her gluttony, Mel\u2019s gigantically superswollen gut flowing out over her trunk-like legs, even while almost reclining, and her mountains of thick blubber appearing like they can barely contain the mammoth feasts Mel had shoved into herself. Snickering with self-indulgent pride, Mel massively hiccupped and gently patted her gargantuan belly in a pathetic attempt to calm its intense bubbling indigestion, still giggling at Alice\u2019s now dumbfoundedly shocked expression. Little gloops and glorps resounding out into the living room with each heavy pat, even through the ridiculously thick layers of her fat. Melissa was reclining heavily against the couch, desperately panting as she tried to recover from her catastrophic ordeal. Despite everything, Melissa was very much enjoying feeling her massive mountains of glutty, greasy sludge churn and boil within the overflowing vat of her squelching stomach and moaning in appreciation of her incredible meals. The crushing-leaden weight of fullness lulled her into sleepy, drunk, conceited contentment. In gorging, Melissa had found her true calling, and she reveled in the endless opportunities of vast overeating offered to her. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAlice was wordlessly stupefied at the state of sickening overindulgence her colleague had allowed herself to reach, and the dangerous level of overfullness she had wrought upon her poor body. From her vantage, Melissa\u2019s titanic midriff looked one bite from exploding, and Alice could almost see the gigantic feasts roil and churn, even through the significant feet of solid blubbery lard. She could eventually stammer out \u201cHoly mother of GOD Mel! Look at the SIZE of you! You\u2019re absolutely, supidly enormous! what have you done to yourself? How could you even do that to yourself? How has your stomach not exploded? You should be ashamed of yourself. It would serve you right if your poor stomach struck you with attack after attack after attack of massive, acute indigestion! Your belly is actually the fattest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d She stood up and walked over to stare down at her, hands on her wide, fleshy hips, a look of scolding concern on her face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDespite her dazed catatonia, Melissa temporarily woke up, hiccupped richly and snorted derisively at her friend\u2019s remarks, \u201c \u201cHYIILP!! Don\u2019ttttt worryyy...HIC *squelchGLORP* HICELLP!...about me...HIC.\u201d She then carelessly and heavily slapped as much of her stupidly swollen sack of a gut that she could reach rapidly for emphasis on every syllable:...myyy. Stum-mickkk *blorp* c\u2019n. Handleeee *burbleGLOP* ANYTHINGGGG...HICC...HICC...HICELLLPPP!!!\u201d Melissa looked down at her gargantuan gut with unabashed satisfaction. Its vast, bloated surface seemed to just barely contain her mountains of thick, wobbling blubber and the huge pile of food she had just ingested, and even Mel had to admit to herself that even she was slightly stupefied at how huge and fat and swollen she actually was. Still, her greed for gorging and eating rich, fatty foods was as ravening as ever, and  after a short hesitation she continued drunkenly rambling to her friend. \u201cHYICEELP...I\u2019ll be okkk...HILP!!

HICHILP!\u201d Melissa conceitedly licked her lips, blinked slowly and struggled to see above her massive mounding belly, her body bubbling so loudly at the disturbance and with the effort, she put her hands protectively on it, as if that would do any help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccupping again, Melissa paused concernedly as her stomach didn\u2019t cease it\u2019s churning, and began to rumble and groan and glop around louder and louder in what was definite massively acute indigestion. But to Mel, she just giggled stupidly and rolled her mountains of engorged blubber around, oblivious to Alice\u2019s concern. Her belly became one massive shaking, slopping, sloshing sack of gargantuan proportions that churned and bubbled with the immense burden of accommodating Melissa\u2019s incredible eating. Finally, with a resounding SQUELCH, Mel\u2019s big belly expanded even further and resumed its normal level of uncontrollable churning. Her hands helplessly slid off her mammoth gut as she struggled to remaind conscious, mumbling, \u201cUnfff whutta glutttt....\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c...You Can\u2019t be SERIOUS,\u201d Alice cut in. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand how you can even THINK about eating more. Don\u2019t you think you should give your overgorged stomach a rest? Look at yourself! Can\u2019t you feel how much bigger your belly is! Listen to yourself! You can barely speak without clearly showing how much you\u2019ve overfed it. You\u2019re going to get seriously sick!\u201d She had said this, but her obliging nature forced her to hand Melissa a box of hugely thick fudge from Carre.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMelissa was buried in it. \u201cHIILLP!!

She had never seen Melissa so happy as when she was stuffed out of her mind. If this is what made her happy, then Alice couldn\u2019t argue, and indeed, a thought struck her that she might be able to help. \u201cYou know, Mel, I overheard the catering staff at Gordge complain about the amount of leftovers and leavings. They\u2019re even thinking of raising their prices because of the sheer volume. We\u2019re all pretty big eaters there, but there\u2019s still a lot left over. The stuff might be a little old or stale, but I\u2019m sure that wouldn\u2019t be an problem for YOUR stomach. I\u2019ll see if I can hook you up with the leftovers BEFORE they get thrown out. How about that? Just think of all the mountains of leftovers food, all the greasy paper sacks stuffed with as many leavings as you can handle!, all that you\u2019ll get to cram into that \u20188th wonder\u2019 of yours\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMelissa blinked woozily and tried to shift upright to peer inquisitively at Alice, her colossal belly yet again churning and bubbling with the effort, which caused Mel to yet again to place steadying hands on the giant vat of her gut. Alice\u2019s face swam into view just over the mounding swell of her mammoth belly. \u201cHYICELLP! Ya...ya mean thattt? *glorpGROAN*\u201d Alice nodded in the affirmative. After a few moments, Mel hiccupped massively again, and eagerly jiggled the expansive upper shelf of her stomach, settling back down into her prone position with a sickly bubbling: \u201c*gurbleglop* HIC HILP!!! hurrray f\u2019r me \u2018n m\u2019stummick!

Finally wheeling myself onto her belly, and bathed in sweat, Mel struggled to reach beyond my mammoth body, and only barely dragged her heavy and sluggish body toward the kitchen. \u201cHICELP! Thisss is gonna be richhhhh,\u201d she mumbled huskily to herself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I gotten myself into...\u201d Thought Alice helplessly as she accompanied her eager friend...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mellissa woke up the next morning to her pride and joy filling out her field of view: her massive tummy. She smiled down at it and gave it a pat, to which it replied with a vicious growl that rippled her entire belly. The beast she had so lovingly fostered and grew was now awake, and it demanded nourishment. And she was all to happy to oblige! That tummy had taken over her a long time ago. Now, her belly was the master and Melissa was the slave, serving it's every whim and demand in it's never ending quest to grow bigger and hungrier. It was a goal that was now much easier with the new job Mel was going to be in starting today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... honey it's okay. You're gonna get your meal soon, big girl\" Mel cooed to her tummy, as the Beauty was trying to calm down the Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after eating so much last night her tummy still felt as empty as ever! Her cooing and patting didn't do much to calm it down, in fact, her belly growled even louder, angry at it's lack of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing only one way to fix this, she went down to her kitchen, and ate herself silly! Exiting the kitchen, her stomach stuck out like a massive orb. It was like a parasite, growing and sucking nutrients from its host. The thing glorped and gurgled, as it struggled to break down the massive amounts of food that was crammed into it. It was at it's limit, however, anymore and it wouldn't be able to handle it. But that was exactly what Mel was planning on doing to it. Drunkenly she made her way to her car and went off to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it to the office and as soon as she walked in the door, all of the attention was on her. How could it not? With a belly that big and loud, it drew the attention of anyone that was there. Carrying such a great weight was difficult for Mel, so as soon as she reached her desk, she sat down and used her swivel chair to move around. She wheeled herself across the office and everyone she passed has a comment for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow! You're really getting big!\" Someone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, she's a big one!\" Mel replied with a slap of her belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she made her way to the janitors area. They were already cleaning out the kitchen. Her tummy growled at the sight of all that food being laid out in front of her. But whether it was from hunger or fullness, she couldn't tell. Either way her stomach seemed to be in distress. She ran a loving hand across it's vast surface, saying sweet nothings to her stomach as though it was a small child that was crying. It seemed to do the trick though as her stomach seemed to calm down. Once she was satisfied that her stomach was stable, she licked her lips and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food wasn't the freshest, in fact some of it seemed questionable if it was even safe to be eaten. Her stomach seemed to agree with a sickening gurgle, like a stomach about to explode. She continued to choke down all of this on top of what she ate earlier. Her stomach swelled and swelled, gurgling sludgily as it did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, she was finished. Well, almost. She held the last bite of a stale cinnamon roll in her hand. She was gasping for breath and her stomach made the loudest growl it had ever made, begging her to stop this. It was too full of junk to keep going. All of that bad food was bloated her up on top of that and she felt like she was one bite away from exploding. She was covered in sweat and her arms were shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could take the last bite, Alice walked in the room and saw her friend on the floor. She was initially stunned by the size of her friend, but slowly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mel, what do you think? Is your stomach able to handle this every day?\" Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel looked at her with a devious smile. \"Of HIC...course it is!\" She managed to get out before she quickly shoved the last piece into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she did though, her stomach shook and rippled, growling like a dying beast. Mel groaned and clutched what little she could of her stomach. The growls increased in volume and the pain became excruciating before her stomach gave a loud GLOOOOOORRRRGGGLE and expanded out a good two more feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked at her in shock as Mel slapped her gut with that crazy smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that answer your...BURP...question?\" Mel asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was only 23 and had little work experience doing anything. But Rebecca was destined to fit in at the office. She was a plump 250 pounds. She was skinny up to her teens. It wasn\u2019t until her senior year of college that she started to fill out. By her graduation she had a nice curvy body. She had finally gotten the boobs and butt of a real woman. She was one of the hottest girls in her class that year. I guess you could say she had \u201cit\u201d in all the right places. But after graduation Becky didn\u2019t stop filling out. She went from curvy to thick to chubby to fat in a very short time. Next thing she knew she was more than 200 pounds. Rebecca\u2019s mind didn\u2019t handle this rapid weight gain very well. Instead of acknowledging that she had let herself go, she went into denial. She simply didn\u2019t see her fat rolls when she looked in the mirror, she just saw that smoking hot body from her senior year. Unfortunately for Rebecca\u2019s figure, working at the office would only help her state of denial as she was now surrounded by big bloated behemoths like Courtney and Jenna. Even the thinnest worker in the office, Victoria had a good ten pounds on Becca. Rebecca was no doubt destined for a long and glorious career at the office. She already had become good friends with Victoria (who was the same age as Becca), and she had a good relationship with her boss, Jenna.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m not fat, but\u2026\u201d Victoria responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nononono, Vicky. And Becky you too. Don\u2019t let anyone call you fat, cause you are not fat!\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah if anyone calls you fat, you tell me and I\u2019ll show them what a fat person looks like. And then I\u2019ll sit on them. Show \u2018em what a fat person feels like.\u201d <br>\r\nCourtney said. The room started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys really don\u2019t think I\u2019m fat?\u201d Victoria said with a smile. The 260 pound cutie took a bite from a doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what you are\u2026 You\u2019re just curvy.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, your booty is to die for.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way you fill those leggings you wore Friday. I mean, forget about it,\u201d Courtney said. This was a classic example of the girls in the office looking out for one another. Victoria was \u201ccurvy\u201d about 80 pounds ago. She was quite fat an on a collision course with obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI flaunt what I got,\u201d Victoria said, basking in her friends compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m curvy.\u201d Rebecca said. She was dying to get into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecky you could even stand to put on a few.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Why don\u2019t you have the last box of doughnuts? You\u2019re making us all look bad with that body.\u201d Alice said playfully. She slid a box of doughnuts over <br>\r\nto Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she really need the whole box?\u201d Melissa whispered to Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. I love doughnuts.\u201d Becca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you have to if you\u2019re gonna work in this office.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just make sure Melissa doesn\u2019t steal yours,\u201d Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how am I supposed to steal doughnuts when you keep telling people? Some friend you are.\u201d Melissa joked. Everyone was having a good time. <br>\r\nEspecially Rebecca, who was finally being accepted by her coworkers. Not only that but she was being showered with compliments about her figure, which was just what Rebecca liked to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you gonna eat those doughnuts?\u201d Courtney asked Rebecca who had only had one doughnut from the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, c\u2019mon skinny. Eat \u2018em up or I\u2019ll steal them from you,\u201d Melissa said with a laugh. Rebecca\u2019s coworkers completely butchered the realities of her weight. Rebecca was anything but skinny or small. She had a tubby belly that perfectly hung over her pants. Her belly button was a deep crevice of blubber. Her belly looked a bit smaller than it truly was because on top of it was her huge heaving breasts. They had swollen with fat. They managed to remain perky despite the thick layer of flab weighing them down. She had an absolutely glorious rack. The rest of her fat inflated her jiggling rear and smothered her porky thighs. She was anything but skinny.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was finally getting in to the rhythm of things at work. She was also getting along with the rest of the office workers. She was now one of \u201cthe girls\u201d. The only problem about her finally finding her place in the office was Rebecca\u2019s waistline. She was already gaining weight before taking the job but now that she worked in the office her gaining went to another level. All the snacking at her desk, the pastry heavy breaks, the lunches with Victoria, the dinner feasts with the rest of the girls, All of it was taking a heavy toll on her already chubby frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all made their way to the Food Court. They all made their hefty food orders and waddled back to their table. A choir of groans came from the seats around the table as 5 fatties lowered their overfed rumps. Courtney, Melissa, Alice, Rebecca, and Victoria all placed their large mountains of food on to the table. The truth was Rebecca wasn\u2019t the only one who had gained recently. The 4 other coworkers were blowing up almost as fast as Rebecca. See, working in the office caused a steady gain regardless. Their weights could go through short periods of loss and gain but in the long term their weights were rising at an almost constant rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then the cop pulls me over and says I was getting a ticket for not wearing a seat belt.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, then what?\u201d Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019m like: Uh officer I can\u2019t buckle my seat belt it\u2019s too short.\u201d Melissa said. \u201cThat\u2019s not my fault that\u2019s the car\u2019s fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right!\u201d Courtney exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said: I still have to give you a ticket. So I was like that\u2019s ridiculous! Why don\u2019t you give the ticket to the car company. They deserve it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you go girl.\u201d Alice said through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis next part is what really pissed me off. So I said why don\u2019t you give the ticket to the car company. Then he said to me: Why don\u2019t you just lose some weight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d There was a collective moment of anger and disgust at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then I started getting on his case about mistreatment and abuse. He finally crumpled up the ticket and let me go.\u201d Melissa said with a sense of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood for you, what a pig.\u201d Alice said. Rebecca wasn\u2019t sure it was the cop that was a pig in that story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right though, cars these days are way too small,\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVicky you don\u2019t even know. For about a year and a half I\u2019ve been driving with my belly rubbing the steering wheel!\u201d Courtney said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, when I\u2019m driving I\u2019ve got one hip sitting on the cup holder and the other hip rubbing against the door. I mean, have they ever heard of the term pear-shaped?\u201d Alice complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, and Al you\u2019re not even as large as me and Melissa. How big are you these days?\u201d Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m only like 345.\u201d Alice said. (interesting use of \u201conly\u201d)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c345! That\u2019s like average in America! Most women I see are at least 300.\u201d Courtney said. The second part was probably true but the first part was definitely not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny, I saw my aunt just the other day and she said I should watch my weight! Just because I may have put on 20 pounds doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m fat.\u201d Rebecca said. Rebecca was a plump 270 pounds now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you said: You should watch your mouth!\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, seriously. And Becky with boobs like yours 20 pounds here and there will just make the boys crazier.\u201d Alice said. Rebecca\u2019s face lit up at Alice\u2019s words. Those 20 pounds were making her worry, but Alice\u2019s comment had completely excused all those worries. Rebecca was free to eat without any regrets. The problem with Alice\u2019s logic was that while Becca\u2019s boobs were fantastically soft and plump, her tubby belly was pushing out farther and farther from under her heavy chest. Her gut was still slightly under the shadow of her breasts but that wouldn't last much longer. </span></div></div>",

It was like she had worked in the office for years. The girls were going to go have dinner together at the local all you can eat buffet. This was a weekly tradition for the coworkers, but this would be a first time experience for Rebecca who hadn\u2019t gone any of the weeks prior. The all you can eat buffet was a sanctuary for the women of the office. It catered to the needs of girls who were on the larger side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls met up in the parking lot of the restaurant. They waddled through the opening of the restaurant and up to the register. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTable for five, and we want the special service.\u201d Courtney said. The employee nodded and led them to a booth. It was by far the largest booth any of them had ever seen. The booth was specially designed for a large customer, or in this case 5 large customers. The girls squeezed their way into the booth. Menus were passed around the table. Rebecca was confused by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do we need menus? Aren\u2019t we going to the buffet?\u201d Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no sweetie, they bring the food to you.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s great. I mean what\u2019s the worst part about all you can eat buffet\u2019s? The walking!\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, after my fifth course how can you expect me to go walk back and forth again to get my six!?!\u201d Melissa said, unaware of the ridiculousness of her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this place is the best,\u201d Victoria said. Rebecca read the menu. It was an astounding compilation of deep fried, sugar coated, grease covered, breaded, wrapped in bacon, well salted, doused in sauce food. Not a single salad or vegetable option. After the menus were looked over 5 waiters came over to the table. Each girl took turns naming everything they wanted in their meal. After that was done the waiters left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now they\u2019ll come back with your food.\u201d Victoria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ll keep bringing you trays until you tell them not to.\u201d Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I love this place. They actually have booths I can fit in.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know right! Most places I\u2019m like: how am I supposed to eat all I can eat if after the 4th course I can\u2019t fit in the booth anymore?\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the only place I can actually have all I can eat without being interrupted.\u201d Alice said. Then the waiters returned with 5 trays stacked high with food. The conversation stopped and the eating commenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feasting went on for a couple hours. Trays shuffled back and forth by the staff as the women gorged themselves. After many courses girls started to cease their eating. Victoria and Rebecca were the first to stop. Rebecca had never eaten so much in her life. She looked next to her at Victoria. She was massaging her bloated belly. \u201cShe has really let herself go. I hope I never look like that. Thank god all this food will just go to my boobs.\u201d Rebecca thought. Victoria was quite large at 290 pounds. The interesting thing was that Rebecca outweighed Vicky at 300 pounds. Rebecca didn\u2019t know that but if she did she\u2019d probably just tell you that didn\u2019t matter cause she carried most of her excess weight in her boobs. If only Rebecca knew. The young plumper did have an incredible chest that made people stare. However she also had two big slabs of fat propping up her blubbery breasts. Her belly had become 2 doughy stacks of soft jiggling flesh. Her belly rested on two thighs that were padded by a thick layer of fat. Her butt had gone from round and thick to flabby and wide. Her cheeks wobbled at the slightest movement. Rebecca was anything but the curvy hourglass beauty she imagined herself as.</span></div></div>",

You could use it,\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are too sweet. I guess I can fit in a bit more.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Courtney turned to the waiter who was standing by awaiting their decision. \u201cWe\u2019d like to have the party sized ice cream.\u201d The waiter nodded and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Becky, How do you like it?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love it! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever eaten so much in my life.\u201d Rebecca said, massaging her gut. Just then a button flew off of Melissa\u2019s shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow another one!\u201d Alice said, looking at Melissa\u2019s exposed fat rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah so that makes\u2026 7 on the night, I think,\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c7 buttons lost? That might be the new record,\u201d Victoria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this is one of the only shirts that still fits me. Now it\u2019s missing 2 buttons.\u201d Rebecca complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, you should go see George!\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tailor. I get all my business clothes from him.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah we\u2019ll all go introduce him to you one of these days.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh desserts here!\u201d Victoria announced. Dessert was carried in by three waiters. They were holding a large metal container. As it was placed in the middle of the table it was revealed to be a metal tub of ice cream. In the ice cream were 5 spoons. There were gasps around the table during its arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do we get bowl?\u201d Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo silly, you just dig in!\u201d Melissa said. It was like a trough of ice cream. A pig trough, and there were 5 greedy pigs licking their lips as they waited to be fed. The girls each grabbed a spoon. They all leaned over the table as much as their flabby bellies allowed. Shoveling ice cream in their mouths the blubbery whales fought through the initial ice cream headache. Eventually they became numb to it and regained their fast eating pace. They tore through the tub of ice cream like ferocious predators tearing apart a carcass. After the ice cream disappeared in their swollen guts they slowly trudged back to their cars.</span></div></div>",

Then they waddled to a nearby bakery and did something never done at a bakery before, they opened a tab for the whole group.

The spa was unique in that they catered to larger women. Jenna had a real knack for discovering places like this. The weighty women walked into the building. They talked to the front desk and then waddled to the changing room. The girls each went to a locker. There they undressed and put on their robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow this robe actually fits all the way around. This place is great.\u201d Melissa said wrapping the robe around her massive middle. They then walked around the spa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Melissa and Victoria are going to get massages and Me, Alice and Rebecca are going to get herbal soaks.\u201d Courtney said. The group then split up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Victoria entered the massage room. Melissa opted to sit in the chair first while Victoria would get massaged on the table. The girls took off their robes. Victoria was shocked by Melissa\u2019s body. At 440 pounds her gut hung over her thighs like a doughy curtain. Victoria laid face down on the massage table as Melissa lowered herself into the chair. The two were really impressed by the spa. They had thought of everything. All the employees were at least 250 pounds. As Victoria stared downward she saw a large bowl of chocolates. She reached down and ate one. It was heavenly. She quickly started stuffing herself with both hands. Melissa sat as three employees surrounded her. One started massaging her feet. Another started to massage her belly. The third started to feed Melissa chocolates. The girls were in heaven. As Victoria pigged out on chocolate the masseuse started rubbing her back. At 320 pounds Victoria was quite plump all over her big body. The masseuse rubbed her thick folds of back fat. She slowly worked her way down until she reached her tremendous wobbling butt. Her overfed rump stuck up in the air like a mound of jiggling flesh. All that sitting Victoria did at her desk was visible by her bloated pear shaped. The masseuse dug her hands deep into Victoria meaty cheeks. The woman tried hard to find any remaining muscle buried under the blobs of blubber that made Vicky\u2019s butt. The woman then moved down to Vicky\u2019s thick flabby thighs. Second only to her massive rear end was her corpulent thunder thighs. Her leg bones were drowned in a thick layer of flab. The masseuse grabbed big handfuls of flab from Vicky\u2019s thighs. On the other side of the room Melissa was enjoying herself tremendously. She was fed a constant stream of chocolates. Her belly was carefully being massaged as well. The masseuse pushed her hands deep into Melissa\u2019s massive gut blubber. The woman\u2019s entire hand disappeared in between Melissa\u2019s thick flabby belly rolls. She kneaded her puffy spare tires like a roll of dough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the spa, Alice, Courtney, and Rebecca entered the bath room. There were three small individual pools built in the ground for each of the woman to sit in. The girls removed their robes. Rebecca was mesmerized as Alice bent down and stuck her massive butt in the air. Her two cheeks had lost their shape and had become to orbs of flesh. They looked like two padded seat cushions of fat. Rebecca then looked over at Courtney. All her flabby body parts wobbled and bounced as she walked. She looked back at Alice\u2019s breasts. They were incredible! While Courtney\u2019s breasts sagged down like heavy sacks of fat, Alice\u2019s breasts were like big jiggling balloons that bounced and rippled. She wondered what Alice would look like without the extra 300 pounds she was carrying. Meanwhile Alice was staring back at Rebecca wondering what had happened. She remembered Rebecca\u2019s first day when she was just a hefty 250 pounds, now she was at least 100 pounds heavier! Her chest remained large as always but now her belly stuck far out and hung over her thighs. Two large belly rolls swayed as she moved and her butt wiggled and rippled with fat at her every movement. The girls walked into their individual pools. Alice\u2019s and Courtney\u2019s pools overflowed as their blubbery bodies filled up the pools. The girls were then fed chocolates by the staff. The three fatties had a wonderful time soaking in their tubs, eating chocolate, and gabbing about nothing. Sadly though the girls bliss came to the end. The girls soak time was up. As the girls got out of the tubs, Courtney ran into some trouble as she attempted to lift herself out of the tub. Her massive belly brushed against the edge of the tub. She tried to pull herself up onto the floor. She flailed awkwardly as she leaned on the edge. Eventually she managed to flop her naked blubber onto the floor. Her wet flab jiggled as she squirmed on the ground. Rebecca stared as the helpless mound of fat struggled to stand up. Luckily the staff at the spa helped pull Courtney to her feet. The three girls then put their robes back on and walked their chocolate stuffed bodies back to the changing room. The 5 friends put their clothes back on and went out to lunch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah waddled her slender form through the hallway. Her perky and large breasts, and her supple behind were the only places she could be called \"Fat\". Her buttoned shirt was tight as she packed the copious stacks of insurance papers with her, moving to the central filling area. She heard a high-pitched voice, \"Hey hannah!\" Hannah turned to the co-worker. It was Jessica, walking to her lunch break. Hannah replied. \"Hey Jess!\" The redheaded, 350-pound woman turned back to her walk, shortly afterwards a 'Pop' rang out from behind. Hannah turned and saw a button laying on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She thought to help poor Jessica as the obese woman tried to bend over, but a brunette hurried over to help her. Hannah turned about and kept walking to the filing area. Jessica was a good girl, if a little big. <i>All Jessica needs is a good, old-fashioned, lifestyle intervention</i>, thought Hannah. She thought of maybe getting in contact with her and  scheduling a visit to a scale and a gym one day. Maybe on Good Friday, the manager was good about giving them Christian holidays off. Hannah appreciated that above all, she was born and raised in a deeply religious families. The Laurens were very prestigious members in Rock Hill, with a vast family of 8 children and more uncles, aunts, and cousins than could be counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah reached the filing cabinet with her brisk and lively pace. Unlike the fatter, bulkier members of the office like Vanessa and Jessica who would have taken a good twenty minutes to reach it, it took Hannah a matter of seconds to reach the uninterrupted wall of files. Hannah spent a few minutes fitting each folder into their respective cabinet slots. Hannah spent her high school years on the school dance team, which kept her very slim. Most of the other dancers on that team, especially Brooke and Taylor, fattened up even beyond their already plump forms after the dance team was over and when they entered college. Hannah was literally the only one who hadn't really gained in college due to her rigorous regimen of exercise and dieting. She had her spots of fatness, but those were overcome by simply slipping into her routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah finished finally filing everything away, and turned back, an announcement came over the loudspeaker. \"Will all office employees please report to the conference room, thank you.\" Hannah sighed in annoyance, she never seemed to be able to catch a moment of peace. That was one thing she was envious of the blubbier members of the office for: They seemed to have more peace sitting in their chairs, enjoying their fatty treats. She even thought for a moment of giving up her diet and exercise regimen, for one moment. Then she had to bring herself back to reality. She would enjoy a long, healthy life, hopefully with a sweet guy, and live well into her 90's. She couldn't say the same for Jessica and Vanessa, who she projected would die in their forties. She made a fast walk down the stairs, the blubbery mass of multiple female office workers in their white button-up shirts followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all arrived in the large room where stood the manager, Rob Herrison. He sported a goatee and a massive 383 pounds on his 6'4 frame. He was huge in both senses of the word. He spoke in his loud, deep voice. \"Now! We're reaching quotas this month, ladies. The board says that we're about to make a huge amount of money, we're working in tandem with a Weight Loss company. For every ten pounds lost, they're giving away discounts for life insurance. I want you ladies out there, working, selling! Now get out there and make some money. We're closing up for the day, get yourselves rested and fed for tomorrow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began leaving, and Hannah exited. As she left, her phone rang. She withdrew her phone and answered it as she stepped away. A familiar voice rang up. \"Hey Hannah, it's Brooke!\" Hannah spoke with excitement to her old friend. \"Hey Brooke! How are you?\" Brooke spoke. \"Hungry, and that's why I've called. I thought we'd get back together for the rest of the evening, lunch and supper are gonna be on me!\" Hannah spoke. \"Well that's great, Brooke! Where do you wanna go?\" Brooke spoke. \"Market Commons, we're meeting up for lunch at California Pizza.\" Hannah pondered for a second. She could afford to break her regimen for one day. \"Sure thing, see you there!\" Brooke replied, \"Bye now!\" Brooke hang up, and then hannah put away her phone as she briskly maneuvered around the panting, blubbery females around her and got into her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drove up to the vast commercial mini-town that was the Market Commons and manuevered into her parking place, she briskly jogged towards the nearby california pizza, and at the door she saw the familiar form of Brooke. Brooke had obviously ballooned up since Dance team was over; When she had left, she was already almost 160 pounds and rather chunky. She had gone up to what looked to be around 240. She extended her blubbery, suited arms. \"Hannah!\" Hannah wrapped her arms around Brooke. \"Brooke, how you doin' babe?\" Brooke spoke. \"Just fine. Let's get inside girl!\" Both women were rather hungry. Hannah had not had her lunch break, and Brooke was Brooke, always ravenous. The only thing that had previously kept her in some semblance of shape was Dance practice. They entered the pizza joint, and got a booth by the windows. Many people sat around. An old acquaintance sat near their seat, and after they had ordered their drinks; A regular coke for Brooke and a diet coke for Hannah, they began conversing. \"How's work, Hannah?\"Hannah smiled and replied, \"Oh, it's great! I have a feeling I'm about to get swamped tomorrow, we're expecting a wave of people.\" Brooke nodded. \"Mmm-hmm. I work at BB&amp;T, and tomorrow's the expected crowd; People putting in their paychecks. But I can bring you lunch tomorrow!\" Hannah smirked. \"That would be great, Brooke!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah turned around, looking at the crowd of mostly unfamiliar faces. To her right, across the aisle she saw a heavy-ish man sitting across from a blubbery woman that would fit right in at the office. Hannah recognized it as Sam from high school, the resident history nerd. He was an odd mix of introvert and extrovert. Hannah smiled and spoke. \"Sam!\" The man turned and spoke. \"Hannah? Hannah Laurens? My god, it really is you!\" Hannah spoke. \"Yeah, how have the years treated you?\" Sam spoke. \"Oh, just peachy. Inbetween semesters at college, I married my beautiful wife here, Kelsie. Kels, look over there, it's hannah!\" The blubbery brunette smiled and waved at the thin woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lunch had gone on with a good deal of conversation between Brooke and Hannah, talking about their lives after High School. Eventually their extra pizza came and Brooke had dug in, but Hannah had also done her good bit of the damage. She was ravenous and it seemed like a competition between the two. They both left stuffed like turkeys,Brooke's white blouse started to poke its head from her suit jacket, a bit of her stomach peeking out at the world from the bottom. They spent the duration of their evening at first, the movies, where brooke, and by the pressure of the popcorn smell, Hannah, beat the odds by actually buying popcorn. They finished up their night at the nearby italian resturaunt afterwards, Hannah ordering Penne Pasta, with Shrimp &amp; Whole Grain Spaghetti. The absolutely gorged women finished up their night waddling out of the resturaunt. Hannah's gut had expanded massively, and Brooke's blouse showed her belly up to the bellybutton. They sat at a pair of rocking chairs nearby in relaxation, and Hannah thought. She didn't want to be typical health freak Hannah, but if this is how Brooke ate every night, she'd follow Jessica down Heart Failure Road. She made up her mind, and turned to brooke, speaking...</span></div></div>",

I'll have to pay you back sometime.\" Brooke shook her head. \"No need, girl! Thanks for eating with me. We'll have to do it again sometime!\" They both departed and left their homes, Brooke struggling to fit her extra bloated form into her car. Hannah was able to do it, despite her enlarged belly that poked out from her normally flat stomach. She drove off back to her house and, exhausted by the amount of food, slipped right out on her bed. She woke up the next morning, feeling the effects of the night of almost nonstop eating. She shook it off and told herself she'd get to it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She got up and, realizing it was 7:20, realized she had to hurry up and get dressed. She threw on her button shirt and noticed it was a bit more snug than yesterday. <i>Another byproduct of that night, damn myself for getting talked into that. I feel like a whale now.</i> She put on some makeup, some eyeliner, her usual setup, did her hair, and got out by 7:45. She had to be at work by 8:30, so she'd have to commit another health sin; Eating a fast food breakfast. She pulled up into the Mcdonald's drive through and ordered a Bacon and Egg McMuffin, some Hash Browns, and a Mocha. As she reached the office about 8:10, she hurried up the flight of stairs, just behind the panting, sweaty form of Melissa. Hannah had no time to say hello; She knew what rush days looked like, and she knew that when Corporate makes a deal, it's a rush day. She sat down at her desk, hurriedly eating her cursedly fatty breakfast. She'd step up her regimen this weekend, hopefully. As she finished her meal, she heard the voice of Rob. \"Alright people, let's make some money today!\"  Hannah did not disdain many people in this world, but she certainly did disdain Micro-managing, loud Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy mid day, she had taken what seemed like six million calls, though it was only 20. As she talked amidst her 21st call, the fat form of Brooke, today sporting a tight button-up that contained all 240 of her blubbery pounds, plopped by her desk and dropped off a large bag with the Burger King logo on it. Hannah smiled and gave an approving thumbs up, and the familiar bloated friend had slipped out. As Hannah finished the call, she dug into the bag; A double cheeseburger, a large fry, a Hersheys chocolate sundae pie slice, and a large coke. She did not question the health of the meal at this point, all she cared about was the food. She began with alternating bites of the double cheeseburger and fry, with sips of coke inbetween. Her ravenous mouth found satisfaction in these, but she filled up the room left with the sinfulness of the chocolatey, delightful slice of pie. The day continued, Hannah satisfied by the large meal.  <i>I'll deal with it over the weekend,</i> thought Hannah. The calls seemed to stop after one more after lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt an urge to get up and get a snack from the fridge, as she saw her-co-workers do the same. She shrugged; She'd committed enough health sins today, why not another? She got up and walked over towards the Fridge, and encountered Jenna, one of the obese coworkers. She turned and spoke, with a sigh. \"Good god, I don't know what the hell corporate did, but everyone seems to be fearing for their lives. I've had about.. Forty calls today, I had to eat through a few of them.\" Hannah nodded, feeling the big girl's pain as Hannah grabbed a bag of Chips from the fridge. \"Some of the people on the phone, bless their hearts, they don't know a smidge of common sense.\" Jenna nodded with an \"Mmm-hmm,\" as she poured herself a cup of coffee. \"I don't know how these people remember how to breathe. What's your name?\" \"Hannah,\" Hannah replied. \"What's yours?\" Jenna replied, \"Oh, I'm Jenna. Nice to meet you.\" The young brunette with her hair tied in a bun waddled away with her mug. Hannah walked away with her bag of chips. She sat back down at her desk and ripped the bag open and began eating the Barbecue chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day sustained a few more calls, and by its end, Hannah had gone to get another bag, and dug into that. Something about these long, stressful days made Hannah hungry. As she left the office, she began her drive home. Her phone rang on the way there, and she picked it up. \"Hello.\" She was greeted with...</span></div></div>",

Sorry I couldn't talk during your work, didn't want to interrupt ya.\" Hannah waved her hand, saying \"It's fine, Brooke.\" The chill of the autumn night gave both ladies a chill. \"Woooh.. We better get inside.\" Hannah spoke. \"Bbbbr. Yeah, damn weatherman said it'd be 70 tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke and Hannah entered the Japanese-themed building, eventually getting to their table after what seemed like an eternity of waiting in line to get checked in. Brooke ordered her typical coke, but Hannah decided to join her in getting a regular coke. She decided to indulge herself tonight, and two days of indulgence wouldn't kill her. As she looked about her menu, she saw a hunk of a man sitting at a nearby table. She poked her bony finger into Brooke's fleshy arm, exposed by the short-sleeved blouse, and as her friend turned to her, Hannah pointed to the black-haired,well-kempt, muscular and bearded man at the next table over. On top of that, Hannah could detect a Southern cadence about his voice, and there was nothing that turned Hannah on more than a Country boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chef prepared to come to the table, Hannah ordered the Hibachi steak and shrimp combo, with a side of scallops. Hannah had not had hibachi in weeks, as her diet was mostly greens and nuts. As she ate through her meal, she kept sneaking peeks of the Black-haired country boy inbetween bite of her scallops and shrimp. She ate through her meal, and as they finished, Hannah pulled her chair up as the country boy got up, giving a stuffed sigh. Hannah approached her, getting out her phone as her flabby friend watched on in anticipation. Hannah walked up to the country boy as he began walking away. \"Hey.\" The black-bearded man turned, speaking. \"Uh, yeah?\" Hannah spoke. \"Hi, uh.. My name's Hannah. I just wanted to say...\" Hannah locked up for a second and then spoke. \"...I really like your beard, and you should totally call me.\" She handed the bewildered man her phone, he quickly entered her number, speaking. \"Hey, thanks, uh, Hannah. I'm Austin. Austin Calone.\" The man smiled. \"I hate to sound like a dork, but, uh...\" Hannah beamed with hope, with gleam and light. It was happening,love was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Who's your friend over there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's smile vanished and her heart plummeted. In her mind she picked up and slammed it into the man's face, and began trashing the entire resturaunt, screaming in complete anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she answered with an obviously disinterested \"Oh. She's Brooke.\" Austin looked sympathetiecally. \"No, I didn't mean it like that, it's just...\" He leaned into her ear. \"If you were to get a bit more...Like your friend.. Then maybe we could talk.\" Hannah spoke. \"Oh, then, uh, sure.\" Brooke spoke. \"Hannah, we got to go.\" Hannah spoke. \"Coming, Brooke!\" She turned and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was absolutely a change in pace. She talked to a cute guy and he gave her terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly terms that she liked. She knew exactly what the guy meant when he said to \"get a bit more like\" Brooke. Hannah wouldn't comprimise her weight for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lines became a bit more blurred in hannah's head. Yes, she wanted to live a long time and not die early of diabetes and heart attack, but damn, an angel like that doesn't descend every day from heaven like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke spoke. \"Thanks for coming, Hannah. Wanna go to a movie next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah knew there were plenty of fattening treats at the movies. Her mind was stuck on this; Would she toss off every lifetime commitment she'd made to stay healthy and not go the path of the typical former athlete, and gain weight? Would she throw her health away for love? If anything, this moment would decide.<br>\r\n\"Uh..\"</span></div></div>",

Hannah hesitated but smelling the buttery snack in Brooke\u2019s arms was too much for Hannah too resist. She ordered a large bucket of popcorn and soda and happily munched on the unhealthy bucket of junk food. Hannah\u2019s taste buds weren\u2019t used to such unhealthy and delicious treats. It was overwhelmingly tasty and enjoyable for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah continued to ponder what had happened earlier as they watched the movie. <i>Could I be wrong about being fat? Brooke always seems so happy, AND that totally hot guy wanted her. I somehow didn\u2019t even have a chance with him. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the movie she got another large bucket of popcorn. She was eating out of anger now.

Hannah\u2019s cheeks were bright red and she was so worked up in her anger that she was breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Brooke whispered. Hannah stopped and swallowed her mouthful of popcorn. She snapped out of her rage realizing she was in a public movie theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 *pant* yeah\u2026 *huff* yeah I\u2019m fine.\u201d Hannah said.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was no big surprise that afterwards, Brooke and Austin kicked it off rather well, and Austin knew the right poison for brooke; Movie nights, Dinner dates, Lazy days at the house. As hannah sat in her room that next Tuesday evening, thoughts ran through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had always stayed fit, in part, to get guys. That was what the media said, right? Have a hot bod, get the perfect guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, something had to go wrong. Had anyone else seen Hannah's life, they'd think she had it made: Steady office job, Perfect body, and (mostly) happy days. Hannah wondered what in her life had gone so wrong that she literally could NOT find a guy that supposedly was sure to fall for her. It wasn't happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in that moment, Hannah's rage boiled over. That always-nice, goody-two-shoes, never-angry Hannah Lanes snapped and turned against the basilisks that she had turned to for the majority of her life, and the prior objects she had seen as her bulwark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screeched and stormed about her house, slamming her punching bags to the ground, pulling down her chin-up bars, smashing up her treadmills, hurling health food to the floor. She didn't care about what they'd done for her previously, they had done nothing if they couldn't get her the perfect life that they promised. She saw these objects of her prior life as a health freak as Charlatans, Chicanery-laden objects of lies and deceit. They did not give her the life she wanted. They did not give her the perfect guy, the picket-fence life of domesticity and peace that had always been her golden vision of the future. As she stood there, her fury overwhelming her senses, the anger washed away in a tide, depression to come flowing back in, as she collapsed on top of the pile of her former life, sobbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then, SHE gets the hunk instead of me!\" sobbed Hannah, sitting on the break room couch. She dug into a box of cookies, slid to her by the chubby hands of Melissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dearie, we've all been there. Our friend gets the man instead of us,\" supplied Alice, in her ever kind and sympathetic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah,\" spoke Melissa, \"Screw guys. I'm in a relationship with Food.\" Courtney leaned over and wiped some tears from Hannah's face, as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y'know, you guys are the best co-workers a girl could ask for. Especially in a time like this...\" Hannah continued digging into the cookies and Melissa kept the food coming. Hannah didn't care what she ate in that time, its calorie content or its fat content, nor its sodium nor sugar contents. All she cared for was how it made her feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sympathy feeding went on for a bit and into Lunch Break. The rest of the gals, famished from comforting Hannah, made a unanimous decision to go to the Burger Barn, a newer restaurant that had opened up around the block. Hannah didn't hesitate in joining them. She no longer had the hesitation that a health freak had. She had sheer determination. Somewhere, deep down, though her conscious brain thought of it only as comfort eating, something inside her urged her to unconsciously try to get fatter. Maybe then she'd be able to steal Austin back for her own, and leave Brooke in the dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hannah sat with her co-worker Posse, digging into a set of Chicken Tenders and two sides of fries, she saw Brooke and her little hunk Austin. Hannah noticed for one thing, that Brooke had even more than her usual amount of food. And if she knew Brooke, brooke normally still got gargantuan portions. She could see that Austin didn't sit fine enough with 240, but still wanted bigger. Hannah could already see Austin's work wreaking havoc on Brooke's button-up from their night back on Thursday; She could see the buttons straining, and tidbits of Brooke's succulent flesh poking through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah wondered: Did she truly hate brooke as her brain tried to convince her?  Or was it just petty jealousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts she pondered while she dug through her mountain of fries and chicken strips. A procession of 'Pops' rang from Brooke's table, as the girl stared down at her malfunction. Brooke attempted to get up, but her large, stuffed behemoth belly wedged her into the booth, and her Boyfriend was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's brain processed this. Did she truly want to see her old friend humiliated and hurt, just because she got the guy of any girl's dreams?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally, she answered...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Urgh!\" Hannah reached in, gripping the gut of brooke, soft and doughy, rippling with the blubbery girl's attempts to rip herself free of the booth. Hannah gripped the back of the girl. She shoved in Brooke's gut and began pulling on her back at the same time, helping her out of the booth. Brooke panted, her massive gut and extended rack heaving and rising, until she slowed her breathing to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hannah.\" She wiped at her eyes. \"What's wrong?\" asked Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke sniffled and spoke. \"The bank said that...That..*Sniffle*... I was getting too costly...For their health coverage...And they fired me....*Sniffle* *Sniffle* I can't believe I've gotten so fat..*Sniffle*..That I can't hold down a job..\" She began crying, and Hannah patted her on the back. \"Brookie, Relax. It'll be alright, someone will hire you, you're not even fat, you're just...Pleasantly plump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, Jess jumped up. \"Our office offers unlimited health coverage! And You're not even as heavy as me, I'm sure that the office would love to hire you!\" Brooke looked up. \"R...Really?\"  Jess nodded. \"Mmmhmm! It even provides for whales like Melissa.\" Melissa nodded and smirked, not even caring about the remark. She had learned to shrug off the weight comments a long time ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll really hire...A pig like me?\" Brooke said slowly, a tone of sadness mixed with excitement. Courtney spoke. \"Of course. I mean, if you're a pig, then call me a Blue Whale.\" Brooke spoke. \"Then...Then I guess I'll apply..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah enjoyed the rest of her meal and then enjoyed the rest of her day with the girl. Her abandonment of her healthy lifestyle led to her joining the girls in their constant raids on the break room. Her embracing of the office lifestyle led to greater pleasure within her job. She saw it as a social affair. Another side effect was the pounds long kept back by the diet and exercise started breaking down the dam built up by her years of  exercise, and she had begun seeping up the ranks as a heavier girl. She had hit 130 by the end of the week, and her button-up had begun straining to its limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke,too, was quickly absorbed into the lifestyle of the office as she got the job the next day, and fit right into the small posse of fatties. Red-headed Jessica took her under her flabby arm especially, allowing her to hang out in her office, officially for 'Cooperation on tasks', but it really turned into a co-feeding time. Brooke seeing a look into her future with rapidly-bloating Jessica, she started following, going from 250 up to 265 by the end of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah and her blubbery friends waddled into the Food Court at the nearby mall. After a bit of scattering off, each of them had stopped off at their favorite joints; Melissa at the Burger King that stood inside the mall, retrieving her typical 2 bags packed full of the unhealthiest concoctions they had. Brooke at her favorite Italian pizzeria, grabbing what must have been 6 slices and about 3 bread sticks, Jessica joining her, getting a full pizza. Courtney got a massive heap of assorted noodles, meats, and soups from the Chinese place in the mall. Hannah visited her favorite Japanese joint in the mall, grabbing several sushi rolls, some hibachi chicken, and some shrimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting their tray fulls (Or in Jessica's case, pan fulls) Of food, they sat down at their tables. Hannah looked at Jessica. \"Someone's hungry.\" Jessica nodded. \"Damn right, I haven't eaten all day, except for about three bags of Cheetos and two mugs of coffee.\" She dug into the large 28 inch pizza ravenously, each slice taking multiple bites to overwhelm.  Courtney slurped up a forkful of noodles and spoke. \"So Brooke, how's the experience been so far?\" Brooke gobbled up a slice of pizza, and spoke. \"Mmm. Good, it's good communing with a few girls about my size.\" Melissa interjected. \"About your size? Hon, we've got about.. What, 200 pounds on you.\" Brooke chuckled. \"Well, if I keep eating this way, I should catch up.\" She giggled and patted her sizable tummy. Hannah spoke. \"You think you have catching up to do, I've got to power eat to get up to you guys' weights.\" Brooke spoke. \"Yeah. It'll be kinda hard with all that goody-two-shoes dieting and exercise you do.\" Hannah waved her hand and shook her head. \"Nah. I don't do that anymore. I realized it didn't get me anywhere, really.\" Jess spoke. \"Well, good to see that you've started on the road. But you've got a lil' while to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the friends finished gorging themselves on their lunch, they hurried back to the office and, discovering that they had next-to-no work for the rest of the day, decided to meet up in the break room. And with the social gathering came the titanic amounts of food; An econo-sized pack of Cheetos, three family bags of chips, and a huge box of cookies. Courtney was beat from her Chinese feast earlier, and only occasionally grazed, but Hannah, Brooke, Melissa, and Jess split up each snack; Brooke took the cheetos, Melissa and Jess tag-teamed the cookies, and Hannah gorged on the chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feast finished, Hannah leaned back into her chair, beat by the serving of chips intended for a family. And then it happened; Two buttons popped off her shirt, exposing the top of her stomach, now extended by the gorging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smirked and spoke. \"Well, looks like our little Hannah just hit a Milestone. Congrats! UUUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked, chuckling and speaking. \"Heheh, thanks...Guess I got a lil' carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the popped buttons. In this moment, her subconscious' plans had been exposed, and this brought her to think. <i>Am I actually trying to gain weight?</i><br>\r\nAs she saw the looks of the other stuffed girls, a few other buttons joined hers in popping: Jessica's for sure, and Brooke as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You know what? Why not. I've starved myself my whole life, and now's my chance to relax a little. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, over the loudspeaker, came...</span></div></div>",

I repeat, the office will be closing early, at 3:30 today\u2026 Thank you.\u201d The loudspeaker shut off. All the girls in the break room looked around in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s only in an hour!\u201d Hannah exclaimed. The room burst into celebration and giddiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case I\u2019ve got some things to finish up at my desk.\u201d Courtney said as she left the break room. \u201cYeah, I do to.\u201d Melissa said as she and a few others exited. Just Hannah, Brooke, and Jessica were left sitting in the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow this is going to be great\u2026 off work at 3:30.\u201d Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey how about after work we go to my house and order pizza?\u201d Jessica proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds awesome!

They then met back up at 3:30 where they drove to Jessica\u2019s house. They decided to stop by Mcdonald\u2019s first where they picked up three big bags of burgers and fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby trio entered Jessica\u2019s living room, still making their way through the greasy bags of fast food. The bulging bellies (varying in size) of the three women were poking out of their shirts as their missing buttons had caused their tops to hang open to reveal parts of their midsections. They sat down in Jessica\u2019s living room and continues shoving burgers and fries down their throats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSho I\u2019ll *gulp* I\u2019ll call the *slurp* pizza place.\u201d Brooke said through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrder from *munch* Gino\u2019s. Besht pisha *swallow* in town.\u201d Jessica said. Brooke dialed Gino\u2019s pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you guys want?\u201d Brooke asked Hannah and Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want a whole meat lover\u2019s pie.\u201d Hannah said. That was a lot more than she usually ordered but she was throwing out any sense of restraint. Something about hanging around with her flabby friends encouraged all of them to be as gluttonous as possible. Besides, anything Hannah couldn\u2019t finish would happily be eaten by Jessica or Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne plain pie\u2026 One pepperoni pie, and do you wanna split another meat lover\u2019s?\u201d Jessica asked. Brooke nodded and repeated it into the phone. SHe also ordered another pie for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be here in 30ish minutes.\u201d Brooke said as she put down her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter finish up these burgers then.\u201d Hannah said. Lacking the gorging skills of Brooke and Jessica, she still had a ways to go with her large order of Mcdonalds. She had a burger in each hand, alternating bites from each burger. It felt weird, eating so rapidly. She wasn\u2019t experienced with stuffing her face so ferociously. She could barely keep up with amount of food she was shoving past her lips. Hannah managed though to get in a groove that let her get through the burgers at such a voracious pace. She had reached a level of eating focus that she had never experienced before but she had seen it many times eating with Jessica and her other large friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah happily licked her fingers as she finished the last handful of fries left in her bag. DING DONG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that must be the pizza!\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She got to the door and opened it, taking the money. Before her stood a pizza boy in the doorway, somewhat burdened by the pizza stack he heaved over to the slender-ish woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Here's your pizzas, ma'am. Enjoy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hannah ravenously picked up the pizzas and shut the door. It was not like her to be so rude, but in her mad dash to fatten herself, she didn't care in any way, shape, nor form. She just wanted the food. She set the arrays of pizza down, her meat lovers before her, and the 4 pizzas before the whale-like redhead and the blubbery blonde to her right on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked at the amount of food before her. A few short months ago, if she saw this, she'd spray holy water all over it and grab all her nearest Richard Simmons tapes, and put herself on a crash diet for even smelling it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she was diving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She alternated between biting into a big slice of the huge, deliciously greasy pizza laden with pepperoni, sausage, salami, and Hamburger meat, and jamming a fistful of fries down her throat. She had shifted her athletic talents of the past into her eating, as Brooke and Jessica hogged on the pizzas, dual wielding slices and biting with voracious aptitude into the gargantuan slices, and gobbling down the straggling remnants of the fries in their bags.  Jessica was, of course, the most apt at this, eating like a champion, going through the record-breaking slices in mere half-minutes. By some miracle, possibly because the stress was being relieved elsewhere, her remaining buttons were holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brooke was trailing in second, also gobbling down the slices with a ferocious attempt to get them packed into her stomach. Hannah, feeling inadequate, stepped up her eating pace, now at about 3/4ths of the way done through her McDonalds, and 1/4th done with her pizza. All mouths were consuming like reverse machine guns, all had gotten to the point where they no longer ate the food, they simply consumed it, eating to get through, the taste of the pizza itself almost erotic in nature, but the eating itself seeming like the pathway to heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took until about 6 to complete the massive feast, all beauties sat back on the couch. They had defeated the massive meal, surmounted the mountain of calorie-laden food, and the bloated, blubbery battlers had their battle-scars strewn about their bodies: Tomato sauce stains down their shirts, a few pieces of crust and ketchup from the burgers and fries laying about. Hannah finished her last burger, and as she finished, that had to have done it. Not only did buttons pop off her shirt and careen towards the wall opposite her, but her airtight shirt had torn in several places. Brooke lay strewn on the groaning arm of the couch, in her bra and panties, as her pants had become choking quite a bit ago, and her shirt lay in a heap near it, torn and ripped like battle armor after a long day. Jessica's shirt had literally fallen to shreds after her gorging, and her pants had burst, all ladies, excluding Hannah, lay half-naked on the couch, and Hannah's pants seemed as though they would go as well at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit, all woke up, returning to sipping the dregs of their remaining McDonalds. They saw the clock, as it flashed 7:00. They thought perhaps to get an early rest, and to go back to sleep on the couch. But they all knew they needed some clothes for work the next day. Eventually, it was decided that...</span></div></div>",

Jess spoke, sweating like a hog, her second chin highly evident as she sat back on her couch seat, her sweat-drowned stomach just two or three inches from her knees. \"Uuuughh....What about...George's....place...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke spoke \"George?\" Jess took a gasp and a huff, and wiped her sweating fore head. \"George's place...*pant* He tailors to..*huff* to big girls like us..*wheeze*...I've had to...*huff*...visit him..*wheeze*..three times..*gasp*..in the past month..*wheeze*...He's really good..\" Hannah nodded. \"Yeah. But, uh...Got anything to fit us in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jessica nodded, wheezing and gasping in near-asthmatic volumes. \"Yeah...*wheeze*...Look in...*Pant*...The Closet..*Wheeze*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter borrowing some of Jessica's old clothes, the girls, once Jessica had gotten a drink and rested up a bit more, and went to the tailor's shop just across the closed office building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladieees!\" shouted the thin, short, black-haired man. \"How are my favorite girls doing?\" \"Just fine, George. We went gorging tonight and we need some new work clothes. George spoke. \"Okay, let's get started! Ooh, looks like you brought some new gals! What's your names?\" Hannah smiled and spoke. \"I'm hannah.\" Brooke spoke. \"And I'm Brooke.\" George smiled. \"Well, who'll go first?\" Hannah replied, \"Uh, how about Jess?\" Brooke agreed, saying \"Sure, you go next, Jess.\" The whale-like redhead waddled up. George moved the tape measure around her wide, expansive belly, the measure going about 75 inches around. \"So how'd all this happen, honey? Don't spare me the dirty details!\" Jess replied as George slid the tape measure around Jess' lardy arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it started with going home from work early. We celebrated by eating lunch...For the second time of the day...With two pizzas for me and brooke here. Hannah skimped and only got one. And in the process, we bust out of our shirts, and our pants burst.\" George nodded at the story. \"Mmm. Sounds sinfully good, I'd burst out of this shirt if I could eat like that, but if I ripped this shirt, I think i'd die.\" Jess slipped off her pants as the tailor measured her thick, rolling thighs and legs. George spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know the drill, Jess. Ya don't have to look, but I got to have a weigh-in so I can know when to have the next set ready.\" Jessica nodded and waddled over to the scale, standing on it. The number flashed up to 395.68, which the tailor wrote down. Jessica, out of curiosity, bent over her belly to peek, and gawked at the number.  \"Geez! I'm almost 400.\" She stepped off as George spoke. \"I'll be right back with your clothes dear!\" George hurried back into his office and came out with a semi-transparent dress shirt without buttons and a set of elastic-waistbanded work pants. Jess slipped them on and with the comfortability of the clothes, she walked back, smiling a bit, but still not exactly delighted over the big number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke walked up next, anticipating the big number. She knew she wouldn't have such a shock, she'd learned to accept the fact that she'd be fat a long time ago, and now it was just a matter of seeing what would happen next.  She got her measurements across her expansive belly, which showed up at about 50 inches. her supple bust, and on her large rear-end, which was prominent along with her stomach. Her weight came up at about 276.35, and she waddled away with another button up, quite a bit more loose than her previous. It promised to hold up for quite a few pounds more, but it'd most likely go as she hit 300, which would doubtless be any day now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah walked up, not yet waddling as she was still in the 100's. Her measurements brought her stomach up to about 35, and her bust was prominent along with her stomach. Her behind was rather big, but not among the biggest attractions. Her weight came up at about 164.43, and George awarded her a blue button-up, about the size of Brooke's old one, so very loose fitting. It served to Hannah as a new goal to shoot for: Bust these buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the ladies exited the parlor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The month closed up after a few weeks of gorging. By the first week of the next month, Hannah had finally hit the big 200. It didn't hurt her gain that she sat mostly in the break room, and she started even exceeding Jessica in her gorging. As she hit 200, she developed a form of training that had thrown her into Binge Eating by the end of the month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe christmas tree stood alight with ornaments and decoration in the office lobby, even though november had set in, it was that time of the year when you could count on the weather being cold. And in the New England weather, winter certainly came early. Hannah, with her extra pounds, came in with a medium coat, not cold by any sense of the word, as her fat and coat gave her plenty of warmth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the first winter she stayed here after she moved from South Carolina; She wasn't ready, being from naturally hot regions, winter came later than it did here. But now she was ready for the cold, especially suited to it now that she had an extra coat of fat. Thanksgiving was just around the corner, and for that, she was thankful. It meant a trip down south, and this was her last workday here before taking the few days off and then the weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building was actually closed to business, it was just a tradition for the day before thanksgiving break, for everyone to pig out together before they went to their families to pig out as well. Hannah was well stocked for the feast: She brought a suitcase full of snacks and a fast food bag, setting them down on the break room table. She was just about dead as she finished hauling the massive load of food over to the table. First she set down the gargantuan bag of food, stacked with about 5 or 6 servings of Hotcakes with sausage, Sausage biscuits, Bacon biscuits, Egg and Cheese biscuits, and 3 orders of Hash Browns. She dove into them, eating them without problem. After she finished the massive stuffing meal of over 5000 calories, she didn't even wait to dig into the massive pack of 10 cheetos. She ate through them right to lunch, until the girls took her out to an Italian restaurant where she ate about 5-6 plates of Alfredo Pasta. Afterwards, she returned to her suitcase and kept eating right on to lunch, scarfing down a massive amount of Lays Potato Chips bags until Supper, which she spent gorging with Brooke, Melissa, and Jessica at a Steakhouse. As the night of gorging finished, Hannah, her clothes and things pre-packed, boarded her plane to South Carolina and the flight continued. She sled asleep in her seat as the plane flew by in the whirring stillness of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the morning came up over Rock Hill, South Carolina, the bundles of pine forests and leafy trees, still bearing orange and red-hued leaves. The trees gave Hannah a comfort, a reminder of her days as a child, bringing back some of the best memories. Eating strawberries in the forest in picnics, dates with Evan before distance and lack of interest on both ends had broken them up, She exited the massive plane and looked out. There in the distance was her mother; A rather heavy woman herself, with about 50 pounds on Hannah. Her blonde had faded as her old age advanced, and only a few tinges remained in the advancing grey. \"Hannah!\"  Hannah extended her arms, wrapping them around what she could of her mother. \"Ah, Hannah, it's great to see ya!\" Hannah patted her mother on the back. \"Good to see you too ma!\" The two heavier women started waddling back to her mother's car. Her mother eyed her body. \"So, I see you've changed a bit, Hannah.\" Hannah nodded. \"Yep. I gave up the whole 'health kick' thing, and with the crowd at the office being full of bigger girls, and, well..\" She waved her hands over her enlarged body. \"Heck, let's call a hat and hat and say that I got fat.\" Her mother nodded, chuckling. \"I told ya you couldn't stave it off forever. Female side has a history of gettin' fat.\"  The car ride was ridden with tales of her misadventures with the girls, the office work, funny stories about different Co-Workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she arrived at the house out in the country, near some to-be-harvested cotton fields, dotting the landscape near her house like a field of clouds, not to mention the vast acres of soy her mother'd driven by. She arrived at the moderately sized house, ringed by woods. She entered the house to the greeting of multiple family members, whom she'd shared her stories with. Of course, there came the whispers she couldn't hear amidst conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord, she butterballed up. I remember her being a lot slimmer than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god, how did she get so <b><i>fat</i></b>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohp, looks like the Female McKinney curse hit Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked out her favorite spot: A bed close to the ground, strong and wide, in one of the front rooms facing the road. As night fell, and all fell asleep, Hannah's stomach roared in dissatisfaction in the fact that it was not being glutted with a trove of food. Hannah tried to stave it off, trying to think about it. The dilemma puzzled her, but...</span></div></div>",

It had a vast number of tables and chairs, with a large table. She knew exactly where the Ice Cream was, but oddly enough, she found some set out on top of the freezer. She saw a note laying on top of the vast, white, square freezer beside the ice cream, and she realized it as being written in her mother's writing.<br>\r\n\"Dear Hannah-<br>\r\nIf you're anything like me, I know for a fact that you're starving. Happy Thanksgiving!\"-Mama\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah grinned like mad. Her mother even had the courtesy of buying her favorite flavor: Orange Sherbet. Hannah quietly grabbed a spoon and sat down at the table, and gorged like a woman gone mad on the gallon of rich, orange deliciousness. She didn't moan, but she constantly gave looks of satisfied, porky greed at the Ice Cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished, the Ice cream slid down her gullet, but her stomach growled for more. It didn't occur to her that she would be depriving some of the kids from Ice Cream, she simply dove into the freezer as sneaky as the piggish blonde could, and fetched another gallon of the Orange Sherbet. She dove through it, eating through it like a woman gone mad, as though she depended on ice cream instead of air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished, her stomach kept growling, the Pavlovian response bred in: If it growled, it would recieve food, and frankly, it simply wanted more food for the sake of eating. Hannah ate through the entire freezer's worth of ice cream and, realizing the evidence'd be discovered, went to her suitcase, unzipped it, and took out a few gallons she'd not gone through at the office, and re-froze them. She brought them to the freezer, put them in, and got back to bed, and fell soundly asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning came early, as the smell of fresh-brewed coffee rolled through the house. Nobody checked the freezer; Everything had gone as planned for Hannah, as she got a mug of the strong coffee and sat with her relatives who relished in the strong, black brew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 12:00 Approached..</span></div></div>",

She could now safely wait to enjoy an enormous thanksgiving feast with her family. Although she found that to not be any easier for her. Her belly rumbled and begged as it was so unfairly teased by the delicious smells emanating from the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother really knew how to cook (her flabby figure was evidence of her vast cooking experience), so Hannah was very pleased to hear her mom would be in charge of preparing this years feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah clutched her plump belly which was aching from its emptiness. She so desperately wanted to go to the fridge and grab a snack, anything to deal with her hunger, but she knew it would pay off if she waited until food was served. Her mom said it would only be a few more minutes anyway. Although every minute seemed to last an eternity as she waited along with her many aunts uncles and cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her mother announced that thanksgiving dinner (or late lunch really) was served. Everyone rushed into the dining room and took their seats. Hannah\u2019s grandmother made sure grace was said before the eating commenced, much to everyone\u2019s (Hannah\u2019s especially) frustration. Eventually though there was nothing that could delay the feast and a gravy covered frenzy occurred as everyone piled food onto their plate. None moved quite as fast as Hannah though, who felt like she might die if she didn\u2019t put something in her groaning gut. She had made a mountain of food on her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few weeks of gorging with her friends had prepared her well for this moment. Even if she was still nowhere as big as Jessica, Melissa, or even her Mom, she had learned to eat as well as any of them. She ate so much her bloated tummy started to rub against the table. Her sweater was pushed up her belly revealing her deep navel. She pulled her skirt down to let her gut have more room as it sat on her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany plates later Hannah finally stopped. Pretty much everyone had stopped eating a while ago, except her mom. Some had even left the table. Hannah licked her gravy covered lips and let out a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHannah *gulp* don\u2019t do that at the *munch* table.\u201d Her mother said through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s thanksgiving. That\u2019s just a sign of a good meal.\u201d Hannah\u2019s uncle Jim said. Everyone at the table chuckled, except for Hannah. She sat back massaging her partially naked belly. The only sounds coming out of her mouth were burps and moans as she eased her stuffed gut.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her binging steadily increased, as she joined Jessica. In the period between the two breaks, Jessica, Brooke and Hannah teamed up to especially pack on the pounds. Jessica had hit 450 by the beginning of the break, as Brooke had broken 300 and hit 320, and Hannah had shot up beyond expectations, hitting 280 by christmas break, shooting up behind Brooke, her binge eating acting like rocket fuel propelling her gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe annual Christmas Party had come around on the beginning of Christmas Break, and the whale-like women waddled in. Red-headed Jessica's belly swelled like an over-bloated exercise ball had been jammed on top of an already-chubby belly, with breasts to match and a buttocks to prop it all up. Brooke's weight had gone to a similar area, and she looked like a shorter-haired, blonde Jessica. Hannah looked like a longer-haired brooke from about right after thanksgiving break. Her old buttons had long since been popped and ripped, and she'd made George a pretty penny before she got this new one. There was something deep inside that turned her on about being out-of-breath and snapping these buttons with her blubber. It made her feel big, like a destructive godzilla-like monster. The destruction of the clothing through her rapid, blubbery expansion gave her great delight and she'd find herself leaning back in her chair often leaning back trying, intentionally, to pop the buttons, making her feel like her own goddess of destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe christmas trees sat around, all emblazoned with the sentimental feeling and lights all abound with the typical red and green lights, the tacky, replayed christmas music coming over the loudspeakers in the large meeting room. The three waddled in, and near the corner there was a grouping of seats, all triple-strength to hold women of their weights. The women all set their things down at the table, Brooke wearing a long, shimmery blue dress that showed off her curved, bulging belly. Jessica wore a long white dress, also showing off her curves. Hannah wore a similar garment, hers being black. Once the women had set their things down, they looked at the array of activities. There was Guitar Hero, Xbox games, and of course, there was the food. They looked on it all and decided...</span></div></div>",

There were quite a few heavy heifers already gathering around the food spread, but there wasn\u2019t really any threat of it running out. The office always went the extra mile with food for these office parties. It wasn\u2019t particularly surprising given how many obese women populated the Gordge offices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway Hannah, Brooke and Jessica all made their way to the long line of tables covered in food. They weren\u2019t the only ones with their appetites on their mind. Courtney, Melissa, Vanessa, and Jenna were already piling food atop their plates. Looking at the enormous amount of delicious food, Hannah knew they had made the right decision. She bit her lip as she felt an almost sexual pleasure from the thought of how much she was going to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral local restaurants were catering the event allowing for Hannah to create the most heavenly combinations of delicious (and fattening) foods. The party quickly became a gorging session for the largest and most gluttonous employees of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah grabbed a piece of fried chicken with one hand and a slice of pizza with the other as she continued to stuff her face. Her taste buds were overwhelmed by all the mouthwatering flavors she was biting into. She added a whole new kind of pleasure to her eating as with every plate Hannah tried to come up with a different combination. <i>French fries in my spaghetti? Why not?... Should I put cheese on my hot dog? Ooh, how about mac and cheese on a hot dog\u2026 Who needs burger buns when I can just use two jelly doughnuts? I should be working for Dunkin Donuts.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Hannah, Brooke and Jessica also gorged themselves silly. Their bellies growing bellies pressed tightly against their dresses. Towards the end of the party their incredible devouring had slowed down as they were finally starting to feel full. Hannah had stopped a few minutes before. She leaned back in her groaning chair, rubbing her painfully full belly. She was pretty uncomfortable as her packed stomach tried to digest the greasy contents of her feast, but she didn\u2019t regret it as her face was flushed and her eyes glazed over from the awesome pleasure of the delectable stuffing session. Jessica finally stopped and pushed her empty plate away. The 400+ pound blimp of a woman backed up her chair to stop her enormous belly from rubbing against the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brooke was still going though. She was really outdoing herself with the incredible amount of food she was packing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, *burp* don\u2019t hurt yourself there, Brooke.\u201d Hannah joked watching her friend gorge herself. Brooke\u2019s belly was incredibly bloated. There were small creaking a tearing sounds coming from her tight dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha *urrp* What am I *munch* going to do, pop?\u201d Brooke joked. Just then her dress burst apart as her belly ripped right through the fabric. There was an almost perfect whole in the dress where her enormous gut surged out of, spreading freely over her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke blushed with embarrassment, but decided to just keep eating instead.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They nabbed a seat close to the kitchen, a table. The girls knew better, all of them 300+ pounds, than to sit in a cramped booth and force the workers to have to yank them out. They sat in their chairs, and for a bit, there was silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their drinks were ordered: Almost all cokes, Jessica was the first to break the silence. \"How's your break been, Han?\" Hannah giggled and replied. \"Fattening.\" Brooke and Jessica chortled, making their expansive stomachs roll. \"Same here.\" spoke Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly was true; The girls had been packing on the pounds. Brooke had hit 350 in the week following, Jessica had hit 480, and Hannah had busted the big 300, landing on 310. Hannah spoke. \"Yeah, and I have to say, I've been happier since I've gotten off my Health kick and gotten on my Fat kick.

I ended up hating it and just dropping it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation carried on well until the women saw their delights coming: Brooke ordered an entire personal pizza and a group serving of Shrimp Mozambique. Jess ordered TWO personal pizzas, with a plate of simple spaghetti, with sauce and meatballs. Hannah ordered two group servings of Fettucine Alfredo, drenched in decadent cheese sauce. The blubbery women dug into the meal, ripping the noodles and pizzas apart, alternating them for sips of their drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal carried on for the next hour, and our ladies' bellies had teased the table. The women were still not done, barely half finished with their massive portions. That was one thing they liked: The big portions for the big people. It was no secret that La Bellisima catered to larger clients, as almost exclusively everyone eating there was either an athlete on a carb load, or the obese. The women exhaustingly ate through their plates: Jessica was damn near dead from the effort she put into the feast. Brooke was sweating as though she were back in Dance team practice. Hannah was starting to sweat considerably, but nowhere near the amounts of raining sweat that Brooke and especially Jessica were putting into eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the battle with the food ended and our plump Valkyries emerged victorious over the food, their bellies stuffed, they heard the groan of one of their metal chairs...</span></div></div>",

As she struggled to shift her massive body the creaking sound from her chair intensified. Suddenly the legs gave out sending Jess\u2019s incredible blubber crashing to the floor. The obese whale yelped as her enormously round bottom hit the ground with a thud. The room seemed to shake as the almost 500 pound woman was grounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the restaurant looked over at the loud commotion caused by the beached whale. Hannah and Brooke would\u2019ve gotten up to help their friend if their bellies weren\u2019t so full and sensitive. Brooke halfheartedly tried to get out of her chair but couldn\u2019t handle the discomfort of moving her packed tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica lay on her back, her enormous gut sticking up in the air like a doughy dome. A few of the waiters rushed over to help. Two of them grabbed Jessica and lifted her up. It took a few tries but slowly Jess\u2019s obese blubber was on her feet. Another waiter brought over another chair. This chair was specially made for the largest customers at La Bellisima, with a wide seat and much sturdier legs. Jessica was guided onto the extra padded seat. She was breathing heavily and sweating from embarrassment and exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who *burp* wants dessert?\u201d Hannah said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I feel so embarassed, I haven't broken a chair before. I know I've been putting on weight, but I don't think I've been getting that fat. And my doc told me I'm morbidly obese..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brooke waved her hand, as to almost try to swat down the invisible stream of worries. \"Pshh. Those quacks don't know their hind-ends from a hole in the ground. Jessica spoke. \"Yeah, but my grandma and my momma died of a heart attack. My doctor says that if I don't drop some of these pounds soon, I'm going down the same road, I'm really scared about that, he said that I'm at high risk even being 40 BMI. My last check up, I was 73 BMI, he says that I need to start soon, or he estimates about, like, a month before...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke hugged her. \"Honey, honey, calm down. She's being overdramatic. But if you're really that convinced, then I know a gym I used to go to when I cared about being in shape.\" Jess nodded. Her fears were calmed by the embrace of a friend as the blubbery trio entered the car and Hannah began moving to the driver's seat. Brooke spoke. \"Well if your doctor thought your lifespan was short before, it's about to get even shorter.\" Hannah turned and spoke. \"Shut up, your belly rubs against the wheel.\" Brooke spoke. \"I still drive better.\" Hannah jokingly threw the receipt at Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio drove home to Jess' house. While the embarrassed redheaded whale waddled off to bed. Hannah and Brooke relaxed and watched some T.V for a bit, gorged on some Ice Cream, and drove back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning light shone through the wide, expansive windows of the gym. A man in a tank top and in <br>\r\n\"Quite some damage.\" the instructor said. \"Well, that's just fine, 480 pounds. I've helped out people with worse weights.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular blonde man raised an eyebrow. \"Not trying to criticize you, but at this point, most women give up. What's got you here?\"  Jessica nodded. \"Well, I broke a chair at La Bellisima, and the day prior, I got a health checkup and found out my BMI was 73 and within about a month, if I don't change my diet or exercise, doc's predicting a heart attack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular man nodded. \"Hmm. So, what's your daily exercise routine?\" Jessica nodded and chuckled. \"Uh....Does 'Nothing' Constitute an answer?\" The trainer chuckled. \"Uh huh, well, that's changing. We'll do our standard evaluation. Lay down on that mat for me, Jessica.\" The whale-like redhead laid down on the large blue mat. The trainer spoke. \"Start doing some crunches.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese redhead gripped the back of her head, and began doing it. The first three were effortless, but after this, she began encountering some resistance. She got out of breath at about 8, and she absolutely stopped as her determination gave out at about 14. She laid out on the mat, gasping for breath. The trainer spoke, getting his water bottle and giving some to the fat woman. \"Okay, so your exercise tolerance is very low. We'll work on that.\" Jessica felt like shit, but she felt like progress was coming.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s really sticking with this weight loss thing.\u201d Hannah responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell more eating for us I guess. Let\u2019s get drive thru before your place.\u201d Brooke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped at several fast food drive thru\u2019s on their way to Hannah\u2019s apartment, accumulating quite the greasy feast. They grabbed their food and waddled into Hannah\u2019s place. Dropping their stuff on the coffee table they both sat in her living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how was your Christmas?\u201d Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Went to my parents\u2019 house. I pigged out sooooo much.\u201d Brooke said grabbing her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I was all by myself for Christmas eve.

They\u2019re the most comfortable lounge pants ever.\u201d Hannah said. The stretchy lounge pants fit loosely on Hannah\u2019s bulging bottom and thick thighs. Hannah\u2019s Mom definitely was predicting the future with just how large a size she ordered for her ballooning daughter. Hannah had plenty of room in the large stretchy waistband (something all of her current wardrobe lacked). \u201cThese are going to be my new fat pants for a while.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t all your pants technically fat pants now?\u201d Brooke joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 haha I guess that\u2019s kind of true.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you\u2019ve really been putting that belly to work recently. No more skinny Hannah.\u201d Brooke teasingly poked Hannah\u2019s plump stomach fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like it better this way. I wouldn\u2019t change my body at all, well except for adding even more to it. Speaking of which lets dig in.\u201d Hannah said as they started eating their fast food. Hannah loved her new state of fatness. She had found completely new and unique pleasures in stuffing her belly and watching her flabby body grow. All the delicious food she consumed daily, watching buttons pop and clothes tear, it was all part of Hannah\u2019s new favorite hobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke worked her way through a bucket of KFC while Hannah alternated bites from the burgers she held in each hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours and two pizza and Chinese food deliveries later and Hannah and Brooke were stuffed. Hannah clutched her swollen gut in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chaha I *burp* look soooo fat.\u201d Hannah moaned with pleasure, feeling just how full and bloated her middle was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust think right now Jess is probably doing sit ups and torturing herself on the treadmill.\u201d Brooke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah licked her fingers and purred. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re *burp* doing this instead.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The trainer had her slowly build up her cardio endurance and it felt like a kind of sweet purgation, disregarding the pain and the burning she experienced. She'd lost about 3 pounds so far, and she was trying to stick to it. She ate a small lunch: Salad and a sandwich, with a diet coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good enough meal, but at that moment, the memories of the sweet, succulent, fattening meals from before rushed in. She tried to shake her head and rid herself of the sinfully delectable treats she had consumed. She repeated to herself mentally that she was getting healthy now, and that once she'd dropped some weight, she could MAYBE come back to the treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept eating through her lunch, delighted. As she finished it, her doorbell rang. She went to open it, and outside sat a box with a note. She picked it up, shut the door from the charging cold before it could batter through the open space, and she set the note aside. First, she opened the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was assaulted with the amazing smell of a hot, chocolate lava cake, with creamy, thick chocolate sauce in the middle of the round, chocolate treat. It was heaven but hell for the fat woman. Heaven in the sights and smells, but hell in that she couldn't have it. The note sat on the side. \"Hey Jess! We know you're on the whole diet thing but we thought we'd let you have your cheat day today! Haha love ya! -brooke &amp; hannah\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lardy women drove away from their ding-dong-ditch of cake. The already-stuffed blondes conversed. Brooke opened up the Conversation. \"I feel so naughty for trying to get Jessica to get off her diet, kinda like we're pulling a prank.\" Hannah nodded. \"Oh, you don't know the half of it yet. If this cake doesn't batter down her willpower, when we get back to work on Monday, I'm going to piledrive her \"diet\" phase into the dust.\" Brooke chuckled in recognition. \"That'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the house, Jessica held the box aloft as she walked to the kitchen with it. She stared at the treat, almost calling her name as to say \"You do not need your diet...You just need me...\" But she tried to shake off the warnings. She had to prove to herself she wasn't just an eating machine who did nothing but eat and get fatter, eat and get fatter, eat and get fatter. She had to prove to herself she had some form of control over what she ate, over her life, over her weight. From an early age her appetite had gotten the better of her constantly. She had occasionally thought of diets and exercise, but only stuck to them for one or two days. But the siren call of the fattening, sinful, almost seemingly deadly cake called to her. It was an anathema but a lure, a hatred but a love, two warring sides of her body in her. Her willpower was straining at this point, remindingly like her chair that had snapped last week.

Of course, sticking out above them all were Hannah, Brooke, and Jess. The smell of coffee was strong in the air: The lifeblood of the office worker was especially needed on this day after the break, especially to the blimped forms of Hannah and Brooke, both of whom carried their cups in one hand, and their suitcases in the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated women proceeded to the elevators, upgraded for excesses of 1,000 pounds. All except for Jessica. She seemed intent on taking the stairs, usually an alien concept to her. The stairs were more surmountable than previously, but they were still a challenge to her nearly 500 pound frame. By not even the finish of the first flight, she was sweating up a storm. But before, one time when the elevators were broken, she had a specific memory of feeling like her lungs would give out by not even the finish of the first flight. She carried her lunch with her: A simple chicken salad. She didn't expect to eat much, as her trainer told her to eat less during the workday, at such a sedentary job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor porky whale had no clue what was to befall her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and Brooke proceeded past Jessica, and they spoke to her. \"Hey Jess! We heard about the whole diet thing, how's that working?\" Jessica huffed her reply. \"Oh..*Huff*..It's been..*Wheeze*..Good...ohgod..*Huff*...Thanks for..*Wheeze*..The cake..\" Brooke just smiled, and spoke. \"Well, we got to get working. See ya at breaktime, Jess!\" They proceeded to their offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke and Hannah and the rest consumed their usual metric mouth-ton of Cheetos, Pepsi, and Chips. At 10, Hannah and Brooke made the excuse that she got an urgent call from their friend at the gas station, when in reality, she ran out to buy a massive chocolate cake. The thing was as heavy as expected, and thei had gotten back by 12. Perfectly timed, it turned out, as Brooke had gotten back about that time with the three bags of super-sized fries, and the bag of triple cheeseburgers, every bag packed to bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sat back at her desk, and she took out her chicken salad. She dove into it with the rabid hunger of a dieting fat girl waiting for lunchtime. Which, coincidentally, she was. She finished it in a matter of seconds. She sat back and tried not to think about her stash of snacks. Suddenly, from behind the corner, Brooke's head appeared. \"Heeey, Jess! I packed a bunch of food for lunch, but I filled up on snacks and I'll just keep snacking on through the day. I hope you'll like my food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stuttered forth the beginnings of a reply, intending to refuse. \"Well, uh, that's nice, and uh, thanks-\" She was immediately cut off, Brooke saying \"You're welcome!\" Brooke began stacking the four bags on top of Jessica's desk. Jessica stared in awe and wonder at the bags of food. At that time, Hannah peered around the corner. \"Hey, Jess! I thought I'd bring you something to cheer you up from the workday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stared at the mountain of fattening food. The incident of yesterday's failing of willpower came back guiltily to her mind, but the taste of the cake came back as she stared at the new delicious monstrosity of Red Velvet, splayed out before her behind the wall of bags.

She wasn\u2019t sure what they were but they smelled really good. She hesitated, thinking about what her trainer would say if he saw what she was doing. But thinking about how good that cake was, she didn\u2019t care about her stupid trainer or anything else. She just wanted to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ecstatic to find the bags overflowing with French fries and burgers. She greedily shoveled fries into her mouth. Emptying three of the bags into her belly. Her gut was so bloated after the hundred or so fries she just ate. She had lost tow buttons on her blouse as her swollen tummy pushed out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved onto the bag of burgers. There must have been at least 10 cheeseburgers in it. Lie an absolute pig she kept stuffing her face with food even though she could feel her stomach starting to hurt. Her chair creaked as she shifted her enormously obese body closer to the burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the last bag was empty and her indulgence was over. Jessica certainly felt bad but it didn\u2019t matter since she also felt so good. She had forgotten why she loved being fat so much. Feeling all that delicious food packed into her midsection gave her such pleasure. She felt so fat as she noticed the sweat coating her naked double belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hadn\u2019t eaten like that in a while and she had missed having her massive binges.

She turned her eye to her ever-present mini-fridge full of drinks and snacks. She reached for it with her dangling, flabby arms jiggling, and she strained to no avail, to try to reach it without getting up. <i>Damn it,</i> she thought.<i> Now I gotta get up.</i><br>\r\nThe porky blonde put her sausage-like fingers around the thick iron of the armrests, trying to push herself up and she used her feet to attempt to shove herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that seemed to be happening, was that her blubber strained against the metal chair and her arms burned in the intense effort. Brooke spoke aloud. \"What the..\" She began attempting to heave herself up, but all that happened was her forehead began to drizzle sweat and she produced a futile 'Nnnnnnngh..' as she attempted to heave her porcine form out of the chair, but only produced sweat and huffs. \"You've got to be...NNnnnnnnngh...*Huff*...Kidding...Me...\" she spoke as she attempted to heave herself out of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implications about her weight were of no concern.

And she didn't want someone gripping her stomach and trying to heave her out of this chair. And it was going to keep getting stuck, it wasn't just this one time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, she calmly and deliberately leaned forward as to be \"standing up\", the chair still attached to her, rear, and then sat, with force, producing the intended effect: The chair crumbled into pieces. THEN Brooke had time to think about her weight dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought that she needed to invest in some bigger chairs, because she sure as HELL wasn't going to torture herself with exercise and dieting. She knew that if she gets stuck in chairs, she's too fat to exercise, and a little dieting isn't going to take all her fat away. As such, she waddled away, retrieved a spare steel chair, sat down slowly in it, as it groaned and creaked its protest to her 350 pound mass, grabbed her damn cheetos and a drink, and wallowed in her gluttony.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jessica was leading the pack: Despite her gorging earlier today, her workouts started to show some form of progress on her ability to move. \"Hold up..Jess.*Huff*..\" wheezed Brooke and Hannah alternatively. Jessica nodded. \"Alright, okay..\" And she slowed back to the crawling pace of Hannah and Brooke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun hung lazily and exhaustedly in the rim of the sky, as the moon began standing up from its position in the opposing half, as the pod of whale-like women waddled into the waiting La Bellissima. Jessica spoke. \"By the way guys, If you don't mind, after this I've got to run..Literally.\" Hannah spoke. \"Yeah, yeah..*wheeze*..Sure thing, miss..*huff* \"I'm in shape..\"*pant*..Jenny Craig..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio stood in the warm reception of the waiting wooden area, as the multitudes of lardy guests sat and dined on the rich, saucy foods around them. A rather chubby, yet not yet plump waitress began guiding them to a table reserved for some of the heavier members of La Bellissima, with sturdier chairs with luxurious armrests, lower to the ground, and closer to the kitchen.  The trio were hardly the fattest customers, but they were among the top 25 percent of them. The heaviest ever served by La Bellissima was a woman sitting at about 840, who needed to be hauled in through the Cargo entrance, and fed there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump group took their seats and all made their orders.  Brooke stepped up her order to Hannah's serving levels. She had a renewed determination as she had the fat girl realization that usually happens. only she didn't go through any form of athleticism, and had gone whole hog with her gaining, both getting party sized-plates of cheesy-sauced pasta. Jessica, however, was still intent on trying to stick with her diet. She'd already gorged today and if she kept breaking her diet, it'd fall down on itself. She ordered a light salad and a small serving of pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal passed without much conversation: Jessica wanted to speak, but the two bloated blondes near her were too busy eating their lives away. The waitress approached. \"So, are we all done here?\" Hannah spoke. \"Actually, we'd like some dessert.\" Jessica looked nervously at the table. Hannah spoke. \"I'll have the Monstrissima brownie.\" Brooke raised her multi-chinned head, and spoke. \"I'll order a large vanilla gelato bowl, with chocolate syrup.\" The waitress turned her head to Jessica.

While Brooke and Hannah waddled over to the movie theater to watch a movie and gorge on popcorn, Jessica went off for a jog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air rushed past her face, and for the first quarter of a mile she was doing good. As the distance gradually increased, Jessica began sweating like a hog, but she kept going. When she hit a wall, she looked down and saw her jiggling, bouncing mass, and reminded her of her past gluttonies, of the image of herself lethargically sitting in her office, surrounded by mountains of snacks with crumbs rolling down her fat and even more being hurled down her lardy, blubbery throat. She was done, and the determination had kicked in. Before, she would have given up at step one and gone back to gorge at La Bellissima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was a new Jessica. Her expedition went on for another, amazingly enough, 3 miles, before she stopped to sit on a bench, to relax. The night was young yet, and she had a feeling that she'd get energy to get going again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree months passed at the office with quite some change. Rob had been fired due to evidence of tampering with Corporate Funds, and Jessica was promoted. Jessica had actually dropped about some 50 pounds in the past three months in keeping with her diet. Her belly had shrunk regardably, and her body in general had gotten smaller. She was about 421 pounds, in her last weigh-in. She had even more ambitious plans, to drop even further by year's end, possibly to even get skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Brooke and Hannah's old plan to renew Jessica's Weight gain had been revived recently. They'd ask Jessica to come by for lunch, but Jess would simply reply that she's busy working. And afterwards they'd call her to have dinner, but she'd reply that she was working out. Brooke and Hannah's constant eating and snacking had drastic effects on their waists, in other words, an expanding one. Brooke had broken the 400 marker, landing squarely on 402, and Hannah was just before it, at 395. The women spent a good majority of their working day snacking at their desks while working, or gorging in the break room. They were done attempting to break Jess' diet by invitation, they would do it, one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich explained why they came back with enough McDonald's bags to feed a football team after a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sat in her office, and saw the women waddle in. \"Hey Jess! We know you must be starving, so we dropped by to give you some lunch!\" Jessica shook her head. \"Well, guys, that's nice, but you know I'm trying to lose weight.\" Brooke put on her best pouty face. \"Awww, but Jeeeeesssss, we got this all for you, hon!\" Hannah replied in like. \"Yeaaaah, c'mon Jeeeessss.\" Jessica sighed. \"Fine.\" The blubbery blondes deposited the ocean of food off, and speedily exited to their own pizza gorging cave within the Break Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at the bags. Every single one had been super-sized: Ten bags full of nothing but fries, Five full of 40 order chicken nuggets, and 5 more full of Big Mac's. Doing some rough math, the meal could have been nothing less than 60,000 calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach faced with temptation, could not resist it. And her stomach resumed control over her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, with almost nothing on her schedule, had the whole day to eat. And the whole day she planned to spend eating this meal. She spread the fries out into a gargantuan pile, and piled out the nuggets and burgers on either other side. She dove her face into the mount of fries, gobbling masses of salty fries. If one wasn't looking, one could literally have mistaken the sound for that of a hog eating. Because this was an exact replication of that sound: The sound of pure gluttony. Jessica withdrew her head once she'd glutted herself on quite a few of the fries, but the pile had barely even dropped. She panted and wheezed as she hadn't done in her most intense workouts.  But once she'd gotten her breath back, she dove back in, gobbling the fries with wild abandon. Her past sense of moderation had been slain by her dormant desire for gluttony. She'd gone back into the pile with more determination than she'd had on her diet, keeping her head in the pile for the next full hour, putting a good dent in it. As she withdrew for the next air break, she reached down for the fatty Big Macs and Chicken, next focusing herself on this great feat of eating. She finished half of this as she committed back to the fries, reducing them down to 1/2. While everyone else was on their lunch break, they passed Jessica's office, not inquiring about the mound of food. Jessica worked on the remainder of the fries, and as the day hit the 3/4ths mark, they had vanished from the desk, save for a few crumbs. Jessica went on finishing the other half of the Big Macs and the chicken, sometimes venturing to stuff one inside the other in a grand display of gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished, closing time was a mere 4 minutes away. She leaned back in her chair, suddenly hearing a 'CrrrrRRRRCK' as the chair's back gave out, and as did the chair itself. Mid-fall, the bloated blimp assaulted the ceiling with a barrage of snapping buttons: Every single shirt button, her tight pants button, and as she hit the ground, her pants burst from their inability to contain Jessica's lardy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bloated redhead lay there, coated in a lake of sweat and a layer of salty, heart-killing foods, she had to contemplate on whether or not she was truly on a diet anymore. She decided...</span></div></div>",

Porky Pam's was the favored destination for both: A. It was a buffet, which Hannah adored, and B, it had barbecue, which Brooke nigh-worshiped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two blubbery blondes were forced to wriggle their ways into a booth, as the tables were taken up by the regular weekend crowd. The booth allotted for them to get out for the moment, but they knew that would change rapidly. They had the employees notified that when they stuffed themselves to the point of inability to leave the booth, they would need plates retrieved for them. As they returned with their first course of many, they began conversingn. Particularly, about Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah opened up the first shots of the conversation. \"Yeah, I wonder how fat Jess'll get once she's off her diet.\" Brooke chuckled. \"Hon, after 15 bags of McDonalds, I think she's off her diet.\" Hannah gave a devilish chuckle. \"No thanks to us, heh.\" Brooke spoke. \"I feel so naughty, but so good at the same time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how much do you think miss redhead dropped on that diet?\" Brooke shrugged, and spoke. \"At a liberal estimate, I'd say sixty, seventy five. At a realistic estimate? thirty.\" Hannah spoke. \"She's dropped a lot. That'll change, though, now that new Jess is probably back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about that moment, Jessica entered. \"Speak of the devil.\" spoke Brooke. The blubbery redhead, sweaty from the short walk from within, showed that the meal had immediate effects. Though some of those 60,000 calories had been burned off by moving, that still constituted a gain of approximately 20 pounds, and she had gained 5 more in the next week, leading up to this bright Saturday morning. She was wearing a peach-colored shirt, with an overly-tight camisole underneath, causing fat to mushroom and puff out from the top of her body, especially true of the area of fat beneath her armpits, fat leaking out, and heaving with each breath. The poor camisole seemed as though it was fit to burst. The blubbery redhead was also forced to sit in a booth on the far side of the restaurant., but the difference being, she was straightaway stuck within, thus her server being forced to ferry food back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke and Hannah reached this point rather soon: Their bellies wedged firmly against the table. Jessica, however, had long gone beyond this point. Her blubber was firmly jammed against the booth, and her absolutely strained camisole had burst. She had gone beyond thirds, fourths, and fifths, and had gone on to sevenths. She was eating almost in almost an olympic manner, eating as though it were her job. Massive amounts of ribs, mashed potatoes, fatback, rice, gravy, chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hannah and Brooke had stopped, however, at the point where the employees could haul them out. Jessica had no such sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica kept eating and eating, and eating, and eating, and by the point Hannah and Brooke had reached eigth plates, and had hit the very end of their stomachs, Jessica had gone onto twentieths. She was sweating a storm, drinking like a race-winning runner, the sweat staining her shirt. Even her 6X-large shirt was showing strain. Her stomach was completely packed to bursting, every inch felt full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was the simple problem of the table: Her stomach was leaking onto, and over it, and she literally could not move. Quite the pickle miss Jessica was in. \"Uh, Ma'am?\" Jessica waved her hand. \"I'm...*Pant*..Good..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis insane woman simply kept eating: It was only 2:20, and by the time that 7:30 had arrived, she had the workers get her 30 more plates of food. By this point, she literally could not fit any more food into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the booth's table had been literally unable to withstand any more. So had Jessica's conciousness given as well.  As the table broke, Jessica fell down to the couch, and passed right out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the whale woke up, she was surrounded by the walls of an ambulance. After another three hours, all seemed to check out, except for a massively excellerated blood pressure of about 156, and an increased heart rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day's work brought plenty of gossip about the whale who broke a booth, and the end of Jessica's dieting phase. <br>\r\nThe end of Jessica's Diet, of course, would bring the pounds coming back, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile Brooke currently weighed in at about 450 pounds with Hannah just below her at 420 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three whale-sized women had gotten together for one of their gluttonous group lunches at one of the mall's food courts. They just barely managed to find a table large enough for all three of them, and all three ladies had to use two double-wide, metallic chairs to fit their massive rears. For Jess though, even two of these sturdy chairs were a bit inadequate as her vast, wobbly butt hung over the edges slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours into their meal, everyone seems rather full and they casually begin conversing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that *urp* buffet was s-so *pant* good I couldn't eat *pant* a-another *urp* bite...\" Jessica said as she leaned back heavily, her stomach so full it was a bit hard to breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smirks and reaches over to playfully pat Jessica's massive, bulging gut, teasing her  <br>\r\n\"Well don't over do it, you're *urp* getting pretty big Jess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke giggled as she rubbed her own full belly, making her own comment.  \"Yeah, i think this *Buuurrp!* is the heaviest you've been yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess then smiled and teasingly poked Hannah's fat belly peeking out of her tight shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush *urrp!* Like you two can talk!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day was long and dull, and the only way the three could stay awake today was by gorging on more than usual. Jess stepped it up to 3 bags of chips per hour, and Brooke had stepped up to 5 mini-donuts per half hour, which she'd trained to eat in one bite. Hannah had to keep awake with about 3 bags of cheetos per hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was also chock-filled with paperwork: Those cheetos, chips, and mini-donuts had to come from somewhere, and where they came from, needed paperwork to make sure the company actually bought them. Hannah had no clue why they needed to make sure they actually had them: She had crumbs on her blouse, didn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about her blouse, she checked, and it began riding up from her stomach, revealing her generous lower belly. She pulled it down: Soon enough she'd have to make another trip to george. She had been intending to check up on her gains anyways: She wanted to know how close she was to 500. She thought back on her old life as a health freak, and wondered why in god's name she'd ever want to go back to being a skinny, joyless, stuck-up health nut. She never enjoyed eating at all back then, and now she did. She was glad she had gone to \"The dark side\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finally filled out the last item: 1 industrial sized crate of Cheetos, and 6 party-sized bags of Lays BBQ. She had to but pen her signature and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the daunting walk to the filing cabinet. She had to get up, and for that reason she groaned and then slowly got up, her blouse starting to ride up again. She rolled it down again over her huge belly.as she started walking towards the filing cabinet. After leaving her office, she began sweating and panting not even 2 offices after hers, and the filing cabinets turned out to be 12 offices down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step forward proved to be more of a challenge, and she remembered that this was the same walk she made months upon months before, when she pondered the life of the fatter woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had pondered it, and now she was living it. And mobility had proved to be one con of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for everything else, it proved to be a pro. She could eat whatever she wanted, and she could fulfill that primal urge to consume, that urge to fatten ones' self that has been embedded since the Ice Ages, when food was scarce. It felt good to indulge it, to give in and not even care about your diet. It was a fulfillment of her deep, buried urges that she wanted to let loose of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that appreciation was not felt as she had to sweat and pant through the hallway. As she finally approached the filing cabinet, she looked at the signs and her heart sank: The sign read \"TPS Reports and Policy Changes.\" A sign pointed right, down he hall, reading: \"Resource and Equipment logs\". Hannah turned and the other hallway was the longer side of the office block of this floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trudged down the hallway, already panting and sweating, but now moreso. It was torture, hell on earth. As she hit halfway through, she felt drained utterly,and her shirt had ridden up past her navel, the sweat rolling down slowly and sluggishly. The hallway proceeded a little bit more, she was almost there. As she finally reached the filing cabinets, she jammed it into the nearest cabinet and began attempting to walk back, simply leaving the drawer open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't make it even halfway back before everything started going black. Hannah panted and tried to slow down, but she was already as slow as she could be. She trudged to a snail's pace and finally made it back to the halfway mark of that hall before she collapsed with a loud 'Thud'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke in the hospital, looking around. The doctor stood at the head of her bed. \"Ah, miss Laurens. You're awake. You seem to have overexerted yourself and passed out from the exertion. You seem to be getting to the point where mobility's an issue for you.\" Hannah nodded. \"Come to think of it, I've had a lot of issues with mobility recently.\" The doctor nodded. \"It's a side effect of the level of obesity you've reached. I've had miss Jessica come in here when she hit about your weight, and I had to prescribe her a mobility scooter. I believe I'll have to prescribe you one of two things: A strict diet and exercise regimen, or a mobility scooter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah considered and weighed the two options. Would she go back to dieting and exercising to be able to walk down the hall? After a bit of deliberation, she answered...</span></div></div>",

If she went with losing enough weight to get around comfortably, then that means she'd need to limit her food intake and go back to torturing herself with small-portioned, tastless diet food, and exhausting, painful excercises. She wasn't even sure she could do most of them any more; she could barely take the exertion of WALKING let alone excercise! As she saw it, the mobility scooter option had more pros than cons, so she finally made her decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the mobility scooter.\" Hannah said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright miss Laurens, I'll give you the perscription and you can just take it in and get yourself a mobility scooter.

I heard you passed out yesterday and were rushed to the hospital\" Jess sounded concerned and very worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm fine. I just gotta not over exert myself. That's why I decided to get me one of these babies\" she pat the handlebars of her mobility scooter, \"but that's kinda what I wanted to talk to you about anyway; I remember the doctor saying he perscribed you one of these too, but I never see you use it...I was just curious why you don't and a little worried...you're not following a doctor's orders Jess...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed heavily, \"I'm fine Hannah. I don't use mine because I still want to walk around by myself and plus I figure I have a little more waddle left in me before I become immobile. That and well...honestly it MIGHT be too small for me now...I don't even know, it's been so long. But I'll see if I can fit in it and I'll start using it when I become immobile.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaannah looked a bit uncertain but nodded, understanding her friend's logic, \"Alright Jessie, if that's what you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her belly no longer sat comfortably in her lap, but now rolled aggressively towards the desk's edge. Its vast expanse had Jessica's pants unbuttoned, her underwear covered by her rolling stomach, which was nudging the edge of the desk, only because Jessica leant back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a peek at the clock, which shone that ever beautiful number: Five-O-Clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, goody</i>, thought the butterballed redhead. <i>Time to hit the road</i>! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up, the sheer effort of this leaving her panting and attempting to catch her breath. Now her belly was no longer content to tease the edge of the table, but the hyper-obese woman's stomach, which still bore the brunt of her weight gain, flooded over the edge and sat like a frozen wave, paused in time on the spacebar of her inactive keyboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat for a bit as the rest of the traffic cleared out of the hall. She decided to wait for the traffic to reside and finally, she put her hands on the armrests. She attempted to get up as usual, planting her feet on the ground as she attempted to haul her buttery ball of a body upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she shoved, her lardy, flabby, fatty arms jiggled and quivered, ineffective in any way or shap in attempting to haul her fat body up. \"Huh?\" she said aloud as she panted. She attempted again, trying with her legs. The ball of her heels didn't touch the ground, however, and the tip of her feet had nowhere near the strength needed to haul the 500+ pile pound of lard up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized this, and attempted to lean forward, but the mass of her belly refused to let her lean forward that far. She heaved and shoved, pushing and going as far as she could, but she ended up just exhausting herself as she resigned to falling back into the chair. She leaned back, panting while she reclined, and her stomach came back up to tickle the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gathered her strength for a second assault. She'd launch herself forward as she could. It was the only way she could get up, as her arms and legs wriggled and jiggled, twitching in their pain and blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her second attempt, but her legs and arms refused to cooperate, as she ended up simply attempting to hurl her torso forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit her. It had happened, immobility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn defeat and shame, she rolled her chair towards the closet, opening it. She rolled the mobility scooter out. It seemed a little small, but damn it, she wasn't rolling home in this chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attempted to shift over to the mobility scooter, and found..</span></div></div>",

The gravitational pull of living a wonderful, gluttonous fat girl's life was too strong. Though she was indeed off her diet, she also decided not to tell Hannah or Brooke; the round, blubbery redhead was enjoying their efforts to try and tempt her, and without those efforts, it just meant less food for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was waddling her way into her office one morning when she found a particularly large pile of various candy bars and sweets stacked high on her desk, completely covering the wooden surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess merely smiled. \"Oh those two...they must've really missed me and my old eating habits, considering I suppose I was the one who showed them how great it is to just relax and indulge a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the two weighty temptresses of food were sitting chatting at their desks, snacking on a few stray bags of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke gave her friend a smile. \"You know, I wonder how long it'll be until we have the old Jess back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be long.\" Hannah giggled, \"We just need to keep up the pressure. I kinda miss Jess; now that she's on that stupid diet, she hardly ever wants to hang out anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know...all she ever wants to do is *urrp!* stay at home and excercise, or go to the gym instead of going out and having fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it sucks...But we'll have her back to her normal self in no time!\" Hannah said cheerily as she took a handful of lays and shoved them in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt every possible moment, Hannah and Brooke would give some type of snack to their friend, usually in large quantities, or they'd buy her a huge lunch, or leave a tempting pastry or desserrt by her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was enjoying their increasingly frequent attempts at breaking her diet with much happiness and gluttony. </span></div></div>",

They prepared to drop it off by her door, when they heard munching and crunching inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, Hannah peered her double-chinned face around the corner. And her double-chinned-ness had expanded considerably. At last weigh-in, which was about yesterday, she hit 477, just around the corner from her friend. Her belly was massive, and had not yet doubled in. Brooke was another story: She had hit 480 if she weighed an ounce, and believe it, she certainly did. Her belly had doubled, and her legs had recieved a good deal of the weight, though the majority of the gain went right for her belly and fractionally to her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hannah peered around, She saw the blubbery blob that was jessica, gnawing on a mass of chips: An entire, large bag of BBQ chips was her target, and she had a bag of fast food sitting behind her. She was also speaking into a phone. \"Yeah...I'll take a Large pepperoni, please. Yes, with the order of wings. Oh, twenty. And I'd like a regular coke with that. Address? Oh, that's 1152 Greyhouse Lane. Thanks! Bye!\" Hannah's realization had come: The diet was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it should NOT have been a surprise even that day a couple months ago. Jess had shot back up to her former weight and then some, hitting the big 500. At present, Hannah estimated her to be about the 520's. And Hannah had an eye for weight. Even though she had long given up dieting, she hadn't given up watching her weight. She just watched it in a different way: She watched it go up and up. And she delighted in this. She no longer ate in spite of the lost man. She ate for the pure glutton inside which she relished now. That which she hid under exercise and ran from, now she could no longer hide. It came out, and came out in a big way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while this ran through her head, the hippo-like redhead turned her head. \"Hey Hannah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah got up, holding the cake brazenly. \"Hey Jess!\" Jess smirked. \"Thanks for the cake, but you know I'm on a \"diet\", right?\" Hannah chuckled. \"Suuure, same kind of diet that I'm on.\" They both matched words: \"The See-Food Diet.\" Jess snapped her fingers. \"Well, ya got me. I was off my diet three months ago, I'm just enjoying myself now.\" Hannah spoke. \"Well, I'll just leave this cake here for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hannah walked out, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

She knew that Hannah was always just a few pounds below her in weight. So, why not help her along? She decided to use the same tactics they had been using on Jessica for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, whenever either just the two of them or their trio of them plus Jessica would go out to a buffet, Brooke would convince her friend to eat just that bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hannah you *uuurrp!* should really try this teriaki chicken, it's *urp!* sooo good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah just looked at the offered plate and shook her head.

Brooke's encouragement didn't help her eating habits, and she'd tripled the amount of calories she consumed at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot conciously, of course: If hannah knew how much she was taking in, she'd revert back to her old ways. Brooke would always slip it in slyly at first: It began with a few extra chips, or another mini-doughnut, or maybe even one of the mega-doughnuts from that bakery across the way. And then she'd moved on to a full bag, a full box of mini-doughnuts, three mega-doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Hannah had gotten to the next stage: At this point she'd take in half a large bag of chips, a full box of doughnuts, and six mega-doughnuts in the full stretch of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was NOWHERE near all she'd eat: For breakfast she'd munch on multiple biscuits, a hash brown, and she'd have a chocolate chip frappe, for lunch, she'd  have a couple burgers and two orders of large fries. For supper it would vary, but her supper would always add up to about 2,500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all this had amounted up to 516 pounds on Hannah, who sat at her desk. Her huge, rolling belly now rubbed against her desk, even as she sat a reasonable distance away from it. She tip-typed away at her desk as she also bit into the mega-doughnut, savoring the rich chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as she finished up the report and sent it to her boss, she reached under her desk for a vanilla cake. Her efforts to fatten jessica had not slowed. The opposite, they'd increased. Although Hannah averaged in at about 12,000 calories per day, Jessica had one-upped her, going up to a frightening 20000 calories per day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was mostly due to the huge amounts of food given to her by Hannah and Brooke. The whale-like redhead had swelled to 637 pounds in one month, and every pound still seemed to be going to her massive stomach. At this point she needed a mobility scooter to get around, buzzing around and cutting even more calorie burning. And every pound strained even her tent-sized button up that was roomy at her previous 520 pounds, and every inch of blubbery, expansive flesh filled the button-up shirt, which was seemingly airtight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all this ferrying food back and forth, however, did quite a bit for Brooke. While the two were gaining to no tomorrow, Brooke seemed to not be gaining a pound. Brooke hadn't been keeping track, really, but if she kept track of the reasons why, the major reason was all the getting up and walking about, hurrying over and running over to get cakes and mountains of food, not to mention lifting and carrying all that food. And, unlike Hannah and Jessica, nobody was shoving food into her mouth and insisting that she eat that mountain of food. She was the one doing the insisting, the demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to find out, though, because she had decided to weigh herself. She knew Hannah and Jess were gaining, and she gave herself a pat on the back, but she wondered why she wasn't gaining: She was eating burgers and fries, having fast food breakfasts, drinking soft drinks. What was going wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had stripped down to a bra and her panties: She still had her big, big belly and her decent rack, nipples threatening to mine through the black bra that she wore to sleep. She stepped onto the electronic scale, peering over her massive, lardy stomach. The number shone clear: 472 Pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke stepped back off the scale, and...</span></div></div>",

Finally quitting time rolled around and she was able to leave her hot, stuffy cube for her and Brooke's favorite pizza place. The drive alone felt like it would never end. When she finally made it Brooke had pulled up a booth and had three large pizzas sitting waiting for her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah leaned back in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It had sat about 3 weeks ago that she had began her firm regimen of weight gain. She was no longer a casual gainer, and it showed: As the fat woman leaned back in her chair, which creaked and held up as much as possible, her fat overflowed from the bottom of her button-up: It was the largest size that George could afford to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery inch of fat showed from her tight-squeezing, skin-tight dress button-up. At every button, a centimeter or two of flesh showed as the button peeled aside slightly. She had finished her fifth box of doughnuts. She'd gone on from mini-donuts to the real thing, full-on baker's dozens, consumed by the end of the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her mug of coffee: Eating this much was thirsty work. Especially for a woman of her girth. She slurped and tried not to spill anything on her shiny white shirt. A little dripped out of her mug and impacted her black skirt. That, she didn't worry about. She continued slurping on the black concoction until it ran dry. She contently sat in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHe past three weeks of utter gluttony felt like her old routines of exercise: She sweated as much,she was as tired at the end of it, but she actually enjoyed it and was delighted to start, whereas when she attempted to work out, she always dreaded it at the start, and dreaded the next session. Now she was doing what she loved, only intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her, likely a residual of her initial doubts, spoke to her, making her wonder that if this was really all that good. Sure it felt nice, and all the food was good. It was nice getting to relax for once. But now she literally could NOT walk up one set of stairs. Was it worth it all? Was it truly worth the rapid-approaching immobility?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the real hannah came back: Of coruse it was! Why shouldn't someone live to their enjoyment? Life was fickle and short anyways, why not enjoy the little a person can squeeze out of life? As the proverb goes, you only live once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch deep thoughts come when you eat doughnuts like a hog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in the door appeared a blubbery form that took up half the doorway. Her black hair was done up in a bun. Her face came familiar to Hannah: It was Taylor, the Marketing manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Taylor was another dancer at the school, the other blubbery member of the team. But, though her girth was technically bigger than Brooke's at the time, Brooke still weighed more. As junior year approached, she made experiments in weight loss and was mildly successful. But Hannah could tell that this didn't last as her fat form took up half the frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally spoke. \"Hey, Hannah! Can I talk to you for a second?\" Hannah gave an affirmative nod. Of course, Taylor shut the door and pulled up a chair. Anytime someone wanted to talk to her in person, it was known that, like Jessica, it had to be done in her office, or it wasn't worth doing. As taylor pulled up the chair, she spoke again.</span></div></div>",

Jessica had a similar problem recently but she seems to be hitting a plateau for now. Can you put the effort you used to into your work and presentation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try,\" Hannah said. She was taken aback at Taylor's statements. She knew it was all true but didn't want to face it.

We don't like to let people go Hannah,\" Taylor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I don't improve?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The 3:50 mark was rolling around on the clock as the obese, blonde form of Hannah sat comfortably at her desk. Her round, blubbery mound of a stomach sat at a nice, happy medium between her desk and her thighs, a couple centimeters from her knees as she dilligently typed and huffed down doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her  white button-up was a little strained from her sitting, but when she stood it was rather loose. Her dress skirt stopped just below the knees, black with white stripes racing downwards, though it was from a couple pounds ago, and it was straining due to her rather expansive thighs. Her baker's dozen started running low to one and a half donuts, as she nearly finished the Report. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe typed in the last word, and sent it on the Transfer folder, and printed it out to the Printing room. Of course, the girls had ceased filing their own paperwork, new people were gotten to do that for them. It had frankly become a herculean task for the lardy whales of the office to move all the way to the printers and to the file cabinets all in one trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hannah shoved herself up with a bit of effort, and waddled over. She ensured that she had a couple sips of her pepsi and walked over to Taylor's Office, leaving her rather out-of-breath and red-faced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin Taylor's Office sat Taylor and a white-coated black woman, who was almost stick-thin, quite the contrast to Taylor, who was  finishing up her recent conquest of Crunchy Cheetos. Her gains really showed in this older suit: Her button-up was almost at bursting point, and her vest seemed just as skintight. Even the simple act of breathing seemed to show each and every thread in the exposed shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She turned to the bloated blonde who now stood in the doorway. \"Ah, Hannah, good to see ya. I'll let ya'll get started, I was just chatting with Doctor Underwood here.\" Hannah smiled. \"Have a good day, Miss Blankenship.\" Taylor smiled and waved her delicate little wave. As she began leaving, an audible ripping and multiple pops emerged, as she hurried out. Hannah made out the figure of her flabby belly jiggling around. She had the vague feeling that this sight would become more common, Taylor was ever-naive about her office-related gains, as opposed to her and Brooke, who embraced the fattening ways of the Office openly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned to her. \"So, Miss Hannah, Miss Blankenship told me you were here for Disabilities?\" Hannah nodded, replying in her out-of-breath, panting voice. \"Mmm-Hmm. Movement's been...A bit..Difficult..Due to..Some weight gains...\" The doctor nodded. \"Alright. I would just give it to you, but I need to record a couple things, which is why I brought..\" She lifted a bag out into view, with an 'Umph'. \"...These.\" Hannah could plainly see a scale sticking out the bag, as well as a tape measure laying on top of it, just to the right of a variety of different instruments, including Syringes and a Blood Pressure armband, as well as a Patient's Gown. A curtain sat in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor pulled out the metal, electronic scale first. \"Okay, Hannah, Let's see how much this intentional weight gain has done.\" She set it down, set it to zero, and spoke to Hannah, pulling out the gown. \"Go into the curtain area, strip down, and put this on.\" She handed her the gown and Hannah went to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back with the teal-blue gown adorning her blubbery form. Doctor Underwood spoke. \"I just need you to step on the scale.\" Hannah nodded and obliged her , stepping on the cold, electronic metal scale. Hannah couldn't see the numbers, and she heard Underwood mutter something and scribble on her clipboard. Hannah spoke. \"Uh, how much do I weigh?\" Underwood spoke. \"Five hundred ninety eight pounds..\" Hannah nodded with a little bit of a smile. Underwood spoke. \"How much did you weigh at your last weigh-in?\" Hannah replied. \"Oh, Four hundred seventy seven.\" Underwood nodded and scribbled in a bit more information. She spoke. \"Okay, go ahead and have a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese blonde obliged her and took a seat across from the slender doctor, as the doctor prepared to write. The doctor opened up. \"So, can you tell me about your exercise routine?\" Hannah spoke. \"None, most exercise I get is walking to my car and to my office. Occasionally I walk to open the refrigerator.\" Underwood shook her head as she wrote. \"Mmm. And what does your diet look like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah spoke in a casual tone. \"Well, I Usually eat 3 bacon biscuits, each with a quarter pound of bacon, with a Chocolate Chip Frappe for breakfast. I eat 2 burgers for lunch with  2 large orders of fries. I usually snack at the office on about 3 bags of Cheetos and a baker's dozen glazed donuts. For supper, I eat tortellini with cheese, and I usually put a cup of alfredo sauce on it as well, just to really get the flavor out, and afterwards I usually have half a pound cake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished counting on her fingers the amounts she ate, she turned to the doctor, who was scribbling away on her clipboard, but she could see a heavily dissapointed face on her face. \"Hmm, hmm, hmm. Okay, just sit right there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor ran through the usual tests: Heart rate, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol. The doctor eventually came back with a note. \"Alright, you'll have your disability within about a week.\" The doctor spoke. \"Although, I have something you may or may not want to hear.\" </span></div></div>",

She had seen a lot of whale sized women being the company doctor here and she had sent a few on disability. She never saw any of them again and Hannah was not going to be an exception. Hannah was in just about the worst shape she ever saw a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if that isn't an option doctor?\" Hannah asked.

Get help, please,\" the doctor begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it,\" Hannah replied curtly as she left. She couldn't believe the nerve of that doctor.

Her fat face smiled in the delight of the Hamburger, her smile puffing out her vast second chin, which must have extended 2 full inches, looking more like a flap than part of a chin. She patted her vast, sack-like appendage of a stomach as she looked at the array of fast food she had just finished.She had never really intended to listen to that quack, but she expected that Taylor probably gave that bitch her number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, she wanted to take a break from the whole business. Which is why she was happy to be going on Disabilities, maybe she'd even get some down time with her friends. She went back to her computer, doing a little bit more before that magical time hit. She had an intent to weigh herself when she got home, even though that bothersome doctor would probably do it when she got to her office if she ever intended to call. She refused to go there of her own volition, doctor's visits only produced insecurity about her health, and that was something she was never one for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally got up as the workbell rang and the stampeding herd of other cows entered. She joined the herd, her vast amounts of fat jiggling and bouncing up against the other vast rolls and jiggling thighs. The whole mass of fat women was just about merging with each other, how their lardy bodies attempted to occupy the same place at the same time. And Hannah could hear them suffering the same as her: All panting and sweating lethargically, one in the herd almost fell over, but a fat hand from her left propped her up. Eventually the herd got into the huge elevators: They had to be quintuple reinforced, the weight capacity on each being at least over 1900 pounds, which helped, especially when the average weight in the office was getting to be 300 pounds, from the last fiscal year's 200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the elevator reached the bottom, and the herd got out of the office, Hannah straggled and waddled, extraordinarily out of breath, her massive legs straddled in their waddling. She praised whatever god sat up there in heaven as she reached her minivan. She'd been saving up for a seat modification, and she had it installed just the prior week. She sat in the seat, happy that she wasn't on the verge of being stuck between the seat and the wheel, and she cranked the engine for the drive home, not to mention the AC, as she used her fat, blubbery hand to wipe the lake of sweat off her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got home, immediately her phone rang. She waddled over in annoyance, and answered. \"Hello?\" <br>\r\nA familiar voice answered...</span></div></div>",

Ashley had to be immediately transported to the hospital where she had to undergo several surgeries. During the time of her healing she had to be be truly still. Ashley had to lay or sit almost all the time and this was little boring. So Ashley slowly found some new joy in reading, watching TV, surfing internet and even some snacking. All this lazy lifestyle had some influence on her weight of course. On one side Ashley's muscles lost the tension and were less visible thanks to new layer of fat under her skin and she was not too happy with that. On the other side her gain had some positive effects in her eyes. For the first time in her life she had some real breasts and some more feminine curves. In the end she felt more like real woman and she more or less liked her new reflection in the mirror. When Ashley finally recovered from her injury, the physicians told her sad news, that she can't to continue with her fitness instructor job. This took Ashley to the situation when she needs new job and she needs it fast, because she needs to pay her bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo find a new job is not that easy task especially when one has no relevant practice.

I'll be there at 5:00PM, only ask for Samantha, they know me there very well.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, it is nice, so see you at 5\" replied Ashley<br>\r\n\"I look forward to meet you\" replied Samantha and finished the call<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was still in the small shock. It looks, that she can have a new job after so many unsuccessful tries! She started to prepare for the interview quite nervously. It is obvious, that fitness instructor doesn't need too much of business skirt suits and it is even worth, when one gains some weight. She had to try several outfits, but almost no one was acceptable. In the end Ashley decided to take light long dress, which were quite loose earlier before her knee injury. Now the dress were quite snug and revealed new Ashley's curves. Her newly bulging breasts created interesting cleavage and it was even possible to see even the sign of her panties over her tight dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 5 o'clock Ashley arrived to the business center, where the Gourmet heaven was based. In shot time she found Cake kingdom. She took deep breath and entered into the sweet shop. Immediately she was greet by a plump waitress in very tight black outfit and small white apron.<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, table for one?\" asked the waitress<br>\r\n\"No, actually i have a meeting with Samantha here...\" responded Ashley<br>\r\n\"Of course, with Samantha, this is our great customer, she is waiting for you already, please follow me\" said the waitress and led Ashley to more separated part of the shop, where were placed the tables of customers, which required more privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was sitting the immense lady by the table which was covered by sweets.<br>\r\n\"You have to be Ashley Perkins, i'm Samantha Jones, the director of Gourmet heaven\" said the lady and struggled to heave with lots of gasping...<br>\r\n\"I'm Ashley Perkins, nice to meet you!\" said Ashley and pressed Samantha's soft fat hand<br>\r\n\"(Pant, gasp) Please (wheeze) sit by me (gasp) and (pant) help yourself...\" said Samantha and heavily plopped down to the robust chair <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha had to recover from her exertion and catch her breath, so Ashley had some time to look at her possible employer. Samantha was in her forties and yes, she was obese, better say very obese. She had quite lovely face with nice framed by short black hair and large second chin, which covered her neck. Under the chin started deep and long cleavage which was quite visible in her white blouse, because the top buttons were wide open. The large and obviously heavy breasts in strong bra were pushed up by colossal belly and were heaving with Samantha's laborious breathing. The white blouse was quite loose when Samantha was standing, but now, when she was sitting, it was quite strained. When Samantha fully recovered, smiled on Ashley:<br>\r\n\"Do you like coffee? They have here great Viennese one, with delicious whipped cream\" offered Ashley<br>\r\n\"You are so very kind, i'll take one\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they started to talk about the possible job. During the interview the plump waitress brought Viennese coffee, which Ashley considered as truly very delicious with large amount of sweet white whipped cream. It looks, that the work is not truly too complicated and doesn't require some special experience. It was about typing on the computer, some phone calls, schedule management of the ample manager and delivering papers across the office. Money were truly good for this position. Later it was not already interview, but more or less the conversation. Samantha was eating the sweets from the table all the time and several times offered them to Ashley as well. Ashley decided to take one as well, just to be polite. But she was truly surprised, sweets were excellent! Ashley took next one and then next one and next one... From time to time the plump waitress came and refilled the table with new types of sweets. Very simply in the end of the interview Ashley was much more pleasantly full, her belly was swollen and her panties were now fully visible through her tight dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, will we make a deal? What do you think? As i said, you can start tomorrow...\" asked Samantha<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was nice to meet you.\u201d said Samantha<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was pleasure to meet you!\u201d replied Ashley and started to search for her moneybag to pay the coffee and cookies<br>\r\nSamantha placed her soft manicured hand to Ashley\u2019s hand, put nice smile on her face and said \u201cIt is on my account here, don\u2019t worry\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, it was truly excellent and irresistible. I\u2019m so full\u2026\u201d smiled Ashley and stroked her swollen belly by her right hand<br>\r\nSamantha got up with groaning, shook Ashley\u2019s hand and started to slowly and laboriously waddle from the coffee shop to her spacious SUV. Ashley was able to see Samantha\u2019s thick legs in surprisingly tight skirt, round swinging buttocks, big broad love handles and heavy fold of the belly. The belly was reaching below half of her thighs and so Samantha\u2019s leg had to lift it on every single step. This movement sand waves across the whole Samantha\u2019s body and her heavy gargantuan breasts were flowing and heaving. Simply the breasts look like they were living on their own. Ashley was surprised, that Samantha had quite high heels on her shoes even with Samantha\u2019s obvious heavy weight. Anyhow Amanda thought that Samantha is charming lady despite of her enormous girth and that she knows to carry her weight with grace.<br>\r\nBy Samantha\u2019s car, which was parking on the assigned parking lot by the sweet shop, both ladies said final good bye. Samantha was struggling to get to her car and Ashley happily went to her car on the public parking place by the business center. Ashley was thinking, what she should do now\u2026</span></div></div>",

I have new job and it starts tomorrow!\u201d said Ashley hapilly to the phone<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, dear, it\u2019s truly great! We have to celebrate it!\u201d replied mom<br>\r\n\u201cI thing so\u201d agreed Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cCan you come and join us today? Let\u2019s say at 8 pm? I\u2019m working on some better Italian dish, which you like\u201d proposed mom<br>\r\n\u201cActually I\u2019ll come, your Italian cooking is great. So see you at 8\u201d agreed Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley headed home to change from her tight dress to something more comfortable and she wanted to protect her dress for tomorrow as well. At home Ashley took off her dress and started to search something more comfortable. When she undressed, she saw herself in the full length mirror. Was her belly was still little bloated from sweet feast or little bigger or even both? Were her breasts bigger? Were her hips broader? Ashley liked her larger breasts slightly spilling from cups of her 32C bra and broader hips in fact. But she felt insecure thanks to development of a layer of the fat on her belly and thighs. Ashley hopped to the scale. She became little disappointed, when she saw the number! 157lbs for her height 5\u20196\u201d means that she is officially slightly overweight and six month ago she had healthy weight 120lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is obvious, all this snacking has some consequences, and I\u2019ll have to cut back my appetite. I have to start diet tomorrow! And I have to do at least some healthy workout! But for today I need something comfortable, mom\u2019s cooking is so great\u2026\u201d Ashley thought <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this decision in mind Ashley selected some of her larger v-neck t-shirt and elastics leggings. V-neck t-shirt she liked, because she we able to present her currently existing cleavage and leggings were comfortable enough for her swollen belly. Then she set out to her parents\u2019 home. She parked the car and went to the house. Her father opened the door:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Ashley, I\u2019m glad, that you came to us!\u201d greeted her Father<br>\r\n\u201cHi daddy, every time it is nice to come home\u201d said Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go inside, mom and sister are in the kitchen and they are working on the great supper.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If Ashley was the fitness freak, her mother was not one never ever. Stella, Ashley\u2019s mother, was average height woman, but she was definitely more than overweight. In her late 50\u2019s she weighed more than 250 pounds for her 5\u20193\u201d frame. She gained significant amount of her weight during her pregnancies with Ashley and her older sister. From this time Stella gained pound here or two pounds there, especially because she developed great cooking skills and had lack of physical activities during her free time. She had overinflated hourglass figure with large and surprisingly firm breasts, broad hips and again very surprisingly not so thick waist. Ashley\u2019s father never complained about Stella\u2019s more than voluptuous figure, every time he was very polite and treated her very well. Stella liked to eat, felt comfortable and has not motivation to slim down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s older sister Jane was at home with her first child and came to celebrate new job with Ashley. Jane was quite slim before she got pregnant with her husband Mark. During the pregnancy Jane definitely ate for two and it brought some effect for her figure. She went from 120 pounds to 190 pounds in time of delivery. With nice support from Mark she never tried to shed her baby weight. On the contrary Jane was now almost 200 lbs for her 5\u20195\u201d frame and her outfit was strained by her soft assets.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ashley came to the kitchen, she was greeted by mom and sister. They both warmly congratulated her to the new job.<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, honey, I\u2019m glad, that you have real job now\u201d said mom<br>\r\n\u201cYes, even I\u2019m so glad. But still I\u2019m sad, because I can\u2019t continue with my aerobics and I added already some weight\u201d replied Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cBut Ashley, don\u2019t worry, you were more skin and bones, now you look better, now you look like the woman\u201d argued mom<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I have some more feminine curves, but with that I obtained larger belly as well\u201d complained Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cBut Ashley, you need some meat on your bones to be healthy. And let\u2019s go to eat, the supper is ready!\u201d said the mom <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Jane started to serve the rich meal for the family dinner party. They had bruschetta as appetizer, baked lasagna as the main course and tiramisu as the desert. In the end of the filling meal all the ladies were truly full. They were relaxed, sitting in the chairs and leaned back to give some more room to their bellies.  Ashley\u2019s belly was even more distended than in the afternoon of course and Jane had to open her too restrictive jeans during the meal. Mark and Ashley\u2019s father cleaned the table to provide quiet digestion to the ladies. Ashley was glad for her flexible leggings, but her panties were very constraining now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply it was very pleasant evening for Ashley. When she returned home, full and satisfied, she took the shower. During the shower, she cupped her breasts and yes, they were larger and little heavier than before. With satisfaction and expectations fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley overslept a little in the morning. She had to hurry up to be in time in the office. She cleaned her teeth, took shower and started to dress. Ashley was not fully sure, but it seemed to her, that her underwear was little snugger than yesterday. It took her little more time to squeeze her breasts into the bra cups at least somehow and little bit more pulling to put on her panties. With the dress Ashley was already sure. Her dress was definitely tighter especially around her breasts, belly and even hips. Her panty lines were clearly visible today and even here love handles were more visible. Ashley checked her appearance in the mirror.<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely I have to buy some new dress and start my diet today\u201d thought Ashley running to her car<br>\r\nAshley skipped her breakfast, but during her way to the Gourmet heaven she felt not so good. Obviously she was hungry. She was little surprised, but when she saw the McDonald's, she headed for breakfast without hesitation. She ordered two McGriddles with bacon, eggs &amp; cheese and vanilla shake. Ashley wanted to buy Strawberry pie, but at this moment she recalled her decision to limit her calories intake and eat more healthy and ordered Yogurt with fruits instead. She was slowly eating her breakfast in the car in the morning traffic jam so when she arrived to business center, the package was empty and Ashley was full and satisfied.<br>\r\nLittle before 9 o\u2019clock was Ashley standing by the reception desk in the business center, where was the office of Gourmet heaven. Receptionist, radiant plump lady, explained Ashley, how to get there. So at 9 o\u2019clock exactly was Ashley standing by the glass door to the office. She took a deep breath and pushed the button of the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter short time came voluptuous young lady and opened the door.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome in Gourmet heaven, what can I do for you?\u201d said the voluptuous beauty<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Ashley Perkins, I should the new secretary here\u201d said Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Nice to meet you! I\u2019m Clara, come in, we are looking forward to you already\u2026\u201d said Clara and led Ashley to Samantha\u2019s office. Ashley was able to see Clara from side and from behind. Clara was as tall as Ashley was, but she was much more on the plump side. Clara had soft hourglass figure and was dressed in skirt suite which stressed her curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha, the heavy director, looked very pleased to see Ashley in Gourmet heaven office. <br>\r\n\u201cSo Ashley, welcome on board\u201d said Samantha with smile on her lovely face<br>\r\n\u201cClara, dear, please can you care about Ashley as we discussed? Samantha asked Clara<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, my pleasure\u201d Clara replied<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, please come with me\u201d Clara said to Ashley and left Samantha\u2019s office<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara led Ashley to IT, where Ashley received laptop and accounts to e-mail and internal systems, vol-ip infrastructure from George. By the way George was pleasant and well looking man. Then Clara led Ashley to her assigned desk.  The desk was placed in the office located by the Samantha\u2019s one. Ashley\u2019s office was connected to Samantha\u2019s one with wide sliding doors. Ashley liked the modern well equipped office, her nice broad and comfortable chair, large desk. All the equipment like phone, copier and even printer were within reach. She even didn\u2019t have to get up from her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 10 o\u2019clock Clara took Ashley to the large meeting room.<br>\r\n\u201cSamantha will introduce you to other people here\u201d Clara explained to Ashley<br>\r\nAs Ashley already new, the Gourmet heaven developed several business activities. Of course the original and still the most important activity was quality check and control in the hospitality industry. The second activity was looking for high quality ingredients for chefs, which were interested in real quality. The last activity was publishing of materials like cookbooks from professional to popular. <br>\r\nIn the middle of the meeting room was placed large round table covered by incredible amount of food. All the food on the table looked very tasty. In short time other people were coming to the meeting room. All of them looked very friendly to Ashley. Samantha came out of breath as the last one, sat down to recover. After a while she officially started the meeting. To Ashley\u2019s surprise all the 10 office ladies were at least pleasantly plump and at least 2 of them were truly extremely obese and were sitting on the broad reinforced electric wheelchairs. All 4 men had more or less normal build.<br>\r\n\u201cDears, we are here, because I\u2019d like to introduce Ashley Perkins, our new secretary.\u201d  Samantha said and asked \u201cTeam, please introduce ourselves to Ashley\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nOne of the heaviest office ladies was named Tessa. She was the manager of the most important department for quality control. By Tessa\u2019s wheel chair were sitting two bulky inspectors Anna and Dana. Other inspectors were working in the terrain. Next to Dana was sitting the second extremely fat lady Nora in her wheel chair. Nora was the manager of publishing department. By Nora was sitting a quite young and slim man named Adam. Adam was responsible for composition. Next to Adam were two quite young corpulent girls Beth and Lana. Both were working as editors in the publishing department. Next one was George, the manager of IT and his colleague Denis. By Denis was sitting Peter with his assistant Dona, the last man in the room. Peter was responsible for searching and purchasing of the ingredients. Near Peter was sitting the very obese lady named Alice. Alice was responsible for accounting and Clara who was introducing Ashley to the office was Alice\u2019s assistant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all team members introduced themselves, Samantha finished the formal part of the meeting and invited all to be less formal and enjoy the prepared refreshment. Samantha was the example and started to consume delicious food in front of you in very interesting pace. Even other ladies were enjoying the tasty refreshment. It was almost surprising, that they were able to chat with each other. Ashley took only small amount of food at the beginning, but then Samantha, Tessa or other ladies started to recommend interesting items to her. This process increased her intake before she can even mention of course and all the items were incredibly great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, this is truly delicious\u201d said Ashley after eating sweet cream puff recommended by Samantha. <br>\r\n\u201cHere in Gourmet heaven, we know, what to order\u201d smiled Samantha on Ashley and added \u201cand this one was from Cake kingdom\u201d    <br>\r\nAround 11:30 AM was the meeting finished and all the people returned to their work as well as Ashley and Clara. Ashley felt quite full, but it was surprisingly pleasant feeling for her. Ashley learned, how to work with the calendar, how to make conference calls, print and scan materials.  At 13:00 Clara interrupted her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m quite hungry, what about some lunch?\u201d Clara asked Ashley</span></div></div>",

It was quite difficult for her to reach with her plump hands on the small keyboard of her MacBook Air, because her massive arms had to squeeze ample breasts resting on top of her big belly.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to disturb you, Samantha. Can I go to lunch with Clara or do you need something from us?\u201d asked Ashley<br>\r\nSamantha stopped the writing and placed her plump hands on the side of her colossal paunch.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat idea girls, can I join you?\u201d asked Samantha<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, it is pleasure\u201d replied Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the car, I\u2019m not build for physical exertion\u201d smiled Samantha<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara and Ashley headed to garage with their slowly waddling boss. Samantha struggled to get in to her large SUV. She more than filled whole space on the driver place. The steering wheel was almost touching her belly fold and her spacious hips overhung the seat on both sides. Samantha used seat belt with extender over her belly and started the engine. In few minutes they arrived in front of the restaurant. When they entered to the restaurant, immediately a voluminous hostess with big smile in her face scuttled.<br>\r\n\u201cSamantha, it is real pleasure to see you here. Your preferred table is waiting on you\u201d said the hostess <br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Mira, it is nice from you\u201d replied Samantha <br>\r\n\u201cAnd can I introduce my new secretary Ashley. It can be, that she will be coming there, if the food will be excellent\u201d added Samantha with smile<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Mira. I hope that you will be satisfied.\u201d said Mira and led them to Samantha\u2019s preferred table<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food in the restaurant was truly excellent. Mira recommended today special meal, the juicy steak with green pepper sauce and all the ladies accepted. After not so long time they received large steak with croquettes. Ashley was full in the middle of her steak, but she regret to waste such great food and so she continued to stuff herself. The steak was simply too good. When Ashley was done, she had to lean back to create some room for her stomach to digest her opulent meal. Samantha finished her lunch and caressed her distended belly by both hands. She was obviously satisfied, because she had nice smile on her lovely face. Clara was full and satisfied as well. She was sitting in similar position as Ashley to make some comfort. Ashley expected, that after this meal they will return back to the office. But this was not assumption. When the waiter appeared, Samantha ordered dessert and coffee with whipped cream for all of them. After a while the waiter returned with generous portion of the delicious chocolate cake and with the coffee. Ashley decided at least to try. Again the cake was sweet and irresistible, so in the end she managed to eat it all. Ashley was so full, that she was not almost move. Clara was in similar state. They had to digest at least a little before they moved back to the office. Even Clara and Ashley were now truly happy about their way back in the comfortable air conditioned car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the office Ashley continued to learn about her job tasks and responsibilities. She was able to switch several phone calls and organize two meetings without asking. Later in the afternoon Samantha called Ashley to come to her office.<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, please, can you call to Cake kingdom and order package of assorted cakes to me? The middle package\u2026 no, better will be the large one... i'm little hungry\u201d asked Samantha<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll call them just now\u201d replied Ashley and run to take care of the wish of her hungry boss<br>\r\nAfter few minutes arrived messenger boy with large box full of cakes and cream puffs. Ashley organized cookies on the plate and served it to Samantha\u2019s office. <br>\r\n\u201cCan I prepare some coffee for you?\u201d Ashley asked Samantha <br>\r\n\u201cIt would be great to have one, thank you! And put it to the glass, please. And make one for you as well, if you wish. We can share cookies, if you like\u2026\u201d Samantha replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley prepared coffee Samantha and for herself to the glasses. Samantha added lots of caned sugar and the whole cream to her glass. Ashley used less sugar, but more of cream. They were chatting, eating puffs and cakes and slowly sipping the sweet coffee. It was obvious, that Samantha likes her new secretary. Ashley was again very full in the end of the meeting and her dress was truly overloaded and restrictive. She was afraid for bending down during cleaning of the table. <br>\r\nAshley went to the toilet before she left the office. She was watching her bloated form in the mirror and thinking \u201cOh my, definitely I have to buy new dress and tomorrow I have to start with my diet\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ashley left the office, she headed directly to the mall. In the boutique she bought two nice ladies suites, several fitting blouses. Then she had to buy new bras, this time with comfortable size 34D and of course several new larger panties. Later she bought even nice pair of shoes on the high heels. All the shopping took her almost 3 hours and she felt tired.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After first day in the office and all the shopping Ashley was tired, but she felt quite hungry for her own surprise. She considered her options and in the end she decided to have supper in a food court of the shopping mall. There were several possibilities, where to eat quite well. Ashley decided for Chinese cuisine, because they had very tasty meals and truly big portions. She ordered chicken soup, fried noodles with fine duck meat and large Coke. When she finished her generous meal, she sat more comfortably and relaxed awhile. During her relaxation she fondled her filled belly spontaneously. Leaving the food court Ashley smelled nice sweet aroma from an ice cream parlor. The aroma was so inviting, that she entered to the parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few people sitting in the ice cream parlor and enjoying their sweet delicacies. A young busty lady in snow white apron was standing and warmly greeted Ashley \u201eGood evening, how can i help you?\u201d<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m not sure, I still look around\u201d replied Ashley with her eyes on the tastily looking colorful ice creams<br>\r\n\u201cIf can I recommend, we have great stracciatella and chocolate ice creams. Do you like to taste?\u201d asked the waitress  <br>\r\nAshley looked at the waitress with surprise in her eyes and said \u201coh, it would be nice\u2026 can I test both?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf couse, yes, you can. Here is stracciatella\u2026\u201d replied the waitress and served teaspoon with the sample to Ashley<br>\r\nAshley was amazed by great strong taste of the stracciatella ice cream. She even closed her eyes, when she was melting the ice cream in her mouth. Ashley swallowed the sample and said \u201coh my, you were right, truly excellent\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know it well and here is the chocolate one. It is great as well, I like it so very much personally\u2026\u201d the waitress said and served teaspoon with chocolate ice cream to Ashley<br>\r\nThe waitress was right. The chocolate ice cream tasted so full. Ashley ordered her ice cream \u201cI\u2019d like to have one scoop of stracciatella on top of two spoons of the chocolate one\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course, but in case, that you want three scopes, I\u2019d like to recommend the vanilla ice cream as well?\u201d asked the waiteress and handed teaspoon with vanilla ice cream to to Ashley<br>\r\nAshley tasted the sample and nodded \u201cYes, truly great\u2026 so strong\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan I offer you nuts and caramel toppings? It will accentuate the taste of chocolate and vanilla.\u201d asked the young waitress and <br>\r\nAshley dreaming about her ice cream already and so she agreed almost without thinking \u201cyes, please\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was able to watch the young waitress turning around during preparation of her ice cream. Thanks to large white apron it was not that visible from the front view, that the waitress is not only busty, but quite plump as well. From behind Ashley was able to see waitresses\u2019 generous behind in tight white trousers which were fighting not to burst in seams during every movement. From the trousers spilled the muffin top clearly visible in snug white t-shit. When Ashley saw the bra cut to waitresses\u2019 soft body had the idea \u201cnow it is clear, how she can know so many about the ice cream, she has to be that plump from it.\u201d This view reminded the diet and exercise plan to Ashley\u2019s mind, but her ideas were interrupted by the waitress who asked \u201cdo you like something to drink? I would take the Frappe coffee with the vanilla ice cream\u2026\u201d Ashley recalled the strong taste of the vanilla ice cream and agreed \u201cYes, thank you\u201d.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ashley arrived home, she took shower and went immediately to the bed. She felt great and was sleeping very well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley overslept in the morning again and she had to hurry up. She quickly showered and started to dress. This time it was much more easy to dress, because her new underwear and skirt suite had the right size. Ashley felt comfortable very in her new clothes. Even it was easier to get to the car and she doesn't have to think about bursting the seams on her dress. When she saw herself finally in the mirror, she was able to see curvy classy girl. She had to skip her breakfast to be in the office in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley remembered her decision about diet, so she skipped McDonald's this time. But she felt truly hungry when she arrived to office. Even her belly rumbled several times already. She switched on the laptop and checked the mails. Ashley's belly again rumbled and this time louder, than before. At this moment Alice and Clara entered to the Ashley's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara asked \u201cHe Ashley, we are going to the cafeteria for the breakfast, Will you join us?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'll join you, actually I was thinking about the breakfast\u201d Ashley said and her belly confirmed the decision with loud growling.<br>\r\n\u201cHa, ha, here is somebody damn hungry, we have to hurry up! Let's go girls!\u201d smiled Alice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, hurry up! It is much easier to say, than it can be done, especially when one is that heavy as Alice was. Alice was quite short but very obese and her bulk and weight significantly limited her possibility to walk to slow waddling. Fortunately the cafeteria was not too far. Ashley was thinking during their way there, what she should have for breakfast \u201cprobably some low-fat milk and cereals will be good start of her diet\u201d. When the ladies arrived to the canteen, Clara and heavily breathing Alice headed towards to the counter and started to load their plates with sausages, scrambled eggs and bacon. Ashley's thoughts about the diet were forgotten under impression of this tasty hearty breakfast. She took the plate and loaded it with two sausages, several slices of roasted bacon and generous amount of scrambled eggs. When Ashley was passing a counter with cakes, she took two muffins and two donuts for snack later. The breakfast was great and ladies spent nice time together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley returned to the office with her sweet snack and started to work again. After few minutes she could hear buzzing of the power wheelchair and Tessa the extremely heavy manager of the quality control department arrived to Ashley's office. Tessa had truly vast belly which was  resting on her huge tree trunk thighs. On top of this belly was huge bosom spreading heavily in front of her. Tessa's blouse was straining at the buttons. Each button created apex of a diamond, where was visible the white flesh of her enormous belly. Tessa used her right bulky hand to ride the wheelchair and on the left hand she had some papers.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa greeted Ashley \u201cHi Ashley, how are you?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cActually I'm great, I just returned from the breakfast.\u201d Ashley replied<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, dear, can I ask you for your help? Do you have some time?\u201d Tessa asked  <br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course, what do you need?\u201d Ashley asked<br>\r\n\u201cI need to prepare some excel tables for planning of the quality audit and I need it today afternoon lets say at three o'clock\u201d said Tessa, explained what she needs and handed the papers to Ashley. <br>\r\nThe work doesn't look like too difficult and Ashley wanted to help \u201cyou will have it of course\u201c.<br>\r\nTessa was smiling obviously pleased by Ashley approach, took some box from basked mounted on the wheelchair and passed it to Ashley \u201cand here you have something sweet to make your work more pleasant\u201d<br>\r\nAshley saw box with 8 nicely looking assorted donuts \u201cOh my, Tessa, thank you, but I can't to take it, I'm here to help you\u201d said Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry and take it, you will save lots of my time\u201d Tessa replied with smile and placed the box on the Ashley's desk<br>\r\n\u201cTessa, thank you so much, you will have excels in time\u201d Ashley said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa left Ashley's office and Ashley started to work on the excels for Tessa and other her activities. Every now and then Ashley looked at the nice donuts and even later she decided to taste one. First donut was truly delicious, so Ashley quickly swallowed the second one as well. Before the noon the box was empty and excel files were ready and sent to Tessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt noon Ashley received the call from Samantha \u201chi Ashley, how is it going?\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cHi Samantha, it is quiet here, nothing important happened\u201d Ashley replied<br>\r\n\u201cOk, it is good to know, so will you join me for some lunch?\u201d Samantha asked Ashley<br>\r\nAshley was not too hungry, but she wanted to be very polite to her boss and agreed \u201cyes, it will be my pleasure\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, great! I'll call you from my parking place, i'll wait for you there. I should be there in 20 minutes, so see you later\u201d replied Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf past twelve Samantha called Ashley from the garage. When Ashley came, they greeted and set out to the new restaurant called with simple name Abundant. Mrs. Carmela the proud owner of Abundant wanted to cooperate with Gourmet heaven and so Samantha wanted to do some kind of pre check. The meal was simply perfect and helpings were truly \u201cabundant\u201d. Samantha and Ashley had full four courses meals. Ashley had the real issues to eat the main course, but thanks to great quality of the meal she was stuffing herself in heroic manner. Ashley was truly happy, that she had less constraining dress today. Even Samantha was so very full. Her white blouse looked even tighter and almost bursting in straining seams around her big belly. Buttons on the top were open as every time to expose long cleavage, flesh of here breast was spilling from the cups of her overtaxed reinforced white bra. The material of her bra and blouse was so stretched, that it was possible to see her nipples pushed up by the full belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usually ladies had to lean back to digest big meal and Ashley said ecclesiastically \u201coh my, this was excellent, truly delicious! Especially I enjoyed the pork meat. It was so succulent and spicy. My mom does similar, but this one was even a little better...\u201d<br>\r\nSamantha gave smile to Ashley and said \u201cIt looks, that you should work in quality control department, we are wasting your talent\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, i'm not the expert in our family. My mother or my sister are quite good cooks\u201d Ashley replied<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, it can change easily, trust me...\u201d said Samantha petting her full belly and continued \u201ceven I was not into cooking before, but now I enjoy cooking so much...\u201d <br>\r\nAshley replied \u201cand in the end I prefer the results from cooking \u2013 such good meals, but I need to cut down a little...\u201d <br>\r\nSamantha created amused look and said \u201cYes, I understand! You are afraid of gaining a few. Oh yes, this can be the price for the pleasure of the cooking. But my man every time says that bones are for dogs and he is not dog, but real man.\u201d<br>\r\nAshley smiled back to Samantha \u201cI know that saying about bones for dogs, my dad use it sometimes, when he is talking about mom...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ladies returned to the business center after their short digestion. When they went from the garage, Ashley was fascinated by Samantha\u2019s laborious walking. Samantha had again high-heeled shoes on her foots. Ashley thought that these shoes have to be somehow specially made and probably reinforced. Ashley had to admit, that Samantha\u2019s legs looks round and well, even they are so thick. When they arrived to office, breathless Samantha plopped down to her roomy chair and asked Ashley for the cup coffee. Ashley prepared Samantha\u2019s coffee and did one for herself as well. She had the muffins, which she bought in the morning. In the afternoon came Clara and asked Ashley for help with filling of some accounting forms. Ashley agreed to help to Clara of course and both girls start the work. Later in the afternoon Clara stopped the work and said \u201cWe need some rest and refreshment\u201d. With that decision she went to the office kitchen and brought back several sandwiches and coke for both. They spend some time with chatting and eating of the sandwiches before they returned back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At 5 o\u2019clock Samantha had regular meeting with other managers. Samantha asked Ashley to come and create meeting minutes for them. Nora and Tessa arrived on their power wheelchairs. Nora had large box with her. She asked Ashley to place the box on the table and open it. It was full of very delicious sweets. Then came remaining managers George, Alice and Peter. Before Samantha started the meeting, Nora invited all \u201cHelp yourself, we have to consume these samples, it would be pity to throw them\u201d. Nora saw, that Ashley hesitated and said \u201cAshley, don't hesitate, it is for all. Take some and enjoy...\u201d. The meeting took more time, than it was expected. On the other side Ashley and other ladies ate most of the sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 8 o'clock in the evening, when Ashley left the office. When Ashley got home, she felt quite tired but curiously hungry. Ashley opened her fridge, but nothing too interesting was there. She was thinking, what to do. Suddenly she had an idea \u2013 there was contact for the pizzeria on the notice board in her office, but what was the number or the name of the pizzeria? It took her some time to recover the name \u201cBig Italian\u201d and the she quickly opened the laptop and found the menu. All pizzas and pastas looked all so very well. Ashley decided to order medium pizza quattro formaggi and called the pizzeria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPizzeria Big Italian, good evening, how can I help you?\u201d  the voice form phone asked<br>\r\n\u201cI'd like to order medium izza quattro formaggi\u201d Ashley said<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but if you order the large pizza, you will receive two pieces of tiramisu and coke for one price\u201d the voice responded<br>\r\nAshley was thinking \u201cTiramisu would be great and I can finish the pizza tomorrow morning\u201d and ordered \u201cYes, i'll take the large pizza with coke and tiramisu, thank you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the delivery boy arrived with pizza, Ashley was truly hungry so she managed to eat the whole large pizza. She was full, but the tiramisu looked so inviting. She hesitated little bit, but in the end she prepared coffee. As she saw it in the office, Ashley put sugar and cream to her cup of coffee and dug in the tiramisu. She went to shower totally stuffed. She examined her curves, especially her distended belly in the shower. She was not sure, but it looked to her, that the layer of the fat is little thicker, than she remembered. She was surprised, the it was not unpleasant feeling as it should be. Anyhow Ashley went to bed with diet on her mind..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Friday, the 3rd day of Ashley in the Gourmet heaven. Ashley got up earlier this morning and went to the bathroom to take the shower. She felt quite hungry, so she went to examine her fridge. Ashley was somehow dissatisfied with the health food like low-fat milk and some low-fat yoghurt. Ashley even had no cream for her coffee, because she used all yesterday in the evening. So in the end she prepared bowl of cereals with yoghurt and strawberry jam. Ashley was not still satisfied, but in the end she found some chocolate and she grated it on top of her meal. This was already little better breakfast option.<br>\r\nIn the office Ashley went for the second breakfast with Samantha and Alice. She took large portion of scrambled eggs and fried bacon. This time she even didn't consider some more healthy options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning was Ashley working on the standard office stuff and was looking forward for the lunch. Ashley went for the lunch with Clara, Anna and Dana. During their substantial meal they discussed, what they will do during the weekend. Anna and Dana said that they will go to swim on the Saturday afternoon. This was quite surprising for Ashley, when she saw their corpulent figures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna asked \u201cand what about you, girls? Don't you want to join us and spend nice Saturday afternoon?\u201d <br>\r\nAshley considered her options and agreed \u201cI\u2019d like to join, if you don't mind\u201d. Immediately she had in her mind that she has to buy new swim suite for tomorrow. <br>\r\nDana said \u201cOf course, Ashley, please join us, you are welcome and what about you Clara?\u201d <br>\r\nClara decided \u201cYes, actually I have no other plan for the Saturday, so I\u2019ll come\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana said \u201cNice, so let's meet by the pool at two o'clock in the afternoon and probably will come Claire one our external colleague as well, she is nice\u201d.<br>\r\nAfter lunch the ladies returned to the office. Ashley had to organize a few meetings for the office members. She was almost done, when Nora waddled into her office with huge effort with folder some papers in right hand and some box in her left hand. Nora, totally breathless and glistening with perspiration sat down quickly to remove heavy burden from her thick legs and placed the folder and the box on the table. Ashley was surprised, that Nora didn't come on her wheelchair, but Nora explained it \u201cOh (pant), my wheelchair (gasp) is broken (pant) and all this (gasp) walking is (pant) killing me (gasp)\u201d. With that said, Nora had to wait and recover at least a little bit before she could continue to speak. Ashley was happy, that her office was equipped with such sturdy furniture, because she was able to see the immense lady sitting by the table on the chair which was softly creaking under its load. Nora\u2019s heavy bosom was spreading in front of her and even partially resting on the edge on the Ashley\u2019s table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora asked Ashley \u201eAshley, do you have time? I need some help, if you can\u2026\u201d when she recovered.<br>\r\nAshley said \u201cactually, in a few minutes I\u2019ll have some time, what can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI need transcription of several hand written recipes to computer format, my girls are working on other batches and we are little behind the schedule to have our new cookbook ready in time\u201d said Nora.<br>\r\n\u201cI can help you with that\u201d said Ashley and smiled back to Nora \u201cI\u2019m quite good and fast in typing\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cAshley, it\u2019s great from you\u201d Nora replied and handed the folder with hand written papers to Ashley. The Nora passed the box to Ashley and added \u201cand here you have something, how make your work more pleasant\u201d.<br>\r\nAshley saw that this is box full of some interesting tidbits and complained \u201cNora, you are too kind, I can\u2019t take it\u201d.<br>\r\nBut Nora said with smile \u201cNo, you have to take it, if you want to help me\u201d. So Ashley accepted the box gratefully \u201cthank you very much, it looks very delicious\u201d.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora had to try to get up several times before she succeeded. Then she heavily waddled out from Ashley\u2019s office with her large buttocks slowly swaying.  <br>\r\nAshley opened the box and tried one tidbit. It was truly very tasty canap\u00e9 based on the delicious creamy rich cheese. After Ashley savoured the tidbit, she started to work on the transcriptions, but slowly she developed the style, that she did transcription of one recipe and took one canap\u00e9 from the box. Unfortunately the box was empty shortly before she finished transcription of all the recipes. When Ashley was done, she sent transcriptions by mail to Nora took the folder with the papers and went to Nora\u2019s office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley entered to the office, handed the folder to Nora and said \u201cI\u2019m done; you have the transcriptions in your mailbox\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you already done?\u201d Nora asked pleasantly surprised.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was not difficult\u201d Ashley replied and added \u201cand the tidbits were so very great\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m glad, that you liked them, I like them as well\u2026\u201d Nora said smiling on Ashley \u201cmy dear, you helped me so much. I hope that you will take the coffee with me now, please\u2026\u201d Nora tried to get up, but was not successful for her first attempt. <br>\r\nWhen Ashley saw Nora\u2019s effort said \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll prepare it of course, don\u2019t get up.\u201d  <br>\r\nNora happily agreed \u201cOk, you are nice. Please bring me full cream and sugar. There is chocolate cake, truly great chocolate cake, so bring it to us as well\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley returned in a while with coffee for both and brought full cream, sugar as well as quite large chocolate cake. Nora took the knife, divided the cake to two halves and handed the  generous portion to Ashley. Both ladies were sitting, chatting and enjoying sweet taste of the chocolate cake. Ashley mentioned, that she was very interested in recipes \u201call of the meals in the recipes looked so very well\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we select only the best of course\u201d Nora said and added \u201cour cookbooks use even the best chefs in the world\u201d.<br>\r\nAshley said with dreaming look \u201csometimes I\u2019d like to know to cook and be able to prepare some great meal...\u201d<br>\r\nNora replied with smile \u201cDear, it is easy, you only have to try it. But be careful, it can be pretty addictive\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coffee with Nora had Ashley return to her office and prepare some tables for Samantha, but at half past five Ashley was done, so she could leave the office. She was heading to the mall to buy the new swimsuit. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley arrived to the mall and went to the shop to select her new swimsuit. She found nice red bikini and turquoise one piece swimwear with proper size and support for her breasts. She tried them both, examined herself in the mirror. She had to ask questions like \u201caren't my breasts even larger then they were? Is not the layer of the fat on my belly, but and thighs even thicker? Aren't my hips even wider?\u201d. Ashley selected the bikini which better highlighted her curves in her opinion.  Ashley paid for the swimsuit and decided to go for the lunch to her favorite Chinese buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Ashley had large serving of white rice with fried chicken meat and of course her favorite chicken soap and large Coke. She was quite full after rich meal, but not completely satisfied. So Ashley decided to visit the ice cream parlor. There was the same busty girl like the last time, who greeted Ashley with smile \u201cgood evening, nice to see you again!\u201d<br>\r\nAshley was surprised, that the girl remembered her, but responded for the greeting \u201cgood evening, what you will recommend me today? Last time it was so great\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cToday we have very original banana split, it is truly delicious. We have sweet bananas, great ice-creams \u2013 vanilla and chocolate you know and strawberry one is great and fresh as well\u201d the waitress responded.<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds truly good\u201d Ashley said impressed and ordered large Frappe coffee as well. <br>\r\n\u201cOf course, great selection\u201c waitress responded and turned to prepare the order. <br>\r\nAshley was able to see that the seams on the white outfit were even more strained than the last time and thought \u201cyes, at least I\u2019m not only one, who gains some weight\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banana split and the coffee were truly delicious and Ashley enjoyed her eating. Full and satisfied Ashley headed home. She laid on the sofa and switched on the TV. Later in the evening she was feeling the desire for something special. Ashley was thinking, what to select. In the end she took bitter chocolate bar and returned to her sofa. When Ashley slowly relished few pieces of the dark bitter chocolate, she felt thirsty. Ashley went to the kitchen and opened the fridge. First of all she took one bottle of the mineral water as usually. Then she hesitated for a while with her eyes on the bottle of Muller milk with vanilla flavor. Ashley imagined the sweet taste of this milk with her bitter chocolate. This combination was so inviting and delightful, that Ashley narrowed her eyes and took immediate decision. She returned the mineral water back to fridge and took her vanilla Muller milk. Before Ashley went to bad, the whole 300g bar of chocolate and the bottle of the sweet milk disappeared.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was fully satisfied so she slept very well. Ashley got up later into the sunny Saturday morning. She felt quite hungry as every time in these last days. For the first time Ashley prepared full English breakfast and enjoyed it on her balcony. The weather looked very promising for her plan to do some swimming with her friends. The idea of swimming in the afternoon gave excuse to Ashley, so she spent whole morning lazing and sunbathing in her balcony without any remorse. Ashley received the call from her mom during the lazy morning. Mom invited Ashley for Sunday dinner and Ashley accepted with something very tasty on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore noon Ashley packed her swimsuit, towel, bathrobe and other accessories to the beach bag and headed for lunch in near pizzeria. When Ashley finished her favorite pizza quattro formaggi, she felt truly stuffed especially thanks to her constraining jeans which were not still replaced with larger size. Ashley\u2019s full belly was overflowing her pants and their button was under truly strong pressure. Ashley was happy, that she selected a longer loose blouse without sleeves which covered her fight with her pants.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf past one Ashley arrived to swimming pool. In front of the compound were already waiting Anna and Clara comfortably seated on the settle. Ashley joined them and after a while they were able to see Danna coming, better say waddling together with huge black girl. Ashley thought \u201cthis heavy black girl has to be Claire\u201d. When Danna and black girl come to rest of the group, Dana said \u201cHi girls, we are here, let me introduce Claire to Ashley. Ashley, this is Claire. Claire, this is Ashley, our new secretary\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley tried not to stare on the on the very big girl. Claire had broad lovely face with nice white teeth which nicely contrasted with her dark skin. Claire has no neck visible, because her second and third chins were touching her abundant bosom. Claire\u2019s breasts created long cleavage clearly visible in quite snug low-cut colorful sun dress. The bra was obviously too small for Claire\u2019s heavy assets, because her breast were overflowing from the bra cups. Under the breasts had its place the big belly divided into two big folds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley quickly smiled to Claire and said \u201cClaire, it is nice to meet you\u201d<br>\r\nAlmost breathless Claire but with nice bright smile responded \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to meet you Ashley\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introduction the whole group slowly headed into the swimming pool entrance. The girls bought the tickets and went to change into the locker room. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley changed to her red bikini quickly and looked around other girls. Voluptuous Clara was ready as well and she nice blue bikini. Ashley had to admit in her mind, that Clara looks great in them even they looked little bit too snug. Claire was fighting to place all her voluminous curves to the large white bikini to Ashley\u2019s big surprise. Claire\u2019s bikini was in great contrast to her dark skin and Ashley was surprised, how well Claire looked in them. Anna and Dana with their corpulent bodies were more conservative and they had one piece swimsuits both. When all girls changed to their swimsuits, they headed to the deckchairs placed in pool area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls stopped by the buffet to buy some refreshments during their way to the deckchairs by the pool. Claire explained them, that even it is quite small place, that they have very good items there. The girls bought lots of recommended homemade chips, nachos, popcorn and some sodas like Sprite and Coke. They organized their deckchairs to be able comfortably chat and sunbathe. When Claire sat down to her deckchair heavily, it creaked quite loudly under such heavy burden, but the design and material were sturdy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some chatting the girls decided to go to the water and cool little bit. Ashley jumped to the pool with elegance of the professional swimmer. Clara, Nora and Dana used the standard steps on the side of the pool, but it was not the possibility for the broad and heavy Claire. Luckily the large pool was equipped with broad steps for comfortable entry and exit from the pool. Obviously some it was used by people with similar issues like Claire or by mothers with children. Even it was possible to use these steps even for comfortable sitting in the cooling water of the pool. Girls were swimming, playing a lazing in the pool. Claire was more or less slowly walking in the water or simply sitting on the stairs. She simply enjoyed  how the water reduced heavy burden of her legs. Other girls were like comets around her. They moved away from her and returned back to her again. Most of the swimming did the Ashley of course. She even used such things like long toboggan as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time in the water the girls returned to to their deckchairs and enjoyed the warm sun and their refreshments. Claire was talking between her bites about the procedure, how are prepared these delicious chips. Ashley was surprised, that even production of chips can be almost something like an art. Ashley was thinking about it and said \u201csometimes I\u2019d like to know more about cooking. I'm almost unable to prepare anything. I just was retyping some recipes and there was some some nice one called Schwarzwald's cake, but it is so complicated...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not that difficult\u201d Claire smiled \u201cif you will spread my back with suntan, I can do it with you even tomorrow, if you which of course\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Ashley \u201cit would be great, I could surprise my mom in the afternoon visit\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u201d Claire smiled and added \u201cI have free time tomorrow in the morning, so I you like...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is pleasure, thank you\u201d Ashley said happily<br>\r\n\u201cAnd by the way I like the original  Schwarzwald's cake so it is my pleasure\u201d Claire added and handed bottle with suntan to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley took the bottle little nervously. She was very interested, how it is to touch skin of such radiant beauty. Claire removed her bra straps and Ashley can see, how the straps digged in Claire's shoulders. Ashley put the suntan on her hands and started to softly massage Claire's shoulders. Ashley felt soft smooth flesh flowing under her hands. In reality Ashley liked this feeling for her big surprise. Even Claire looked, that she enjoyed the light massaged. Lower Ashley was able to touch the voluminous folds beginning on the back. Now in Claire's sitting position these folds looked more like tires of the truck and Ashley could feel how soft they are. Interesting and disturbing idea popped in Ashley's head \u201cbe big can be even pleasant\u201d.<br>\r\nGirls enjoyed the lazing in hot weather for some time and went to play to the pool again. When they returned back to their deckchairs Ashley automatically asked \u201cClaire, do you want to spread back with suntan again?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it would be nice from you my dear\u201d Claire said and this time laid on her big belly and breasts with groaning. The deckchair accepted its load with creaking again. <br>\r\n\u201cShould I open you bra?\u201d asked Ashley<br>\r\n\u201cYes, please\u201d responded relaxing Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was slowly working on the Claire's large and soft body and Claire enjoyed the massage. This time was Ashley working even on the broad backside and Claire's tree trunk thighs. The flesh of Claire's body was moving under Ashley's hands like the gelatin. Previous playing in the water created appetite for all the girls and so they decided to go for some hearty snack. Claire advised to visit the second buffet in the swimming pool area, because they had great hot dogs and hamburgers there. Claire accentuated even great quality of the meat and which is used for the cooking in this buffet. All hungry girls agreed and went there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aroma in the buffet was very inviting. Dana ordered two maxi hot dogs, two large hamburgers with doubled fries and tartare sauce. Nora did very similar order, only had one hamburger and one cheeseburger. Clara ordered maxi hot dog and large cheeseburger with fries. Ashley wanted only the large cheeseburger with fries originally, but Claire which was the slowest on her way to the buffet turned to Ashley and said \u201dhoney, you have to taste the hot dog here definitely\u201d. Than Claire turned to the waiter and ordered the hot dog for Ashley as well \u201cand one maxi hot dog for this girl as well\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHi Claire, your wish is fulfilled in advance\u201d the waiter said with big smile and asked \u201cand what about you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor me two maxi hot dogs, two cheeseburgers, two hamburgers and of course lots of fries, you know me\u201d Claire replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls paid for their heavy snack and started to eat. Ashley was truly amazed by the rich and spicy taste of both hot dog and cheeseburger. She ate surprisingly ravenously. Even all the girls were truly more than satisfied and praised Claire for the recommendation. All of them, including Claire were totally stuffed in the end. They sprawled comfortably in their chairs and were sipping their sodas, massaged their full bellies, chatted and enjoyed nice afternoon. When the girls digested their meal at least a little, they decided to go to pool once more. This time they were not too active and were relaxing in the pleasant water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girls got out from the pool, they enjoyed last warm rays of the afternoon Sun. Later, when the air cooled, they decided to finish their stay in the pool area. All the girls headed back to locker rooms to change from swimsuits to their normal clothing. Ashley had to wave and pull the trousers up over her thighs and hips, but then she found, that her belly is still distended from her heavy snack. She was struggling with the button on her very tight jeans. Ashley blushed. She sucked her belly as much as possible and with effort she succeeded. She was very happy, that the loose top covered her belly spilling over the top of her jeans. Outside the pool area the girls were saying goodbye and discussing their plans for the evening.</span></div></div>",

Then Claire waddled closer to Ashley and asked with smile \u201dso Ashley, my dear, do you have kitchen at home?\u201d<br>\r\nAshley replied \u201cYes I have of course, but it is true, that I don't use it too often...\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo do you have oven, form and blender?\u201d Claire asked <br>\r\n\u201cI don't have form, but yes, I have blender and electric oven\u201d Ashley said<br>\r\nClaire replied \u201cok, we should do some shopping, before we start. Do you have some time just now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I have! Claire, you are so kind\u201d Ashley responded<br>\r\nClaire commanded Ashley \u201cLet's go to the car, my legs hurts, if I stand so much. You can follow my pickup to the mall\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire slowly waddled to her pickup breathing heavily. She got up to the car with evident exertion and load groaning. Claire's belly and colossal breasts almost touched the steering wheel. Claire even had some issues to close the door of the car. When Ashley car stopped behind Claire's pickups, Ashley was able to see, the pickup inclined to the left side. Then they both headed to the mall to buy cooking equipment and ingredients.<br>\r\nWhen they arrived to the mall, Claire explained to Ashley, that this is quite special mall, where  they have very especially fine ingredients and professional equipment for the chefs. The went slowly thru the mall and did their shopping. Ashley was now equipped with new baking form for the cakes with 30cm in diameter. They bought ingredients for three Schwarzwald's cakes, just to be sure as Claire said. Claire explained to Ashley lots of new things, how to buy the 1st class ingredients for Ashley's cooking. When they finished all this shopping, Claire felt tired and quite  hungry, so she asked \u201cSo what about some great dinner? I know great place and it is not that far...\u201d<br>\r\nAshley was not that hungry, but she liked to be with Claire and to absorb so much new things about cooking. So she agreed \u201cit would be nice of course\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo both of them moved to the all you can eat buffet which was 5 minutes from the mall. They had great dinner there and Ashley was totally stuffed in the end. In the end she managed to eat several  plates loaded by food including lots of sweet deserts. Ashley's belly was full and hard as the rock. When she said good bye to Claire and sat to her car, she heard tearing sound as seams of her too stressed jeans got up their work on her curvy behind. Ashley was quite embarrassed and thought \u201cIt is good luck, that it happened on my way home and no one could see it! I have to cut back, I event ruined my jeans! I have to start diet from Monday definitely\u201d.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ashley returned home, removed her ruined jeans and took her favorite position on the sofa and switched her TV on. After a while she felt somehow dissatisfied. For a short time she was fighting with herself, but her sweet tooth won. Ashley she got up, went to the kitchen, prepared her coffee with lots of cream and brown sugar. She started to use brown sugar instead of the white one, because the brown sugar was more natural and she liked its taste more. She took her coffee and large bar of dark bitter chocolate back to TV. Now, slowly melting the chocolate in her mouth and sipping sweet coffee, she felt satisfied, very satisfied. Later she went to her bad full and happy. Immediately she fell asleep with Schwarzwald's cake in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning Ashley got up in advance. She prepared hearty breakfast based to be ready for the baking. At 8 o\u2019clock Claire arrived. Even Ashley was living on the 2nd floor, Claire tried to use the elevator. Unfortunately the elevator was broken, so she had to use the stairs and it was truly hard work. Claire was glistening with perspiration and panting, when she arrived to Ashley's door. Both girls hugged. Ashley was liked the soft touch of Claire\u2019s abundant body. Ashley led the Claire to the kitchen where Claire sat down heavily and chair creaked under her weight. Claire was almost too out of breath that she cant complain about the broken elevator \u201cOh (pant) my (gasp) these stairs (pant) are (gasp) killing me (pant). I'm (gasp) parched (pant)...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley handed cold Coke to Claire and started to prepare cup of sweet coffee as well. When Claire recovered from her exertion, she started to teach Ashley, how to prepare the Schwarzwald's cake.</span></div></div>",

But it was clear, that Ashley is quite skilled and Claire saw it \u201cAshley, dear, you have talent\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think so?\u201d flattered Ashley asked<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do, of course. I can see it...\u201d Claire responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ashley finished decoration of the first cake with Claire's leadership, both of them were very interested, how it will taste. Anyhow it looked very great for the 1st Ashley's attempt. Ashley quickly prepared two cups of the fresh coffee with cream and server slice of the Schwarzwald's cake to Claire and to herself. Claire took her dessert fork, slowly cut of the first morsel and examined the structure and said \u201cAshley, it looks great, so lets taste it, I\u2019m so interested...\u201d. Claire put first bite to her mouth and chewed it slowly. She swallowed the morsel and cheered \u201choney, it is truly great, it is so great!!!\u201d Claire continued to eat her slice methodically and it was obvious, that she enjoyed the every single morsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had lightweight button-up sundress today. Dress were quite loose once Claire was standing, but when Claire was sitting, the dress were very snug around her globular breasts and bulging belly folds. Ashley could see between the buttons belly flesh with deep naval, piece of white overflowing bra and small piece of white panties. As Claire was speeding her eating, Ashley could see, the even Claire's hard nipples clearly visible against tight bra and dress. Ashley thought \u201cthe cake have to be truly great, if Claire is so aroused\u201c and took her first bite. Delicious taste of the festive dessert took immediately all her attention. The taste was so rich and so sweet, that Ashley almost closed her eyes from all this delight. Suddenly she understand, how ti is possible, that Claire is aroused. Both girls were eating until the whole large cake disappeared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done with the cake, Claire was sitting comfortably and fondling her belly and breasts. She  said \u201cWow, Ashley, that was wonderful! I love Schwarzwald's cake and you know well, how to prepare it\u201d.<br>\r\nAshley agreed \u201cYes, it is delicious recipe, I\u2019m glad, that you explained me, how to bake it, thank you so much\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley felt quite full, but she truly liked this feeling in reality, because she has no constraining clothes on. She was not aware, but now she was very near to the point, when she will completely change and no return will be possible. Without too much thinking she started to work on the second cake and again even this one looked great, when she finished the decoration. She put the cake the the fridge and asked Claire \u201cand what about some lunch Claire?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBrilliant idea\u201d quickly responded Claire patting her big belly and added with smile \u201ceven after the cake, there is definitely some space for something delicious and by the way we need to protect the second cake for your visit\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I order some pizza or pasta?\u201d Ashley asked<br>\r\nClaire was thinking a little and responded \u201cLarge pizza is great idea\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end both girls ordered over interned 3 large pizzas to share and Ashley started to work on the last cake. Even this third cake looked damn great. When Claire saw the results, she said \u201cyou should the a piece to Samantha tomorrow. She will like it definitely\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think so? I'm not sure, if I can...\u201c Ashley said <br>\r\n\u201cYes, you should try and believe me, it is great. And Samantha likes, when the people in the office are active\u201d Claire responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ashley put the third cake to the fridge, she was little nervous, because the pizza still doesn't arrived and she felt surprisingly empty. Luckily shortly after she cleaned her kitchen the pizza arrived and girls could move the the living room and start to gorge with hot pizza. When the girls were done with pizza, they leaned back, relaxed, sipped sweet Coke and digested.  Ashley's belly was stuffed and visible under her quite prominent breasts. Even Claire's dress were even more snug around her belly. When they digested, Claire said good bye and started the difficult way to her car. Ashley took the second cake and headed to the visit of her parents.</span></div></div>",

She liked the touch especially with ample mom\u2019s soft flesh. She said \u201cI have a surprise for today here\u201d and went to back the car for the Schwarzwald's cake. When she returned the cake, all of them were surprised. Ashley\u2019s mom even didn\u2019t believe on the beginning that Ashley created and decorated such great looking cake herself and asked \u201cAshley, you did it truly herself? It looks unbelievably great!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I did it myself. I had Claire, my new great friend, at home and she lead me, but I did it truly myself\u201d Ashley replied proudly<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Ashley, you have to teach me, how to prepare it!\u201d mom sad with professional interest<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, mom!\u201d Ashley said happily<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks to me, that you have something from me\u2026\u201d Ashley\u2019s mom smiled<br>\r\n\u201cSis, are you returning to our family?\u201d Ashley\u2019s sister asked with smile<br>\r\n\u201cIt can be\u2026\u201d Ashley admitted with smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them moved to the garden, because this time Ashley\u2019s mom prepared large barbecue with lots of juicy chicken and pork meat. Ashley\u2019s dad was standing by the grill and prepared delicious pieces of meat while the ladies were sitting on the garden and eating with gusto. Later after the blow-out the ladies were stuffed and sitting comfortably leaned back in their chairs and chatting. Ashley was talking about her new work in the Gourmet heaven and about her enjoyments with her new friends. Ashley\u2019s mom was very interested in the mall, where Ashley bought the ingredients for the cake, so she asked \u201cCan you show me the mall, where you was with Claire?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, we can meet tomorrow in the afternoon and I\u2019ll take you there. And we can the dinner in great all-you-can-eat buffet which is there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, this is great plan, I have time tomorrow in the afternoon\u201d mom said<br>\r\n\u201cCan I join you?\u201d asked Ashley\u2019s sister Jane.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course sis, so let\u2019s meet tomorrow at 6 pm here?\u201d Ashley responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and sis agreed on the term and moved inside the house to have the coffee and cake. Mom still little full from all the grilled meat got up quite heavily and said \u201cOh, this is great to eating is such pleasure, even if one gains a few\u2026 Now my taste buds are ready for your cake Ashley\u201d. <br>\r\nAshley herself was quite happy for her sweatpants which provided enough space for her full belly in comparison with her ruined jeans.  Ashley\u2019s dad prepared the coffee and served slices of the cookie to the ladies. Mom took her first bite and savored the rich sweet taste of the Schwarzwald's cake. She was immediately captured by this amazing taste and said \u201cOh my, oh my, oh my, this is delicious! Ashley, you have the talent\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nSister agreed with mom \u201cYes, this is truly so tasty and sweet. I have to learn it as well, mmmmm\u201d moaned from the pleasure and continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them were eating like there is no tomorrow. After a short while the whole cake disappeared and the ladies were digesting and recovering from their food coma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, when Ashley returned to home, she went to take the shower. She examined her slowly softening body in the hot water and was thinking about Claire\u2019s plush and soft body, about her ample mom and very womanly looking sister. She was somehow envious for their curvy bodies. When Ashley finished her shower, she went to bed. Even she felt quite sleepy and tired, she can\u2019t sleep. She had to get up and went to the kitchen to prepare her regular sweet creamy coffee with bar of the bitter chocolate. Then, fully satisfied with heavy sweet taste, she went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning Ashley took the last cake from the fridge because she wanted to share it with her colleagues. She hurried to office. When Ashley arrived to the office, she put the cake to the fridge and started her computer. During sorting of the mails and calendar events Ashley found, that she quite hungry. Fortunately she hadn\u2019t wait for a long time and her coworkers came to invite her for the hearty breakfast. <br>\r\nAt 9 o\u2019clock heavily panting Samantha waddled into her office. When Samantha recovered from exertion asked Ashley to invite Nora and Tessa for regular management meeting. Ashley called them. Nora and Tessa arrived comfortably seated in their power wheelchairs in short time. The ladies ordered the coffee whit lots of whipped cream from Ashley. When Ashley returned with their cups of coffee nicely decorated with whipped cream, Tessa\u2019s bulky globular belly rumbled with anticipation. Tessa said \u201cIt looks tasty, it would be great to have something sweet with this nice coffee\u201d.</span></div></div>",

Later come George the Gourmet heaven IT manager to ask Ashley, if everything works well. Ashley decided to invite George for cup of coffee and he accepted this offer. George wanted strong black espresso and Ashley prepared sweet creamy coffee for herself to celebrate her success with cake. Ashley and George were sipping their coffee and talking. When he left the office, Ashley was thinking, how lovely man he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was disturbed from her thoughts by the doorbell. For Ashley\u2019s surprise, there was Claire waiting by the office door. Ashley greeted with the globular beauty \u201cClaire, my dear, nice to see you!

Claire opened her bag and took out the papers with some box and shifted them to Ashley wit comment \u201chere are my papers and I brought you something for your sweet tooth\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley saw, that Claire brought twenty for great looking cream puffs, immediately she felt surprisingly hungry and said \u201cClaire, thank you so much, you are so nice\u201d. Ashley proposed cup of coffee to the lazed Claire. Ashley served large glasses of coffee with whipped cream and decorated with grated chocolate and started process Claire\u2019s papers. During the work she enjoyed sweet flavor of the sweet puffs and sips of her coffee. Ashley shared the cream puffs with Claire of course. After half of an hour the papers were sorted out successfully and all the cream puffs disappeared. Ashley\u2019s belly was full and distended, so she had to lean back in her chair to relax little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire asked \u201cAshley, what are your plans for the evening?\u201d<br>\r\nAshley replied \u201cActually I have no plans for today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this conversation Samantha\u2019s office broad door were opened and Tessa arrived on her wheelchair to the Ashley\u2019s office. Tessa saw Claire seated in the chair and said \u201cHi Claire, I\u2019m glad to see you; I just wanted to ring you up, because I have work for you\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNice and what shell I do?\u201d asked Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa replied \u201cYou know my friend from Big Pony. They are working on new menu and they need to check the quality and some recommendation. They hope, that if it will be as successful as the last one was\u2026\u201c, Tessa looked from Claire to Ashley and added \u201c\u2026and you can take your friend as well, because they will be ready today in the evening. Ashley, are you interested, aren't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was surprised and little confused \u201c\u2026of course I\u2019m, but I know nothing about this job\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa said \u201cAshley, don\u2019t worry, it looks, that you have talent. By the way Claire is my best external consultant; you can learn lots from her, if you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley agreed to take part in Claire\u2019s degustation mission without other hesitation. Tessa smiled on the girls, said good bye to Claire and left Ashley\u2019s office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire encouraged Ashley \u201cAsh, don\u2019t worry this will be nice work and it will be great to have friend there. They have great chef and large portions there. You will see, so let\u2019s meet at 6PM here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ashley said good bye to Claire, Samantha waddled to the Ashley\u2019s office with smile on her lips \u201cAshley, you truly impressed us with your great cake. I hope, that you will enjoy your first degustation session. And now let\u2019s go for some generous lunch, I\u2019m so very hungry\u201d. Ashley followed her bulky boss to the car. Ashley was almost surprised, that Samantha can walk in her surprisingly tight skirt and on high heels.   <br>\r\nAshley and Samantha had great full lunch in small Italian restaurant near to the office center and both of them were stuffed with great lasagna and sweet tiramisu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen stuffed Samantha was struggling to get into her SUV, they could hear loud rip followed by several pops. Samantha's overfilled skirt ripped in seams and the freed doughy flesh of her heavy belly pushed created too much pressure on the pure white blouse, so the buttons popped. Little surprised Samantha said \u201cWow, it looks, that I just ruined my business skirt suite!\u201d and explored her soft assets with her hands and added \u201cyes, yes, I put on some\u201d.   </span></div></div>",

It is not that far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u201d nodded surprised Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha started the car and headed to her house. After few minutes they stopped by large house. Samantha invited Ashley inside the house, seated her to the comfortable sofa in the living room. On the table coffee table were paced bowls with selected chocolate, candied fruits and some chips. Samantha was holding her ripped skirt in one hand and with her free hand she showed on the bowls and said with smile \u201cAshley, help yourself. Especially you should try the chocolate from the blue bowl, it is great\u201d. With that said, Samantha waddled to other room to  exchange her ruined clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was still stuffed from the lunch, but she was not able to resist the chocolate on the coffee table and yes, the taste of the chocolate from blue bowl was so addictive. After few minutes Ashley was able to see her immense boss slowly walking from the bedroom almost naked in her white bra and panties. Samantha headed to bathroom obviously. Her large fat belly was divided into two large folds. The lower fold partially covered by the panties was reaching below the half of sturdy thighs.  On top of the top belly fold were spilling Samantha's breasts. Samantha's body jiggled with every laborious step and this made her breast to wave and to try to escape the constraining bra. From behind Ashley was able to see undulating broad hips and large cottage cheese buttocks. Ashley had no negative feelings during this show, on the contrary she reminded Claires's dark soft and smooth body and imagined, how soft have to be even larger and heavier Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was melting delicious chocolate in her mouth and looking around the living room. She was able to see set of pictures where was Samantha posing most probably with her husband. On the oldest pictures was Samantha plump and on the most recent she was already quite heavy. Her husband was quite tall and probably muscular man and on every picture he embraced his ever growing wife. He had so delightful grimace, that it was more than clear, that he enjoys this close contact with his soft wife. Ashley remembered similar feelings, which she was able to see on her dad, when he was looking or hugging her mother. At this moment she had to think about George from Gourmet heaven and for short time she imagined herself in his hands. Her thought were interrupted by Samantha's voice \u201cAshley, my dear, please come to help me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley got up and followed the voice coming from the bathroom \u201cOf course, I'm coming\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ashley came to the bathroom, she could see heard shape of Samantha's huge rear as she  was bent down and trying to reach something under the basin. Samantha straightened with load groan and wheezed \u201cOooof, I can't reach there...(wheeze) for the scale\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was Ashley able to see large industrial weight scale scale under the basin. Ashley squeezed by her voluminous boss and moved the scale to the middle of the bathroom. She was very surprised by it's remote display, which she placed on the basin. Samantha stepped on the scale and placed palms on the sides of her soft globular belly. The red numbers on the display started to blink. When the number stabilized, there was shining 440lbs. Samantha looked at the display and said \u201cWow, it is not surprising, that the walking is so hard these days. I added another 20 pounds this year! What one can do! Lets go to dress...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha heavily waddled back to the bedroom, her booty was shaking and thunder thighs were touching from her bottom to the knees. Ashley placed the scale back under the basin and went to the living room. She was thinking about her hefty manager and again she put eyes on the snapshots. Not only the husband, but even Samantha looked so happy on these pictures. Ashley set down to the sofa and automatically put another piece of chocolate to melt in her mouth. Again she had to thing about her mom and dad. It was obvious, that you can have nice life even with some additional weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNewly dressed Samantha entered to the living room and said \u201cI'm ready, lets go to the office\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had nice loose summer dress with deep neckline where she presented large amount of cleavage. It was interesting to see, that the dress were loose, when Samantha was standing, but when she was seated in her SUV, they were quite snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afternoon Ashley had to prepare process some papers, prepare some invoices and schedule several business meetings for Samantha and Tessa. She was almost done, when Nora arrived with slight buzz on her wheelchair and asked \u201cAshley, my dear, I need some help again. Do you think, that you will have some time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll try, what can I do for you Nora?\u201d asked Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have here some recipes again and I need to rewrite them...\u201d said Nora and tapped by her plump fingers on folder of papers which she had on her vast bosom \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll be done in a few minutes with these papers and then I can work on it. It was very interesting last time. I backed the Schwarzwald's cake from them.\u201d said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora smiled on Ashley, passed folder with recipes to her as well as the bag with some box in it \u201cI have some sweet bonus for you of course and thank you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley thanked to Nora and continued to work on the papers. When all of them were processed, she opened the folder with recipes. She took first one and opened text editor. At this moment she stopped, put the recipe back and opened the bag with the box. There was formed set of twelve tempting doughnuts. Ashley felt her mouth watering.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley didn't know a thing about Gourmet Heaven so she was reluctant to take the job. She wanted to go home and do a little research. She thanked Samantha for the opportunity and let her know that she would be in touch. Ashley left the premises and headed home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home she pondered the job prospect. She was in dire need of employment and hadn't heard back from 99% of her applications. She knew she better take the job, Samantha seemed nice enough, how bad could it be? She gave Samantha a ring back and told her she could start tomorrow. Samantha sounded delighted, and Ashley was as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Ashley showed up a little early, just to make a good impression. She again pulled up in front of the Cake Kingdom building where she was going to be working. On her way in she passed the Sweet Shop where her interview had been. To be honest she was impressed with the campus this company had. The fact that her own building had it's own coffee shop was incredible. The rest of the building was as uniquely named as everything else. Since it was the Cake Kingdom each suite of offices was named after different flavors. She made her way to the Red Velvet office where she was going to be working. All the tasty names got her belly rumbling. After these treats yesterday Ashley had been craving something sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked into her set of offices she was shocked at what she saw. There was food everywhere. Baskets of cookies, and full on cakes on every surface in the office. The office was pretty small, just two windowed offices, and half a dozen cubicles. They had their own bathroom along with kitchen and conference room. The walls were covered with filing cabinets and tables. Typical office, except for the food spread. Ashley knew that when she took a job for Gourmet Heaven that they must have been in the food business some how, but what had she gotten her self into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley made her way to the back office where she knew Samantha would be awaiting her. She walked through the open door and was greeted with Samantha's warm smile and a hello. The girls said their pleasantries and carried on a conversation for a few minuets. Ashley couldn't help but notice the box of donuts that Samantha was eating through. Samantha offered Ashley one. Ashley had been taken aback by all the sinful food in the office, but she was still craving sweets after yesterday so she took her new boss up on her offer. Samantha kept offering until Ashley had eaten three and the box was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about a little office tour before we get you started.\" The large woman took her time getting up from what looked like a reinforced office chair. There were only four other women in the office and Ashley got introduced to all of them. The first thing she noticed was that all of these women were fat. She wasn't surprised after seeing Samantha, and also seeing the amount of sweets each woman had at her desk. First off was Nancy. Nancy was an accountant and had been here for a few years. She looked to be about 200 lbs and almost 30. Next was Tasha. Tasha was in HR. She had also been here for a few years but was much younger than Nancy. She had joined the company right out of college. She was only 25 but was already 230 lbs. Tasha was also probably the closet one to Ashley in age. The next cubicle over was Fran. Fran was probably a little younger than Samantha, late 30's. Fran was in charge of sales. She had been there for years and had a lot of experience at her job. She was definitely the biggest of the bunch at 330lbs. Well not as big as Samantha, not one touched her enormous size. Last in line was Denise. Denise was in the quality control department. She must have been the same age as Nancy judging by the old picture on her desk of them at a graduation much slimmer. Now it seemed like Denise was around 250, when she used to be such a twig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Samantha showed Ashley her desk right in front of her office. Samantha also told her to make her self at home and get comfortable, nothing was off limits. Throughout the day Ashley got acquainted with her new job. It was very different from being a fitness instructor. Throughout the day Samantha called on her to bring her treats. It seemed like Samantha never wanted her desk to be cleared of something to eat. She watched as her boss munched all day long. No wonder these women were so big, endless supply of free food and no restraint. Ashley helped herself to a few treats but tried not to over do it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Throughout the day as well the other women in the office would drop things off on Ashley's desk for Samantha. Along with their work they would leave Ashley a treat. Ashley had been tempted to eat them but refrained as she wasn't hungry. Soon they piled so high that Ashley decided to have something just to get it off her desk. She decided to have a slice of red velvet cake, after all it was the office specialty. The cake was delicious and she couldn't help but have another slice. Later on as she passed Tasha's desk she thanked her for the cake. \"It's to die for isn't it.\" The chubby blond gushed. Ashley couldn't help but notice the empty cake tin with remnance of a demolished red velvet cake in the corner of her co-workers desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can grab you?\" Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you asked, there is this tray of brownies in the kitchen I have been craving all day. Could you be a doll and grab it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly.\" Ashley said before she took off in the direction of the kitchen. 'Boy these girls really like their sweets. They all must be fat from working here.' Ashley thought as she grabbed the tower of brownies and brought them back to Tasha. After the brownie delivery she though she should check in with the other three girls. After asking them all the same thing, they each wanted something sweet to munch on. Ashley complied with their wishes and brought them all treats from the kitchen. As she made her way back to her desk she was summoned into Samantha's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making quick friends are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, everyone is so nice.\" Ashley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are going to be having a meeting in the conference room in 10. I need you to go pick up a donut order from the Sweet Shop and drop them off in the conference room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly.\" Ashley left the office and headed down the hall to the Sweet Shop. 'A donut order? Does it ever stop for these girls?' She thought as she stepped into the sweet smelling shop. She asked for her order at the counter and was handed 6 big boxes. 'Holy moly this is a lot of donuts.' She took the boxes back to the office and spread them out in the conference room. As she got back to the office Samantha stepped out of her office and announced the meeting to the other girls. All of their heads perked up as they noticed Ashley walking by with all the boxes. They all waddled their way into the conference room and took a seat. Samantha sat at the head of the table with Ashley next to her. Ashley was ready to take notes on her tablet. Each worker took a box  from the table and placed it in front of them selves. Each box was full of a dozen donuts. Even Samantha had taken a box, which left only one left. The last box was for Ashley. In that brief moment she knew everyone was looking at her and was expecting her to take the last box. She knew she didn't need the calories but she also knew they would probably be the most delicious thing she had ever eaten. Well besides that cake earlier, as Tasha put it, it was to die for. Ashley didn't want to be looked at as the outcast so she graciously took the extra box and snatched a donut out of it. It was truly tasty and she even craved another after the first. As the meeting went on Ashley had a few more donuts, while her coworkers had no problem packing the entire box away. The meeting ended and each full bellied woman made their way back to their desk. Ashley couldn't fathom how each of them could eat so much, or let them selves go so badly.  She could understand Fran, long time vet with the company and getting up there in age, but the other younger workers were all so plump. Their bubble butts filled their work skirts showing off how supple each cheek had become. The rolly polly bellies bulged out in front of them like they had a basket ball under their blouse. Each of them also sported a hefty bosom. Their inflated chests filled their bras and taxed the buttons on their sweaters. Each of them was a wobbling pile of fat, and Ashley didn't see that changing any time soon with how their eating habits were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting Ashley was called into Samantha's office. \"Was there something you needed Samantha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear, have a seat.\" Ashley sat in one of the comfy chairs in front of Samantha's desk. She noticed the remains of all the snacking Samantha had done that day. Her waste bucket was full, and she still had crumbs on her desk waiting to be cleaned up. \"Ashley we have a pretty easy philosophy here at Gourmet Heaven, and that is a healthy employee is a happy employee. Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" Ashley replied. 'Fat employees are happy employees?' She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now our employee's may not know about our corporate philosophy, but it's our job to make sure they are happy and working at their best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why there is treats and food all around the office. You want to encourage your employees to eat, because the more they eat the happier they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Our research has shown that women encouraged to indulge, to live with less restraint, work better in this company. I'm sorry that I didn't bring this up during the interview, but part of your job is going to be helping your coworkers get the encouragement they need. Is that something you can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley thought to herself. These girls pack it away without a second thought already, how hard could it be to help them on their way? \"Of course Samantha, anything you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on a want a daily report of how your work is going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As good as done.\" Ashley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Dismissed. And don't forget this box of donuts left over from the meeting. I couldn't have another I'm stuffed.\" Samantha handed Ashley the half full box to take to her desk. Ashley passed the rest of the day nibbling on her donuts and other snacks on her desk. Her desk was more food than it was paper work. By days end she was quite stuffed and her flat belly poked out more than usual. She said goodbye to her coworkers, and remembered that tomorrow was going to be a much different day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley arrived promptly the next morning for work. She had been planning her attack all last night. It also crossed her thoughts that she used to get paid to help women lose weight and she was pretty much being paid to fatten them up. Hey a job is a job. She stopped by the Sweet Shop and picked up an order of 6 dozen donuts again, get the morning started right. She gingerly eased into the office holding the tall pile of boxes and placed them on her desk. One by one she handed them out to the girls in the office as she greeted them for the day. Once she was done so took a box in for Samantha as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Samantha. Fresh donuts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love them, thank you. Getting a good start this morning I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Gotta make sure these girls are well fed, right? And in the process of doing that I was wondering if I could get clearance from you to order a milkshake machine for the kitchen. Coffee is just so blah.\" Samantha had a smile across her face. Ashley was going to do just fine with the task given to her. She knew the girls in the office were going to balloon with all the extra calories Ashley was going to get them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear, that is a marvelous idea. Get me your notes and research by lunch so we can process the order.\" Samantha was still smiling as Ashley went back to her desk, giddy from getting her idea approved. When she got back to her desk there was one box of donuts left. She had forgotten that an order of 6 boxes included one for her. 'Oops.' She thought to herself. 'I guess I over ordered. Nothing to do now but have a few.' Ashley had been wanting them anyways. After delighting everyone else with treats she craved some for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley started researching all sorts of different machines for the office, but finally settled on one that took care of all the work for them. All Ashley had to do was refill it in the morning. She presented her findings to Samantha and an order was placed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had other ideas for her coworkers as well. She called and doubled the order of sweets to be delivered daily to the office. The reason there were sweets to eat is because the company provided them free of change to encourage their staff to eat freely. A cleaning crew would come in the morning before office hours and clean up the empty platters from the day before and restock the office based off the reoccurring order. The current order Ashley felt was to limiting. The woman on the other end of the phone warned Ashley from over ordering, the food was free but they didn't want it to go to waste. Ashley assured her that it was not going to go to waste. She got the approval from Samantha to up the order on the grounds that she had to deal with any left overs, which meant consuming them herself. So tomorrow they would start to see an increase in the sweets around the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's last change for the day was to up the ante during their staff meetings. Instead of donuts she filled the conference room table with a smorgasbord of pasties. Her coworkers eyes lit up with then saw the fancy feast. They thanked Ashley for her hard work and started in on the mound of sweets until they were gone. During the meeting Ashley took scrupulous notes on who was eating what. All part of the report she had to submit to Samantha at the end of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting she spent the rest of the day either at her desk with paperwork and phone calls, or our roaming the cubicles prodding her fellow workers with sweets. As the day toiled on Samantha asked Ashley to stay a few minutes after work. All the girls got their things and left for the day and Ashley made her way into her boss's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me Samantha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, take a seat. I'm assuming you have your daily report for me?\" Samantha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Ashley read her report to Samantha as they shared some brownies that Samantha had strategically placed in the office right before the meeting. The big thing she noticed was that Tasha was by far the biggest eater. She ate more and faster than everyone else. She really enjoyed having treats delivered. Fran was also a big eater, but not in the way like Tasha was. Tasha was ferocious, and Fran was more complacent. Fran loved to have something on her desk and in her hand, but wasn't attacking it with lust like Tasha did. Denise was also a big eater. She didn't eat as much as Fran, or as wild as Tasha, but she definitely enjoyed the perks of the office. Last but not least was Nancy. She was probably the slowest of the bunch. It's not that she didn't like all the sweets, she definitely embraced the company culture, she just wasn't as passionate or excited like the other girls were. There was an opportunity here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing report Ashley keep it up. I also can't wait to see the changes tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

She used her cup to make sure the machine was working perfectly, a tradition she kept up every morning after it was installed. Milkshakes were delicious and Ashley enjoyed drinking the thick liquid. She made sure everyone got some and knew how to get more when they wanted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso the extra food order had arrived that morning. The office was extra full of treats and sweets. The staff seemed excited by all the changes that were happening. They dug in viciously like Ashley knew they would. These chubby workers really liked their sweets and she really couldn't blame them. Everything was free and it all tasted so good. It was murder for their waistlines though. Everyday the office workers seemed bigger. It might have just been Ashley's imagination since she knew all too well how much these girls packed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was happy with Ashley's work. The girls were eating at an increased pace, and not leaving a scrap behind by days end. She also noticed Ashley unable to resist the sweet life of the office. She continued to order her extra box of donuts in the morning, right next to her morning milkshake. Ashley could also be seen enjoying a red velvet cake at her desk most days. Ashley wasn't on any pace to become the next Fran or anything, but things change quickly in this company. Samantha was happy with the office's improvements, but she was also privy to what was coming ahead in the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been about a month since Ashley started at Gourmet Heaven. By now her progress could be seen on her co-workers. Each of them had gained 10-20 lbs. Tasha was on the higher end of the scale, now weighing in at 250. Her bust had gotten so big she had to leave open most of the top buttons of her blouse for them to breath. Fran and Nancy had steady gains as well, and little Denise brought up the rear, literally. She may have only gained 10 lbs, but it seemed to have all gone to her behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was not immune to the gaining either. She had also gained 10 pounds but was completely oblivious to them. One day Ashley was called into Samantha's office first thing in the morning. She used this opportunity to deliver her boss some donuts. Samantha was on the phone and gestured for Ashley to put them on her desk. Ashley complied and took her normal seat in front of the desk. Ashley could over hear Samantha's conversation but couldn't make out what she was talking about,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, our investment is up 75% over last month... I know my new investment is paying dividends... The new account? It's healthy. Up 10 points actually... My team is probably going to be the top performers this quarter if we keep it up... I know next quarter is going to be crazy with all the changes. Well I have to let you go, ta ta.\" Samantha hung up the phone and focused her attention on Ashley. Ashley had slipped a couple of donuts out of Samantha's box and was just finishing them as Samantha was finishing her call. Ashley had had such a sweet tooth since getting this new job. Samantha had noticed Ashley's new business suit. She must of out grown the old one since this one was looking a tad bigger than before. She decided to test the waters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love the new suit Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, thanks. I just felt like sprucing up my wardrobe with a few new things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She doesn't suspect a thing, the poor dear.' Samantha though as she noticed Ashley's little bulge of a belly that she didn't have a month ago when she interviewed her. \"Well we only have one month left of this financial quarter. Time for a report.\" She gave Ashley the floor, and Ashley presented her work for her boss. </span></div></div>",

That was until she was called into Samantha's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had just given Samantha the monthly report just a few days ago. Samantha had been pleased, but still wanted to achieve even more. Ashley had surmised that Nancy was sitting now at 215 lbs, Tasha was up to 250, Fran the vet at 342, and Denise with a small bump up to 260. And of course Ashley didn't know it but she had gone from a nice 110 number up to 120. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, great first month. I can really see the results.\" Samantha laughed in her head at the thought of how well the new recruit was joining their corporate philosophy, especially after being a fitness instructor. \"But we need to keep our foot on the pedal.\" Ashley nodded in agreement as she listened to her boss. \"I think our weakness is Denise, she just isn't embracing the culture like we want her too. Fran has been here long enough and is comfortable with how we operate. Tasha embarrassed things from day one and I think is really flourishing in the environment. And Nancy is accepting of it too. When Denise first started she seemed like she'd love it here, but recently she has been withdrawn. We need to change that and I need your help Ashley. Can you do that for me Ashley?\"</span></div></div>",

I'd recommend using some team skills to accomplish this task.\" Samantha told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Ashley brainstormed a plan she hoped would work. Samantha wanted Denise to be a team player, so maybe she needed some team support. Folks like Fran and Tasha took care of themselves, they didn't need to be edged on to gobble down sweets. It wasn't going to be enough just to tempt Denise with lots and lots of delectables, she needed to be hands on. Maybe if Ashley sat down and enjoyed food with Denise she would be more apt to take part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day she set the plan in place. Everyone else's appetite was on autopilot, so she focused herself on Denise all day. At first it was a small cake she split with her and ate with her at her desk, making sure she ate the whole thing while she was there. Then she made sure she was sucking down all of her milkshake and getting a large refill. She split a box of donuts with Denise, and then a plate of gourmet cookies. All day Ashley was bringing food over to Denise's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise started to get wise a little bit. She was curious why Ashley was sitting with her all day and none of the other girls. Ashley's response was that she just didn't know Denise all that well and wanted to get to know her better. Secretly she was pumping her full of sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy days end Denise had consumed triple what she would have on a normal day. She was stuffed. She thanked Ashley for spending so much time with her today as she left to go home. Ashley grinned as she was so proud of her work. Unbenounced to Ashley though, she was quite full as well. Her small belly was looking quite taught in her small business suit. Ashley gathered her things and left for the day, ready to do it all over again tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Samantha had asked her to get their numbers up by the end of the quarter, and Ashley was satisfied that she had done a good job. After all the effort she put in with Denise, the girl was looking a bit rounder. Of course the bootylicious woman had plumped up mostly in her rear, but Ashley was still proud of her accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling reminded her of her past life. She used to feel accomplished when she'd help a client lose weight, and meet those milestones. Now she was like a weight gain coach, but the clients didn't really have a choice, they just were sort of accepting of their fate. Ashley looked around the office and at the rotund women that filled it. This was her job now, she was a corporate encourager, and she wondered where this career would take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could get out of her head, Samantha snapped her out of it by calling her in to her office. \"I believe you have your report for me.\" Samantha gleaned. Ashley read off her extensive report, full of numbers and names and food items. Then it came to Denise, her project. She gave her report on the assignment she was given, and just hoped it was what Samantha wanted. She told her about the social aspect of the encouraging, and the constant assistance she gave to her project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked on at Ashley as she gave her report. Samantha knew what was going on day to day, she wasn't very far from the action, this was a small office, but she liked getting the report from her special project manager. Ashley sat in the lush seat that was in front of Samantha's desk, mostly reading off a piece of paper. Samantha noticed that Ashley kept pulling at the hem of her skirt like it was constantly riding up. Ashley's plan had definitely started to work with Denise, Samantha saw her this morning and her booty was looking much bigger. But Samantha's plan was working too. Every morsel Denise ate so did Ashley, and it was showing on the relatively thin woman. The tight business suit showed Samantha everything she needed to know. Ashley wasn't going to plump up over night but was well on her way to looking the part when it came to a Gourmet Heaven worker, Samantha could not complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had finally finished talking allowing for Samantha to respond. \"Great work Ashley, you really helped us through this tough quarter. But you know what they say, another game starts tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Ashley arrived to work, ready to take on her new challenge. What she didn't know was that she was secretly the one who was going to be fattened up. All the other girls were in on the prank as well. All the girls in the office needed to be on the bigger side, so it was only right to help Ashley join the ranks. Throughout the day Ashley was asked to bring the other girls food, under the guise that she was helping them fatten up, but once she delivered the sweets she was asked to sit and enjoy them with her coworkers. Each girl turn by turn snacked away with Ashley all day. By days end she was extremely full but thought that she did a good job making the other girls eat more. As the week end on she felt that the only way to get the other girls to eat was to eat with them. They were secretly loading her up with calories causing her to gain every day. Pretty soon the results were not hard to see. Ashley had gotten quite chubby, but was non the wiser about her gain. The girls kept it up for months until Ashley was tipping the scales at 250, gaining over 100 lbs. The plump receptionist was so ditsy she didn't know what was going on. The other girls kept up the ruse pretty well, saying things like 'I feel like I've been eating more and more everyday.' Of course with all the eating the staff had some extra pounds too, but Claire's gain was monumental compared to theirs. Ashley bounced into the office like she did every morning, allowing her now pudgy frame to shake and jiggle as she walked. Her big belly pressed hard on her small blouse even allowing about an inch of flesh to jiggle freely. The buttons on her blouse tugged as they tried to find room for her massive tits. Ashley headed straight for the kitchen area as she had grown acustom to. The room was full of treats for her to munch on. She had very little work to do besides eat, and eating had become second nature for her. After being shacked up in the kitchen eating all morning, her full stomach was brought back to her desk along with a cake or two to enjoy during the middle of the day. Her coworkers had got in the habit of bringing her treats rather than the other way around. That way they could only have a few bites of something and leave the rest for Ashley to enjoy. Ashley had plumped up quite well for everyone's liking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Samantha called her into her office. She wanted to congratulate her on a job well done in the past few months. \"Oh why thank you. I feel like I worked so hard to accomplish the results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You most certainly did.\" Samantha said as she eyed Ashley big tummy. \"Everyone has had only tremendous things to day about you around the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really. I'm so glad to know that I'm fitting in. You know it's always hard being an outsider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it doesn't hurt that you took quickly to our company culture.\" Samantha said as she pressed a finger into Ashley's exposed doughy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gasp* Ashley tried to pull her ill fitting top down over her exposed belly. \"Aww I must have shrunk these in the wash again. I've been having to buy clothes many sizes too big recently, they all seem to be shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it dear. Here have a brownie to get your mind off of it.\" Samantha handed Ashley a tray of brownies. Ashley sat as she ate them one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These treats are too good Samantha. No wonder this business is doing so well. I've got to cut back or I'm gonna get fat.\" Samantha chuckled to herself. Ashley was already quite plump, she wondered when she would realize she as fat as the rest of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it's time to get back to work, what do you say?\" Ashley waddled back to her desk, taking the brownies with her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After that meeting with Samantha things went back to normal for Ashley. She stuffed her face more and more at work. Her coworkers looked on as she gained more and more weight. The other fat coworkers all porked up and passed 300 lbs, but Ashley put them all to shame when she hit 350 in a few more short months. She was now rivaling Fran's size who was also 350 after the past few months. Ashley waddled into work and began eating like she did everyday. That was her only job now. Samantha had taken all of her other duties away, with left Ashley with only one thing to do. She used two chairs to support her as she sat at the break table eating every sweet on it. Tasha came by shortly after lunch to check in on the growing girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone needs some work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you call those two trifles over there? Looks like work to me.\" Ashley said as she undid another button from her top allowing her billowing boobs some more breathing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about I help you out with one, spread the work around.\" Tasha suggested. She grabbed a large trifle and started in on it. Tasha had gained the most in the office recntly. While Denise and Nancy were plump at 300 Tasha hadn't stopped until she hit 320. The large big boobed blond did enjoy her sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this the best gig, getting to eat all the sweets we want?\" Tasha asked Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess. I've gained such a sweet tooth since joining the company, and all the food is free, why not take advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's even more than that.\" Tasha went on. \"No one judges you for being a big girl around here because we are all big, isn't that right Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for your self girl. I know you're the big eater around here, but I haven't gained that much since starting here, it's only been a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you calling 'the big eater'? You put us all to shame girl.\" Tasha retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I maybe nibble throughout the day, but I wouldn't consider myself a big eater. I've been pretty bad recently so maybe i've gained some weight, but no more than 20 or 30 lbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"20 or 30 lbs? Girl you are fooling yourself. Let's hit the ladies room and compare our weights.\" Tasha threw down the gauntlet. She stood on the scale first and the readout read 325.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone needs to move up a bra size.\" Ashley tried to smack talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just step on the scale. I bet you weight more than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you? Deal, easy victory. What do you bet me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loser eats 'The Meal' at the Sweet Shop.\" Tasha wagered. 'The Meal' was a feast of everything on the menu at the sweet shop. It was an impossible challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal, and make that bra two sizes too big, your going to need it after your trip to the Sweet Shop later.\" Ashley stood on the scale and the read out flashed back 362. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy you crushed me. Looks like we all know who is the biggest now.\" Tasha flaunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"362? How can that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha stopped her gloating for a moment. \"Girl it's not the end of the world. Not like 325 is anything to be proud of, I'm still as fat as can be, but we all are, it's what makes us a team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right. I just never thought I was this fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because your boobs can't compare to my girls, doesn't make them not pontoons.\" Tasha teased her blubbery friend as she have her tit a honk. \"But a deal is still a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who would I be if I backed down from a deal.\" The whole office took a break and went down to the Sweet Shop to watch Ashley eat. Tray after tray was brought out to the big girl. She ate them all like a champ. As she took a bite of the very last course all the girls cheered. Ashley was insanely bloated and full. After that there was no denying who was the biggest. Ashley's next milestone was Samantha.</span></div></div>",

She was close enough to 400 lbs, was 500 really that far? Samantha was a whale of a woman but Ashley wasn't too far behind. Ashley spent her day actively stuffing her face, trying to gain weight. Tasha encouraged her, and helped her meet her goal. The two girls ate around the clock, staying late most nights after work. Ashley found it easier to eat when she had a companion, which Tasha was happy to be. As the pounds piled on Ashley they also bulked onto Tasha. While Ashley was passing 400, Tasha was hitting 350. The big girls loved to eat. The rest of the office left them alone to their feasting most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls got bigger, but their clothes didn't always keep up. Tasha's rack was always too much for her tops. Popped buttons and deep cleavage were a daily problem for her. Ashley's biggest problem was her widening belly. No shirt could contain it and no pant wanted to button around it. Neither girl cared enough to slow down their eating and the gaining continued. 425, 450, 475 came and went so fast. Ashley was starting to get huge and could see the finish line in her sites. She waddled and wobbled into the office everyday just to sit down and stuff her face. Finally the big day came when she reached 500 lbs. Ashley had absolutely nothing that fit properly. She put on a shirt that was missing a few buttons and a skirt with a tear in the seam. She waddled into Samantha's office to tell her the good news. The rest of the office staff followed her including Tasha who was tipping 425 at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stood in front of Samantha's desk. She looked like she towered over her. From this vantage point she looked even bigger than Samantha was. \"After realizing I was bigger than all the other girls I decided to shoot for the heavens and attempt to take your crown on fattest in the office, and I'm here to tell you that I hit 500 lbs this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well congratulations. But why did you over shoot so high?\" Samantha stood up so everyone could see the two next to one another. \"I only weight 400.\" It was apparent now that Ashley was way bigger than Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We always thought that you were 500lbs?\" Ashley studdered to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I don't know where that rumor came from, I guess I was so fat that 500 seemed like a reasonable number. But congratulations none the less. And it looks like our little Tasha here has packed on some pounds too.\" The attention to her room turned to Tasha who was also now bigger than Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess I have gotten kinda big huh...\" She trailed off as everyone took in the site of her massive melons that were being hardly restrained by her poor wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that is all then back to work.\" Samantha announced to the group. They all just stood there shocked from the news. Ashley's fat quivered as she stood there in shock. She had gotten so fat for nothing. She was absolutely huge now. Well she had set out with a goal in mind and had achieved it, there can be nothing wrong with that. She maybe 500 lbs of fat, but that's who she was and no one was going to change that. \"Well if everyone is just going to stand there lets all go down to the Sweet Shop to celebrate. Ashley I'll even order you 'The Meal' I know how much you can pack away.\" The flock of rotund girls made their way back to the Sweet Shop. Ashley and Tasha were the slowest getting there. The two largest girls each ordered one of everything and easily packed it all away. Tasha sat next to Ashley while they ate course after course. At the end of the meal she turned to her friend and asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when are you going to join me in the 500 club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tasha had been eating around the clock trying to catch up to her friends weight. It was hard to catch her when it was climbing so fast. It was also hard because the more Tasha gained the bigger her boobs got. They were practically life rafts at this point, far bigger than the watermelons that she used to sport in her smaller days. The top heavy girl found it hard to find support for her growing chest and they didn't help her stay balanced while wadding around. Her unrestricted chest usually was just held up by her growing tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was unaware of her friends intent, she just kept up the eating charade to appease her belly. She had grown accustom to all the eating and craved sweets all the time. Lucky for her, her job afforded her all the sweets she wanted. She sat at her desk looking like a beached whale. 500 lbs of pure fat oozing over the sides of her large chair. Her massive gut found refuge either on her desk or in her lap. Typically the latter kept her too far from the snacks on said desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time rolled on Tasha's weight climbed. Although the troubles she had as her weight went up she wasn't stopping until she hit that 500 mark. One day as Ashley sat at her desk she started to hear a rumble. She looked out in front of the office and she saw Tasha lumbering down the hall. Each footfall sent ripples through the blonds fat. It shook violently as she waddled slowly to the office. As she opened the door, holding sweets in both hands Ashley could tell she had been making progress weight wise. Her clothes were very ill fitting and she could see by the outline of her bra that she had out grown yet another pair. Her girls jiggled and bounced as Tasha made her way over to Ashley's desk. Tasha's large back side swayed side to side as she walked almost busting down cubical walls as she passed them. The large girl picked up a huge slice of cake from Ashley's desk and downed it in a few quick bites. \"That was mine you fat bitch.\" Ashley joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you need the calories tubby.\" Tasha joked back. \"I should just take this whole thing.\" She said she she grabbed the cake stand away from the blob that sat before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I bet it goes straight to those fat tits of yours. Speaking of, they are looking bigger today than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are aren't they. I must be getting close to the 500 club then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 500 club?\" Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I want to join you, that's why I've been pigging out so much recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted it to be a surprise, and I want you to weight me tonight on your industrial scale at home that you bought for yourself. I think I've finally hit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Tasha waddled her way over to Ashley's house. Tasha had ordered a feast to be delivered for the girls to enjoy in celebration. She walked into the kitchen and noticed all the food everywhere. \"Hey there tubs, look what I ordered for us.\" Ashley said as Tasha walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ordered? I ordered us food as well.\" With that the doorbell rang and guys started being in even more food. When it was all over the kitchen was filled to the brim with sweets and treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're not 500 lbs yet you will be when you leave.\" The girls got right to it and made their way to the bathroom that housed the industrial scale. \"Alright clothes off.\" Ashley told Tasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes off?\" She replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you can't have them weighing you down and giving us false pounds.\" Tasha stripped off her shirt and skirt. \"Bra too sweetheart, it must take a lot of fabric to keep those puppies up. Don't worry it's nothing I haven't seen.\" Tasha unclasped her bra exposing her large boobs. She stepped on the scale but couldn't see past her flab at the numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's is say Ash?\" Ashley had grabbed a cake from the kitchen and had broken off a chunk in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need a little more to make the mark.\" Tasha started eating the cake out of Ashley's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, more. I need more.\" Tasha demanded. Ashley shoved more and more cake past Tasha's lips. After the cake had been eaten she started in on more treats. Ashley had brought a bunch into the bathroom and Tasha was quickly eating as much as she could. Her massive exposed body jiggled as she ate. Ashley rubbed one of her massive mammaries as she fed her more and more. Tasha couldn't stop and just wanted more. She wanted to be fat, she wanted to weight more, she wanted to skyrocket past 500 like Ashley did. She wanted her body to be bigger. Ashley had removed her top and started eating along side Tasha. The two whales ate and ate like there was no tomorrow. They allowed their large bodies to collide with one another, as they sat on the floor eating more and more. Neither one was getting stuffed, as their supply in the bathroom dwindled. The two exposed girls went out into the kitchen where a large feast awaited them. They ate until it was all gone. Each girl was stuffed. They both sat back as their fat oozed all around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha leaned over a gave Ashley a kiss on the cheek. \"Thanks for helping me reach my milestone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't help. You were already 512 when you were on the scale earlier. Now I bet you're even bigger.\"</span></div></div>",

Tasha hopped back on the scale after the feast and the dial didn't stop until it reached 520. Ashley took her turn since she had not been on since her 500 lb landmark. This time the dial spun up to 530, only 10 lbs more than Tasha. \"Looks like some one closed the gap, huh fatty.\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I could get this fat. There is no way I could have done it with out you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I would not be this fat with out you. I guess we only have each other to blame for being so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I for one am glad to have a fat friend like you around to share in all this enjoyment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasha I think we are a little bit more than friends.\" Ashley said as she gave Tasha a wink. The girls had an obvious physical attraction to one another and at this point in time couldn't keep their hands off one another. They couldn't help but rub each others fat bodies all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at work Ashley and Tasha had a hard time not staring at each other. Tasha's tasteful rack right on display before everyone's eyes. Ashley's huge belly filling her whole lap kept turning on Tasha. Also both girls ate like there was no tomorrow. They both loved watching the other pack away tasty treat one after another. By days end both girls were hot and bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before they were ready to leave Samantha called them into her office. Both blimped out girls stood next to each other taking up most of the room in front of Samantha's desk. \"Is there some thing you girls need to tell me?\" Samantha asked. They were both quiet. \"Now I know you both didn't go butter ball on your own, and you seem to be helping each other gain. I'm just wondering if there is any more to the picture here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short pause Ashley spoke up. \"Tasha and I are in love. We can't resist one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, the two office fatties fall in love. Well congratulations you two, its hard to find love these days especially when you are a big girl like us. I think we need to celebrate. Let's all head down to the Sweet Shop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the girls were taken down to the Sweet Shop for a feast. Samantha ordered almost all the food in the joint for the two rotund girls. They munched until every crumb was gone. All three women sat as their feast digested. \"You girls really know how to live.\" Samantha lemented. \"Fat as can be and in love with one another. I can just picture the wedding now. Your so happy to be engaged your eating goes into over drive. You're both over 600 pounds come the big day. You're so wide you can't fit down the aisle if the church. You both look stunning in your gowns, only if they fit. You grew so much after the fitting they almost couldn't get you in them. The reception is just a giant feast for you two to pig out. You eat while everyone looks on at your massive undertaking. You both eat so much that your dresses rip to shreds. Your honny moon consists of feasting in a hotel room between countless attempts at love making. When you finally return to work all your coworkers shower you with affection for such a holy union between two large ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god that sounds amazing. Tasha, will you marry me and make all my dreams come true?\" Ashley proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if our wedding happens like that word for word.\"</span></div></div>",

Her branch was running smoothly in her first year in charge of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down in her own special office the 500 pound manager undid her belt and pants button. As with most of Jenna\u2019s employees there was a clear correlation between Jenna\u2019s weight and her years of experience working at the office. The longer she worked there the longer her waistline grew. Thus her first act as boss was to make the office more suited for someone of her\u2026ilk (basically for really fat girls that eat a lot). These \u201cadjustments\u201d kept Jen and her employees literally \u201cfat and happy\u201d. As she worked on her BOD (Box of Doughnuts) she looked out to examine her employees<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sat at her desk. The 27 year old had the face of an angel, and the body of a hippo. Through high school and college she was a popular kid. Cheerleader, prom queen, honor roll, she was perfect. Alice combination of looks and personality were almost too good to be true, but all good things must end. When she joined the office she couldn\u2019t help but get caught up in the gluttony of her coworkers. Despite her angelic qualities she was helpless to the sinful indulgence that plagued the office. While her inner beauty remained, her outer beauty became buried in a layer of fat. Her sense of restraint eroded. As Jen looked, Alice leaned back in her chair and patted her doughy belly. While she remained gorgeous for someone of her size, there was no way of ignoring her obese state. The 340 pound cutie lifted her plump body out of the chair. Spinning around 90 degrees she showed her massive butt and wide padded hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sat at her desk across from Alice. The two were best friends. However Melissa was only 25. She was already a bit chubby when she got the job but working at the office unleashed her inner glutton. Being a fat girl was in her nature. Melissa was always greedy, lazy, indulgent, and fat, so when she joined the office she was in her natural habitat. She fell in love with pastries and fast food, stuffing herself constantly. Melissa pigged out so much she had blimped up to 370 pounds. Even around the office she was fat for her age. The young whale sat at her desk shoveling doughnuts into her mouth. Her free hand undid her bottom shirt button. Her overfed gut pushed out over her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was stationed at the entrance to the office. The young secretary had been working at the office for only a year. She was already chubby when she joined the office. The freshman 15 continued to the college 60 for Vicky. Being a young and naive she was quick to adopt the office lifestyle. Being a ditzy party girl she had no thoughts of restraint or consequences. She was too busy enjoying her early 20\u2019s to get concerned over her weight. Sitting at her desk all day she had piled on 70 pounds in her young career. Now at 23 and 260 pounds she happily sat on her flabby butt, grazing on junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second most experienced worker at the office was Courtney, a cheery woman who was a diligent worker. She had been living the office life for many years now and over time had completely let herself go. At 410 pounds the 29 year-old stuffed herself daily at the office. She was a veteran of the gluttonous office lifestyle. After many years at the office she had become very comfortable with her situation even though it had turned her into a 400 pound whale. Jenna watched Courtney make her way back to her desk. It was clear that she was coming from lunch for her entire midsection was on display. She was cradling her stuffed belly and heavy fat rolls with her hands, or at least as much as her hands could hold. As she waddled her way through the office she accidentally bumped into another coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna watched as the newest addition to the office bounced off of Courtney\u2019s puffy side blubber. Christina joined the office just a few months ago. Just 22 years old Christy was just a hot young thing straight out of college. Remarkably she still had the thin sexy frame that she had the day she started working. Christy was really shy around the office, and wasn\u2019t socializing with any of her coworkers, it was probably why she remained so thin. This was bothering Jen. \u201cMaybe someone should invite her to lunch,\u201d thought Jenna. She really wanted Christina to fit in like the rest of the office gals. </span></div></div>",

Christina watched as her coworkers slowly made their way out of the office. The numerous office fatty\u2019s carefully maneuvered themselves through the sea of desks, looking like the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade. After exiting the office they entered the elevator 2 at a time. This was because A: they didn't want to exceed the elevators weight limit, and B: there wasn't enough room for three women of so much thick rolling fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the parade of flesh (and Christina) made its way to the food court. The place was heaven for most members of the office. Chinese food, Pizza, Mexican food, Burgers, Bakery, Ice cream, Fried chicken, the food court covered all of the main food groups of the modern obese office whale. Just the smell of the food court would add five pounds to the normal human being. It was truly a fattening sanctuary. A temple of worship for those with appetites like Courtney, Melissa, and Jenna. It was like fat girl Disney world. Of course the food court couldn't have become the gluttonous shrine it was if not for the heavy funding it had received over the years from the offices bloated babes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately that was a lot harder than it looked. The first person to sit was Christina as she was the person that could fit into the booth the easiest. Then Victoria joined her on her right. Then Alice joined in on her left. Melissa, Courtney, and Jenna all sat in chairs since they were too big for the booth. It didn\u2019t take long for everyone to start eating. Christina looked around as her coworkers shoveled fatty foods into their mouths. Watching her coworkers eat, she couldn\u2019t help but get caught up in all of the gluttonous consumption. She started to eat more and more. She had never realized how tasty the food was here. She hadn\u2019t eaten such fatty food in so long. She had forgotten how good it all tasted. No one said anything. There was so much eating by the group of coworkers that all you could here was the deafening sound of chewing, swallowing, chair creaking, and drink sipping. Communication wasn\u2019t made again until the trays were emptied and had to be restocked. After the first round of eating was done Christina was the first to comeback with her second course. Her second tray of food was much smaller than the mountains of food that her coworkers brought back to the table. Christina was a little surprised though when Alice came back with two hefty trays of food. One of which Alice placed in front of Christina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCmon, sweetie don\u2019t hold yourself back. You\u2019re missing out on the fun.\u201d Alice said. Christina hesitated at first. She always refused such excessive indulgence. But then she smelled the sweet, salty, fatty food on the tray. Maybe just once couldn\u2019t hurt that much. She thought. She started to dig in. Some of the others at the table took notice and showed her their approval. Christina actually started to feel like part of the group. She happily ate with reckless abandon. She even got thirds. However as she made her way through her third tray of food. Her eating slowed. She had pushed her stomachs limits. Her coworkers hadn\u2019t slowed a bit. All Christina could do was sit and digest. Despite the pain in her stomach she was very happy. She\u2019d finally felt like part of the group. When the feast had come to a stop, conversation emerged. There was much praise for her eating. Christina realized how much she liked her coworkers and how foolish she was for judging their eating habits. What she didn\u2019t know was that this was the day that would start everything for Christina. She had no idea What she was in store for.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone liked Cass &amp; Marni in the Morning, all the way up the corporate ladder. They were the only local radio station that everyone in the office could agree on which, given the diversity of tastes in the office, was really saying something to the quality of their programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww!\u201d A collective moan escaped the break room as its inhabitants voiced their displeasure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled apologetically and shrugged her meaty shoulders, tapping her wrist with one sausage finger. They were only allowed to listen to the radio on breaks, which while frequent, hardly synced with the schedule of everyone\u2019s favorite radio queens.

She couldn\u2019t hear or feel any of Jenna\u2019s thunderous footsteps, so that meant either she was already in her office\u2014where she couldn\u2019t see them\u2014or she was abusing her managerial position again and hadn\u2019t come into work yet. Given how long it could take her blonde beluga of a boss to lift herself from an office chair <i>or</i> tear herself away from a breakfast buffet, there was no telling when Jenna would be back to where she could see them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, just a few more minutes.\u201d Alice said with a naughty giggle escaping her as a quiet chorus erupted from her fellow fatties, \u201cI <i>really</i> wanna hear the second date update!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice flicked the radio back on and hurried as fast as her doughy legs could carry her back over to the lunch table. A smile settled between her chubby cheeks as everyone laughed\u2014it seemed all it took to get By-the-Book Alice to live a little was some radio\u2026 and maybe an extra donut or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pesky song or two, Alice and the girls were rewarded with more quality time with their favorite morning talk show. They listened intently and gave their own unrequited responses amongst themselves, particularly regarding the bad first dates section that they <i>all</i> seemed to enjoy. Nobody seemed to notice that twenty minutes had passed, and that they were almost half an hour late back to work\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019see Christie, it\u2019s all about taking it easy once in a while.\u201d Courtney said in a pseudo-sagely manner as she dug into another treat (this time a bagel) \u201cEven <i>Alice</i> knows that. Work\u2019s important and all, but you\u2019ve gotta live a little if you\u2019re gonna survive around here. Which is why the girls and I got you this, newbie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Courtney plopped one of the biggest, fattest donuts Christina had ever seen in front of her on a napkin. It looked like just a regular glazed donut under a magnifying glass. Nothing strange about it other than its peculiar size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she\u2019d already eaten quite a few of them, and her stomach was really starting to hurt\u2026 plus, it wasn\u2019t even lunch yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank y\u2014urp!\u201d Christina covered her mouth as best she could to bolster the belch behind her lips, \u201cBut really, I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw come on!\u201d Courtney said with a pat to Christy\u2019s comparatively tiny back, \u201cI <i>just</i> told you that it was Friday and that you should live a little. Saved the last Super-Donut for you and everything! Do you <i>know</i> how hard it was for me to convince Melissa not to eat this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thank you, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked back to the glazed monstrosity before her, unable to ignore the fact that it was coated in so much sugar that the break room\u2019s lighting was clearly reflected in the slick coat of confectionary sugar on top. It stood taller than most sandwiches\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d she managed, \u201cIt looks so bad for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you think those Super-Donuts are cheap?\u201d Melissa barked from her seat across the break room, \u201cYou\u2019re just lucky we\u2019re actually <i>giving</i> you yours this time instead of just ordering it for you and splitting it up three ways!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa.\u201d Alice said sternly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s rude is all.\u201d She said in a huff, \u201cShe wants to fit in and all, then she\u2019s gotta go and ruin it by being a prude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina turned tentatively to Courtney, who pursed her lips knowingly and drummed her fingers on the table expectantly. They didn\u2019t <i>really</i> think that she could handle all this, did they? Maybe if she were <i>their</i> size, but\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the side of her super-donut, Christina lifted it into her mouth and took as big a bite as she could muster\u2014which wasn\u2019t much. But still, considering that she\u2019d been coerced into eating nearly half a dozen <i>regular sized</i> donuts already, it was saying something that she could take such a chomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite after bite passed through her lips with erratic precision. No two chomps were quite the same: mostly small, due to the pain that slowly grew in her stomach, but she managed to take a couple big chunks out of the task at hand when she realized how little of it was left. She was sweating, her stomach was so full. It pressed tightly against the white of her blouse as the other women looked onward in excitement. They cheered her on in an attempt to keep the scrawny girl going, lest she fail to devour the Super-Donut. It was sweet and sickening, and Christina felt like she was going to barf every other bite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before long, her super snack was nothing more than just that\u2014a snack. A good snack, great even! Maybe one of the best donut\u2019s shed ever had in her whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne that had left her sick and feeling bloated all morning, but a snack still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, two big indulgences down\u2026 how much worse could it get? It\u2019s not like being \u201cone of the girls\u201d meant eating like that all the time, right?</span></div></div>",

They would rather have more for themselves than to give away a tasty treat. Unfortunately for Christina, that wasn't going to stop her inevitable weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was simply too much food around for her to resist. Walking into the break room to the noxious smell of fresh doughnuts was too tempting for the skinny girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could have one.\u201d She would say. But one doughnut is a slippery slope. Every day she would have a doughnut, until she started having two doughnuts. Then every time someone had treats she would partake. She started to become friendlier with her coworkers, leading to more and more lunches in the cafeteria. At first she was able to justify eating her salads for lunch alone, but as she made friends in the office it was harder for her to say no to a fattening cafeteria feast. She slowly started to adopt her friend\u2019s gluttonous habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly her defenses against obesity started to fall. She stopped going to the gym and stopped walking to places (mainly cause her friends never wanted to walk). She could hardly be called fat especially compared to her coworkers, but more and more her weight increased. Her body filling out what was once lean muscle with soft fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course for Christina she barely noticed her subtle gain. Her new friend group made her look like an Olympic athlete. In fact her coworkers/buddies were about the worst people to help Christina with her weight. One was an absolute pig (Melissa), one was a completely oblivious weight gain prodigy (Victoria), another was a 350 pound former cheerleader (Alice), another, her boss, can barely stand on her own (Jenna), and last but not least, her mentor, was perhaps a 400+ glimpse into her future (Courtney).<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d press deeply into the soft creamy surface of her skin, only for the pressure to cause some other area on her tummy to swell. Her lips in a tight and tiny frown, she rolled the tank top back over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the full-body mirror, all the young former intern could see was her pot. It stuck out so far that who cared if her breasts were getting bigger? So were her arms, her legs\u2026 her butt. Even her face was rounder! A whole fifteen pounds that had just materialized into and onto her body\u2014something had to be done about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a puff of venom and left the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was insane. She\u2019d never had a weight problem before, never so much as gained a few pounds that didn\u2019t melt right back off. And it was never more than five, tops. Maybe ten if Thanksgiving came around the wrong time of the month. Something had to be done about this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m <i>so</i> glad you talked me into this.\u201d Victoria said with a slurp of her smoothie, \u201cThis place makes the <i>best</i> strawberry banana blend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina watched as the olive-skinned secretary drowned herself in icy mix. One hand held the cup between five chubby fingers while the other swiped at her phone. The usually prim and proper Victoria had dressed down in light of the occasion, however Christina couldn\u2019t help that she didn\u2019t quite understand what she was supposed to <i>do</i> at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth had dressed light in respect to the spring weather. While they\u2019d come in heavy coats to ward off the chilly New England breeze, beneath their North Face jackets both had worn their best workout attire. Christina in a tee and yoga pants from her college days (that, unfortunately, were much tighter than she would care to admit) with sneakers. Victoria in a tank top that wrapped around the two prominent folds of her belly while squeezing her proud Italian bust line. Below, however, Victoria had opted for a pair of tight black running shorts that were stretched to transparency. Her enormously inflated ass had left her booty shorts spread so thin that not only could Christina make out her friend\u2019s panty lines, she could also clearly make out what color they were\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina took a slurp of her own smoothie, albeit a tiny one filled with self-conscious examination of her own pudgy paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, like, what do you wanna start with?\u201d Victoria asked obliviously as she tied her long black hair back, nestling her blend between her breasts as she topped her head with a Yankees cap, \u201cWe could do\u2026 um\u2026 that thing. Or that. Or\u2026 whatever <i>that</i> is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrunches.\u201d Christina answered as her chub rumbled, \u201cDefinitely crunches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sat porcine on the matted floor, struggling to so much as breathe. She\u2019d began sweating after crunch number three, having hardly done so much as one crunch since her Gen Phys Ed her freshman year, and had so far made it all the way to crunch number fifteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her belly was still very present. She\u2019d half-way expected it to disappear every time her elbows touched her knees, but every time she was greeted with the dumb smile that her belly made with her huddled position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2026 Okay\u2026\u201d Christina huffed, rolling onto her side, \u201cGood\u2026 Good start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, not but a few feet away, the treadmill creaked ominously as heavy dragging footfalls scraped against the track. Flabby arms flailed wildly as the rest of Victoria attempted to stay with the low setting. Lifting one elephantine leg up after the other every day was something she barely did every day, hardly preparing her for this \u201cexercise\u201d thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina couldn\u2019t help but watch the big black bubble off her butt bob up and down with every belabored step. The mirrors in front of her showed that poor Victoria was sweating buckets, her moon-pie face absolutely enflamed in a beat beet red. Her gut jumped up and down with her every movement, visible beneath the white tank top that clung tightly to her sweaty shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Victoria fell, landing on her belly and knees with her big round bottom stuck high in the air. Her Yankees cap fell off too, but both eventually slid down to the floor of the gym. Victoria soon struggled to stand, and quickly shut off the devil machine before fixing her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is stupid.\u201d She whined, \u201cChristie, can we go yet?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVicky its\u2026 it\u2019s only been half an hour. I\u2019ve still gotta work my arms, my legs\u2026 maybe do some butt clenches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh!\u201d the spoiled secretary stomped her foot, sending her thunderous thighs and bulbous belly into a frenzy, \u201cCan\u2019t we, like, at least go get a pizza or something? I\u2019m <i>starving</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had McDonalds on the way over here!\u201d the younger girl said, exasperated and exhausted, \u201cLook just\u2026 just, uh, go get some smoothies. I\u2019ll do some push-ups and then we\u2019ll go. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d The immensely thick Italian said with a huff as she whipped around, back to the smoothie bar, \u201c<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"> Don\u2019t even need to be here anyway\u2026</font>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina rolled her eyes as she got back into position. She laid down on her hands and knees, still able to feel the sweat that had come off of her back. She kicked out her legs and dropped down to the floor (now able to <i>smell</i> her sweat, gross!) before pushing down on the floor with her untoned arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-One!\u201d she grunted, \u201cTw\u2026 Two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms gave out, and she collapsed into a skinny pile of blonde assistant right there on the yoga mat. She was <i>really</i> out of shape! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And she apparently smelled, <i>really</i> bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Christie, they said they only served smoothies from ten to eleven.\u201d Vicky came back in all of her pudgy preciousness, \u201cY\u2019wanna head to like Taco Bell or something and get one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina worked her way back to a standing position, brushing herself off with both hands and taking deep pathetic breaths before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what.\u201d She wheezed, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go\u2026 shower. Then we\u2019ll\u2026 I dunno\u2026 go back to McDonalds and\u2026 and get a milkshake or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, what the hell. She\u2019d done pretty well today.

Of course Victoria didn\u2019t actually enjoy any form of exercise and she was too na\u00efve to realize that she actually could use some exercise given her increasing weight. The real reason she wanted to join Christina was simply because going to the gym seemed like a hip thing to do for someone her age.

Victoria on the side away from the counter while Christina was forced to stare down the glowing menu hanging from the ceiling. Christina had almost choked on her softshell taco upon her workout buddy\u2019s contented announcement, stifling a snort with a little help from her mouthful of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVicky, I\u2019m\u2026 <i>pretty</i> sure that\u2019s not how that works.\u201d She said, mildly amused by her friend\u2019s zeal for meals, \u201cYou\u2019ve still gotta track how much you eat.

Back in high school, I could eat all I wanted and I never gained any weight. I\u2019ve got, like, a super metabolism. I swear, I burn so much energy doing the littlest of things.\u201d She punctuated her point by taking a huge chomp out of her burrito, deep throating the cheesy meaty mess into her greedy maw<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina couldn\u2019t help but interpret that as she got <i>tired</i> after doing the littlest of things. It was pretty hard to take Vicky\u2019s claims of a so-called super-metabolism seriously when she easily outweighed Christina by a good hundred pounds in below the waist weight alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Christina ventured, attempting to shoe-horn some reality into Vicky\u2019s delusions, \u201cBut\u2026 you know we only go to the gym on Saturdays, right? I mean it\u2019d be different if we went every day, but you know\u2026 work and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I know.\u201d Vicky swallowed, not breaking eye-contact with her wrap, \u201cWe should totally do this more though. I love working out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina watched her friend wrap her lips around the tortilla-wrapped mess and choke down another bite. As she chewed Vicky\u2019s chubby cheeks bulged with her current intake, and a glob of sour cream dotted the corner of her mouth. She\u2019d broken a sweat way back on taco number two, and the light perspiration that misted her forehead was still present below her headband in the fluorescent lighting. Her soft olive skin bulged out of her track suit, her arms packed into the tight sleeves of her top, as various parts of her ample anatomy shook and shimmied in its struggle to remain comfortable in too-tight clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think we could do Sundays too?\u201d Victoria ventured, forcing her mass of masticated mush down her throat, \u201cI, like, <i>never</i> have anything to do on Sundays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 no, I can\u2019t do Sundays.\u201d Christina pulled the judgmental thoughts from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like she was in any place to judge someone for her weight. Since she\u2019d started going to the gym every Saturday, she\u2019d somehow still managed to put on another five pounds. Five more pounds in just three weeks, despite watching her diet and doing her best to stop at one donut every morning in the office. These little outing with Victoria were great, but they seemed to be spending a lot less time in the gym and more time in the restaurants outside the gym\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But I can do Wednesdays after work!\u201d she said suddenly, her hand cupping the swell of her pot lightly underneath the table, \u201cI just\u2026 uh\u2026 really wanna shed some pounds, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I can do Wednesdays.\u201d Vicky said thickly through her mouthful, still gripping the remains of her burrito in one hand, \u201cSo, what, like carpooling? Because I know this great little smoothie shack right down the road and I could totally drive us there before we work out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, whatever.\u201d Christina said dismissively, \u201cAnd we could, like, walk to the gym from there right?

I\u2019m going to keep going and see if anything changes.\u201d Christina thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristina, hurry up!\u201d Victoria yelled. Christina was in the locker room bathroom at the gym. Christina then washed her hands and walked out of the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady, V?\u201d Christina said. They waddled out of the gym. They were both still sweaty from their exercising. They managed a whole 12 minutes of walking on the treadmills before calling it quits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were still in their gym clothes as they made their way to the exit. While Christina used to look only thick next to the obese Victoria, she now looked undoubtedly fat. Although one was much bigger than the other, their doughy bellies bounced with each step. Their thick jiggling thighs rubbed together. Christina\u2019s plump, soft features filled her clothes rather tightly, while Victoria\u2019s clothes were struggling to keep her ample flesh from escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYesterday I was looking at the gym\u2019s website and I found a whole list of discounts and deals you can get with a membership from here.\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I wanna see that.\u201d Victoria said. She pulled out her smart phone and they both stopped walking near the gym exit. \u201c50% off 2 pizzas\u2026 3 burritos for the price of 2?... Free fries with a drink! This is awesome, Christy!\u201d Victoria said with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty cool, right?\u201d Christina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget our usual meal, I think we should take a trip around town. Let\u2019s see just what this membership can get us.\u201d Victoria said with a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I have the time.\u201d Christina said with a bit of her own excitement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which would have been great to know three frappes ago, and she probably would have turned down that muffin if she knew how many fat grams were in it. The scones were a terrible idea, with or without the icing, and taking a sip of Vicky\u2019s milkshake couldn\u2019t have been the wisest of decisions. At this rate, the only thing she <i>could</i> eat here was the free samples by the door! Why would they put this place outside a gym?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, ohmigod\u2026\u201d Vicky said throatily, her mouth full of frozen dairy product, \u201cChristy? These things are the best. You\u2019ve <i>gotta</i> try one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No thanks\u2026\u201d Christina\u2019s distress was obvious to anyone who wasn\u2019t Vicky, \u201cI\u2019m, uh\u2026 I\u2019m gonna go to the bathroom. Jog. <i>Jog</i> to the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, if you buy one more, I get the other one free!\u201d Vicky cried out as Christina removed herself from the booth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No thanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, what was happening to her? Not that long ago, Christina was a model of skinny girl chiq! But now, here she was drinking down calories like they were going out of style! She pumped her soft arms back and forth with every exaggerated step, her round pot-belly wobbling noticeably underneath her tank top, and let out shallow puffs of air at a time. Securely inside the bathroom and making sure she was alone, Christina whipped out her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, six hundred and eighty calories\u2026 times three\u2026\u201d she swiped her thumb over the calculator app, \u201cthree hundred and eighty for the muffin\u2026 I had two scones, so four-sixty times two\u2026 <i>oh my god</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty-three hundred and forty calories. In one sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina pressed her sweaty back against the wall, her heavy breathing echoing in the bathroom as she attempted to calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo big deal, right? They hadn\u2019t even <i>gone</i> to the gym yet. She could burn all that off, right? How long did it take to burn thirty-five-hundred calories? Surely if she just ate this (for the rest of the day!) she\u2019d be fine. This and breakfast wouldn\u2019t kill her. Just a carbo-load. Athletes do it all the time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina collapsed on the mat, sweating in all the wrong places after only three half-situps. When crunches had started becoming something of a problem for her three weeks ago, one of the gym regulars suggested doing sit-ups to work up her core. But lately even <i>those</i> were starting to become impossible\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands reeled in over her stomach, resting on the swell of her pudgy paunch as it lay distended and flabby. In this position, the belly-flab pooled outwards as it sunk under its own weight, collapsing into her lovehandles and collecting her sweat off of the matt. The sound of her and the mat meeting had progressively gotten louder every week, but Christina was sure that she\u2019d heard the distinct sound of her modest amount of backfat clapping against the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled to look down, seeing only the white mounds of her t-shirt clad hooters and the mountain peak of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, how long had her belly been big enough to see over her tits\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a sudden burst of energy renewed, Christy launched into another sit-up, touching her elbows to her knees for the first time in weeks in her frustration-fueled frenzy. She later, however, fell back onto the mat. Down for the count, if her sides and neck had and anything to say about it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay there for three solid minutes before working up the strength to remove herself from the floor, cautiously rocking her way over to the smoothie bar, wary of her aches and pains, and eased herself down onto a stool next to Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, good workout?\u201d Vicky asked innocently as she slurped on her smoothie, not looking up from her phone nor deviating from the straw, \u201cThis place is the best, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina\u2019s eyes narrowed to slits as she stared daggers at Victoria, who hadn\u2019t left her seat at the smoothie shack since they\u2019d been here. Granted, that had only been about half an hour, but it seemed that her work-out buddy was more concerned with what cap went with her outfit than she was with working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>slrrrrp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina smacked her lips as she watched Victoria guzzle down a rich blend of banana and strawberry\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know these things only have like, two hundred calories?\u201d Vicky asked, turning her attention to the immensely sweaty Christina for the first time since she\u2019d sat down, \u201cI just, like, can\u2019t stop drinking them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked over to the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch, they\u2019re\u2026 <i>really</i> expensive.\u201d She wheezed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if you have one of these babies\u2026\u201d Vicky whipped out her card, well-worn as ever despite their short time together, \u201cCut the price in half, and then cut <i>that</i> price in half. They\u2019re like, super cheap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina watched as Vicky slurped again, resting the cup between her two titanic tits as she used both hands to fiddle with her phone. Beside her, several empty cups sat discarded, presumably the ones she couldn\u2019t get enough of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 how many of those have you had?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh, like, five.\u201d Vicky said with a snort, \u201cBut who cares? Lo-cal right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table grimaced at the bill. It was everyone\u2019s least favorite part of the meal, given how enormous their appetites were. The main downside of eating so damn much was that it was expensive. You were going to wind up paying for it one way or the other\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d Alice gasped, her pudgy hand cupping her lips as she cut her curse short, \u201cI knew I should <br>\r\nhave stopped at seconds\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa crinkled her nose as her bill over to Alice silently, hoping that nobody would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina wretched at the rather large number next to \u2018total\u2019. Surely she hadn\u2019t eaten that much\u2019s worth of food tonight, had she? God, she felt like such a pig. Nothing to do now but pay for it, said the girl with the messiest purse in existence. Just had to find her credit card and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat that?\u201d Alice asked, pointing to the little gold card Christina had put onto the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s my gym membership card.\u201d Christina mentioned off-handedly while she rummaged through her purse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw.\u201d Melissa curled one nostril at the golden card, \"Jeez Christy, we all know you\u2019re the skinniest girl in the office, no need to rub our noses in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, I just brought it because I thought I might\u2026\u201d \u2014<i>click!</i>\u2014\u201cGet a discount?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you get a discount here?!\" Melissa roared, suddenly impressed by the tiny piece of plastic, \"That's so cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe, I dunno.\" Christina said, pondering the possibility, \"I mean, everywhere else accepts this thing, and it's pretty close to the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had that\u2014\" Alice started, but was cut off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd have to roll you into the office!\" Melissa said with a playful nudge of Alice's ample side-fat, \"You'd never leave that little Chinese place on Eighth and you know it. I'd have to rent a forklift just so we could go out on Friday nights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice immediately grew very flushed at the notion, and fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's mouth watered, against her better judgment... she couldn't possibly have been hungry after all that\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That place with the Lucky Cat in the window?\" she licked her lips, \"You think I could use my discount there?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina and Victoria were going crazy over their gym discounts. They were always on the hunt for new discounts. They were hooked on the thrill of savings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe our membership works here. This place wasn\u2019t even listed on the website!\u201d Christina said, licking the sauce off her chubby fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, good thinking, asking the women at the gym\u2019s front desk.\u201d Victoria said. She leaned over to show Christina the long receipt. \u201cCan you believe it? All that for just 30 bucks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that might be a personal best. That might be considered robbery!\u201d Christina said with a smirk. \u201cYou know we haven\u2019t been to the gym in a while.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. They had both been too caught up in their pursuit of finding every discount in town. Despite Victoria\u2019s complete aversion to exercise, the thought of the smoothie bar at the gym peaked her interest. She rubbed her swollen, yet still hungry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waddled into the locker room. They weren\u2019t planning on going to the gym today but luckily they both had their workout clothes in Victoria\u2019s car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both striped down and suited up. It had been almost 3 weeks since they had been to the gym, and it showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUr- urrrr\u2026 Christy can you *pant* help?\u201d Victoria said. She was trying to pull up her black spandex leggings over her giant bulging bottom. She turned around showing Christina her soft pale cheeks. Christy grabbed the stretched material. The two women grunted and huffed as they slowly pulled up over her jiggling flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*huff* Thanks.\u201d Christina struggled to bring her shirt down over the curve of her doughy hanging belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that they had done some expanding since they last wore these clothes. Christina\u2019s chubby butt peaked out from her tight track pants. The polyester fabric that wrapped around her blubbery thighs made a noise as she waddled. Victoria\u2019s giant belly and bottom bounced with each plodding step. There were several small holes in her spandex leggings as her fat stretched out the fabric. There was a small sliver of flesh around her waist as her shirt failed to cover her ample doughy midsection. You could see every curve, roll and flabby fold on the two overfed plumpers. Their tight, overstretched clothes showed every bounce, wobble, and jiggle of their swollen, out of shape bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know we should probably get some smoothies first.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah for like fuel.\u201d Christina responded. \u201cPlus with the discount, we\u2019d be dumb not too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waddled over to the bar. Victoria\u2019s enormous bottom hung far over the edge of her seat. They started off with a strawberry banana smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm\u2026 This is really good!\u201d Christina said sucking down the last of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! Oh you should try the pineapple one.\u201d Victoria said. Christina was just going to have one smoothie before she worked out but the taste was too good, plus it was such a good deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat one was even better.\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not another? You\u2019ll really like this one.\u201d Victoria said. And so they continued to go down the menu. One after another they sampled smoothie after smoothie. They just went down so smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre their anymore smoothies to try?\u201d Christy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about one of the shakes?\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be drinking protein sha- Oooh there\u2019s a chocolate one!\u201d Christina said. The tubby \u201cgym members\u201d certainly didn\u2019t need to order a protein packed \u201cBulk-up Shake\u201d but with a resemblance to milkshakes and flavors like chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, it was hard for them to say no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are *burp* a bit more filling. I\u2019m not sure these will help us lose weight.\u201d Christy said. She rubbed her full gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? We\u2019re in a gym, how could it possibly be bad for you?\u201d Victoria said, sucking down the shake. Christy could\u2019ve argued but conveniently accepted Victoria\u2019s logic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent a long time and emptied many cups sitting at the smoothie bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, wanna go?\u201d Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that was fun.\u201d Victoria said. The two women dropped from their stools with a thud. Their giant bloated bellies bounced heavily as they hung out of her shirt for everyone to see. They certainly provided a lot of motivation to the rest of the gym goers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina was the first to realize that she had a problem, rest assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past couple of weeks, as well as the ones in the near future, Christina had begun to implore Victoria that the two of them actually visit the gym from which the memberships they so gleefully abused hailed from. A snack here, a meal there, but then it was off to the gymnasium to melt of some pounds! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026In theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn practice, however, Christina would find her willpower hardly as bolstered as she would have thought. For every crunch, sit-up, rep, pull-up, or crunch she managed on the sweaty gym floor, there were at least a hundred calories to make up for it. Christina would sweat and sweat and work and sweat for a pathetic amount of time before calling it quits and taking a breather with increasingly idle Victoria\u2014which almost always resulted in her work out for the day being prematurely cancelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, despite her genuine zeal for weight loss, Christina wasn\u2019t finding herself losing much of anything. She would begin every day with a conscious effort at psyching herself up for squeezing in as much exercise as she could in one day\u2014walking papers over to her coworkers instead of emailing them, lifting heavy files, using that little ball she bought to put between her legs and squeeze, butt-clenches at her desk, <i>anything</i> to get herself moving. However, she would find herself defeated day in and day out at increasingly early intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only muscles Christina would strengthen in those coming weeks would be her jaw, her sole limits tested were her lethargy and appetite, and the only direction her pants size would go was up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina instinctively tugged at the clingy material that wrapped around her bobbing belly. She pinched and distorted the fabric, uncertain as to whether or not the pattern was slimming. It didn\u2019t look slimming in the mirror that morning, but it was either this or her Librarian Clothes. She wanted to look fun and pretty\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand cupped the round pudge that pooched heavily over her waistline, the vinyl material stretched over her vast paleness. Even her hand looked fat, with thick squishy arms that lacked their previous definition of bone and muscle. She frowned instinctively at her willful pudge, too stubborn to just go away already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to look fun and pretty, even if she was fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina took a few steps forward and opened the door into the break room, an eruption of girlish gabbing going unheard by the self-conscious employee as she imagined booming footsteps following her every movement. Surely she wasn\u2019t <i>that</i> fat. But this dress had been a mistake, for sure. It was breathy, yeah, but it was so close against her skin\u2026 it couldn\u2019t have been flattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn\u2019t. Christina\u2019s big butt had the workings of a shelf behind her, each cheek moshing from within the floral pattern of the vinyl-polyester summery dress. She had gotten quite hippy lately, with her thighs flaring outwards while her legs thickened beneath her. Even her toes had gotten fat\u2014evidenced by her open-toed sandals to complete the easy-breezy-I\u2019m-not-fat look she tried so desperately to pull off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer round face flushed as she felt the eyes of her coworkers beat against her as she walked towards the vending machine. Just a soda and an apple pie, she warned herself, or no dinner tonight. Gotta eat healthy, gotta eat right. Tomorrow was Wednesday, so maybe she could convince Vicky to jog to the gym with her\u2026 oh--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cool touch of the glass sent a chill through Christy\u2019s shape. Maybe she\u2019d taken a few steps too many forward\u2026 no point in stepping back now, just deal with it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dYou know Cass, I\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</i> Gnoshed a distinctive voice from the radio, followed by the familiar sound of rustling plastic bags, <i>\u201cIf fe would juff ignore all the critfism iftead of jufmm.mmmm\u2026 mmpmhm\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina punched in the numbers, an anxious sweat misting her forehead. Surely nobody <i>here</i> was in any place to judge her for her weight, right? For God\u2019s sake, none of these girls could even sit on the same break room bench with one another. Surely just because Christina might have put on just a teeny\u2026 <i>tiny</i> amount of weight, no one would say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little spring whirred and the apple pie fell to the floor of the machine. Here came the worst part\u2014bending over. Her pants had all ripped right down the seat, thus the dress. Even if this dress wouldn\u2019t rip (rather, <i>shouldn\u2019t</i> rip!) she had an overall distaste for the action by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dMarni, Marni, Marni\u2026 you know I can\u2019t understand you when you talk with your mouth full.\u201d</i> came an irate and deeper woman over the speaker, <i>\u201dJeez, are you eating <u>again</u>? I thought the studio asked you not to bring food in here anymore?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dOh gimme a break, I missed breakfast.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christina bent over, she gave everyone in the break room a prime view of her big round ass. Courtney led the room in playful catcalling, which was nice of her, but still rang kinda hollow to currently self-depreciating Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha, you guys.\u201d She said, her round face flush with embarrassment as she whipped back around with her apple pie in tow, \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m going to the gym <i>tomorrow</i>, so you\u2019ll have a lot less to catcall at by this time next month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh jeez, stop being such a prude.\u201d Melissa said with a roll of her eyes, \u201cTrust us, we\u2019re the experts on fat girls. And you\u2019re no fat girl.\u201d She slapped her gargantuan stomach, stuffed into a tight white blouse and brown skirt. The mammoth middle shook violently at the action, while Melissa\u2019s other hand fed her donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>That</i> is a fat girl.\u201d Courtney said with a thick thumb to Melissa, \u201cAnd a pretty unrepentant one at that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh bite me.\u201d Melissa crinkled her nose at Courtney, biting viciously into her donut<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys\u2026 come on.\u201d Alice said in an almost maternal manner as she nudged her head towards the sulking Christina, who hadn\u2019t taken to the joke as well as the others had, \u201cChristina, sweetie, you look great. Really. I <i>dream</i> of the day I could pull of a cute little dress like that again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina smiled, despite herself. Alice\u2019s comment made her feel a little better, but she still felt like a stuffed sausage in its casing. She sat down next to Alice, and she did her best to play the wallflower again. She wasn\u2019t feeling exactly confident in herself, you see\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dOkay so maybe I\u2019ve put on a <u>little</u> weight, but I do <u>not</u> have a problem!\u201d</i> Marni huffed and puffed over the speaker <i>\u201dI go to the gym, like, six times a week! I\u2019ve got the discount points to prove it!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christina nibbled away on her pie, trying to make it last, it dawned on her that she had hardly been paying attention to the conversation at hand. She\u2019d been sitting there for a good five minutes while talk radio poured in over the loudspeaker system, and she\u2019d zoned out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno Courtney, I could totally see myself getting a gym membership.\u201d Melissa said with a wry smile, \u201cI mean, Christina\u2019s gym gives out all these free discounts and shit\u2026 I could deal with a little exercise if it meant I get to save some money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney just laughed, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d have to actually <i>go</i> to the gym in order to get the discount, \u2018Lissa.\u201d Her entire body shook with amusement, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be able to just sign up and get discounts. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa leaned in in an effort to hush her voice, but Christina could definitely hear what she said\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201dLooks like it works pretty well for Christina, huh?\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CREEEAK THUMPUMP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dWhaa--!\u201d</i> Marni\u2019s voice reemerged once the distinct sound of chair splintering settled, her voice muffled in its distance from the microphone, <i>\u201dC-Cass!  Hff... hff...Help me up?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina stood up from her seat at the table, little droplets of tears behind her glasses, and stormed out of the room. Courtney punched Melissa in the flabby arm while Alice shot her a dirty look, but it couldn\u2019t make up for Christy\u2019s hurt feelings\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dI rest my case, Mega-Marni.\u201d</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She heard footsteps and looked up to see Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Mel, she\u2019s just cranky. She didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut *sniff* she\u2019s right. I\u2019m such a pig.\u201d Christina said grabbing her doughy belly for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Christy, you\u2019re the farthest thing from it.\u201d Alice paused. \u201cHow about we go to the gym together?\u201d Christina stopped crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Really? Like now?\u201d Christy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I wanna see what you and Victoria are always talking about. I doubt Jenna\u2019s gonna do anything.\u201d Alice said. Christy smiled and they walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving early, I\u2019ll explain tomorrow!\u201d Alice yelled to Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what\u2019s going on? Let me come!\u201d Victoria said as she struggled to get off her chair. She half jogged up to Alice and Christina outside of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha- *huff* Where are we *wheeze* going?\u201d Victoria huffed as they waddled through the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gym, and\u2026 I guess you can come along.\u201d Alice said, not wanting to say no (Vicky probably wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer anyway). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey piled into Alice\u2019s car and swung by everyone\u2019s place to pick up some gym clothes. It was hard for Christina to stay upset as Alice whisked her off to the gym, combined with Victoria\u2019s gullible confusion she had officially flipped her frown upside-down. Finally they parked and walked into the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh these smoothies are too DIE for! You\u2019re gonna love them.\u201d Victoria gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmoothies?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they have strawberry, pineapple, My favorite is banana, actually I think cherry and blueberry is my favorite\u2026 or maybe lemon and raspberry.\u201d Victoria continued to gush about smoothies until they got to the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBulk-up shakes?\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I don\u2019t know why they call them that but they taste sooo good, you\u2019ve gotta try one.\u201d Vicky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass, but that sounds cool.\u201d Alice said. Christina giggled at Victoria. They each went up to a locker and took out their work out clothes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been to a gym in years. I can\u2019t believe I still had workout clothes in my closet.\u201d Alice said. She had a habit of making half-assed attempts to get in shape. Which meant every year or so Alice bought new gym clothes only to use them while she sat eating on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy sighed as she could feel her clothes clinging to her pudgy frame. She did feel a bit better though as she looked at her two friends next to her. Alice\u2019s sweatpants looked like tights as her thick legs removed any bagginess and comfort that usually came with sweatpants. Meanwhile Victoria\u2019s spandex leggings left little to the imagination as her enormous rear stretched the material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you have like an exercise routine?\u201d Alice asked as they walked out of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 sorta.\u201d Christina said halfheartedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to go to the smoothie bar. I don\u2019t like sweat.\u201d Victoria said. Alice wasn\u2019t surprised, but she wasn\u2019t about to let Vicky sit this one out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Vicky don\u2019t bail on us.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 but\u2026\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay for your smoothies when we\u2019re done.\u201d Alice said. That was an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do the treadmill for a bit.\u201d Christina said. They waddled over to the treadmills. They each started a slow walk. Christina went up to a faster pace. Victoria and Alice were barely staying on their feet. Their large bottoms wobbled violently as their bulky gelatinous thighs squished together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was starting to breathe heavily and sweat trickled down her head. She started to feel disappointed in herself, as her thoughts from earlier returned. That\u2019s when she heard the sound of the treadmills turning off. She looked next to her to see Vicky and Alice standing still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria and Alice were weezing and covered in sweat. Alice was hunched over and leaning heavily on the machine. Her legs trembled as they struggled to hold up her bulk. Victoria clutched her chest as her pudgy bosom rose and fell with her huge gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI *huff*\u2026 I *wheeze* qu-quit.\u201d Victoria said as she stumbled to the smoothie shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe\u2026 Yeah let\u2019s *pant* do something *huff* else.\u201d Alice squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. How about sit-ups?\u201d Christy said. They waddled over to the mats. Alice dropped to the floor with a thud. She really wanted to quit but she wanted to keep it up for Christina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked up at her breasts and belly as she laid on her back. She hated that she saw her doughy gut sticking out past her breasts. She looked over at Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust give me a *pant* second to catch my *huff* breath.\u201d Alice said. Christina looked at Alice as she lay on the floor. She was surprised how huge Alice was. Her shirt stopped a couple inches above her belly button. Her half naked gut looked like a big dome of blubber. Her thick arm fat oozed on the floor. Her giant breasts made most of her neck disappear. Christina definitely didn\u2019t feel so big anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright let\u2019s start.\u201d Christina struggled as slowly she lifted off the mat. She tried but couldn\u2019t go all the way up before she fell back down. She looked over at Alice. With her legs up Alice\u2019s belly rested against her thighs. She groaned and through her momentum forward. Except the only thing that came off the mat was the back of the head. Her body stayed pinned to the floor. Her breasts, belly and thighs squished together as she made another attempt but she remained grounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t *huff* have to *pant* stop.\u201d Alice panted. Christina went back and made a few more attempts. She managed to go all the way once before falling back with a thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s *gasp* bothering you?... I know Melissa can be *pant* mean but why does it bother you so much?\u201d Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019ve gotten so fat.\u201d Christina huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, so what? Join the club. There\u2019s no punishment for being fat\u2026 aside from wearing bigger clothes.\u201d Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that I look so big and\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig? You\u2019re the skinniest one at the office. You always wear tight little dresses and skirts that make us jealous. Life is a lot easier if you have confidence in yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t let Melissa bother you. She wished she looked as good as you.\u201d Alice said. Christina smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop. I could definitely go for a smoothie.\u201d Christina said getting off of the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, let\u2019s hope Victoria hasn\u2019t bankrupt me.\u201d Alice joked. They waddled over and sat next to Victoria.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And maybe, just maybe, it was a bad idea to ask for the extra-large, only-available-on-request cup <i>and</i> fill it with a sweet bubbly nectar that was Baja Blast. But a) you could only get it at Taco Bell, and b) her membership rewards made it just a bit more affordable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich made it pretty easy to justify the burrito triplets, a cheesy gordita crunch, and an order of nachos all to herself (<i>with</i> one of those little bags of Doritos that they gave out!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God Alice, now that you\u2019re gonna exercise with us, you can totally eat whatever you want!\u201d Victoria announced, aggravated by her coworker\u2019s restraint, \u201cStop being such a baby and actually get something that\u2019ll fill you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice tucked the little gold card back down into her wallet and banished it down into the depths of her purse. She\u2019d never felt so stupid, signing up from this gym membership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, Vicky\u2026 I still feel pretty dumb for even getting this thing. I work later than either of you\u2014when am I even gonna have the time to <i>go</i>?\u201d she pursed her full pink lips around her straw and took a sip, \u201cPlus, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not how \u2018exercise\u2019 works\u2026 <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">especially considering you didn\u2019t <i>do</i> any\u2026</font>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina gnoshed down on her prey, oblivious to the world as she pierced her burrito\u2019s soft tortilla skin and guzzled down its sour creamy blood. Once she swallowed, her hands instinctively wriggled their way down the neck of her meal before taking another bite, and so on, only occasionally breaking to take a slurp of her delicious green drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe such an indulgence after all of her weight woes wasn\u2019t the <i>smartest</i> thing to do, but dammit it made her feel better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen like, you should totally start coming on Saturdays with me and Christina!\u201d Vicky said contentedly, \u201cLike, Christy totally won\u2019t mind, will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmphmhm\u2026\u201d Christy mumbled through her burrito<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaturdays are when I hang out with Melissa though\u2026 and Wednesdays are when Jenna keeps us after.\u201d Alice interjected, ignoring her friends voracity, \u201cI mean, I could go with you guys every once in a while though. Do you go on Fridays?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes we go on Fridays.\u201d Vicky said with a sip at her straw, only to get an abrasive (yet familiar) slurping noise in response \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get a refill.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vicky made her announcement and unlodged herself from her place in the booth, it did not escape Alice to sneak a peek at the immense Italian\u2019s prodigious backside. It was easily her most distinguishing feature, and growing more and more pronounced by the day. At least as large as her own, but on a girl half her size. The two rolling avalanches of butt blubber sloshed lazily in Vicky\u2019s tight spandex, stretched to transparency over her quivering olive mass. Her thighs rubbed together audibly\u2014the sound of spandex on spandex making an unmistakable noise with her every awkward gait\u2014and her flabby arms swung from side to side slightly with the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky stepped to the sodajerk and put her cup under the fountain, her flabby belly cutting into the stainless steel counter on which the machine sat despite her generous distance from it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does she, like\u2026 not\u2026 <i>know</i>?\u201d Alice asked Christina, without looking back, \u201cWith the way she talks you\u2019d expect Victoria to be a little\u2026 um\u2026 a little er\u2026 Christina?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhu?\u201d Christina looked up from her meal, cheeks bulging with masticated meaty mush, \u201cShorry I wushn\u2019t\u2026 glp\u2026 paying attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s eyes softened slightly, making the svelter blonde take a large bite of her gordita, \u201cChristina, are you still upset about what Melissa said to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoh.\u201d She said before swallowing, \u201cWhy would I\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie, I know a thing or two about comfort eating.\u201d Alice said with a slight sternness, \u201cEnough to recognize it when I see it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed in a semi-silent relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine. I am.\u201d She said sharply, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 where does she get off calling me fat? I mean <i>I</i> know I\u2019m fat, but she\u2026 but she\u2026 ugh. Hurt my feelings, so now I\u2019m stuffing my face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo punctuate her point, Christina grabbed the remaining burrito left on her tray and took a big chomp out of it. She shoved the food to one side, giving her one bloated cheek, so that she could continue to make her point before continuing to make Melissa\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I am fat, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice tentatively touched her friend on the arm and waited for her to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you keep eating like that, maybe one day. But for right now, you\u2019re still the skinniest girl in the office.\u201d Alice said with a smile, \u201cJust be careful, and don\u2019t let anyone get to you so bad. You\u2019ve got to have confidence in yourself, or every time somebody calls you \u201cfat\u201d or \u201ctubby\u201d or \u201cwide-load\u201d, you\u2019ll wind up eating exactly like you are today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence as Christy finished her food, looking Alice in the eyes while she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I did overdo it a little today, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little. Can\u2019t have you winding up looking like me or Vic\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I was thinking that, after this, we\u2019d show Alice that little caf\u00e9 down the road!\u201d a third voice, Victoria, re-entered the conversation, \u201cYou know, that one with the giant muffins and the extra-extra-extra large coffees? Oh my God, and the smoothies too! They\u2019re almost as good as the ones in the gym! And maybe we could all get one of those big, fat, chocolate chip cook\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVicky, I\u2019ve already <i>been</i> there\u2026\u201d Alice objected softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not as a <i>member!</i>\u201d Victoria announced proudly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having that card if you don\u2019t enjoy all the discounts it can bring?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo maybe go to the gym?\u201d Christy interjected dryly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, besides that!\u201d </span></div></div>",

The shirt was a bit tight around her soft midsection and breasts but she thought she pulled it off. She might not have had much of an hourglass figure anymore but she still had more than any of her coworkers. Her hair looked really good, she thought. Christina walked out of the bathroom and into the break room. There was Courtney, Melissa and Alice chatting while they stuffed themselves with junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to the refrigerator and opened the door. Bending over she searched through the contents of food. This sparked chorus of catcalls from Courtney followed by Mel and Alice. Christina playfully shook her ample rump to play along with the bit. She even did a little dance as she pulled the piece of birthday cake out of the fridge and sat at the table. Her belly still wobbling as she took her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah then she said she pretty sure she\u2019s still at her high school weight.\u201d Courtney said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are we talking about?\u201d Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVicky.

Her drooping olive gut brushed against the wood of the counter, her uppermost stomach slab spilling onto the surface of the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight? But since we\u2019re working out\u2026\u201d she trailed off before stealing her milkshake back from Christina, \u201cWe can totally have as much as we want. You want one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll just get another smoothie.\u201d Christy crinkled her nose before smiling at the woman behind the counter, who went right to work on making her a double banana blueberry, \u201cA lot easier to eat, plus I\u2019m in kind\u2019ve a fruity mood today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve like, eaten every flavor.\u201d Vicky huffed, upset by Christy\u2019s lack of willingness to admit she was right, \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want something new?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christina\u2019s smoothie came up and she passed the girl her cards (both membership and credit) the doughy blonde representative took a big slurp from her straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty <i>confident</i> that I\u2019m just gonna stick to smoothies for now.\u201d She said with a laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s to Health Insurance!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive chubby arms raised in the air and clinked their glasses, clear champagne sloshing around in each crystalline container before being downed by their respective drinkers. The restaurant was somewhat hoity-toity, and no one really wanted to make a scene, but tonight was a cause for celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter 12 months of working with us, you\u2019re finally a real employee!\u201d Courtney said with a laugh, \u201cIf you had just quit your stupid internship we coulda given it to you sooner, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, whatever.\u201d Christy said dismissively, \u201cHeard it before, shoulda jumped on, shoulda told my boss to go screw himself, shoulda done a lot of stuff. What\u2019s important now is that I\u2019m officially one of you guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina\u2019s announcement rang true in more than one way, of course. While it was true that now she had become a fully-fledged member of Gordge Enterprises, Christina was also beginning to fit in around the office in more than just status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer strapless blue dress hugged her expanded form tightly, little rolls of back fat dimpling behind her shoulders. Her doughy arms wobbled with every movement, and the bigness of her belly was beginning to stress the front of her ensemble for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the office, Christy!\u201d Alice laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t spent the last eighteen months with us anyway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy\u2019s thick arm shot forward to grab a complimentary roll once she saw that Melissa was making a move on the basket. Her chubby fingers wrapped around the soft piece of bread before she took a bit chomp out of it\u2014leaving her coral lipstick on the remaining grain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez Christy!\u201d Melissa whined, \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s not six other pieces there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if you had anything to say about it.\u201d Christy said with her chubby cheeks full of bread, \u201cI\u2019m pretty <i>confident</i> in saying that you would have eaten them all if you had the chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, sans Melissa, laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was midnight in her apartment, and the only light to be seen came from the dimly lit refrigerator in Christina\u2019s kitchen. The low hum of the machine\u2019s motor filled the room, and made the floor vibrate slightly at its feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 this looks yummy\u2026\u201d she licked her full pink lips with a greedy, salivating tongue as she reached into the frigid ice box and pulled out a Tupperware container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d woken up not but five minutes earlier, her belly grumbling wantingly for something sweet and filling (<i>despite</i> the fact that tonight had been pizza night, and she\u2019d emphasized the \u2018pizza\u2019 part extra tonight) It just so happened that there was a little chocolate cake in the fridge that she\u2019d been saving for just such an occasion\u2026 since this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina\u2019s wide and generous shape eclipsed the light from her fridge a little more every night. However, from behind, it gave a perfect impression of how far her gluttony had taken her. The once slender employee had grown quite round, with round heart-shaped hips and rolling curves that shook whenever she walked. Even now, her belly and love handles lay completely exposed by her lacking tank top, soft creamy pudge lapping over her panties and eclipsing her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one thick arm, she held the cake out decadently, while the other rubbed her burgeoning belly. They'd both grown impressively thick these past few weeks, with her indulgence yielding her wobbly arm wings and increasingly toneless appendages. Even her fingers looked completely unrecognizable, from the slender typer's fingers had grown ones more akin and accustomed to munching on donuts and sweets around the office. Her round face flushed red with excitement and greed as she eagerly awaited her sweet delicious treat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty <i>confident</i> that I\u2019ve earned this\u2026\u201d she said with a greedy grin, drooling from the corners of her mouth, \u201cAfter all tomorrow <i>is</i> Wednesday\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

The booth table was littered with dishes. The combined effort of Courtney, Christina, and Alice was too much for the waiter to keep the used plates from stacking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s incredible.

Christina stayed on the phone for a couple minutes with one of the radio producers. As she ended the call they all made girlish screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, oh my god. Where was the address?\u201d Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c224 Main street. Do you think we\u2019ll meet Marni or Cass?\u201d Alice squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould that happen?

Cass and Marni talked for a few second before removing their headphones. Cass got up and walked out of the booth. Marni stayed in her seat and pulled out a large sub which she took a big bite out of. Cass walked over to the blubbery trio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich one of you is Christina?\u201d Christina squeaked out a response. \u201cWell congratz. Maybe I\u2019ll run into you at the gym.\u201d Cass said. She then walked pass them.

One voicemail from Victoria.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was plainly obvious that none of the officious ladies that waddled in some time later that week were even passingly familiar with the teachings of a gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe particularly large one with the distractingly large breasts, Alice, had crammed herself into yet another expensive purchase of expansive exercise clothing. The entirety of her upper half was painted a soft pink by the tight clingy clothes she\u2019d stuffed herself into, complementing the lovely shade of red her cheeks had grown in the short distance from the car to the door. Her lower half was a darker shade of magenta, the outline of her belly tucked beneath the waistband of her sweats clearly defined as it pressed tightly against the confining bottoms and spread the gap between her ensemble\u2014a slight smile of pale pudge creeping into view every so often, forcing her to tug at her top. Her mammoth arms swung at her sides in her attempts to keep momentum going, and her mouth hung open slightly as she struggled to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite her was Victoria, who seemed peculiar in that she seemed more breathless than her much larger friend. While no doubt immense in her own right, she was still at least forty pounds Alice\u2019s junior. Vicky\u2019s exaggerated pear shape was never more evident than in her spandex lycra workout leggings\u2014stretched to transparency over the olive tree trunks that were each of her thighs. Her upper half was hardly as contained though, as her peculiar denial over the matter of her weight had robbed her the decency to tuck her tummy into her waistband. The soft, malleable mass that was Vicky\u2019s voracious gut slapped loudly against her fat thighs, and wobbled with increasing ferocity at her every awkward step. Between her proud Italian bust, she\u2019d crammed a milkshake with the straw aimed to her mouth, leaving her hands free so that she might update her Facebook status and report that she was going the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proud contest winner herself, Christina, looked almost svelte between the two of them. She\u2019d opted for a rather modest t-shirt that she\u2019d stretched over her puckish upper half. The past few months of her rapid expansion had lent her no favors in the clothing department, as even now the soft smile of her underbelly could be seen bobbling out from under the hem of her tee, much like Alice she had been forced to tug down on it every so often to keep herself decent. Her glasses had been removed in anticipation of her incoming workout with the premium membership, making her face look thinner, but her half-sleeves wrapping around her doughy upper arms, combined with the chubbiness of her wrists and lack of definition in any part of her body counteracted the modest favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them hobbled up to the front counter, whereupon Christina proudly flashed her Premium Membership card\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Miss, if you\u2019ll just follow me I\u2019ll show you there.\u201d The trim, toned attendant said with a smile as she stepped out from behind the counter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina happily obliged, her two flabby friends following suit as the skinny minny lead them down the hallway where, Christina noted, the bathrooms were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou take your card.\u201d The woman said, whipping out her own platinum colored membership certificate, \u201cAnd then you put it under the scanner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet beep sounded that she was safe to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are mats in the center where the TV is, some treadmills and exercise bikes if you\u2019re a real cardio nut like I am, the strength stuff is in the back, and if you\u2019ll go past that, there\u2019s the sauna and massage parlor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, thank you very much!\u201d Christina smiled as she, Vicky, and Alice attempted to step through<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on her attendant faltered slightly at the intrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that, if your friends don\u2019t have Premium memberships, they\u2019ll have to stay outside\u2026\u201d she said with a practiced friendliness, \u201cWe\u2019re kind\u2019ve a new gym, and getting people to pay for the Premiums is a really big deal. My boss would kill me if she found out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFit Life Gym really <i>was</i> a new gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Premium room was almost completely empty, at least the main section with the cardio equipment was. Except for the attendant that had let her in after the other one left, there was only maybe three people inside, Christina included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were both really skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Christy just kind\u2019ve stood there, unsure of what exactly to do. Admittedly, she was a little intimidated by the other women in the room. One of them looked like Jillian Michaels, and the other one looked like that woman from the Golf channel. And here she was, weighing in at almost two hundred and fifty pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could just\u2026 avoid them? That woman who led her here said that there was a sauna and massage parlor.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d undressed (having the foresight to bring a bathing suit in hopes of testing out their highly advertised steam room) and had come in to find the room already quite steamy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay back against the wall, the moisture in the room running down her back as it clung to the wall. In her reclined position, her singularly large gut spilled out between her legs, thighs separated in pleasure that doubled as allowing her belly some room to breathe. It touched the tile too, wet on her underbelly now. From her seat, she kicked her chubby legs in enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer two noodley arms supported her bulk, their vertical positioning causing the pudge on her upper arms to droop downwards towards her elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis room\u2026 she could get used to having this room all to herself for the next six months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and her head lulled back as steam overtook her. The heat was high, but not overbearing. It was a relaxing warmth that she allowed inside her. Soon she began to sweat, and moisture began to accumulate upon her like she were merely a fixture in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome by some curiosity, Christina found her hands slowly travelling to the great round mass that was her gut\u2014now wet and dripping. She touched it tentatively with both hands, kneading the fleshy mass like bread to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt\u2026 <i>really</i> good\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe sound of another voice shook Christina out of her steamy stupor, and her heart shot up into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatcha\u2026 um\u2026 whatcha doin\u2019 there?\u201d the voice said, sounding uncomfortable, \u201cI figured you might have been breathing heavy because of the steam but\u2026 yeah, just making sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I-I\u2026 ohmigod.\u201d Christy squeaked, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I thought I was alone and\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s no big deal, just\u2026 you know, you\u2019re not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom deeper into the steam room, near the corner, another shape emerged to join Christine in her sauna. The doughy office girl had been so relieved to finally get into this sauna, she hadn\u2019t taken the time to make sure that no one else was in here with her! How embarrassing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I recognize you, you\u2019re that girl who came down to the studio!\u201d the voice sounded more familiar now, \u201cAt least you\u2019re using your prize, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, Christy recognized that voice...</span></div></div>",

The bench that the two of them sat on was a little thin, but Christina managed to sit on it just fine. The woman next to her, little more than completely naked, was practically pouring herself onto the floor. Her belly drooped completely off the side of it, and her fat thighs were only half on. The only thing that was completely seated was the hostess\u2019 hind quarters\u2014moreso that she took up more of it than needed than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina could hardly wonder how a woman with no neck could be a radio hostess, her thick double chin eclipsed it entirely.

She leaned her head back and slouched down. Her swollen legs weren\u2019t even touching the bench anymore, instead her overfed bottom spread even farther over the tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool.\u201d Christina checked the clock. \u201cYou know I actually think I\u2019ll get one now.\u201d Christina said as she lifted her chubby mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you around.\u201d Marni said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina waddled out of the steamy sauna. She dried off her sweaty blubber and went to get a massage. She struggled a bit to climb up onto the table. Her flabby belly and breasts spread onto the table like pancake batter. The masseuse came out and started to press deeply into her back. Christina\u2019s midsection had gotten so doughy recently. This included her thick rolls of back flab which the masseuse rubbed thoroughly. Christina felt a little embarrassed feeling the hands sink so deep into her squishy layer of fat. The masseuse most of been grossed out trying to find any muscles in all her blubber. But didn\u2019t Marni say she\u2019d gotten a massage? Even Christy felt slim next to a short butterball like Marni. Christina calmed down. She actually was really enjoying the massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina turned over. Her meaty back hit the table with a thud. The female masseuse sunk her hands into Christina\u2019s swollen belly. Christina let out a little moan of pleasure as her big gut was squished. She wasn\u2019t quite sure what the Masseuse was doing since she couldn\u2019t see past the horizon of her jiggling cleavage but it felt sooo good. It wasn\u2019t a sexual pleasure as much as it was a sensual pleasure. Either way she was just going to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina waddled out of the premium area of the gym. She spotted Victoria and Alice over at the smoothie shack. Had they been drinking smoothies this whole time? Christina thought. She waddled over and plopped onto a seat next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Christy! What was it like Ms. Premium member?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was really cool.\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, what did *slurp* you do?\u201d Victoria said sucking down a smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I went to the sauna for a while. Oh you won\u2019t believe who I met there!... I talked to Marni!\u201d Christina squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, Marni and Cass, Marni?\u201d Alice said. Christina nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. way. What was she like?\u201d Victoria asked with giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s like, practically the same as she is on the show. I also saw Cass but I didn\u2019t get to talk to her.\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid they look like they do on the billboard?\u201d Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Cass looked like Jillian Michaels sort of. She was really fit. Marni was shorter and rounder than I thought.\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean rounder?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t just round really. She was like\u2026 BIG.\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig? Like\u2026 Fat?\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCass often mentions she\u2019s gained some weight. I always pictured her with some chub.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she was really fat. Like FAT fat.\u201d Christina said, holding her arms to gesture a giant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs big as Alice?\u201d Victoria asked. Alice frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh. Not exactly, close, but she was short so she looked even fatter.\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow I wonder when that billboard picture was taken. Anyway what did you do next?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I got a free massage, which was amaaazing.\u201d Christina bragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need one of these premium memberships.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to talk as they kept sucking down smoothies and shakes. They left the gym with their bellies bloated and heavy. Victoria and Alice especially were packed full of smoothies. Their guts hanging freely out of their clothes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Be caller number ten around lunchtime and you six free months at this place. You\u2019re not gonna get a deal like that anywhere else!

Three straight days of calling in at every chance she got, and still no membership. She was always really close though, caller number nine or caller number eleven. It wasn\u2019t like she was jealous of Christy or anything. She won fair and square, and Alice couldn\u2019t be mad about it. It was just\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, <i>she</i> would have made so much better use of it is all. Actually worked out, actually used the treadmill, actually go to the gym to <i>exercise</i>. She\u2019d been trying to lose weight (off and on) for the past few years now and then suddenly Christina gets, like, the best gym membership offer ever? It just figured, with her luck, that she\u2019d have to watch someone practically throw away something that she\u2019d been begging for since the start of her swelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Alice asked with a polite, yet practiced, interest, \u201cChristina won six months Premium Membership from doing this, are you saying that I can\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike <i>yeah</i>, Christy was a fluke!\u201d Vicky said, amazed by Alice\u2019s apparent ignorance, \u201cPlus you\u2019re like, super unlucky. If you wanna win a Premium \u2018Ship\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014Ship?\u201d Alice asked, eyebrow raised dryly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014Gym Slang.\u201d Vicky explained quickly, \u201cThen you\u2019ve gotta work the numbers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s flabby arm moved the mouse on her computer over to the tab marked \u2018FIT LIFE\u2014MEMBERSHIP PACKAGES\u2019 and clicked, showing a professional-looking chart with lots of various packages available and their prices stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been, and there\u2019s no way I could afford it.\u201d She said glumly, \u201cIt\u2019s a hundred bucks a month, and between my tailor and my apartment\u2026 and Melissa\u2026 there\u2019s just no way I could\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot <i>those</i> numbers!\u201d Vicky said, waddling her way into the already crowded cubicle, \u201cLike, your Discount Points. The points you get every time you swipe your little gold card at all the places we go out and eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey keep track of those?\u201d Alice asked incredulously, her interest genuine by this point, \u201cHow many is a Premium Membership?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s like, a hundred thousand.\u201d Vicky answered, Alice cringed slightly at such a high number that shattered her dreams so expertly, \u201cBut listen! Like, every time you get your card swiped somewhere it\u2019s a hundred points. Me and Christy go out to the gym three times a week and we eat twice. So I did the math\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere somebody coughed expectantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014Okay, Courtney did the math and like, that\u2019s 600 points just going out to eat. But they also count when you use your discount on the smoothies and milkshakes and stuff, so that puts me at two thousand a week and\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo <i>thousand</i> a week?\u201d Alice exclaimed incredulously, \u201cVicky how many of those things do you drink?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, like, get Courtney to do the math, I dunno.\u201d She said with a roll of her eyes, \u201cSo like, If I go to the gym <i>six</i> times a week instead of just three, that means I\u2019ll have four thousand points a week!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVicky, even if you <i>did</i> go six times a week, you\u2019d still have to go every day and order all that every day and <i>eat</i> all that every day for the next <i>six months</i> before you got a premium membership.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky sauntered a little closer, cocky as ever, and gave that little airheaded smirk she gave whenever she thought she had a good idea\u2014which wasn\u2019t often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike <i>exactly</i>.\u201d Vicky announced proudly, her hands resting confidently on her wide (wide <i>wide</i>) hips, \u201cI figured that by the time Little Miss Premium Member gets out, I\u2019ll wiggle my way in and see what it\u2019s like to have a sauna all to myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s jaw dropped. It actually dropped. How could anyone think that this was a good idea? Vicky had hatched some hairbrained schemes before, but this just didn\u2019t seem healthy. Alice wanted a premium membership to Fit Life too, but not nearly as bad as Vicky did, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVicky, you know you can\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Vicky asked in a huff, \u201cIt\u2019s not like Christy\u2019ll know! I\u2019ll just go with her on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays <i>and</i> all the days in between!\u201d she answered with a satisfied little smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you can\u2019t just eat your way to a Premium Membership, it\u2019s not healthy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh! It\u2019s a <i>Gym</i>! I\u2019ll just work it off while I\u2019m there!\u201d Vicky turned her impressive pearness and headed back out to the hallway, \u201cSure beats sitting on my butt waiting to be Caller Number Ten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina slurped on her milkshake absently. She could see why Vicky liked these so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so she really shouldn\u2019t be here without Vicky. Or at least Alice. It wasn\u2019t fair. They were workout buddies and... and there was just this unspoken code between them that they shouldn\u2019t work out without each other. It was like that time when Vicky skipped ahead on Netflix without her knowing. It somehow just felt\u2026 wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all of her doubts melted away as soon as she saw the masseuse come her way. She put the milkshake down on the bench, but rejoiced with a little squeak upon being told that she could still sip away while she got manhandled by the little Korean woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God\u2026 this was heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting pampered and rubbed and kneaded\u2026 sipping on milkshakes without lifting a finger... she should do this more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA <i>lot</i> more often\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like anyone would know.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina had been a premium gym member for two months now and she had been enjoying it to the fullest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swiped the card and waddled in to the premium facilities. There was a separate locker room for the premium members who wanted to use the sauna or get a massage. She had two smoothies in hand to sip. Christina started to take her clothes off. As she pulled her shirt off her bulging belly flopped down on her thighs. Her juicy fat rolls jiggled with her every move. She switched into a bikini. Christina took a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Her swimsuit was getting really snug. Her soft fattened breasts squished together to make a long crease of cleavage. The tight bikini bottom was giving her a wedgie as it struggled to fit over her wide round bottom. She lifted up her gut to see the front of her swimwear. She had gotten them a month or so ago and they already were pinching into her increasing layers of blubber.  Christina picked up her two smoothies and waddled into the massage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female masseuse greeted her and Christina awkwardly heaved herself onto the table. She laid on her back with her belly sticking up. There was no doubt Christina had gotten fatter since becoming a premium member. She had filled herself up with all those extra special discounts. And don\u2019t forget the smoothies. She had even fallen for those bulk up shakes that only weightlifters and Vicky drink. A lot of it had gone to Christina\u2019s overfed middle. The masseuse\u2019s hands sent ripples through her giant gut flesh. Her belly was like a big dome of jello that constantly wobbled and jiggled as Christina packed it full of sweet and salty foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly wasn\u2019t the only thing that had gotten fatter though. Her face was becoming nice and round, filling out her cheeks more. Her arms also were now flabby and plump. But Christina didn\u2019t care. She was in such pleasure as she sipped her smoothie while blubbery body was massaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Vick and Alice, this is too much to resist.\u201d Christina said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know she wasn\u2019t the only one sneaking in extra gym trips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria waddled through the gym and over to the smoothie bar. Her whole body jiggled as she pumped her rotund legs. A lot of her belly was on display as her shirt struggled to cover her rolling mounds of blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a seat at the bar of the smoothie shack. Her obese body barely managed to fit in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne banana strawberry.\u201d She said. Vicky spread her thick legs apart to give her gut some room. She had already used her member discounts at Taco Bell and Roman\u2019s Pizza before she came to the gym, and her belly was pretty packed. Victoria wasn\u2019t done eating yet, though. She sucked down her first smoothie with ease. She ordered another one which didn\u2019t last long either. Then she ordered a chocolate protein shake. Which she sipped for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was in ecstasy as she gorged herself.<i> I am so going to get that membership. I\u2019m getting so many points! Let\u2019s see, today I got 100 for the meat lover\u2019s pie at Roman\u2019s. Then there was another 100 for the burritos. So that\u2019s 200. Then this is my\u2026 3rd smoothie? Or was it 4? No, no it\u2019s the 3rd. actually I\u2019m gonna order another.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA blueberry orange please?\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s 400 smoothie points. So in total that\u2019s\u2026 uh\u2026 600! What did Courtney say I need? 600 points a day\u2026Or was it 700? Hmmm\u2026 I\u2019ll just get some ice cream across the street, just to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer 4th smoothie came to her. She started slurping it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been doing this every day for the last two months. When she wasn\u2019t hanging with Alice or Christina she was shamelessly feasting on the various restaurants around town. She didn\u2019t have a good grasp on numbers so she recruited Courtney to help her keep track of her progress of achieving 100,000 discount points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Victoria had failed to notice over the last two months (and the last few years really) was how her body was handling her eating. Her spandex covered thighs looked like giant plump sausages. Her bottom was so large it had lost any of its round shape, instead it now was just two enormous mounds of jiggle. Her belly had split into two doughy slabs of doughy fat. She was looking more and more like her elder coworkers (Alice, Melissa, and Courtney), in that there wasn\u2019t a single part of her body that wasn\u2019t covered in a layer of soft and flabby padding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the last sip of her smoothie. Vicky rubbed her bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ha, I should have been doing this earlier. I can\u2019t believe Alice said my plan was crazy! She\u2019s probably just a little jealous that I\u2019ve got such a nice body. I forgive her though, I\u2019d be jealous if I didn\u2019t have my good genes.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria grunted as she lifted herself onto her feet and left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even as she collapsed, her girth continued to wobble as it attempted to settle itself into a sitting position. Her thick arms wrestled with all four boxes and the iced coffees that she\u2019d picked up upon Alice\u2019s request. Two iced caramel frappes the size of beer mugs, one for each of them to slurp down on break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sweat Al.\u201d Melissa said with a little chortle, \u201cJeez, you\u2019d think I was giving you a kidney.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice popped the top on her box, great gut grumbling greedily at the sight of the glazed sugary temptresses before her. Still warm, too! That little bakery next to the gym never seemed to let her down, and with the added bonus of her discount\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, here.\u201d Melissa said, mouth already full of masticated mush, as she handed Alice the tiny gold card between her two sausage digits, \u201cI know you don\u2019t like to be separated from your precious member card.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past two months, Alice had idly been working her way to a Premium Membership at Fit Life Gym on her own. And while she didn\u2019t quite agree with the voracity with which Victoria tackled the problem, Alice had to admit that her way had its merits. It also had its calories, which was why she would be undertaking this challenge nice and slow\u2014she would get a membership, yes, but there was no point in spending all that money at once and keeping up with all those points...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was where Melissa had come in. Since her greedy gal-pal outright refused to set foot in a gym, let alone sign up for a membership (despite the innumerable discounts it provided) Alice had seen fit as to allow Melissa her own hand in attaining Alice\u2019s prize. Every so often the two of them would go out to eat, and Alice would let Melissa ring up with her membership card. That way, Alice gets the points and Melissa gets the discounts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody wins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 these\u2019re good.\u201d Melissa grunted as she made her way through the pastries, \u201cFigures they\u2019d put this place next to a gym, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Alice half-laughed, \u201cWell you\u2019ve gotta treat yourself, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had been doing a lot of that lately\u2014more than usual, to be precise. In fact, ever since she\u2019d gotten this stupid card, it had enabled her to eat just a little bit more without feeling the negative impact on her wallet. It showed in the additional fifteen pounds or so she carried on her already bulbous frame. Most of it went straight to her chest, but Alice\u2019s best skirts and dresses were going to be getting snug\u2026 again\u2026 if something wasn\u2019t done quickly. Maybe she\u2019d better pay George another visit soon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dAnd that concludes our new\u2026 hff\u2026 Munching with Marni segment\u2026\u201d</i> the voice over the breakroom intercom announced in a breathless huff, \u201c<i>And fellow members of Fit Life\u2026 Fit Life Gym, Patti\u2019s Pastries is having a special deal just for us fellow exer\u2026 exercisers.

They were uncomfortable and loud, sounding her presence to anyone within an earshot\u2019s distance. As if the fact that her thighs had become so inseparable lately wasn\u2019t bad enough, but to think that she could force them apart with an abrasive material like panty-hose? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy picked at her legs, painted black by the thinly stretched stockings. They were uncomfortable and compressed her meaty lower half, the fabric was drawn so tautly around the thickness of her legs that her pale peachy skin was plain and evident beneath what were supposed to be pitch black hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy lumbered towards the break room, her only refuge from work outside of the office. Every awkward, wobbling waddle of her gait was met with obscene amounts of jiggling and shimmying beneath her ensemble. From the top of her head to the tips of her toes, there was no denying that Christy was definitely a Gordge Employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d draped herself in a verdant turtle neck; one that was meant to be worn by women much smaller than her in design. It hugged her every curve, accentuating her breasts and giving them a kind of pronounced roundness, however it also had the same effect on her great doubly-tiered gut. Half-way tucked beneath the waistband of her black leather skirt, the minor deception hardly hid that Christina was quite top-heavy. Her arms filled the sleeves of her sweater with gusto, the overlap of her upperarms evident even under the heavy cloth. Her boots, even, looked ready to burst at the zipper with her fat calves poured into the sleek black shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair had been done in a more popular style recently, giving her bangs that came over her forehead while still keeping the majority of her hair up rather than down. With her glasses and newly configured facial fatness, it only served to make Christina look much rounder in the face than before\u2014something that no one seemed able to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, Christina\u2019s hands fell to either side of her great wobbling mass of stomach, able to feel its quivering movements with every belabored step. Inwardly, she wretched at how far she\u2019d allowed herself to fall. How much she\u2019d allowed herself to eat\u2014and moreover how fat she\u2019d gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Christie!\u201d Courtney had asked her earlier that day, \u201cI get off a little early today, you wanna head over to Carrie\u2019s for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No thanks! Gonna head over to the gym after work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe actually work out this time. Maybe not spend so much time getting massaged and poked and prodded, or sitting in a steam room sweating like a pig. She hadn\u2019t even used the treadmills once since she won that Premium Membership three months ago. All she\u2019d done was drink smoothies for free and maybe watch the TV that they kept in front of the workout equipment\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it was hard to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the perks, and all the discounts\u2026 it had a way of sucking her right back in. No matter how hard she tried to resist, Christina just kept falling back into the same routine. Slurp slurp sweat, slurp slurp sweat, go get a bite to eat. And it was so nice to have someone to massage her day in and day out, to take away the strain of her hectic lifestyle. Office life was hell! Nobody seemed to get that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her stomach grumbled. It begged for something sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy inadvertently pressed herself against the glass of the vending machine, green-draped gut smooshed against the unyielding glass. Looking over all of the options available to her, or perhaps the walk from her cubicle to the break room, made her breathe heavily. She hardly noticed when her soft pink tongue came to lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE4\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB7\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA9\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith surprising dexterity for such pudgy pointers, Christina nimbly fed quarter after quarter into the hungry machine. And it yielded many snacks in return for its counterpart in hungry machinery. Christy\u2019s lips had curled into a not so faint smile as she eyed all of her delicious meals\u2014<i>no</i>, her delicious snacks. Meals were what she got discounts off of. No reason to feel bad about a little snack, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach grumbled again, this time more loudly and with greater ferocity. She touched it with one hand, her outstretched fingers sinking slightly despite the bracing fabric. She arched her back slightly in anticipation of the arrival of her beloved snacks, however her free hand continued to feed more and more quarters into the slot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB6\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC3\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD7\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her cheeks grew flush at the sight of her bounty, the hand currently caressing her belly began to squeeze. Lightly at first, then it evolved into a gentle kneading as her cheeks grew rosy and her eyes glassy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of currency to feed her beast, Christina grunted thickly as she bent over to retrieve her prize. As she bent over the strain on her leather skirt was audible, as was the strain on Christina. It had been so long since she\u2019d done any actual exercise that even bending over at her weight, nearing two hundred and seventy pounds now, was beginning to become arduous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she managed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed longingly into the mound of treats cradled in her thick arms, happily convincing herself that this would be her one indulgence for the day because, after this, she was all business. Gym. Workout. Sweat. The works. She was being bad, yes but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that really so wrong?</span></div></div>",

Alice and Melissa\u2019s enormous hips were wedged together in the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa... scooch *huff* over.\u201d Alice panted. Melissa attempted to shift over to give Alice some room but could only manage to send her mountainous belly into a violent jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice readied for another push. \u201cHrrrn\u2026\u201d KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! \u201cJUST Ah *pant* MINUTE!\u201d Alice gasped. Her stuffed gut oozed further off of the sofa cushion. Finally her wide hips popped free and she stood upright. Alice awkwardly waddled to the door. Her packed belly sloshed with each step, much to Alice\u2019s discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door and handed over cash and her gold membership card in exchange for several boxes of pizza. She took back her card and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas he *wheeze* cute?\u201d Melissa asked as Alice placed the pizza on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but\u2026 Hrrrr!\u201d Alice groaned as she dropped heavily onto the sofa. \u201cI don\u2019t *huff* think we\u2019re seducing anyone looking *burp* like this.\u201d Alice puffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. The girls were not ready to appear in public. They had been eating like pigs for hours and it showed. Their faces were covered with sauce and their flabby folds and jiggling cleavage were covered with crumbs. Alice\u2019s swollen belly had completely outgrown her tank top and sat naked in her lap. Melissa had shamelessly opted to just remove her shirt showing off her enormously doughy upper body. They had been doing this every weekend for months now. Each time pushing their limits further and further all in the name of those precious discount points. They had really outdone themselves this time. Their overfed guts rose and fell with each heavy, audible breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet still as Alice opened the first box of pizza, and the obese whalish women caught a whiff of the hot cheese pizza, their glazed over eyes lit up and they happily grabbed a slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s Marni\u2019s meal of the week!

Obviously it wasn\u2019t just a fluke, this was the fifth time in a row she\u2019d swiped the damn thing and it still hadn\u2019t let her inside. She\u2019d left work a little early today in hopes of squeezing in an extra-long massage in light of her stressful day, casting aside her looming thoughts of fabric torn asunder and the ominous groaning of her office chair in hopes of a well-deserved extra half-hour with Mei-Ling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not if this stupid scanner had anything to say about it. It figures that on the <i>one</i> day she needed it the most, the stupid thing would break. Maybe she could just get someone to let her in\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, do you think you could help me?\u201d Christina puffed at the familiar blue-polo\u2019d woman while gripping a banana-strawberry blend in her free hand, \u201cMy card\u2026 it\u2019s not working. My membership should have a few more days on it. Do you think you could maybe\u2026?\u201d She trailed off as she smiled hopefully towards the shorter, but considerably fitter woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant was more than ready to help, and simply swiped the card herself\u2014only to be answered with the same uncaring \u2018boop\u2019 that had mocked Christina so readily for the past five minutes. With a little frown of her own, Christina\u2019s attendant bade her to wait for a moment while she ran the card at the front desk. She waited, but was hardly satisfied with the woman\u2019s answer upon her return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this says your Premium Membership has expired.\u201d The shorter woman said with a saleswoman\u2019s sympathy, \u201cBut if you\u2019d like I could renew it for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina nearly choked on her smoothie. How could her membership be over?! Sure it had been the allotted six months (even though it certainly didn\u2019t feel as long) but she could have <i>sworn</i> that she\u2019d had another few days to go. At <i>least</i> one more day\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy\u2019 pudgy lower lip curled into a pout as a nasal huff escaped her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t really\u2026 afford\u2026\u201d Christy trailed, \u201cI mean, I could call the studio where I got it. I\u2019m sure they could verify that\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, if you can\u2019t afford a Premium Membership at this time, we <i>do</i> have a new option available so that regular members can be afforded our premium packages.\u201d The woman, clearly an expert hustler, said with infallible chipperness, \u201cIts twenty dollars for a day pass, and that gets you unlimited access to the massage parlor, deluxe workout areas, as well as the sauna until closing. Now you can buy a week\u2019s pass for a hundred and you\u2019d basically be getting your weekends free\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina\u2019s jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I, uh\u2026 only have a twenty\u2026\u201d she whimpered, her wallet having been mysteriously cleared out well over the course of the week and several restaurants<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo did you wanna do the Day Pass?\u201d the attendant asked perkily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God, how could this have happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a whole six months already, and now Christina was either going to have to pony up a hundred bucks a month (or four hundred if she went with those week passes, which were totally outrageous!) in order to keep herself entertained (and fed) in the manner that she had become accustomed to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy sigh poured from beneath her heavy breasts, her massive mams falling as her chest loosened. No point in thinking about that now. Just\u2026 enjoy yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy pinched the spaghetti straps on her dress, her arms bending back at an angle made uncomfortable by her pillowy arms. She pulled off the skin-tight material, with little shocks sounding as the incredibly static-prone thing brushed against her skin. It was winter, and hardly the time to be wearing such light clothing. But Christy was beginning to run out of options, and it was either this or wait for her dry-cleaning to get done. She\u2019d been freezing all day, and her little half-jacket and boots had hardly helped her stay warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreed from its polyester-blended prison, Christina\u2019s great gut surged forward. It looked bigger with the floral-print painted across its width, but even in the nude Christina\u2019s vast pale gut painted an impressive picture of indulgence and greed. Doughy to the touch and folded into two great rolls, Christina\u2019s corpulence couldn\u2019t have been more cumbersome. It now hung heavily over her thighs, inching closer and closer to the skin of her knees with each passing day. It was paired with two swollen love-handles that oozed over the waistband of her panties, along with another set formed by her rolling back fat meeting under her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggling her way out of the dress, Christina took two belabored steps out of its circumference as it now lay on the floor. Her two legs had grown impossibly thick; with two great boulders that wobbled aimlessly and acted as a makeshift shelf during Melissa\u2019s more sadistic days. She could see it without a mirror, turning her head gave her a clear view of her great big bottom. Her legs had thickened and thickened until there was very little distinction between her calves and thighs\u2014other than simply growing wider as one travelled up from her swollen toes to her hidden hip-bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Christina dressed herself in her work-out gear. She\u2019d been reduced to a simple t-shirt and sweat pants over a newly-purchased bathing suit, where in the height of her fitness craze she\u2019d opted for much flashier gear akin to Victoria\u2019s. If it hadn\u2019t been for her great gut, she would have worn a sports bra alone, like the other women in the gym. But then, if it weren\u2019t for her gut, she\u2019d wear a lot of things. Her breasts had probably outgrown the conventional \u201csports bra\u201d sizes anyway. They\u2019d grown quite large alongside the rest of her, often having to fight her chub-caked arms for space in any tee she might wish to wear. Her face had even grown unrecognizably fat; the collar nearly choked her as it cut deeply into her neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pawed at her stomach and worked Vicky\u2019s old sweats over the bottom-most roll, tucking her lower stomach inside. She then rolled the t-shirt over the remaining pudge and removed her glasses. Bending over with great agony, the calamitously corpulent office gal scooped up her dress and balled it up before throwing it and her glasses into the locker she\u2019d been provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she head out the door, Christy caught sight of her immensity in the mirror\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph\u2026\u201d she whined, cupping the vastness of her gut with both hands, \u201cFigures that I\u2019d just <i>now</i> lose my Premium Membership\u2026 quit work early so I could work out, lose some of <i>this</i>\u2014\u201c she slapped her vastness, causing an irreparable wobble that reverberated all the way to the swell of her fat ass, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I <i>so</i> can\u2019t deal with this right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a smoothie (<u>a</u>, considering they were hardly free anymore\u2026) Christy was in a somewhat better mood. Stripping her outer layer of clothing and waddling into the sauna (much to the chagrin of the fitter patrons of said gym) Christy made her way over to the steam room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe sweat some of this off\u2026\u201d she grunted thickly with another jostle of her jiggliness, \u201cBut <i>noooo</i> gotta pay twenty bucks a day if Christy wants to get skinny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr one hundred a week. Or one hundred a <i>month</i> if she wanted to go that route. But even then, that was so expensive. There was no way she could afford that <i>and</i> keep herself clothed, fed, and entertained\u2026 mostly fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy opened the door and head inside, noticing with some disdain that she and the door could not occupy so much of the same space at the same time anymore. However, she managed, and launched herself down on the damp floor with a heavy SPLAP! And a splash of sweat and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 they should totally let you bring smoothies in here\u2026\u201d she whined huskily, only to be taken by surprise when someone took the liberty to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God that\u2019d be so cool.\u201d Said\u2014</span></div></div>",

You\u2019d figure since I get free smoothies they\u2019d let me bring them in here.\u201d Victoria said. She continued to talk but Christina stopped paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can\u2019t believe this is it. No more massages, no more sauna. Worst of all my best friend will be enjoying it without me! Maybe I could get that many discount points. </i>Christina put her hands on her bulging sweaty gut. <i>Who am I kidding they\u2019d have to roll me into the locker room at that point. God I\u2019m so fat\u2026 Oh stop it Christina, you\u2019re still the skinniest in the office. Alice can\u2019t even find a shirt that\u2019ll last her more than a week. Still though, I probably should lose some weight. I\u2019ll get a regular membership again (still got to have those discounts). I\u2019ll start exercising after work\u2026 eventually. Damn I\u2019m going to miss daily massages. So relaxing and stress relieving, especially on a day like today. </i>Victoria stopped talking and looked over to Christina. Christina wasn\u2019t sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 No way\u2026 That\u2019s crazy.\u201d Christina said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know right? So then\u2026\u201d Victoria continued to blabber. <i>I\u2019ll still get a day pass every couple week\u2019s maybe, just to treat myself and hang with Vicky. Man this sucks\u2026 I\u2019m so eating that cheesecake I saw in the bakery yesterday. </i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t enough that she\u2019d lost her Premium Membership, or that she was the heaviest she\u2019d ever been in her entire life, but Vicky just <i>had</i> to go and rub it in her face by getting a premium membership. In what world was it fair that <i>Vicky</i> gets to go and get massaged and drink smoothies and have access to all that exercise equipment when she\u2019s not even going to use it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh, just let me sit on my fat ass and drink all of these smoothies and milkshakes for absolutely free!\u201d</i> she imagined Vicky saying, <i>\u201cOh did I break the door with my saddlebag thighs, ah-ha I\u2019m like sooooo sorry!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a slurp on her straw, her chubby cheek pooling in her hand as she leaned into the table. Her belly cut deeply into its surface, and her armfat rested lazily on top. Christina\u2019s nostrils flared as a guttural and jealous growl escaped her. For a moment, the pace of her sucking increased as she venomously slurped down her iced coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just wasn\u2019t fair. She was <i>so</i> done. Like, more done than she\u2019d ever been with anything in her entire life. All she wanted to do was just sit at home and eat ice cream. She\u2019d been living like a queen the past six months, and now she was just supposed to <i>stop</i>? How would she unclench? How would she relax after a long day at the office? Where would she spend all her time? How was she supposed to lose weight when she couldn\u2019t drink all those healthy smoothies or have access to all that fancy equipment that only the Premium Members could use? <i>How was she supposed to sweat off her pudge when she couldn\u2019t use the steam room?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nasal pout became her as she slumped forward ever so slightly. Her large and swollen bottom spread wide across the bench seating in the break room, and her dress cut slightly into the rolling surface of her back fat. Her lower lip expanded slightly as it curled into a pout, one pudgy hand gripping the nearly-empty frappe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy licked the sticky caramel residue from her lips as she contemplated getting a soda from the vending machine. She ultimately decided against it, but her mouth was still uncomfortably dry. She clicked her tongue against her teeth as she fought the urge to rise under her own power and quench her thirst. Sodas had calories, calories were bad, yadda yadda yadda\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a <i>Sprite</i> couldn\u2019t hurt, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overfed employee gave a great huff as she kicked one flabby shapeless leg over the bench seat. She pivoted on her well-padded ass and planted the other foot firmly on the ground before pushing against the surface of the table with her hardly-hardy arms. They shook slightly with the effort that her pampered muscles exerted in moving her mass, but Christina soon found herself in a standing position. Lumbering over to the vending machine, Christy readied her quarters from her pocketbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was going to be one of those days.

The overfed sweetheart reached past her ever growing belly to put some fries on her plate. She was quite a bit bigger after Melissa and her ate their way to Alice\u2019s new premium membership. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Alice said, accidentally bumping flabby hips with a large woman next to her. She looked up and saw a familiar face. \u201cMarni? OH MY GOD are you Marni from Cass and Marni on KISS102.5?!?\u201d Alice yelped.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, that\u2019s me. I take it you\u2019re a fan?\u201d Marni replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy names Alice, Oh I\u2019m a huge fan\u2026\u201d Alice proceeded to fangirl all over Marni for a few minutes while they filled up their plates. \u201cYeah but at Gordge we listen to you every day almost.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you work at Gordge? They send us the best gift baskets.\u201d Marni said rubbing her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH Oh! That\u2019s me, I was the one that decided to send the weekly instead of every two weeks, and everything!\u201d Alice said. Marni smiled thinking about the delicious treat in those baskets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to sit down and eat with me and Cass?\u201d Marni asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god yes.\u201d Alice said trying to contain her excitement. Being a semi-popular local radio show host made Marni the minorest of minor celebrities. It wasn\u2019t often that she got to feel like a really big deal. So she welcomed Alice\u2019s intrusive fandom plus there was the chance of getting some more of those gift baskets out of her (once a week was just not enough!). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Marni and Alice waddled their giant wobbling rears over to a table were Cass was rubbing her bloated (but still slim) tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarni, I gotta stop having these buffet\u2026 Who\u2019s this?\u201d Cass said looking up at the chubby smiling face across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Alice. She works at Gordge, and was the one in charge of those gift baskets!\u201d Marni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear there great gift baskets apparently. I wouldn\u2019t know because <i>someone</i> keeps eating them all by herself.\u201d Cass joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Marni were a surprisingly good match. As they both shoveled food into their hungry gullets, they chatted on and on. Alice would listen intently as Marni did what she could do best, ramble (she had made quite a career out of it). Alice would occasionally throw out a \u201cand then what happened?\u201d or a \u201chaha no way!\u201d as Marni continued her endless chain of stories and opinions. Alice tried a few times to respon with a story of her own but it would quickly send Marni off on a tangent (much to Alice\u2019s delight).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would talk through several plates of savory buffet food. <i>How as she been eating this whole time?</i> Alice pondered as they got up for another plateful. Even as she talked endlessly Marni still managed to keep cleaning her plate.<i> I guess that happens when you talk for a living\u2026 Is she always eating during the show then?</i> Alice wondered. Looking at Marni jiggle, it certainly was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of their meal the two heavy heifers were swollen and bloated. Cass had left early since she had stopped eating many plates ago. Marni\u2019s talking pace had slowed a bit but was still going strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I actually think I met a Gordge employee at Fit life, in the premium member facilities\u2026 ke-kelly?\u201d Marni struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Christina! Yeah she told me she met you. I\u2019m actually a premium member there now! I go there all the time!\u201d Alice huffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah no way. Well maybe I\u2019ll see you in the sauna or something. But I think it\u2019s time I get going. It\u2019s been a pleasure Alice.\u201d Marni said struggling to get on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so cool to talk to you, Marni. Hopefully I\u2019ll run into you again.\u201d Alice said with a giant smile. Alice remained seated. She whipped out he phone to text Melissa. Her obese body was jammed into the booth. Her belly was uncomfortably digging into the edge of the table but Alice was way to giddy to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow I am shooo jealoush!\u201d Courtney said through a mouthful of doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I hope I run into again.\u201d Alice said. Alice\u2019s run in with Marni had been all the rage at the breakroom table the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAnd shoutout to my girl Alice at gordge for giving us TWO gift baskets this week!...\u201d</i> They all giggled with excitement. <i>\u201cYes Marni we here love the fine people and the great services offered at Gordge. You can Call them at 1-800-GORDGE1\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that was a good idea Al?\u201d Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she asked so nicely I couldn\u2019t say no.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She guzzled, she did not sip. Her thirst for thick, creamy products was relentless and it seemed that only choking down as many milkshakes as possible was going to do the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 so good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was thick with exertion as her stamina dwindled. As if speaking was too much trouble for the overfed and underexercised secretary. She let out a husky \u2018mmm\u2019 as the sweet pink mixture sank down her throat and into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the cup down, her breathing labored from the simple act of slurping. A light cloud of perspiration coated her entire body, her mouth agape as hot air escaped her. Using her flabby, bulbous arms Vicky reached for another. She took it to her chest as she drank the sweet sugary mixture like a fish would water. Another guttural groan as she savored the sweet taste of her latest shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Michelle gimme\u2026 gimme another\u2026\u201d she purred huskily to the short woman who worked the Smoothie Shack, \u201cAlice you\u2026 urp\u2026 you want a Bulk-Up shake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked her co-worker and friend up and down noticeably before giving her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thank you.\u201d She said with a smile, \u201cUh, Vicky, what\u2019s in those things anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, just\u2026 fruit and stuff\u201d The secretary panted before being handed a freshly-blended Blueberry-Banana-Blast, \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 mmm\u2026 they\u2019re so good. You sure you don\u2019t want one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past year or so, Vicky had been expanding at an alarming rate. Nobody seemed to notice too much except for Melissa, who took stock only in the fact that someone other than herself was growing alarmingly expansive. And Alice had <i>known</i> Vicky was growing and gaining faster than anyone she\u2019d ever seen before but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as the barstools groaned beneath her gigantic ass, Vicky\u2019s weight was beginning to become downright destructive. In the past few months she\u2019d broken several of her office chairs and tipped a break-room table. She\u2019d heard some talk about her getting a new car, but lately there was something floating around about her carpooling with Jenna. She didn\u2019t make coffee runs anymore and, honestly, Alice was more than a little worried about her friend\u2019s loose grasp on reality. Vicky\u2019s insistence that she hadn\u2019t gained a pound since high school were a little alarming now that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUURP\u2026\u2019ma go to the bathroom\u2026\u201d the immense Italian said thickly as she slid off of her seats and tottered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice watched Vicky\u2019s vast volume wobble and shake uncontrollably with every awkward step. Her large, formless ass cheeks fought for space in Vicky\u2019s yoga pants, painted grey by tight fabric. It was as thick and stable as a table, Alice was sure she could sit her smoothie on the back of her friend\u2019s enormous rump and it would come back to her intact. Vicky\u2019s great gut hung heavily in front of her, down to her mid-thigh by now, and wobbled with as much ferocity as the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer olive immensity was not simply constrained to her enormous ass and behemoth belly\u2014her arms were uselessly doughy and untoned with several inches of fat caking the outer layers. She could no longer rest her arms at her side due to her thick bingo wings, and her breasts were becoming back-breakingly large. Even her face, once more or less defined due to her pear shape, had grown round and soft. She looked like a completely different person\u2014the only semblance of the real Vicky beneath all that blubber was the worn Yankees cap she worked out in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice raised her eyebrows and took a sip of her smoothie. <i>God she's gotten huge. She's become bigger than me!</i> Alice thought. Victoria certainly had surpassed Alice's previous weight but they were actually currently at the around the same weight. Alice herself had rounded out quite a bit in her pursuit of a premium membership, more than Alice was even aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you can, um\u2026 just sit that over there.\u201d She said to Michelle, the girl behind the counter who returned with Vicky\u2019s milkshake, \u201cShe really needs the exercise\u2026\u201d </span></div></div>",

As she opened the fridge door to get her much deserved meal, Alice was shocked by what she had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shakes! So many shakes!\" shouted Alice. To her surprise the fridge was stocked with shakes. They took up much of the fridge space, so much so that Alice had to dig around just to find her meal. Where did all of these drinks come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alice! Got a case of the Mondays?\" said a cheery Vicky. \"Oh I see that you're checking out my bulk up shakes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice turned around to see Vicky with an empty shake in hand. She looked even bigger since the last time she saw her at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these all yours?\" asked Alice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! My premium membership allowed me some one-on-one time with a trainer. He said a healthy diet is the key to keeping in shape. So I took his advice and I bought a whole bunch of shakes to have with me at work and at home. Now that I am drinking these all day, I'm eating healthy and that allows me to cheat a little bit more than I used to. Anyways can you hand me that banana berry blast bulkup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you're taking this a bit far? I don't think this is what your trainer meant by a well balanced diet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! I don't want to end up like all these fat girls here in the office. A girl has to watch her figure. Actually can you hand me another? I'm going to take one back to my desk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice handed another drink to Vicky and watched as her ass brushed the sides of the door frame. Alice was truly concerned by what she had just witnessed, but was paralyzed by Vicky's actions. She watched as the workweek went on and Vicky continually slamming shakes at work and at the gym. By week's end she was already outgrowing her current wardrobe. At this rate, Vicky was going to get massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While the massages and saunas were great and all for Alice, Vicky really saw the benefit of her personal trainer. After all who better to keep her in shape then someone who does it for a living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainers first piece of advice was already having its impact. Vicky had to get a new chair since her ass had grown too wide to sit on it. She was more off than on the chair. Her company ordered the widest chair that was available, but even that chair was a bit of a struggle for the office fatty. Not fazed by her chair predicaments, Vicky sought more advice from her trainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few days after meeting with her trainer that Alice and other coworkers started to notice a change in Vicky. Her clothes were tight already, but now she was starting to overflow them. Her titanic ass, was becoming uncontainable. Her ass would cause even the strongest of stretch pants to slide down revealing her panties. Her stomach, while no match for her ass, stretched over the waistband and spilled out across her vast thighs when she sat down. Fat rolls revealing themselves around every bend. Something was up and Alice had to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice approached Vicky at her desk. She was already putting away another shake as her stomach extended to contain yet another calorie laden bomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it seems like you're enjoying your new diet.\" said Alice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky huffed, out of breath from chugging another shake. \"Oh yeah Alice, you should try it. My trainer really has me working hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I saw him earlier this week and he gave me some more dieting advice. He said having a healthy diet is not the only key to staying in shape. Having an active metabolism is also important. Considering that I'm pretty young, he was encouraged that I could really turn up my metabolism if I ate more frequently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat more frequently? That doesn't sound right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he said it's important to break my day up to more meals. So I've been taking his advice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Vicky I think he means to break up breakfast, lunch, and dinner into more meals\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. I don't think you know how this works. But let me explain. How often are we awake in the day? 16 hours? That's like...not the entire day or something. The rest of the time you're sleeping. That's giving your metabolism time to slow down because it's not digesting a meal. So on top of adding an extra meal or two to my day, I make sure to fill up before I go to bed. That's the secret Alice. Eating before you sleep keeps your metabolism active even as you rest. Every night I drink a few shakes and maybe spoil myself with a carton of ice cream or a cake or something. It's been very effective. I wake up hungry and that's a good sign. That means your metabolism is working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..uhh..yeah that sounds like a great diet plan. I'll have to check it out sometime.\" Alice knew that this was wrong, but there seemed little she could do to convince Vicky otherwise. But she had to walk away from the situation before she got too wrapped up into it. She left Vicky to her shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething didn't seem right though. How could Vicky be misinterpreting so much information? She wasn't the brightest girl in the word, but she had to see that this advice was bad...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While he enjoyed staying fit and training others, it was his true delight to see all the curvy and fat women that would come through those double doors. Chase was attracted to larger women, which was not considered normal for someone in his profession. In fact, it was much worse than that. Chase was a feeder. It was very difficult for Chase to balance his work life with his dating life. He mostly kept his feeding relationships under wraps. He also tried to contain himself at work even when he was asked to train the overweight women at the gym. This all changed, however, after Chase met Vicky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase had never seen such a pear-shaped body like Vicky had. Her gelatinous ass was something unreal. Her hips and thighs were so thick, you'd hunt forever to find and definition. And what's worse, she was actively gaining weight. Chase saw Vicky expand over the course of months at the gym. He'd constantly find her throwing back smoothies and shakes at the gym bar. When Vicky sought after a trainer, Chase couldn't resist taking her under his wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough their first few sessions, Chase realized Vicky is not the sharpest tool in the shed. Her tactics for keeping weight off was actually having the opposite effect. He battled with his morals to trick Vicky into gaining more weight. Ultimately his desire to see her expand outweighed his morals and he began to feed Vicky very explicit instructions. Eat and drink more healthy foods (especially bulk up shakes). Eat more meals across the day to keep up the metabolism (and especially at night). Chase saw the results of his actions. The more Vicky grew, the more he knew that he wouldn't be able to resist dating her. While Chase had dated feedees, they were willing participants in the act. Chase was diving head first into unknown territory. How big could Vicky get? He was hoping this was just the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Chase has his charms. He was able to get Vicky on a few dates and now they were a couple. This definitely drew the attention of some of Vicky's coworkers. However, it would soon fall on deaf ears as Vicky fell deeper into Chase's plans. </span></div></div>",

She brought another spoonful of ice cream pass her lips. She was eating it straight out of the carton. Christina was in a rut. She was definitely going to regret how the night went. And to think it started out so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the evening Christina decided she was going to finally go back to the gym. Not just that she was going to sweat, and get a real workout in. She even changed into her (ill fitting) workout clothes. She was on her way out the door when she looked over to the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A Seinfeld marathon? Oh no way, this is my favorite episode! And it just started.</i> Christina unconsciously walked over to the sofa and sat in front of the TV. <i>I\u2026 I can probably\u2026 I\u2019ll just watch one episode.</i> Christina thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne pizza delivery and a couple trips to the kitchen later and here she was. Still sitting on the couch, still wearing her gym clothes, eating ice cream out of the carton. As delicious as the ice cream and pizza was it wasn\u2019t going to stop the wave of shame and regret that was about to hit Christina in 3\u2026 2\u2026 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Sigh* I can\u2019t believe I did it again. I even got my clothes on and everything! This is all your fault.\u201d Christina grabbed a handful of her bulging spare tire, making it jiggle slightly. \u201cYou just have to get in the way of things. You hear that belly? Why do you always have to ruin my plans\u2026 it\u2019s bad enough you ruin my shirts.\u201d Christina actually giggled a bit, but it didn\u2019t make her feel any better. There was still a pang of grief coming from inside her (not to be confused with the pang she felt from the meatlover\u2019s pizza she had eaten earlier). She sighed deeply. She just felt so pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHaving trouble getting to the gym? Want to shed some pounds but can\u2019t afford the pricey memberships or the expensive equipment?\u201d</i> Christina looked up and nodded. <i>\u201cWell here\u2019s the answer looking for! Introducing my brand new home workout video: The 5 Minute Upper Body.\u201d</i> Christina stared at the montage of slim and toned hardbody\u2019s doing crunches and pushups on their living room floors. <i>\u201cJust 5 minutes a day and you could end up with abs like this!\u201d </i>Christina took the last bite of ice cream as she stared blankly at the numerous before and after pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could do that.\u201d Christina said. \u201cI don\u2019t even need to buy the video. Just 5 minutes, that\u2019s all. Just some sit ups, right? Might as well if I\u2019m going to wear these clothes.\u201d Christina heaved herself off the sofa with a grunt. \u201cHrrn!... You\u2019re totally redeeming yourself, Christina.\u201d She said, as she gave her bouncing belly a slap. \u201cYou hear that, tummy? Your days are numbered.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina awkwardly got down onto her back in the middle of her apartment. Her giant butt spread out on the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright 5 minutes. Let\u2019s just do some sit ups. I can do\u2026 <i>a</i> sit up, right?\u201d Christina said. She positioned herself properly. She rubbed her hands together in preparation. She took several deep breaths. She needlessly readjusted her position one more time. \u201cAlright, deep breaths\u2026 appropriate clothing\u2026 feet together, as they should be\u2026 what\u2019s that noise? Is someone at the door?... Nope, that was nothing\u2026\u201d Christina laid nervously on the floor. She looked down at her doughy belly sticking up in the air.  \u201cAlright\u2026 all ready\u2026 just one situp\u2026 starting now\u2026 and here\u2026 I\u2026 go.\u201d Finally Christina attempted her first sit up. She grunted heavily and tried as hard as she could to reach her knees. The top of her soft back lifted an inch or so off the ground. Her torso bent only slightly. Her chin dup into her pillowy soft cleavage as she struggled to accomplish even a fourth of a full sit up. Her giant flabby belly started to jiggle as her poor underused abdominal muscles struggled to flex under the immense weight of Christina\u2019s obese pampered body. After just a few seconds her heavy upper body collapsed back onto the floor. Her flabby arms flopped onto the ground. Her chubby round face was as red as an apple and sucking for air. Her exposed jiggling belly rose and fell with each huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf only *pant* they\u2026 had *wheeze*\u2026 a 5 second *huff* workout.\u201d Christina lay uselessly on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she caught her breath Christina said to herself\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The exertion of attempted exercise had robbed her of the fortitude to announce it angrily, and her lack of breath had kept her wheezing until well after her declaration had been completed. She simply lay there, flat on her back, huffing and puffing like an old smoke stack. Her great distended gut and swollen sweater puppies rose and fell erratically at her frenzied breaths, little dots of tears to come in the corners of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as she lay there longer, TV blaring and surrounded by the evidence of her indulgence, the words still lingered on her lips. Like peppermint chapstick, they tingled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too fat to even exercise. And she\u2019d <i>never</i> lose this weight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more moments passed before Christina attempted to roll herself into a sitting position. It was quite a challenge to overcome her girth, the bigness of her belly and weakness of her muscles proving to be a very unfortunate combination. Pathetic grunts and wheezes rolled under the blare of Seinfeld as she rocked. Eventually she gained enough momentum to gain footing on the coffee table and couch. Her arms shaking slightly from the strain of her weight, Christina managed to pull herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained there, now sitting, desperately trying to catch her breath. The whole act had left her completely winded. Less than two years ago, this would have been literally no issue for her. But now, in her current state\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way she was <i>ever</i> going to lose this weight. She was too fat to exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words washed over her. It wasn\u2019t as painful a realization as one would have thought. It should have been. In every other world, Christina would have roared and rose to the challenge, or sunk even further, or something. But instead she just sat there contemplating what it meant. What it meant to be \u201ctoo fat to exercise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she stood, if only to collapse back on the couch again. Wordlessly she grabbed the remains of her binge and continued. Her eyes stared glassily at the television, though she wasn\u2019t really watching. Her stomach gurgled expectantly at a commercial for pizza, and the temptation was surely there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d she said to herself in an almost relieved tone of voice, phone already in hand, \u201cI\u2019m a total fatass anyway. What\u2019s another pizza gonna do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour. Four more pizzas. Stuffed crust with an order of breadsticks and dipping sauce. She locked her phone and went back to the television, leaning onto the agonized arm of the sofa. With one hand she propped her head up, doughy arms spreading over the rest like pancake batter, while the rest of her just lay there lavishly. Her other hand rested on her great pale paunch, which swelled over the lip of the sofa cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy even bother dieting?\u201d Christina asked herself again a few moments later after she recognized a home-delivery Chinese restaurant that Marni had recommended, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can exercise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint, if somewhat crazed smile dimpled her chubby cheeks as she resumed her seat. Her stomach groaned, and her hand went to soothe it. She began to rub it now, gently pressing down on her big belly with one outstretched palm. There was an unexpected excitement tucked away in her breast, one that fluttered at the idea of her incoming intake. About getting to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 It\u2019s not like I can\u2026 do anything about it!\u201d Christy giggled naughtily as she hung up the phone, sub-shop delivery guy in tow while she knead her gut vigorously, \u201cI\u2019m just too fat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes clenched slightly at one of her own particularly pressing squeezes. Her fat ass cheeks clenched, making her rise a good two inches off the couch. Her breath was hot and frequent, panting not out of exertion but out of excitement, and the blood beneath her skin made her red with anticipation rather than exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled slightly as she continued to poke and prod her body, delving further and further into her defeatist mindset. What was the point of working out? She was too fat to do it properly, and if she couldn\u2019t exercise then there was no way she was going to lose weight! So why bother freaking out if there was nothing to do but\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DING-DONG</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<i>eat.</i></span></div></div>",

She put her hands on her big hungry belly and rubbed. Courtney (who shared a cubicle with her) looked up at Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell someone\u2019s in a god mood.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm, I just got a coupon for Roman\u2019s pizza and the Ten Dragons Chinese food place.\u201d Christina\u2019s gut rumbled and her mouth watered. \u201cThink I\u2019ll use them both after work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a good night.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I think I\u2019m gonna stop at Mcdonald\u2019s after work too\u2026 and maybe I\u2019ll get a cake from that bakery on 5th.\u201d Christina was now squishing her hands deep into her flabby rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney wasn\u2019t even phased by Christy\u2019s proposed evening of gluttony. \u201cHaha, Nothing better than taking a tour of the towns restaurants. I call that \u2018kitchen hopping\u2019. In college everybody would go bar hopping, but my sorority gals and I would go kitchen hopping, hehe.\u201d Courtney heaving breasts jiggled as she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha I\u2019m gonna start calling it that.\u201d Christina chuckled. \u201cYou know I haven\u2019t really told anyone, but last week I finally gave up on losing weight.\u201d She said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Courtney said. She thought Christy had given up losing weight a year ago\u2026 or at least it appeared that way. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I finally realized that this is the body I\u2019m stuck with. No point in trying to change it.\u201d Christina said. \u201cDo you know what I mean?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney honestly didn\u2019t quite know what she meant. In Courtney\u2019s 15 or so years of fatness and near constant weight gain, she had made literally no attempt to ever lose weight. She had never gone through a drastic weight gain that made her freak out over the changes to her body. No, Courtney had slowly packed on the pounds throughout her adulthood, never causing her to have that \u201cOh my god I\u2019m fat!\u201d wake up call/crisis that so many fat girls have. She had really never had any care or insecurities about her weight and she never really understood all the whining and worrying that came from her fat friends. Still though she had seen Christina go through a range of emotions since she started working at Gordge. She was glad to finally see Christina at some sort of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 Yeah I guess. Losing weight always seemed like self-torture. Glad to hear you\u2019ve finally become a member of the unapologetic fat girls club. You will receive your card in the mail.\u201d Courtney joked. Christina laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there any benefits to joining the club?\u201d Christina riffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chmmm Not really other than guilt-free eating, never having to worry about anorexia, and possibly buying an extra ticket on planes\u2026 Oh but you do get to hang out with me, Melissa, and Alice.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t pass an opportunity like that up.\u201d Christina giggled. \u201cBut when is my initiation party?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 how about tomorrow at lunch.\u201d Courtney laughed. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to pay for it.\u201d They both chuckled and Christina continued to smile throughout the work day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had really found comfort in her conversation with Courtney. Now that she was finally feeling okay with her weight, it was good to know her friends were okay with it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was sitting in traffic on her way home from work. She could smell the burger king drive-thru sitting in the passenger seat next to her. She had gotten it for when she got home. Christy figured it would hold off her appetite until dinner where she would really treat herself with those coupons she found\u2026 But boy those fries smelled good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina rubbed her flabby middle and let out a sigh. Her belly was beckoning to be filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm Just wait until you\u2019re home, Christie\u2026 but oh god this traffic is slow. If I eat now I\u2019ll be hungry again before dinner though. Wait what am I saying? I\u2019m not going to lose any weight regardless. I\u2019m a fat girl now, I am supposed to be eating whenever I want. I\u2019m too fat to be holding back this poor empty tummy.\u201d Christina said with a naughty grin. She dug her hand into the large fast food bag and began feeding herself fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few traffic lights later and the bag was empty. Christina laughed with a look of shock and embarrassment. \u201cThat didn\u2019t last as long as I\u2019d hoped.\u201d Christina moved on of her hands to her slightly bloated gut. It wasn\u2019t filled yet. Her mouth was still watering thinking about what she could eat next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know I could really go for some of that Chinese food and pizza I was planning for dinner.\u201d She was thinking about how she could get them both delivered. \u201cIf I ordered it now I bet it would be at the apartment by the time I got home.\u201d She was pretty sure the menus for the places were in the glove compartment. Christina giggled naughtily and picked up her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she placed the orders she patted her belly and let out a sigh. \u201cOh, the things you make me do.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina almost literally kicked the door down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one flabby foot, she pushed the door open after fumbling with the tumbler and her key. Normally she\u2019d use her hands, but they were a bit preoccupied at the moment. She\u2019d just caught both delivery boys as they\u2019d arrived, which was very convenient for her but more than a little confusing for the barely pubescent boys who had to wait on her for a full five minutes, and had all but ripped their parcels from their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, Christina\u2019s gut was the first thing in the room after her foot. Due to her positioning, it brushed uncomfortably against the side of the door in her sideways motioning. Another belabored half-step inside, and everything save for the last few inches of her bodacious bottom was fully inside her apartment. A few more steps forward, and Christy laid her spread from the delivery, plus a few other items she\u2019d picked up along the way out on the coffee table. The feast stared back at her from down below on the table, and Christina did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d she moaned thickly, her stomach churning with an insatiable greed as one chubby hand slunk over to soothe it, \u201cMmm\u2026 oh mmm\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to\u2026 to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy\u2019s face grew flush again, her chubby cheeks reddening with a wicked delight. Her forehead began to perspire lightly, and an inexplicable warmth spread throughout her entire body. Her warm pink tongue ran over her full lips as her heaving hot breath filled the room. The hand placed on her abdomen began to knead her dough, gripping tightly onto the pliable pudge that suffocated Christina\u2019s once slender form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling the fingers on her free hand dramatically, Christina reached for one of the boxes of pizza first. She flipped the lid and pulled out two thick greasy slices of sausage pizza. She took a deep instinctive inhale as she drew them closer, her mighty breasts becoming mountainous for a moment before she let it out. The warmth grew as she brought it closer to her maw, salivating near uncontrollably at the sight of her sweet mistress Roman\u2019s Pizza\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026 oh no\u2026\u201d Christy looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge grease stain on her dress. Her <i>new</i> dress. The one she bought specifically because all the other ones wouldn\u2019t fit her anymore\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRmmm\u2026 no problem, I guess\u2026\u201d she huffed after a few damaging dabs at the spot with greasy fingers, \u201cI\u2019ll just change\u2026 probably shoulda done it anyway\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipped from her carnal desire, Christy waddled into her bedroom, two slices in tow to snack on, and proceeded to undress. With one hand (the other was a little preoccupied with keeping her tummy full) Christy undid the straps and acquired some nighties for herself. A pair of yoga pants (Vicky\u2019s? They looked like Vicky\u2019s\u2026) and an old shirt from Fit Life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wriggled the gray sweats up her tree-trunks with little difficulty, Vicky was even then quite more bootylicious than Christina. She tucked the lowermost of her triply-tiered stomach into the crotch of the pants and proceeded to wriggle her way into the shirt (which was hardly as comfy as Vicky\u2019s old pants!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a devious thought overcame Christina, as she stood there with her hands wedged between her waistband and belly fat. Looking around, as if anyone were home, Christy unrolled the pants from over her stomach and proceeded to tuck it under, allowing her big belly to hang free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was\u2026 relaxing, oddly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Christy moaned throatily again, rubbing the now free segment of her stomach, \u201cCan\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t been doing this since, like, forever ago\u2026 My tummy feels <i>so</i> much better\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the pizza crust from the chester drawers and promptly sticking one end in her mouth, Christy waddled back into the living room where she immediately thrust herself down onto the couch. Attempting to lean past the great obstructions that were her balloonish breasts and giant gut, Christy managed to work her large doughy arms over to the coffee table, where she grabbed as much of her feast as she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God\u2026 this is\u2026 mm\u2026\u201d she began to sweat again after the first few pieces of pizza, her excitement at indulgence overwhelming her, eventually her external monologing becoming little more than \u201cmm\u2019s\u201d and \u201cah\u2019s\u201d as she gleefully stuffed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Christina\u2019s eyes glazed behind her glasses as she lost herself in the great feast she\u2019d procured for herself. Pizza boxes disappeared, and the Chinese takeout barely stood a chance. The dollar-menu burgers were wiped out in moments at a time, all devoured by the great greedy glutton in the making. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath was shallow while she ate, whimpering and whining as the corners of her lips tugged into a piggish smile. She was unstoppable, eating anything and everything edible in sight until she was sated. And when the needs of her stomach were filled internally, Christina would take to fulfilling its external needs\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 mmm\u2026\u201d she cooed as she played with her pudge, squeezing her delightfully fat belly as she digested. She closed her eyes during the action, that greedy grin replaced with one of absolute privilege. She kicked slightly sometimes, like she was on a bicycle, as she knead. But even still, her breath was loud and distinctly pleasurable.

Another side effect though was that she was fatter than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was touching up her eye make-up in the bathroom mirror. Her bottom belly roll rested in the sink as she leaned closer to her reflection. Christina may have given up on attaining a perfect body but she hadn\u2019t given up on looking pretty. She smacked her plump red lips and adjusted her stylish thick framed glasses. Standing back a bit she looked over her appearance. Her chubby round face looked pretty cute when framed within her long blonde hair which was artfully tied up in a tactically messy bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the neck down though, Christina was sort of a mess. Her shirt clung tightly around her every pudgy curve. You could see the outline of her overfilled bra as it pressed against her shirt. Their slivers of white flesh in the visible gaps between each button. The fabric creased uncomfortably around every doughy roll and fold. Christy\u2019s poor pants were under similar duress. She had lost the button that morning (almost giving Courtney a black eye) and the zipper was pulled all the way down (her belly wouldn\u2019t let her zip it up). Luckily she had managed to fit a belt around her expanding waist that could hold her pants up. Still though the pants were giving her a bit of a wedgie and felt like every step she took was going to tear them to shreds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina thought about how poorly clothed she was. \u201cWell what am I supposed to do with a big fat belly like this?\u201d Christina gripped her belly and arched her back like a pregnant woman would. She felt a bit of rush from feeling so naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned away and walked out into the breakroom. She waddled over to vending machine. She was caught off guard as her belly bumped against the glass window, causing her to stumble a bit. She couldn\u2019t even see most of the snacks since they were blocked by her blossoming breasts, but Christina had memorized her usual order from the vending machine. Her glazed over eyes stared at the falling candies and treats as her right hand fed coins into the slot and robotically punched in several codes. Christina felt her pants unravel just a bit as she bent her enormous bottom over to receive her snacks. She then waddled over to the fridge to collect more fuel for her aching tummy, which she placed on top of the pile of food she was creating in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer obese body dropped onto the seat with a thud, and her collection of unhealthy junk spread onto the table. Melissa and Alice might have noticed Christina\u2019s preposterously large meal if they weren\u2019t focused on their own stacks of sugary, greasy food. As she sat down, Christina felt her belt pinch tightly into her gut. Her belly rolls folded over and made the belt disappear in her stacks of flab. Christy face grew red as she desperately tried to relieve the enormous pressure around her enormous belly. Finally after a few seconds of torture and anguish, she released her gut from the terrible pinch. She let out a sigh as her flabby rolls burst free and surged further onto her lap. Her pale fleshed pushed out over her pants, letting her bottom belly roll sit naked under the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Christina was just thinking about how good the doughnuts tasted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A greedy growl emanated from deep within her fleshy folds, even as she strained her neck to keep both signs in view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying, I never thought <i>I\u2019d</i> be the one driving <i>you</i> around.\u201d Melissa chuckled amusedly from her seat behind the wheel, \u201cI always figured that it\u2019d be the other way around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa lifted one thick arm to nudge Alice\u2019s ample belly, her hand sinking deep into her friend\u2019s soft flesh before Alice swat it away with an arm far fatter and squishier than Melissa\u2019s. A disgruntled burble escaped the super-sized secretary as she fended off her friend\u2019s tauntings, her full lower lip creasing into a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it, Melissa.\u201d Alice grumbled huskily, her voice thick and heavy, \u201cYou\u2019re being mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying with all the time you spend at the <i>gym</i>\u2026\u201d Melissa rebutted playfully, \u201cI told you those places were evil. S\u2019why I never bother with one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa snorted with laughter while a good-natured chortle escaped elephantine Alice. Her time as a premium member of Fit Life had done little to stunt her weight gain. In fact, it went from a steady crawl (if not a right plateau) right back to ambitious and quickly climbing. She\u2019d quickly overcome Melissa\u2019s own girth, upsetting the precarious balance the two co-dependent enablers had forged over years of Melissa being heavier, and then some. While by no means the largest woman at Gordge, or even the largest woman in their branch, Alice was certainly a heavyweight these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Melissa was driving was due to Alice\u2019s weight, in fact. Two-fold if one wished to be specific. Alice\u2019s mass had grown far too large for her current vehicle, her breasts and great gut wedging the wheel to a complete halt. Melissa\u2019s own enormity, while no means healthy, was <i>just</i> so much svelter than Alice\u2019s so that it allowed for the basic movement of the steering mechanism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, for how long she would remain thus so much lighter than Alice was subject to change. She and her friend frequented many of the same restaurants and often indulged Alice\u2019s Premium Membership benefits\u2014the empty donut boxes strewn about the vehicle a testament to the sheer impossibility of going even a moment without something to snack on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you getting enough air back there?\u201d Melissa looked into the rearview mirror at Christina, \u201cAlice\u2019s AC\u2019s kinda screwy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Christy snapped back from the window, \u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gurgle. Christy was <i>not</i> fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in her biggest dress. A nylon number that clung to her way too tightly. Everything was outlined to the smallest severity. Her breasts spilling out from her bra, every dimple and spare roll her stomach had to offer, even the outline of her belly button and the crack of her fat ass was on complete display and painted the softest shade of Porky Pig pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHrrmm\u2026\u201d Christy fondled her pink pudge with one chubby hand, \u201cYou\u2019re sure this George guy knows what he\u2019s doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh he\u2019s the best.\u201d Alice answered energetically from the front seat, \u201cEveryone in the office goes to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother \u201chrrm\u201d from Christy, this time of doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarni goes to see him too.\u201d Alice said with a bigger smile, knowing that it would grab Christina\u2019s attention, \u201cYou know she\u2019s always got the cutest outfits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina didn\u2019t. She\u2019d only ever seen Marni half-naked or in workout clothes, and that was some months ago when she still had her membership. But from what she <i>knew</i> about Marni, Christy was sure that her judgement could be trusted. Besides, now that her money wasn\u2019t going to Fit Life, she could afford a little\u2026 adjustments\u2026 in her clothing now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, don\u2019t worry about the price tag.\u201d Alice reassured her friend, \u201cEverything\u2019s on sale, and so are a <i>lot</i> of the adjustments. You\u2019ll be fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy looked up abashedly and smiled towards her friend, who smiled into the vanity mirror. It was a pretty sweet thing of Alice to offer to take Christy with her. They\u2019d both bonded lately over how difficult it seemed to stay clothed. Though with Alice it was a bit more\u2026 understandable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow bad could it be?</span></div></div>",

She through her wrapper in the trash and they waddled into the store. The obese trio waddled past the store front of clothes and into a backroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeorge!\u201d Alice said as she suffocated the grey-haired man with her enormous blubber. Melissa also gave him hug. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing along our friend Christina, who I think finally requires your services.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was a short slender man. Probably in his late 50\u2019s with thick framed glasses and grey and white streaks in his hair. He came off very Martin Scorsese-ish. They chatted for a bit. Melissa and Alice had been seeing George for a few years apparently. Christina found it odd how much Alice and Melissa seemed to\u2026 swoon(?) over George. <i>I mean he\u2019s charming but\u2026 really? Alice really is gushing about him. This is kind of uncomfortable.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice, you\u2019re daddy issues are showing.\u201d Melissa whispered. Alice blushed and immediately shut up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat well which one you would like to go first? How about you, Christina? Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t bite. Although I can\u2019t speak for my assistant.\u201d George said. Alice burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, sure I guess.\u201d Christina replied. George lead her into the middle of the room while Alice and Melissa took a seat off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just undress and I\u2019ll get the measuring tape.\u201d George said. Christina began to undress. Her tight dress chaffed against her soft belly as it slipped off of the doughy obese body it had struggled to contain. Christina let out a sigh of relief as she unclasped her bra and her heavy, flabby tits hung free. George came back and looked at the naked Christina from a few feet away. He tilted his head, crouched down, stood up, walked around, looked up close, stepped further back. Christina wasn\u2019t sure what to do. George continued to mumble and talk to himself. Finally he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Christina, I can see it now.\u201d He held his hands together like he were imagining Christina in a picture frame. \u201cYes don\u2019t worry, I am going to make you so beautiful. Not to say you aren\u2019t already beautiful, no of course not, you\u2019re gorgeous, a blonde heartbreaker like you\u2026 Mhmm, yes\u2026 but you\u2019re going to make everyone jealous when we get you in a proper dress or blouse.\u201d Christina didn\u2019t know what to say, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself from blushing. She had certainly not expected to be flattered here. \u201cAlright I\u2019m just going to measure you and then I\u2019ll sew you a blouse that\u2019s to die for.\u201d George started to measure all over Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to make me completely new clothes?\u201d Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, first time customers always get a heavily discounted set of dresses, blouses, skirts, and what not. And before you say anything else I\u2019ll just tell you that you\u2019re not going to say no to the prices we offer.\u201d George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Like a whole new wardrobe?\u201d Christina said with a bit of girlish excitement. George could afford to give first time customers like Christina a practically free new wardrobe since they always end up paying it back with frequent adjustments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was showered with compliments until George stopped moving his measuring tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m done?\u201d Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, just go back and sit down and Cheryl will help you with everything else.\u201d George said. Christina dressed back up and waddled over to Alice and Melissa. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d Alice\u2019s hand shot up and she struggled to get off of her butt and waddle over to George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice undressed in the middle of the room. Christina was a bit taken aback by Alice\u2019s naked enormity. George was too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Alice how\u2019s life treating you?\u201d George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know, there\u2019s been ups and downs.\u201d Alice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAin\u2019t that the\u2026 er, truth.\u201d George said as he struggled to get the tape measure around Alice\u2019s massive double belly. George was having a bit of trouble measuring Alice incredibly obese body. Eventually asking for help from his assistant. \u201cWell you\u2019ve definitely gotten a bit bigger.\u201d George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so you\u2019re gonna have to let everything out more?\u201d Alice asked. That was usually what happened anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 actually no. I\u2019ll probably have to make new clothes for you.\u201d George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?.. What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re change in size is a bit more\u2026 dramatic than usual. I don\u2019t think I could adjust your current wardrobe anymore to fit you. You can only alter clothes so much.\u201d George said. Alice looked down with a look of disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coh\u2026\u201d was all she squeaked out. She wasn\u2019t going to cry but Alice definitely felt a little deflated from the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey on the bright side, you\u2019re going to get a brand new wardrobe.\u201d George said trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I guess that\u2026 could be fun.\u201d Alice said solemnly. She dressed herself and waddled heavily over to her two friends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her skin and swollen pugs of pudge were sensitive though, and it felt good for them to be handled. The massage table, tailor-made for women of larger sizes, creaked and groaned as she lay belly up on the flat surface\u2014her great gut rising and falling with every belabored breath that the beached blonde could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe svelte masseuse, not her usual girl but another tiny thing that was as short as she was talented with her hands, took to Alice\u2019s bulk well. Her hands slid across her vastness from her shoulders down to the great dome of her belly, pressing inwards from both ends and causing light swelling in her uppermost section. She loomed over Alice\u2019s head, taut midriff a mere half inch from Alice\u2019s nose, as she fluffed her. Alice took great enjoyment in the sensation of soft tender hands taking such care of her delicate and pampered stomach, though she would never openly admit it. It caused her breath to shallow and her cheeks to redden, the pleasure immense in that her hands lay limp but her belly go rubbed without spending any extra energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost enough for her to forget what had happened earlier. With George. And the tailoring. In front of everybody\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recollection made her mouth uncomfortably dry, feeling cavernous and hungry. Her pavlovian response to comfort eating was strong, and even now she wished that she\u2019d been allowed to take food into the massage parlor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masseuse moved from the top of her stomach to the middle, the sides of Alice\u2019s fat gut until they were shiny with lotion. Her stomach wobbled obnoxiously at the action, swaying from side to side for a time longer after her massuese\u2019s hands left her flesh. However, her girl was professional. She swathed her customer\u2019s giant rising gut like she was basting a doughy white turkey. She pressed up here too, on her sides, causing a greater swell that rose lower than the one before it. It caused a sharp inhale from Alice, an oddly sexual (though shallow) sound that made Alice bite her lower lip in embarrassment. She made the strangest sounds sometimes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, the clothing store. That\u2019s right. It had happened in front of everybody\u2014Alice had been so embarrassed that she actually insisted that Melissa drive her home, whereupon she and Christy went out to eat not two minutes after Alice was in the elevator up to her apartment. She\u2019d taken a taxi to the gym, and it had taken her five minutes just to get to a sitting position\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hum escaped Alice as the masseuse took a crack at finding Alice\u2019s hip bones. She toyed with her thick thigh fat, pressing sternly on Alice\u2019s outer legs and the sides of her mountainous ass. It was nice to be massaged, given that she was rapidly approaching a state when she was unable to do it herself. She clenched her titanic cheeks in excitement and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Alice cried out as the support beneath her suddenly gave way after a lurching groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table collapsed beneath her immensity, leaving her laying flat on her back amongst the broken metal and malformed table. The masseuse quickly jumped to attention and grabbed Alice by the flabby forearm with both her tiny hands, but proved to be illequipped in dealing with a tragedy of such epic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hold on, I think I might need some help\u2026\u201d the woman wheezed, taking a half-step forward in search of someone, \u201cRachel\u2026 Hey, Rachel, could you come help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women were required to lift Alice and all her immensity, and that was with back-breaking exertion on her part as well. By the time she was standing, Alice was a wreck. Naked, enormous, and wheezing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll have to break out the heavy duty table\u2026\u201d she heard the one named Rachel mumble behind her, \u201cThe one we use for that radio star\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welled up in the corners of Alice\u2019s eyes.

The two extremely obese women barely fit their bulging bellies behind the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each ordered beer and buffalo wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the reason why you called all of a sudden?\u201d Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 It started when I couldn\u2019t fit in my car anymore, then I had to get all new clothes from George, then I broke the massage table at the gym\u2026 an-and *sniff* I-I\u2026\u201d Alice was struggling to hold back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww that\u2026 that sucks\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Courtney said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve let myself go so much. I just got that premium gym membership and still I just get fatter!\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Alice.\u201d Courtney put her hand on Alice\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBeing fat isn\u2019t the end of the world. Hell, I\u2019m fatter than you are. You don\u2019t see me getting down on myself, do you?\u201d Courtney said. Alice sat back, gaining her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah\u2026but\u2026 I guess\u2026 I guess you\u2019re probably right.\u201d Alice said with a sigh. \u201cIt just feels so shameful, letting myself go like this. I feel so embarrassed. At least you and Melissa have come to terms with your weight. I wanted to LOSE weight and somehow got fatter.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to lose weight? You don\u2019t really act like you actually want to lose weight. You keep telling yourself that you don\u2019t want to be fat but I think subconsciously you have a different opinion\u2026 Being fat isn\u2019t so bad if you stop telling yourself you\u2019re supposed to be skinny. Yes maybe you get out of breath easier and going up the stairs sucks but that\u2019s okay! You\u2019re not a cheerleader anymore, Alice. It\u2019s not a big deal if you\u2019re out of shape. So you can\u2019t drive your car anymore. Buy a bigger car! They make bigger cars, it\u2019s not like you were never gonna drive again. That 90\u2019s hunk a junk is a deathtrap anyway.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 You\u2019re right! You\u2019re right.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so you had a bit of an accident at the massage parlor. Everyone has embarrassing moments. Would you rather torture yourself on the treadmill 3 times a week or be able to eat what you want?\u201d Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell obviously eat what I want. You know, I think you\u2019re right. It\u2019s just that for all my laugh I was Ms. Overachiever in everything, it\u2019s hard to get over the fact that I had lost my figure.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInstead of saying you lost your figure, just think of it as gaining even more of a figure. I\u2019ve seen guys take a glance at those cans.\u201d Alice blushed. \u201cC\u2019mon order whatever you want, and you better not feel bad about it. Especially since it\u2019s on me tonight.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation quickly turned into their normal banter and Alice became her usual bubbly self. Most of all though Alice stuffed herself until she nearly burst. This time though she felt no shame as she hauled her enormously bloated belly out of the bar.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had recently been a gift from Courtney, custom-fit for the portly PR\u2019s pudge. And while Victoria wasn\u2019t quite as heavy as her fellow office drone was, which was no difficult task, there were some areas where the two of them were a perfect match\u2026 and then there were some where Victoria exceeded that of the other employees due to her uncanny expansion in the past few months\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm\u2026 yes sir, I\u2019ll transfer you right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith husky whimpering grunt, Vicky leaned forward again, eliciting another sharp whine from her chair. Straining the sleeves on her custom-sized purple business blouse, one of Vicky\u2019s meaty arms stretched towards the base. Constrained by the tightness of her top, Vicky\u2019s doughy digits just barely managed to poke the little white button that would transfer the caller to Jenna. After the deed was done, her arm instantly reeled back in like an immense olive fish line, and her fat thumb pressed the \u201cEND\u201d button on the cordless. She then began the arduous task of resituating herself in her seat, an act that was beginning to become increasingly lengthy and hardly worth the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe act of wrestling with her own immensity left Victoria breathless, her chubby cheeks flushed in exertion. They were getting rounder now, burying her pretty Italian features under the fleshy avalanche of her olive skin. Her thick second chin left her neckless. Either of her round arms lay on the rests, pouring off either side of their perches. Victoria\u2019s great gut rest lazily on her lap and thensome\u2014the thickness of her thighs robbing her of the ability to spread her legs and allow her the adequate room that her belly required. Her thick black hair was up, the heat from her neck under her \u2018do was beginning to become unbearable. The tiny silver earrings she\u2019d chosen today looked absolutely ridiculous on a woman so huge, so elephantine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly shifted back to her computer, her eyes focused on Jenna\u2019s door and her newsfeed. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time she\u2019d phoned it in through work\u2014the intricacies of her social life and who her sisters were dating now seemed a lot more interesting than whatever it was she was supposed to be doing here. So long as she made sure to switch the windows before anyone saw her, no one would be the wiser\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, <i>she\u2019s</i> getting fat.\u201d Victoria raised an eyebrow maliciously at a picture of her second-oldest cousin, \u201cAlways knew she would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria giggled to herself, an action that reverberated in the chair. It had a high squealing giggle as Vicky\u2019s girth shook it with her amusement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh <i>he\u2019s</i> cute\u2026\u201d Vicky said to herself with mild amusement, photo-stalking a friend of her friend \u201cFriend request\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward interestedly, the chair wailing a little more at the sharpness of the incline. Her belly bunched against the desk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh mmm\u2026\u201d she licked her lips at a picture her old college roomie had taken of some sushi tagged #healthyliving, \u201cI could go for some of that right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her cankles under the desk, lurching forward slightly with the lightened support. Her ass flexed slightly in excitement deep within her cheeks, an action that was hardly noticed nor felt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh they have deep fried stuff\u2026\u201d she\u2019d navigated to the restaurant\u2019s website in hopes of having found a new stomping ground, \u201cAmerican Dream Roll\u2026 hmm\u2026 it\u2019s sushi though, so I guess it balances out if it\u2019s deep fried\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled deep within her belly folds, her nostrils flaring slightly as a familiar emptiness overcame her. She wondered, not so idly, what spicy mayonnaise tasted like. She\u2019d never heard of it before, but then she\u2019d never been really big into sushi. Her eyes widened as she lost herself in the PDF of their menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if I\u2026 get my discount there\u2026?\u201d she huffed, having grown quite excited by the prospect of maybe going there right now, \u201cOoh\u2026 Happy Hour is half off\u2026 Oh if it worked then I could just eat\u2026 I\u2019d eat that\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nREEAK!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026 and <i>that</i>\u2026\u201d she mumbled breathily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWRAAACK!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, like\u2026 <i>all</i> of\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nK-KRAAAK!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy cubicle-shaking THUD, Vicky was flat on her fat ass. She\u2019d put too much pressure on the chair, and it had given way beneath her. She fell on her back, laying porcine on the floor as her ass made her lower half rise a good bit higher than her upper half\u2014even cushioned by her copious amounts of back fat. Her great belly domed up in its two distinct rolls tall from the floor, the reverberation felt in her gut having caused two of the lower buttons to pop right off and fly somewhere in the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh!!\u201d she grunted thickly, deeply irked by yet another furniture malfunction, \u201cThese stupid fucking chairs again! Like, when are we gonna order some that aren\u2019t total bullshit?!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was in a very good mood today\u2026 she had actually been in a good mood for a while since she had stopped feeling so gloomy about her weight. But today she was feeling especially good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christina made her way over to the vending machine her big overfed belly bounced with each step. All of Christina bounced with her walk to be honest. Her big bottom wobbled and each landing of her feet on the soft carpet sent ripples through her flabby breasts and upper arms. Usually the jostling of her fat didn\u2019t put Christina in a good mood but today was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finally received her clothes from George, the tailor, over the weekend, and since it was Monday, it was the first time Christy was wearing her new clothes around the office. While showing off your brand new clothes was something pretty much every girl (or guy for that matter) enjoyed, Christina\u2019s case was a bit different. While she did like how cute and stylish her new wardrobe was, the reason why she was in such a good mood was because of the fit. Christina had never thought plus size office clothing could be so comfortable. Instead of having her big belly awkwardly shift as her tight shirt struggled to contain its wobbling enormity, her soft belly rolls bounced freely under her perfect fitting blouse. Her pants felt wonderful around her thick thighs. She wasn\u2019t sure what George lined them with but she felt no chaffing as her blubbery legs rubbed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punched in several numbers and watched as various sweet and salty goodies dropped from the vending machine. Christina bent over to retrieve them, surprised when there was no ominous groan or stretching sounds coming from the seat of her pants. It felt like she was in her pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was almost giggling from the unbridled giddiness she was experiencing with the new level of comfort she had found from her new unrestrictive wardrobe. She waddled over to the table and sat down next to Alice. She instinctively reached to adjust her pants and belt to give more room for her gut but found that her hefty belly sat perfectly in her lap. Christy could not believe how awesome this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristina are those the new clothes?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I wanna see. Here, stand up and show us your outfit.\u201d Courtney said. Christina hefted herself up and sun around to show off her knew clothes.<br>\r\n\u201cI LOVE the way this blouse fits. All of it fits so well really.\u201d Christina said, wuickly sitting back down so she could get to her snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah George is like a wizard with that tape measure.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should be getting mine from him soon. I really need them, too. This skirt is barely holding together.\u201d Alice said as she looked over her enormous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope it does for your sake. Especially after hearing about Vicky\u2019s clothing malfunction at the gym.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think Alice could probably pull off the \u201chalf naked with my pant\u2019s torn to shreds\u201d look, pretty well.\u201d Melissa said.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been four hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d told her, for her birthday she wanted to go out clubbing. Like they used to. They, like, <i>never</i> went out to the club anymore. That is to say they never went <i>together</i> anymore. Sometimes it had been more beneficial to just leave her behind and head out herself, slink around with some guys and dance a little. If she\u2019d had it <i>her</i> way, they\u2019d never do anything except eat. Which, admittedly, was kinda fun to do sometimes. They never got to spend any time together outside of work anymore, which was totally lame. Even at the gym, the <i>one</i> place that both of them liked to go, was pretty divisive. So she\u2019d take her out on her birthday, go wherever she wanted. Even if it <i>was</i> out to eat before they hit the clubs\u2014which seemed pretty unlikely now considering that they had a morning show to do and it was already ten \u2018o\u2019 clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass sat across the table, her plate empty and her attention lacking. She propped her head up in her hand while she watched, idly, as her longtime friend and coworker ate her way through a week\u2019s paycheck. And it had been like this for <i>hours</i>. Just eating and eating and eating, plate after plate and swipe after swipe of that damn platinum card. After all the trouble she\u2019d gone to for tonight, it was understandable to be a little upset, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d gone and paid off the owner of Marni\u2019s favorite buffet in town as incentive to allow her friend to really eat all she could eat, instead of just kicking them out half-way through the night. She paid for that tent of a dress she was wearing (courtesy of Taperman Tailoring, thus the ad), <i>and</i> her hair and makeup for the night <i>on top</i> of driving her around. Cass had put a <i>lot</i> of effort into making sure tonight was going to be fun, but so far it had been anything but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni had pushed the table all the way over to Cass\u2019 side, requiring every inch of wiggle room there was to spare. Her behemothic belly still managed to brush against the lip, and as she ate it threatened to swell over and onto the table\u2019s surface. Her arms rested firmly on the crest of her corpulence, her various rolls and copious padding of pudge proving quite obstructive\u2014though she managed to gorge herself with little difficulty. Her wide, rounded arms constantly quaked with their constant movement, feeding forkful after loaded forkful of serving into Marni\u2019s awaiting maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like someone had taken a prom queen and blown her up too big. The dress was low cut, wrapping around the distinct and dominant tiers of her stomach before stopping just above her knees. Her arms wobbled freely,  having undone the tight straps not long after she\u2019d realized that it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Behind her, two black boulders of bobbing butt blubber struggled to break free from her cocktail dress confines. Her hair was up and her makeup pristine, her round cheeks rosy and her plump lips painted, and it was all because of Cass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut <i>nooo</i>. Pre-clubbing birthday dinner had quickly become Marni-Munchie-Hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni gnashed and chewed at her most recent victim, a plate of meatloaf hobbled together in hopes of buying some time. Her second chin flexed and expanded as she swallowed, having completely obscured any presence of her neck. She was slowing down now, at least, but that was beside the point. Cass had sat here this whole time watching as Marni ate herself stupid. She picked idly at the remaining chunk of steak she\u2019d gotten about twenty minutes ago (having had time to actually digest her dinner and go back for a little more later!). Something about being around Marni when she was like this made eating seem a lot less fun\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhn\u2026. Oh man\u2026\u201d Marni wheezed, her breath long lost in the sea of gluttony she\u2019d been swimming in for the past few hours, \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 oh Cass, I can\u2019t\u2026 ungh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni\u2019s ridiculously flabby arms pushed the table a little further into Cass\u2019 middle, officially making her uncomfortable. It relieved a little pressure off of Marni\u2019s massiveness, but not nearly enough. A nasal whine escaped her as two hands rushed to either of her flanks, rubbing gently as she attempted to soothe the beast she\u2019d created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, now she had a stomachache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink you\u2019ve had enough Birthday Girl?\u201d Cass asked flatly, not looking up from her phone as she placated her pudgy partner, \u201cY\u2019wanna go out to the club now or wait until next year when you\u2019ve finally digested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrp\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 Cass can you just\u2026 come over here?\u201d Marni pleaded as she tentatively touched her tonnage, \u201cI just need some\u2026 I just need a little more room\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026 why not?\u201d she answered flatly, wriggling her way out of the booth and walking around to Marni\u2019s side, whereupon the heaviest host pushed the table as far into the booth seating as she could. A grateful groan escaped her as her belly sagged further, free from its support. The definition between her various rolls was less evident and her belly was rounder, no doubt full of tonight\u2019s great birthday binge. She rubbed the spot where her belly had been forced upwards for so long, her dress tighter now that the entirety of Marni\u2019s middle was forcing it forward. If she ripped that thing, Cass would have too\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Oh so much better\u2026\u201d Marni mumbled thickly, closing her eyes and lulling her head back, \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right I am\u2026\u201d Cass grumbled, \u201cConsidering I paid for the\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY, WE\u2019VE GOT A BIRTHDAY!!\u201d a clamorous call rang out as the kitchen doors swung open, an entourage of waiters and waitresses flooding around the booth, a particularly Hispanic man in a chef\u2019s hat clutching Marni\u2019s last present of the night\u2014a big chocolate birthday cake. It was <i>supposed</i> to come out hours ago, but Cass supposed that it was closing time soon. No doubt this was their little way of saying \u201cwe\u2019ve gotta go soon, and so do you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the entire birthday song, Marni just stared at the cake; defeated. She had saved no room for dessert, and Cass could tell. Her breathing was heavy, her sweaty swelling mass moving up and down constantly\u2014something that Cass could unfortunately feel thanks to their close quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 you really didn\u2019t have t<i>urrrp</i>\u2026\u201d Marni burped, \u201cCass, I\u2026 I think I\u2019m gonna have to take this home.

After everything she\u2019d been through tonight, Marni was just gonna take the damn thing home? That\u2026 that didn\u2019t seem right. To her. She\u2019d <i>paid</i> for this, <i>and</i> everything else tonight\u2026 someone was gonna eat that cake! Dammit she\u2019d been watching her eat <i>all</i>. <i>night</i>. and she was <i>going</i> to eat that stupid\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no.\u201d Cass said flatly as she put her phone down on the table, \u201cI\u2019ve seen you eat, like, twice as much as this. You are not gonna take this thing in my car, forget about it, and me wind up eating it. It\u2019s just not gonna happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass grabbed the knife and cut a big square from the bulk. Then, channeling some of the disappointment she\u2019d felt throughout the night, she stabbed it with a fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass raised the fork above her head, watching as Marni\u2019s gaze hypnotically followed the levitating tidbit of cake. She was far too addicted to food to say no, the whimpering that peppered her gasping breaths making her desire all the more obvious. Like a dog begging for scraps, Marni just couldn\u2019t say no. No matter how full she was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 <i>Mmmmm\u2026</i>\u201d she moaned, her eyes closing as a hot puff of air escaped her, \u201cCan\u2019t\u2026 mrmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother mouthful, still no objections. Marni\u2019s arms slid down the swell of her gut, having been relieved of duty. Her head lulled over, her mouth agape in expectation and acceptance. Every bite was welcomed with a sensual sound that Cass had only ever heard her friend make when eating cheese cake, and soon her free hands began to caress her stomach lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass had been watching her eat all night. This cake, this stupid little cake? Nothing. Marni could eat this in a second if she wanted to. After all, she\u2019d paid for the damn thing. And it was <i>not</i> welcome in her apartment. It wasn\u2019t like Marni cared about her weight anyway\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Marni burbled sleepily as Cass placed another forkful in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, halfway done.\u201d Cass commanded, bringing her hand to rest on the taut sphere of Marni\u2019s great gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni winced at Cass\u2019 touch, the dress hardly thick enough to afford any sort of insulation against the outside world. However the light stroking, an action which came naturally to Cass, seemed to ease her ailment. In her heels, Marni\u2019s toes clenched as another mouthful made its way past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing great, come on Birthday Girl.\u201d Cass asserted, drumming Marni\u2019s tautness with her fingers while she waited for her heavyset heifer to finish chewing. As soon as she saw Marni\u2019s dangling double chin flex, another bite. Marni just had to eat this bite, she <i>had</i> to. B-Because they were closing soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm\u2026 no\u2026 too full.\u201d Marni panted, \u201cCan\u2019t\u2026 ah\u2026 can\u2019t do it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass squeezed Marni\u2019s malleable mass with her outstretched palm, causing the whalish woman to convulse and let out a sharp yelp that startled the other late-nighters. Cass manned the final bite on the utensil and held it above Marni\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want it?\u201d she asked firmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni began to salivate from the corners of her mouth as the tantalizing treat was held in front of her, just out of reach. Her mouth opened ever so slightly, her eyes nearly crossed as she kept the fork in sight. She was sweating bullets, her massiveness itchy in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou w<i>aaaa</i>nt it?\u201d Cass asked again, an eyebrow raised wryly and her lips tucked slyly to the side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuh\u2026 yes\u2026\u201d Marni managed to huff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaaat?\u201d Cass asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said\u2026 yes\u2026\u201d Marni whimpered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last bite was placed immediately in her mouth. She chewed and swallowed instinctively, left an absolute wreck. She sat in place, pathetically pudgy and out of breath as she wheezed up a storm. Cass couldn\u2019t help but watch, wide eyed, as Marni began to clutch at her distended middle. Her enormous breasts bobbed up and down with every belabored breathing, and her cheeks were rosy red. Marni looked like she was about to pop, barely conscious if Cass had her guess. But that\u2019s what she wanted, right? She\u2019d spent all night eating and eating and eating on Cass\u2019 dime instead of going clubbing with her. She\u2019d been left so stuffed, and sweaty and\u2026 vulnerable\u2026and... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, uh, don\u2019t mean to interrupt\u2026\u201d one of their waiters returned suddenly, \u201cBut we\u2019re kind\u2019ve\u2026 closing. So\u2026 make of that what you will.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was incredibly productive and efficient at her job and always went above and beyond when completing the tasks she was assigned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s why it was no surprise when she was called into Jenna\u2019s office after lunch on Wednesday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina grunted as she hauled herself out of her chair. Her spare tire cascade in front of her upper thighs, forming a doughy belly apron. She waddled out of her cubicle and into Jenna\u2019s office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey *gulp* Christina, come take a seat.\u201d Jenna said, licking the ketchup and grease off her fingers. The enormous boss leaned back heavily in her groaning chair. She wiped her hands on her massive, clothed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina pulled a chair across from Jenna\u2019s desk. Christina let out a sigh as her bulk lowered onto the seat. She was a bit nervous for some reason.<i> Could it really be a raise? Courtney said it probably was\u2026 but then Alice thought it was a promotion. Is that better?... Wait what if it\u2019s neither? What if I\u2019m being transferred?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve enjoyed your time spent here at the office and at Gordge inc\u2026\u201d Jenna said, she paused. <i>Oh my god am I getting fired? I bet it\u2019s because I ate all the brownies in the kitchen last week\u2026 I totally was gonna have only one, I didn\u2019t mean to eat both boxes!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Are you okay?

You probably needed it to. The starting salaries here really suck.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I managed to get by. Finally I\u2019ll have some walking around money though.\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too sure, you\u2019re paying for our next lunch together.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair Al, we could probably bankrupt her by the third course.\u201d Melissa joked.

She looked over to Melissa in a quick affirmation of her coworker\u2019s suggestion, shuffling a little further down the aisle and allowing the brunette a play at the bin. Her belly brushed against the rack where the trays could slide, spilling over slightly in a bright pink bulge over the cheap imitation marble. Using one of her flabby arms, Christy made a grab at some sticky rice and poured it over her chicken, making it rain bright white on her little orange mountain. Then another spoonful, and then one more, before she topped her first course with shrimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a pretty long time since Christy had come here. Twin Dragons Buffet was pretty ritzy, for an all-you-can-eat joint. Ever since she lost her membership at Fit Life and decided that she couldn\u2019t afford the once constant indulgence of upscale Chinese food, Christy had been forced to eat at WuKong (the <i>other</i> all-you-can-eat Chinese restaurant, it wasn\u2019t as good but it was cheaper and they delivered.) But after Jenna had given her notice about a certain someone\u2019s pay raise\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy huffed as she plopped herself down into the booth, a tremor going through the restaurant floor. Pivoting her pathetic muscles, the overfed employee scooted her supple supine self as close to the wall as her burdensomely bulgy hips and enormously fat ass would allow. Even still, her stomach was already becoming close friends with the table. Her flabby elbows rested lazily on the table\u2019s surface as she made a hasty grab for her silverware, her greedy eyes already glistening as the heaping pile of carbohydrates called her name\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for Courtney to come bumbling over. The PR rep held a platter in between her hands, resting it on the great shelf of her doming stomach as she waddled to the table. She looked ridiculous, such a large woman with such a small (comparatively) tray only served to make herself look larger by comparison. But she was far from the only fat woman who ate at this establishment\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026 gnosh\u2026 Marni did a review of this place.\u201d Alice said idly as she readied another forkful for herself, seated across from Christy, \u201cDid you know that they had a chocolate fountain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHasn\u2019t she\u2026 hff\u2026 already done this place?\u201d Courtney huffed, her laborious largeness having stolen her breath as she waddled over; a problem that only cheap oriental food could cure, \u201cMm\u2026 Like, four times?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was on the Marni Munchie Hour.\u201d Alice corrected after a quick sip of her dark bubbly drink, \u201cThis was on her blog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is <i>also</i> called the Marni Munchie Hour, and it\u2019s still the third time she\u2019s reported on it <i>there</i>.\u201d Melissa corrected as she waddled over, the rest of the sweet and sour chicken in tow as well as some beef tips and shrimp, \u201cGave this place five stars, but I think they paid her off with hibachi chicken. That chocolate fountain sucks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, not that one!\u201d Alice rolled her eyes as Melissa squeezed into the inadequate space next to her, \u201cShe did this on her <i>regular</i> blog. The KISS102.5 blog that she shares with Cass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know <i>way</i> too much about those women and their personal lives.\u201d Courtney interjected, much to the amusement of the other ladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy smiled impatiently and returned to her mountain. Chicken covered in rice covered in shrimp, a veritable masterpiece of the oriental cuisine. She\u2019d found a real liking for it on the cheap from WuKong, but it always got her coffee table messy and it was a pain in the butt to clean up all those takeout boxes. But here, at Twin dragons, she could get all the sweet succulent benefits of her munchie menagerie without all the pesky cleanup duty\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOoh, that looks good!\u201d Alice announced her intrigue in Christina\u2019s meal by leaning in closer with a distinct huskiness to her voice, \u201cWhere did you\u2026 mm\u2026 did you think of that all by yourself? What\u2019s in it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy paused, mid-bite, to make eye contact with her massive superior. She blinked in slight frustration, put the fork back down, and did her best to be as polite as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, uh, shrimp and rice and sweet and sour chicken.\u201d She said quickly, picking the fork back up again before Alice could ask a follow-up ques\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like <i>all</i> the sweet and sour chicken.\u201d Melissa griped, poking at her meager (in actuality, a more than healthy helping) of the sweet orange meat, \u201cLittle Miss I-Got-A-Raise decided to get all the good pieces!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy eyed her friend with scrutiny before looking back at her own plate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Melissa whined as Christy took several big bites out of her massive meal, shoving the goopy sweet stuff between her lips with a big smile on her face, \u201cYou pig!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, and Christina couldn\u2019t deny it. She\u2019d been thinking about this ever since she\u2019d gotten the raise, making this meal and shoving it down her throat. Ten of these, a <i>hundred</i> chicken-rice-shrimp mountains to go down into her belly! As she swallowed, a familiar warmth spread throughout her giant belly apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d Christy said slyly with a pat of the crest of her stomach, her hand lingering there for a moment before returning to its place at the side of her plate, \u201cEvery fat girl for herself right? And in twenty minutes, when they put out some more, I\u2019ll just eat all of <i>that</i> too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Melissa gasped somewhat playfully, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guttural grumble growled loudly enough for all four women present to hear, Christina\u2019s advantageous appetite having been aroused by the prospect of living up to her promise-slash-threat. Her hand slowly slid back to the crest of her stomach, stroking it lightly as it commanded her to eat the as-of-yet unavailable entr\u00e9e. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch me.\u201d Christina burbled thickly before delving into her appetizer\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The four fatties continued to eat and chat. Christina and Melissa had completely emptied the bin of sweet and sour chicken. Their little rivalry had stopped for a few minutes. Until Alice noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like they\u2019re replacing the sweat an\u201d Christina and Melissa immediately jumped up to get more chicken. They both struggled a bit to get out of the booth. Melissa stumbled a bit allowing Christina an early lead in their race to more food. Christina sprinted for about two steps before realizing she was in no way capable of maintaining a dead sprint. Her blubbery breasts smacked her in the face and her whole body quaked and wobbled before she slowed down to a pathetic jog. She managed to steal about half a plate of sweet and sour chicken before Melissa came and bounced into her. Their bodies jiggled, Christina nearly lost her balance. They quickly waddled back to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of the were giggling and Christina and Melissa were breathing heavily as they shoveled food into their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an old fashioned eating contest going!\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my money\u2019s on Melissa.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I\u2019m rooting for Christy then.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rushed back for more and by the 3rd trip there was no sweet and sour chicken left. Christina and Melissa both stared at the empty bin. Then they glanced at each other\u2019s plates. Christina had maybe one or two pieces more than Melissa, and she gave a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it won\u2019t be that easy.\u201d Melissa said as she quickly started dumping chicken fried rice on the rest of her plate. Christina paused before realizing what Melissa meant. She immediately started to pile on the dumplings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are still going? Thought you were just fighting over the sweet and sour chicken.\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN- *gulp* No!\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsh jusht *gulp* round\u2026 *munch* two.\u201d Melissa said through a mouthful of rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to demolish plate after plate of Chinese food. It wasn\u2019t really much of a contest between them. No one was keeping track of how much they were eating since they were too wrapped up in their own glorious gobbling. They were having way too much fun to stop though. It was more just an excuse for Christy and Melissa too eat as much and as fast they could. Something they were both very good at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina\u2019s mouth was just a couple inches away from the dwindling pile of noodles in front of her as she shoveled them rapidly passed her lips. It tasted soooo good. Christina was experiencing such bliss as she ate with reckless abandon. The food was so delicious and she could feel her belly starting to fill up. She frowned a bit as she realized her plate was empty. She almost always ate too much too quickly. Christina often ran out of food before she ran out of appetite. She always regretted not taking her time with her meals and actually savor her food before it all disappeared in her belly. But she didn\u2019t have to worry about that today. <i>No matter how much I eat they\u2019ll always have more. I can just keep eating until I don\u2019t want too anymore.</i> Christina smiled thinking about her piggish intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her tray and waddled quickly over to the buffet. She huffed trying to catch her breath. These back and forths from the booth to the buffet had her completely red faced and wheezing. She grabbed from several bins forming a pile of various foods on her plate. Her mouth watered and her eyes were glazed as she continued to add onto her plate. Her mouth turned to a big stupid grin as she watched the pile of food on her tray grow incredibly large. Every trip she somehow managed to fit even more on to her tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Melissa continued her incredible eating pace. While Christina was completely letting loose with her appetite, this all felt routine for Melissa. When she ate she had one gear. Melissa always ate like it was a competition. She just ate until her belly was full or there was nothing left to eat. Either way once the food was within arm\u2019s reach, it didn\u2019t stay there for many more minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany plates later their pace had started to slow. Christina struggled to squeeze her bloated belly out of the booth. Her swollen middle wedged tightly against the table. She finally popped out and made her way back to the buffet. She now managed a very slow waddled. Her packed gut bouncing with each step (much to Christina\u2019s discomfort). Her left hand kneaded her doughy bottom belly roll (which now hung naked over her pants). She had eaten an enormous amount of food. <i>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got much more room for more. I\u2019m not sure I can take another plate\u2026 Oh they refilled the sweet and sour chicken! Guess I could have a bit more.</i> Christina giggled a bit at how much she was spoiling herself. She piled another mountain of chicken on her plate and waddled slowly back to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they had all eaten their last plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who one?\u201d Alice asked looking at her two overfed friends. Their enormous bellies bobbed up and down with their heavy breaths. Neither of them looked very comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 *huff* ugh- *burp*\u2026 Oooh\u2026 *wheeze* mmmm.\u201d Christina was deeply massaging her exposed gut. She could do little more than groan and purr as she attempted to ease her overstuffed middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, you got anything to say about that, Mel?\u201d Alice laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?... *pant* nuh *huff* nop- *URRRP*!\u201d Melissa gave an earth-shatering burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess it\u2019s a tie then.\u201d Courtney joked. Christina couldn\u2019t even laugh, she just grumbled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a genuine concern among many that the grand opening of Juan Gringo\u2019s was going to get rained out, the fledgling business\u2019 chance at success ruined because of a little wet weather. But nobody seemed to mind too terribly much. It wasn\u2019t too bad outside, just a little cold and a little cloudy. Perfect enough weather to partake in munching on some cheap Mexican food\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gaaaaaawd\u2026 it\u2019s so <i>hoooooooot</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flock of fatties stomped down the sidewalk, encompassing the entire stretch of cement with their collective gaggle\u2019s girth. Three of them, quite well-acquainted, had decided to make a day out of their respectively uneventful weekends and decided to give this new place a try. If this place was as good as it promised to be, then they might have just found a nice little outing to go during lunch. Or maybe on Friday nights? If it had a bar, Friday nights\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, if they could ever make it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was already regretting her decision to park so far away. But around the block was literally the closest any of them was going to get to Juan Gringo\u2019s with a vehicle, given the concert in town. She had been forced to walk more today than she had in\u2026 God, <i>months</i>. And it was killing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled one leg in front of the other in an uneasy swinging motion, her fat thighs too thick to allow any semblance of her once elegant gait. Her thighs touched all the way to her knees and, when in tandem with her drooping belly apron that obstructed the view of her feet and thensome, the act of physically lifting her legs was becoming more trouble than it was worth. She swung her arms to gain momentum while in motion, her elbows eclipsed by soft pudge that had built on her upper arms. Her giant belly bobbed lazily in front while her breasts followed suit, the exertion of heaving her enormity around making her entire face go flush with exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d dressed in thin layers, her elephantine expanse was prone to overheating. That being said, here they are now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gaaaaaawd\u2026 it\u2019s so <i>hoooooooot</i>\u2026\u201d she whined again, near tears, \u201cWhen are we gonna get theeeeeeeere?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost there, Christy\u2026\u201d Courtney said in front, leading their little gaggle, \u201cCan\u2019t you smell that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>sooo</i> can\u2026\u201d Christina bemoaned as her gut growled venomously at the heifer in front of her, \u201cIt\u2019s driving me <i>crazy</i>\u2026 I\u2019m so hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, you baby, we heard you the first time.\u201d Melissa, behind Courtney but in front of Christina, interjected, \u201cIs this what it\u2019s like to take me places? Because I don\u2019t want to go anywhere with me anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past few months had been more than kind to Christina. Jenna\u2019s raise had afforded the former intern more than enough to allow a certain upgrade in her cost of living. Which, while potentially able to improve her life in other ways, basically went directly into Christina\u2019s dietary habits. Affording her a similarly svelte wallet but a much more ample form\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three of them arrived at Juan Gringo\u2019s\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blocked off street was pretty crowded with a large stage and several booths and street vendors in the middle of the road. Near the edge of the large crowd was Juan Gringo\u2019s. The three hefty women waddled across the street to the restaurant, but stopped before entering. Right outside the place was a booth with Marni and Cass doing their show. A pretty small crowd gathered around the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, let\u2019s enter to win a prize from Cass and Marni.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that could be fun.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you\u2019ve gooot to be kiiidding me. If I don\u2019t *wheeze* eat something now, *huff* I\u2019m gonna eat both of you.\u201d Christina whined. Her stomach whined too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Christina it\u2019ll be so quick.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and who knows you might even win again!\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThat song was Camera Shy performed live by Athletes Foot right here on Main street. We\u2019re about to go to break but don\u2019t forget to stop by and enter a chance to win a week of free food from the brand new Juan Gringo\u2019s all-you-can-eat Mexican restaurant! We\u2019ll be giving that away to our lucky winner in the next hour or so\u2026\u201d</i> Cass\u2019s voice came through the loud speaker at the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina paused for a bit. God she was so hungry, but a week of free meals from this place? Christina was hungry but she was also smart, and she knew the economic choice was to try to win. She hated making her empty belly wait but Christina knew the potential payoff was much more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine let\u2019s do it quickly.\u201d Christina said. They waddled over to the booth. They were a little disappointed they couldn\u2019t meet Cass or Marni as they just ended up talking to some producer who asked for their info. They then quickly walked into Juan Gringo\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope this place actually has good food now that we just signed up to potentially eat here for free.\u201d Melissa said. They were seated in a (fortunately) large booth. Juan Gringo\u2019s was a bit different than your conventional all you can eat joint. You could order food which would be brought to you from the kitchen by your waiter or you could got to the buffet where they had all kinds of Mexican food as well as a make your own tacos and burritos area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Melissa and Courtney could even decide which option they wanted Christina was dashing over to the buffet area. She was in no mood to wait anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they all were gorging themselves with nachos, burritos, tacos, and anything else that could be filled with beans, rice, salsa, and meat. The three gluttonous friends didn\u2019t say a word as they were so wrapped up in their greedy lust for filling their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina breathed a sigh of relief as she cleaned her fourth plate. Not only was it a relief to satisfy her suffering tummy, it was a relief that everything she ate was soooo good. The difficult journey from her car to Juan Gringo\u2019s was definitely justified by the delicious platefuls of Mexican food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually their voracious devouring slowed a bit as their feast was coming to an end. Christina put down her plate and squeezed into the booth. Her heavy gut sat naked cause of her too small t shirt. Christina groaned at the discomfort of her belly. She leaned further back to give her tummy some more room in her lap. She rubbed the red mark on her skin where her jelly rolls had been pushing against the table. She purred with pleasure before remembering that there was still a plate in front of her waiting to be eaten. Reached past her enormous belly and plump breasts for the delectable food she had just retrieved. Since she was running out of room in her stomach, Christina figured it was time for dessert, thus she had piled a stack of churros onto her plate. She grabbed two or three in each hand and began to alternate bites from the two thickets of churros she held in her hands. Christina grinned with greed and pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAlright we\u2019re ready to announce the winner of a week of free food from the brand new Juan Gringo\u2019s restaurant.\u201d</i> They all heard from the booth outside of the restaurant. The three bloated babes stopped eating as they listened closely for the winner of the prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAnd the winner is\u2026 Christina White!

She\u2019d entered online about an hour ago, crossing her chubby fingers and toes that she might score that sweet all you can eat deal, <i>\u201cAnd the winner is\u2026 Christina White! Come over to the KISS 102.5 booth to pick up your prize!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crestfallen sigh escaped the swollen sweetheart as she slowly lolled back to work. She would have <i>loved</i> to be out with the girls, trying out Juan Gringo\u2019s herself, but Jenna needed someone to stay over. And unfortunately for her, Alice had drawn the short lot. Christina was so lucky\u2014Alice had been entering the KISS102.5 contests and daily giveaways since she\u2019d started working at Gordge, and she\u2019d never won anything. But Christie had entered twice, and both times she\u2019d won some pretty awesome gifts! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, there was always next week. They always had something to give away on that show, and as more and more restaurants picked them up as sponsors, the more delicious all those prizes were getting. Last week it was a free office party catered by their local Chic-fil-A, and the week before that it was a fifty dollar gift certificate to the Twin Dragon Chinese buffet. Alice was really holding out for another BOGO deal from Taperman\u2019s Tailoring; the last few weeks had been pretty hard on her wallet and her waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHff\u2026hff\u2026Big\u2026deal\u2026\u201d a slow, husky drawl wheezed from somewhere else in the office, \u201cLike I\u2019d really\u2026wanna eat all I could eat\u2026at some\u2026some <i>Mexican</i> restaurant. Do you <i>know</i> how many\u2026 how many <i>carbs</i> are\u2026like, <i>in</i> a burrito?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria punctuated her opinion from her desk with a much needed slurp of her smoothie, her full lips wrapping around the bright green straw and sucking down the thick fruity mixture. She released with a huff, her arm falling uselessly back into place on her desk. Her other arm stretched to grab her protein bar, fresh from the \u201cbulk-builders\u201d section of the bar at Fit Life, and unwrapped it nimbly with deceptively sluggish fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I can\u2019t even\u2026 <i>imagine</i> how many calories are in <i>one</i> of those\u2026 those things. Those things they serve.\u201d Vicky puffed as she stuffed a good two-thirds\u2019 of the bar into her mouth, \u201cAll the\u2026bread and\u2026and the cheese\u2026mmm\u2026and the sauce that\u2019s on like\u2026 everything.\u201d The secretary paused to slurp down another sip of smoothie, \u201cAll those\u2026mm\u2026 those tacos and\u2026 and like the quesadillas\u2026 It\u2019s all like <i>soooo</i> fattening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice inwardly mused at the hypocrisy of Victoria criticizing anyone\u2019s dietary techniques, even if they were absent. For a while now it seemed everyone had been expanding just a bit quicker than usual, what with all this \u201cwho\u2019s gonna get a premium membership\u201d and all the discounts and coupons and stuff, but nobody seemed to have blown up quite like Victoria. For all her big talk about exercise and nutrition, Victoria was hardly in any position to judge anybody about their weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting in one of Jenna\u2019s old reinforced chairs, her posterior and their boss\u2019 were hardly shaping up to the same in size. She poured out of it at every angle, her mile-wide thighs pressed and bulged out of the holes created by the armrests. The thickness of her thighs forced her to sit stiff and rigid, and the severity with which her ass stuck out meant that she was more out of her chair than in it. Even still, the cartoonish proportion that her body had developed meant that there was a good few inches between her ample backfat and that actual back of the chair. She leaned back every now and then, but that cause a great strain on her back and the chair\u2014the agonizing groans of Jenna\u2019s old chair was a testament to just how bottom-heavy voracious Victoria was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was unrecognizeable, having widened and softened with all the extra weight, and her bingo wings were swollen and obstructively flabby. Her fat breasts rested lazily atop her great swollen gut, which surged forward and pooled onto her fat lap. If she had more sitting room, Victoria would have spread her legs so as to allow more room to breathe for her belly, but as she sat now it was all but impossible to actually reach her workspace. She couldn\u2019t even reach all the way around it now\u2014yet somehow she found it perfectly acceptable to berate Christina for happening to win an all-she-could-eat fiesta at Juan Gringo\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike\u2026Christie\u2019s gonna get\u2026soo\u2026fat\u2026\u201d even her voice had changed, having slowed and deepened slightly as she\u2019d gained, \u201cShe should really start\u2026hitting the gym again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven good-natured Alice couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the hypocrisy of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh stop, I\u2019m sure Christie will behave herself.\u201d Alice said in a motherly manner as she eased Vicky off of her friend, \u201cAnd besides, I\u2019m sure if we\u2019re nice, she\u2019ll let us all in on it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Vicky puffed, \u201cYou think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, we\u2019ll probably wind up going there every day next week.\u201d Alice explained to the already salivating secretary, \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be a really good chain, I haven\u2019t had any since I went on that business trip out west.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Vicky purred thickly, Alice could practically see the reflection of all that delicious Mexican food in her glazed eyes from all the way over there, \u201cI guess\u2026 so long as she\u2026 <i>shares</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria huffed and puffed as she heaved herself into Fit Life gym, a few hours after she\u2019d finally escaped her horrible office job. It was time for her afternoon workout, right after her post-power lunch afternoon snack. She gripped another protein bar in her hand and alternated between awkwardly waddling towards the door and taking large bites out of the poor granola-chocolate-peanut mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already beat from the modest walk from the car to the gym (with Premium Member parking, no less!) and couldn\u2019t have looked any less like an athlete.  She was dressed in an old tank top that hugged her every inch and roll while completely exposing her ample armfat to the world, and a pair of bright blue leggings that struggled to stretch over the supreme swollenness of her giant ass. Even her Yankee\u2019s cap looked a little snug on her head, her fat cheeks bunching up in distaste as she lumbered towards the door. She had to lean forward when she walked now, or she would fall backwards onto her copious amounts of posterior plush\u2014probably without even feeling a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHff\u2026hff\u2026\u201d she puffed as she tried to squeeze through the doorway, her ass fat catching on the cold metal frame and oozing back over it. She looked backwards, getting a clear look at the problem. She shimmied her hips in as seductive a manner as possible (for any hot guys who might be watching, natch.) but found that it didn\u2019t so much free her so much as make her mad. She was still stuck! She raised her hands to either side of the doorway and pushed, popping right out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy\u2026peasy\u2026\u201d she wheezed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky lumbered down the hallway, giving curt hellos to the gymgoers out in the main workout area whom she\u2019d become acquainted with during her patronage. Vicky tottered down the hallway, her big fat ass leaving almost no room for anyone to get by. She settled at the entrance to the Premium Member area, a sweating sputtering mess as she felt around for her platinum card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding it, she whipped it out and swiped it down the scanner\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky curled a nostril and tried it again. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. That wasn\u2019t the sound it was supposed to make, was it? Obviously not or she\u2019d be inside right now, getting her smoothie on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Marianne!\u201d Vicky barked at a familiar blue polo\u2019d woman who just so happened to be trying to squeeze past Vicky\u2019s ample ass fat, \u201cMy card\u2019s not working. It\u2019s going \u2018boop\u2019. Do I need to get a new one or something? This thing\u2019s pretty old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant, Marianne, was more than ready to help. She smiled and took the card from Victoria and swiped the car herself\u2014<i>boop</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this just means that your Premium Membership has expired.\u201d The shorter woman said with a saleswoman\u2019s sympathy, \u201cBut if you want, I could always renew it for you? We\u2019ve got a really good discount on return members.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpired?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn\u2019t been six months already, had it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then I\u2019ll renew it.\u201d Vicky said resolutely, \u201cHow much is it a month?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you\u2019re a returning member, you\u2019re only going to have to put fifty dollars down this month. Now next month <i>will</i> cost the whole hundred dollars, but\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA hundred dollars a <i>month</i>?\u201d Vicky asked, her second chin dropped, \u201cI can\u2019t afford that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, I would <i>really</i> suggest that you look at our basic membership package then, Vicky. It\u2019s only fifty a month, twenty five this month since you\u2019re a returning member, and it comes with a discount at all the premium passes.\u201d Marianne said with some trepidation, \u201cBut if you\u2019re really looking to get back into shape, then\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Back</i> into shape?\u201d Vicky huffed, putting her hands on her hips and standing as defiantly as her great girth would allow, \u201cWhat\u2019s <i>that</i> supposed to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne faltered, grimacing slightly in the line of sight of one of their biggest customers. Vicky was practically sumo-sized, and the wee little cardio-er knew that she wouldn\u2019t stand a chance if this got physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I suppose we could allow you just one more day. Just this one time.\u201d Marianne said with an awkward smile, swiping her faculty card in the scanner, \u201cJust, uh\u2026 have fun! And make sure not to tell my supervisor!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina licked her lips as she stared into the cavernous mouth of the break room fridge, her soft stomach gurgling as her clingy blouse cradled it. Everyone always brought the best stuff; Alice and her takeout, Victoria with her mother\u2019s home-made pasta dishes, even Courtney\u2019s sandwiches looked professionally made and appetizing. Her own meal seemed meager in comparison, two microwavable Hungry Man dinner plates with a cupcake from the bakery down the street for dessert. Sure somebody always made a Quiznos run before lunch, and that usually helped fill her up, but it still didn\u2019t seem very fair that she had to suffer like this. Just <i>looking</i> at all of this stuff was making her hungry\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thick arm slowly breached the fridge, the icy mist that it created making goosebumps appear on the sausage-like appendage. Christina wiggled her fingers greedily as she traced over the surplus of food that sat before her, just waiting to be plucked like an overripe fruit. She toyed with the idea of taking one of Alice\u2019s little fold up boxes of Chinese, but decided against it. Alice was always so sweet after all, it wouldn\u2019t have been right. But Victoria had been awfully loud lately, and she wouldn\u2019t shut up about that stupid contest she won last week. She\u2019d probably be <i>glad</i> that Christina took away a few of those nasty old carbs, right? But that would have been hard to disguise\u2014breaking the first layer of cheese and taking a huge chunk out of that sweet meaty mix would have probably just served to piss Victoria off, and there was no way that Christie could avoid getting caught red-handed this close to lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped her boxes in one hand tightly, biting her lower lip as she fought the urge to just take everything for herself. Her gut groaned at the sight of all this delicious food that teased her, her breathing shallow as she rest her hand on the first shelf in the fridge. There had to be <i>something</i>, just a little extra that nobody would miss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie grunted thickly as she settled on taking one of Courtney\u2019s sandwiches\u2014it was her turn to make the Quiznos run anyway, it\u2019s not like she\u2019d catch her. Christie palmed the impressively large thing and ripped it from the expansive cold cavern, clutching it tightly to her fattened breast while she tossed one of her Hungry Man meals into one of the microwaves. She put in the time and collapsed onto one of the benches, unwrapping Courtney\u2019s confection from its protective cellophane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie moaned as she chewed\u2014even cold, it was still probably one of the better sandwiches she\u2019d eaten in a long time. A home-made chicken sandwich with tomato and mayonnaise on sourdough with lots of lettuce and some spices. The meat was still so juicy and the tomatoes so plump and watery that it dripped down Christie\u2019s mouth and dribbled onto her breast. She took another big hungry bite, scarfing down her little stolen treat as quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Christie!\u201d came a cheery voice, ripping Christie from her sandwich trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shit, had the door opened? She\u2019d hardly noticed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey Al!\u201d Christie said shakily, holding her pilfered prize covetously into her bosom while she chewed, \u201cYou, uh\u2026 you ready for lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really am\u2014it\u2019s been such a long day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swollen sweetheart puffed as she struggled to pull one thick leg in front of the other, her big belly bouncing as Alice fought against her own girth. She\u2019d dressed in stretch-pants again, meaning that she was obviously overdue for a trip to the tailor. Her long white shirt, practically a tent with an off-white pattern sewn into it, looked snug against her copious upper half. It hugged her breasts tightly, with her impressive hooters very obviously (though, knowing Alice, very inadvertently) on display. Her stomach would force it up ever so often, meaning that Alice would have to struggle to reach past her own ampleness and pull it back down over the massive quivering swell of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Is that a sandwich?\u201d Alice asked with her sugary-sweet good-natured concern, \u201cThat looks\u2026 really good, actually. Where\u2019d you get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know\u2026 out.\u201d Christie smiled awkwardly as Alice tottered towards the fridge, \u201cI was out and got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Alice smiled, satisfied with Christie\u2019s vagueness, \u201cThen whose food is in the microwave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine.\u201d Christie answered through a bite of Courtney\u2019s sandwich, \u201cI, uh\u2026 I skipped breakfast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Alice\u2019s answer was a little more put off this time, having distinctly remembered seeing Christie down at least two or three super donuts this morning, \u201cIs that one, um\u2026 also yours?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to the remaining Hungry Man meal that Christina had under her arm, nestled against her big belly. The bespectacled blonde glanced aside nervously, guilty conscience wracking her brain and making her unable to think clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed dinner last night.\u201d She said almost proudly before taking another big bite, \u201cSho yah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we went ou\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina heard the door open this time, its hinges worn after so many years of constant use and abuse courtesy of the hungry gals that roamed the office. But she wouldn\u2019t have had to, considering that Melissa tended to make her entrance known. For as big in the belly as she had gotten, Melissa was easily as big in the mouth. She practically burst through the breakroom door, her flair for the dramatic easily getting the best of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew! Jesus <i>Christ</i> I thought lunch would never get here.\u201d She announced, waddling in belly-first with her arms swinging merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was not untouched by the weight gain that had affected her co-workers, having put some significant poundage in the past few months especially. Her stomach was hit hard, hanging lower towards her knees as her multiply-rolled middle gained depth and width with every passing meal. It practically swung from side to side when she walked, her jowls jiggling in unison with her every step as the cubicles shook before her mighty mass. A few more meals, Christie reckoned as she munched nervously on Courtney\u2019s sandwich, and Melissa wouldn\u2019t be able to reach around it anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d Alice said in a motherly tone as Melissa plopped her expansive ass down on the seat of the table opposite Christie\u2019s, causing the poor thing to groan, \u201cI thought you said you were just going to the bathroom\u2014that was twenty minutes ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice bobbled towards the table that Melissa had claimed for them, two bags of takeout in hand as she lumbered over. She placed them both down on the table, Melissa eagerly leaning into her belly to rake one in for herself, and slowly lowered her heft down. Alice had gotten pretty big lately, and nobody knew it better than she did. She was often careful, and tended not to just throw her weight around. But with the way that bench bent beneath her, Alice\u2019s bulk was just getting more and more destructive by the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured I\u2019d order lunch after I got done.\u201d Melissa eagerly ripped open a box of fried rice, pausing only to match Alice\u2019s stink eye, \u201cWhat? I ordered you one too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina mostly ignored this, choosing to stuff as much of her snack into her mouth as possible. It was so good. Seriously, why hadn\u2019t she done this before? The chicken had to be home-made, there was no way this was store-bought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat smells good?\u201d Melissa asked, taking a few sniffs, \u201cMm\u2026 Hungry Man? Chicken tenders, mashed potatoes aaand\u2026 a brownie? I think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, how\u2019d you know?\u201d Alice asked, impressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see it on the box.\u201d Melissa stuck out her tongue at her gullible glutton of a friend, \u201cSeriously Al. Hey Christie, you gonna share one of those with your best pal Melissa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie looked over, looking like a deer caught in headlights\u2014still chewing fiercely on her chicken cud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh, no. These are, uh\u2026 these are mine.\u201d She said hastily, \u201cBut, uh\u2026 you can have the brownie if you want. They never come out right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do if you cook \u2018em right.\u201d Melissa grunted as she heaved herself up at the sound of the microwave timer, her big belly bunching up against the bench as she ho\u2019d, \u201cYou can\u2019t just put it in there with the rest of the tray, you\u2019ve got to take it out and cook it separate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa\u2019s great gut brushed against Christina\u2019s ample back fat as the larger brunette turned into the alley created by the table and counter, squeezing herself into the small space as her belly oozed onto the countertop and her big fat butt bumped against Christina\u2019s head. She got the tray out and placed it on the counter, grabbed a knife and fork, and cut out the brownie before leaving Christina with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant me to nuke the other one for ya?\u201d Melissa asked with a surprising lack of judgment, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve had two-tray days. I get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure, yeah that\u2019d be great.\u201d Christina leaned, trading tray for tray as Melissa popped in the other one, \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa struggled to turn around, her rolling love handle pushing into Christina\u2019s side as she waddled out of the cranny she\u2019d nestled into, her belly flopping back down once it was free of the counterspace. She popped the meager brownie into her mouth and chewed, her double chin pressing against her breast. She then proceeded to collide against Alice\u2019s ample girth, Melissa\u2019s middle forcing Alice\u2019s arm forward a little too far, knocking her bite of fried rice and hibachi chicken onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Al.\u201d Melissa grunted through brownie, \u201cGettin\u2019 kinda tight in here, huh?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice nodded affirmatively while Christie simply grunted in response. She was almost done with her little meal now, good timing considering she had her <i>actual</i> lunch to get to before Courtney showed up. She was torn between picking up the pace and disposing of the evidence and taking her time to savor the flavor\u2014what in the world was <i>in</i> this thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 yeah, I\u2019m about to go on lunch. Call you back.\u201d Another voice puffed as Victoria squeezed her way through the door, her zaftig thighs forcing her to totter in sideways so her enormous hips and fat ass didn\u2019t get stuck, \u201cOhmigawd <i>yes</i> I\u2019m gonna call you back. Jeez.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky\u2019s incredible ass was visible from any angle, even looking directly in front of her. Her hips had gone from ample to monstrous, with her thighs swelling out and over her knees. In front of her, Vicky\u2019s titanic tummy rolled into three distinct sections of pure overindulgence, pouring out of her blouse and slapping against her overtaxed leggings. She sauntered through the little aisle left between all the tables, wisely choosing to avoid Alice\u2019s road-block bulkiness but in the process her immense Italian ass made room for itself on Christie\u2019s table by knocking over the fully-cooked tray. Luckily the cellophane wrapping was mostly still on it, but the corn couldn\u2019t be saved\u2014it wound up all over the breakroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVicky!\u201d Christina cowed, \u201cThat was my lunch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, like so<i>ree</i>.\u201d she huffed, reaching into the fridge and forcing her ass into Alice\u2019s personal bubble while she pawed at her lasagna, \u201cIt was like, <i>really</i> close to the edge. Just\u2026 pick it up or something. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie huffed, putting her sandwich down on the table as she hoisted her bigness up from the bench. She leaned over to pick up what remained of her second course, but when she reeled herself back up, she found herself head-first in Vicky\u2019s underbutt, causing both women to let out sharp cries of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh!\u201d Vicky squeaked as she pressed herself against the wall, thankfully giving Alice another inch or so of elbow room, \u201cJesus Christie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who knocked over my lunch, Vic.\u201d Christie said exasperatedly, coming up red-faced from exhaustion at the simple act of bending over, \u201cTry to control that tank ass of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky waited as patiently as possible for Christie to sit back down before she wriggled her way into what little room there was between the counter and Christie\u2019s table. The cabinets were just above there, and held little condiments and stuff that everyone used. Vicky leaned into the counter, covering a good half of it with her fatness in her hopes of reaching the top shelf. She rocked backwards into the back of Christie\u2019s head, making pathetic little grunts of exertion at every attempt\u2014giving Christie whiplash as she slowly fought against being wedged into Vicky\u2019s titanic crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need some <i>help</i>?\u201d Christie finally asked, scooting away from the super-sized secretary\u2019s carnivorous ass, \u201cWhat are you trying to reach up there anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u2026 protein bars\u2026\u201d Vicky huffed, all red-faced and sweaty, \u201cI keep them\u2026 up there\u2026 so no one will\u2026 steal them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you <i>put</i> them up there?\u201d Melissa asked wryly as she observed the situation, \u201cYou can\u2019t even reach without sitting on Christie\u2019s head\u2014why don\u2019t you just keep them on a lower shelf?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShu\u2026 Shut up.\u201d Vicky huffed as she side-waddled back into Alice\u2019s personal space so Christie could reach the box of protein bars, \u201cThanks Chris\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box wasn\u2019t in her hands a second before one of Vicky\u2019s chubby fists plunged into it, stretching out the cardboard as Vicky\u2019s chubby ball of a fist emerged with two of the filling things. She immediately unwrapped one of them and pressed it past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me you\u2019re not going to eat all of those\u2026again.\u201d Alice warned while staring Vicky\u2019s right butt cheek in the side, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a whole pan of lasagna to go through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called\u2026 <i>carboloading</i>\u2026 gawd.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky puffed as she choked down the remaining portion and started on her second, wriggling her way through the lacking aislespace. Christie and Alice instinctively removed their lunches from ass-length as Vicky\u2019s ponderous posterior poured onto the tables. That ass was getting to be far too much to handle. She collapsed on a microwave-facing bench, much to the reinforced thing\u2019s dismay as it hollered in agony, still munching on a protein bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie rolled her eyes and returned to her sandwich\u2014the last section of her sandwich to be precise. Even with all the distractions, this had absolutely been the best thing about today. She had to get this recipe from Courtney\u2014was there a way to do that without incriminating herself? Probably not. But then again, it\u2019d probably be easier than stealing one of her subs every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe microwave beeped shrilly, ten minutes later, as Vicky\u2019s pasta bubbled to a searing perfection of molten marinara. A whiny, entitled huff became the big-bottomed beluga as she attempted to hoist her fat ass off the table. Alice, in her sweetness, saw fit to turn at the sake of her own meal and remove the pan for Vicky, a certain understanding between them forged due to their similar limited mobilities. It was passed from Alice to Melissa, Melissa to Christie, and then from Christie to Vicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026<i>gimme</i>\u2026\u201d Vicky burbled through the hints of chocolate that remained on her lips, taking the piping hot pasta toward her without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened yet again to reveal Courtney, an armful of subs held tightly against her tonnage\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey ladies, I\u2019m back!\u201d she announced happily, \u201cShould I try and find a space or, uh\u2026Christie, did you eat my sandwich?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina had been having a wonderful week. She had been eating with no sense of restraint lately and a week of free all-you-can-eat Mexican food only heightened her level of gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gone to Juan Gringo\u2019s Mexican Restaurant every day this week. She had even managed to go two times on a couple days, once with her office friends after work and then a second time for dinner. On Friday Jenna was nice enough to extend everyone\u2019s lunch break so Christina could take them all there for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday night she got home late from another large Mexican dinner. She closed the door of her apartment, huffing and puffing from having to take the stairs to the third floor. She hung up her coat and dropped a greasy bag of fast food on the kitchen counter. Christy had stopped at the drive thru on the way home. She wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d eat it tonight given all the food currently in her stomach, but maybe she\u2019d want a late-night snack later. Even if she didn\u2019t eat it tonight she\u2019d save it for another day. Christina loved having extra food in her fridge that she could just pop in the microwave and eat. She had an ample supply of Chinese food and pizza that she would snack on throughout the day and at night. Christina had gotten used to having something tasty and delicious in her mouth at all times. For most of the time Christina spent in her apartment she usually had a box of fried rice or a bag of leftover fries or a bowl of buttery popcorn in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps not tonight though because she was so incredibly full. One benefit to going out to eat with Courtney and Victoria was they almost never stopped talking. There was hardly a moment where one of them wasn\u2019t gabbing about something, allowing Christina to sit back and listen and, most importantly, focus on the food in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated blonde made several groans and grunts as she waddled into her bedroom. She had to get out of these clothes. Christina was wearing a navy blue V-neck sweater and some very tight jeans. She fiddled with her belt which was constricting around her squishy waistline. Since her bulging boobs blocked her view, she walked over to her mirror so she could see what she was doing. Christina let out a \u201chrrrk!\u201d as she pulled and undid the belt. She let out a sigh as the pressure around her blubbery midriff was released. The button on these jeans had popped off just last Wednesday so her belly was allowed to bulge out. The pressure of her big paunch forced the zipper all the way down and caused her sweater to ride up several inches. Christina\u2019s overfed gut was finally free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror she noticed the pinkish red mark going all the way around her doughy middle. It was probably time to poke a new hole in her belt, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood to do that now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she took off her sweater and under shirt. She struggled to pull the stretched sweater out of her big flabby arms. Christina hadn\u2019t really noticed how thick her arms were getting. She examined the hanging blob of fat on her left bicep before throwing her clothes in the hamper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft in just her underwear, she began to remove her bra. Undoing the clasp behind her back she let out a deep breath as her plump breasts were freed. As her boobs grew bigger and heavier with fat, the more and more she looked forward to removing her bra at the end of the day. Her breasts had filled out a lot as she put on more weight. They still managed to look relatively perky as they rested slightly on the top of her growing belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina through the bra aside and took some clothes out of her dresser. A comfy pair of pajama pants slid nicely over her thick fleshed out legs. The stretchy waistband did a nice job handling her round swollen butt. She tucked the pants under her hanging gut for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a thin white tank top that she pulled it over her bulging bare breasts. When she yanked it over her belly, Christina found it to be quite tight. The whit top had barely made it down to her belly button. She pulled it as far past her heft as she could. You could partially see her stomach fat as the cotton fibers struggled to stretch over her pillowy flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked out of her bedroom Christina could feel the tank top rising up, letting all of her belly hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh screw it.\u201d Christina said, as her hands instinctively went to rub her exposed flabbiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went over to the bag of fast food she had brought back. The burgers and fries were still nice and warm. With her ballooning belly no longer constricted by pants or a belt, Christina felt like she had some room for more. Bringing the bag over to the sofa she let out a grunt as she lowered herself down. The couch seemed to groan in response. With one hand submerged in the greasy bag of food and the other pulling the remote out from under her big soft rump, she put on a rerun of the Simpsons that she had recorded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the burger and fries were consumed and several episodes were watched, Christina let out a long yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about bed time.\u201d She said in a sleepy voice. But with all the food in her gut she stayed firmly on the sofa and within minutes she was fast asleep with her salty fingers clutching her swollen belly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite several renovations over the part of the past three years, and a major overhaul once Jenna took over as branch manager some years before that, it was becoming painfully clear that there just wasn\u2019t a way to rally several incredibly obese office women and squeeze them into that tiny meeting room. They\u2019d tried it just last month to do the quarterly review, and the results were disastrous. Everyone was cramped, there weren\u2019t enough chairs for everyone to sit down in and almost none of them were wide enough for them to use, it got really hot and muggy, and everyone tried to peel out of the room at once\u2014meaning that Victoria got wedged in the doorway with some of Alice\u2019s belly and her left boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then there had been some talk about another renovation, but in the meantime they\u2019d been using the office floor as their makeshift meeting room. Jenna would announce that there would be a meeting over the loudspeaker and then she\u2019d call everyone\u2019s attention to herself once she managed to trudge her way out of her private office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had become a painfully large woman after working in such a sedentary job for so many years, no doubt combined with her natural penchant for overeating and underexerting herself. While several of the women working under her were explicitly obese\u2014Alice and Courtney were getting to the point where they couldn\u2019t ride the elevator together\u2014Jenna had steadily remained the biggest, fattest woman in the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention everyone, please?\u201d Jenna\u2019s deep though distinctively feminine voice soared over everyone\u2019s cubicles, \u201cJust a quick little meeting and then everyone can get back to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina pushed back, rolling herself out from her desk and turning the swivel chair outwards. Her stomach rested gingerly on the seat of the chair between her legs, separated in the spacious cavern created in its accommodating design. Around her, Christina\u2019s coworkers did the same with varying degrees of difficulty as the office purred with the various fatty grunts of exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know, but it\u2019s important.\u201d Jenna mistook the chorus of groans as begrudging her for calling them to attention on a Friday (which, granted, some of them might have been)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had put on a distinct amount of weight since Christina had arrived, which was really saying something. She had not been exempt from the steady gain that gripped almost everyone in the office, having put on at least another hundred or so pounds in the few years that Christina had been working for her. Her great stomach swelled outwards past arms\u2019 length and dipped down to her knees, making any trip an impossibly difficult trek for the big beautiful branch manager. Her breasts, enormous mounds of soft womanly flesh, always looked ready to pop right out of any of her custom-fit business suits (Christina had often hypothesized that this was intentional). Her face, doughy and round and chinned three times over, was framed by her stylish brown bangs\u2014an attempt at making her puffy cheeks seem less so that failed miserably\u2014and her hair was often pulled up into an updo to reduce heat on her back neck-roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, yeah. Right here.\u201d Jenna waved a heavy arm that swung with flabbiness, \u201cJust\u2026 phew\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her enormity onto Victoria\u2019s desk, causing it to creak ominously despite its solid construction. By the time she was confident that she had everyone\u2019s attention, Jenna had completely lost her breath. Standing at her size, as well as the arduous trip from her office all the way out here, was exhausting. So she continued while sitting on Victoria\u2019s desk\u2014which worked out great for Victoria, considering that meant she didn\u2019t have to listen since Jenna wouldn\u2019t see her on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026phew\u2026 I\u2019ve been branch manager at Gordge for a long\u2026 <i>long</i> time.\u201d Jenna said resolutely as she folded her hands on top of her gut, \u201cAnd in that time I\u2019ve seen it grow and prosper and\u2026 pretty much just kick ass until we became the most profitable branch in the country. When I started here\u2026 Gordge South was the\u2026 the top dog. But thanks to all our hard work, it\u2019s us. We\u2019re awesome. <i>You\u2019re</i> awesome and while I\u2019m\u2026 <i>really</i> sorry to say this, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight rabble, causing Jenna to raise her chubby hands in a call for pause<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving the company. You\u2019ll probably still see me every now and then. I\u2019ve been promoted to corporate, which is\u2026 well it\u2019s a huge honor for me. I\u2019ll be staying until the end of next week, but after that I\u2019ll be packing up and I\u2019ll be out of here.  I didn\u2019t <i>tell</i> anyone because\u2026 well, let\u2019s be honest here, this is just really painful for me. I\u2019ve really come to\u2026 really love all you guys and I\u2019ll always miss being your boss. And Carrie\u2019s homemade brownies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a whole week for goodbyes, but I just wanted to wish everyone good luck. I thought I\u2019d take this time to announce my departure, but <i>also</i> to announce who\u2019s gonna get the Big Girl chair and a private office once I\u2019m out of here. Would you please step up here\u2014</span></div></div>",

The obese office veteran got about four inches off of her chair before immediately falling back on the strained seat. Once again she lifted herself up, her flabby arms wobbling as they pushed down on the bending armrests. There was a short hesitation until, with a final grunt she stood upright. The clapping had died down but started up again as Courtney maneuvered her obese bulk through the cubicles, up to where Jenna was sitting. She was a little out of breath when she reached Vicky\u2019s desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank\u2026*huff* Sorry\u2026 Thank you so much guys. I\u2019m very excited to be taking over for Jenna, though we\u2019ll all be sad to see her go.\u201d As Courtney said this she gave Jenna big hug. Given how incredibly fat the two women had become, it was literally about the biggest hug you could possibly imagine. There was a chorus of aww from the small crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s really not that big of a deal, gals. I\u2019ll be the new assistant regional supervisor for the east coast. It\u2019ll be my job to come visit the branch twice a year.\u201d Jenna said. Though it was a little hard to believe, with her enormous body that just kept growing fatter, that she\u2019d be willing to take yearly business trips for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah in a way you\u2019re actually still my boss.\u201d Courtney said with a giggle. \u201cAnyway, for next week Jenna and I will basically be your co-bosses. Jen will technically be in charge but I\u2019ll start to shoulder some of the load since she\u2019s gonna be really busy and I could use this time to ease into the job\u2026 As for what to expect from me as your boss, Jenna\u2019s been a great example for me the past however many years it\u2019s been. You guys are incredibly productive and put up great numbers for the company, so I won\u2019t try to fix anything about that. One thing I would like to do as manager is make it a little more comfortable around here for all of us.\u201d This was met with a few hoots and hollers of approval. \u201cI\u2019ve got some idea\u2019s but for now I think we all just want to give Jenna a good send off. We need to organize a party next week.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna\u2019s last week at the office went well. On Thursday everyone brought her gifts for being such a good boss and they had a party after lunch with three different cakes (since Jenna couldn\u2019t decide on what her favorite cake was).On Friday they said goodbye and they all gave her big long hugs, there were even a few tears shed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn\u2019t take long for Courtney to implement some much-needed changes around the office. After Jenna\u2019s announcement of her departure Courtney quickly had a suggestion box installed outside the break room with a little notepad and a pen nearby, encouraging her soon-to-be subordinates to scribble out some ways that they felt the office could be improved. Nobody really took that kind of thing seriously\u2014they\u2019d had a suggestion box before, and nothing ever got done\u2014and it was mostly just forgotten about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the construction crew arrived, everyone changed their tune quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was kicked out of the break room for a week, unable to do so much as look in the doorway. They were forced to suffer through long hours of noisy construction, stay cramped up in their cubicles, and were blocked off from the coffee machine, refrigerator, and the communal vending machine. Everyone had to go out for lunch every day for a week\u2014leading to lots of empty wallets. Courtney assured everyone that the renovations would be worth it, and even rewarded their patience by caving into the high demand for a second lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, just when it was about to become to much, the construction suddenly stopped. They had all left at five \u2018o\u2019 clock the day before and came back to a quiet workspace for what seemed like the first time in forever. There were no big burly men swinging construction supplies around, no hard rock radio drowning out their Cass and Marni, there wasn\u2019t so much as a waft of beer burp to darken their morning. Instead, it was quiet\u2014almost eerily so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHrm.\u201d Christina crinkled her brow curiously as she waddled through the front door, lumbering down the hall towards the break room, \u201cThat\u2019s weird\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody was there! Every day for the last week it seemed like there was at least one big sweaty guy clogging up the hallway and giving her an eyeball over, but now only emptiness. In fact, the only proof that those guys had been there at all was the significantly wider door\u2014painted to resemble its predecessor, though the little window that saw inside had been removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked around anxiously. Was anybody else here? Was her ordeal finally over? Could she use the break room again? The overfed office girl outstretched a plump sausage-y arm and twisted the doorhandle, wincing at the loudness of the new tumbler and hinges. Surely nobody would care if she took a little sneak peek, right? How much farther could the crew have to go before they were done anyway? It was just her getting accustomed to where she\u2014and the other ladies, of course!\u2014were going to be spending their lunches, nothing more nothing less. It wasn\u2019t like she was being\u2026 sneaky, or anything right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, Christina pushed the door inward and took a step inside. She fumbled around the wall for the familiar lightswitch. Instead of the peg-like switch she\u2019d grown accustomed to, Christina found a little shape on the wall. She slowly slid it upwards, the lights growing brighter the further she pushed it up\u2014a dimmer switch! That was sorta cool, she guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever once fully illuminated (to a level which Christie found comfortable of course) the true nature of the wondrous renovations were made known. The entire room had doubled in size somehow, with the familiar tables being spread around more comfortably instead of pressed tightly against the wall. The walls had been repainted to a more modern two-tone blue design and the floor hand been retiled in a sleek black and white, the cabinets and counters having been redone in a similarly modern style. The vending machine had been coupled with a sister vendor, alike in every way except in that Christina could tell that the duller one was the original. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina took another step inside, looking around in wonder at the completely changed room. It felt\u2026 warmer, somehow. Wait, there was an air vent in there\u2014Courtney had an AC unit installed, and it was running heat full blast! Christina couldn\u2019t help but smile as she gleefully took off her coat, resting it on a new coatrack. She waddled over to the counters to find three microwaves instead of their usual two, with two sister Starbucks coffee machines sitting side by side ready for use! Were those\u2014no, they couldn\u2019t have been. Courtney hadn\u2019t <i>possibly</i> gotten them\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like the blenders?\u201d a surly tone took Christina by surprise, \u201cWere you the one who asked for those, or was that Vicky?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina whipped around much quicker than a girl of her size should have been able to, an action that caused her stomach to sway destructively over to the far left side. Her heart jumped out of her chest as her breathing took a sudden spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourtney!\u201d she called out a little louder than she would have liked, \u201cOh my God, you scared me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir new Branch Manager had taken to her position very kindly. While Courtney never had any problems keeping herself clothed professionally beforehand, since her promotion she had been indulging a bit in her outfits. A tailor-made business suit that could have easily been tailor-made for a hippopotamus was draped neatly over her great expanse; her blimpy body colored black with little pink pinstripes running up and down her vicious curves. A pink blouse collar popped out of the jacket, the sleeves visible as Courtney\u2019s bingo wings stretched its arms to the point of distortion. Her smile swam in a sea of her second chin as she tottered forward, her heavy footsteps much louder than Christina\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell serves you right for spoiling the surprise.\u201d Courtney joked, \u201cWhat do you think? Do you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s great!\u201d Christie said emphatically, \u201cHow\u2026 how did you make it so <i>big</i> in here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I just asked the crew to knock out a wall. We stopped using that old meeting room once Jenna took over, so it was just kinda there and we just kinda needed the space.\u201d Courtney said nonchalantly, leaning on a nearby table to support her supreme heaviness, \u201cSeriously, I\u2019ve been working here for <i>years</i> and I finally just got sick and tired of not being able to <i>move</i> in this freakin\u2019 room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina watched as Courtney\u2019s great gut heaved up and down with her labored breath. She was getting out of breath from the sheer labor of just standing\u2014Christina was surprised something like this hadn\u2019t happened sooner, given how long Courtney had been so big\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it looks great, really.\u201d Christie said excitedly, \u201cWhere\u2019d you get the money for all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenna put a little aside before she left, and I just kinda\u2026 <i>found</i> the rest of it, if you can believe that.\u201d Courtney said with a shrug of her meaty shoulders, sending her massive mams up and down with them, \u201cI've got a lot more ideas that I'd like to try out; finding some time for a few more breaks for you guys, mini-fridges in your cubicles, all kinds of stuff. But for now I figured, hey, why not start off me being the boss on my best leg, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d Christina said with one last cursory glance of the break room, \u201cSo can I\u2026um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some coffee?\u201d Courtney said with a smile as she waddled forward, \u201cSure you can. Just\u2026 um\u2026 help me take off my jacket first?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The new break room was a huge hit. The ladies of the office raved about it for two whole weeks, basking in the extra space, newer appliances, and better seating. Courtney didn\u2019t stop there with implementing her ideas for improving the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe convinced everyone to stay at the office an extra half hour everyday by giving them two rest breaks and two lunches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney had an amazing knack for accounting and managing a budget. She had managed to find enough money to get mini-fridges for everyone\u2019s cubicle as well as order new comfier chairs for their desks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Victoria glanced at the clock and saw that it was time for the first break of the day. There was a chorus of groaning chairs, feminine grunts of exertion, and straining and stretching fabric as everyone headed for the breakroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky let out a sigh. Her new office chair felt so big and comfortable under her sprawling flabby butt that she almost didn\u2019t want to leave it. Plus with her minifridge stocked with chocolate protein shakes she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about keeping her gluttonous belly full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, these pumpkin frosting doughnuts are awesome!\u201d Vicky heard coming from the open door to the break room. The mention of pumpkin spice doughnuts made her mouth water. The smell of the warm fresh pastries reached her nose and Vicky perked up in her chair. The pleasing thought of eating the delicious, sweet, seasonally flavored treat captured her attention like a worm on a hook would to a fish. She rolled her seat away from her desk and leaned forward with her hands on the armrests. Her blubbery belly rolls bulged forward as they were squeezed against her lap. She tried to keep her back straight and stuck her butt out so she could get the proper leverage needed to lift her 400+ pounds of poorly conditioned flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHrr\u2026\u201d Vicky grunted as she slowly lifted out of her seat. The stitching of her skirt audibly stretched and partially ripped as it struggled to contain the massive girth of her globular overfed cheeks. The butterball secretary let out a big exhale as she finally stood on her feet. Although her new chair didn\u2019t grip around her wide pillowy hips like her old ones had, the task of getting off of her seat and overcoming the gravity of her obese bulk was still a pain in her enormous bottom. However, as much as she\u2019d prefer to stay in her seat until the end of the day, the thought of delicious doughnuts kept Vicky moving. She entered the breakroom and was happy to see that there were still plenty of doughnuts left. Whoever picked them up this morning had ordered an extra box apparently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey Vicky. What\u2019s uh\u201d Alice stopped midsentence and retracted her hand from the pastry box as Victoria\u2019s plump hands dove in the way to grab three doughnuts, one of which was quickly devoured by the young and hefty Italian girl. She closed her eyes and shuddered slightly at the heavenly flavor of the tasty confection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe break room was buzzing with enormous gluttonous women chewing and chatting. The only person in the office not there was Courtney who just happened to waddle through the widened doors at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*pant* Attention!... Whew *huff*, everyone listen up! Mute the radio please.\u201d Courtney said, using one hand to lean her heavily overfed frame against the kitchen counter. \u201cOkay this\u2019ll just take a second. So I know you gals have been working you\u2019re little buns off since I took over for Jenna. All of you have been kicking butt this week, and I feel very proud to be your boss. Anyway recently I found the time to do a little organizing of the budget and managed to free up some money. Since everyone here has been doing such good work, I figured the office deserved a reward for it. So what I decided to do with this chunk of the budget that\u2019s opened up is set it aside for a weekly shopping trip to keep this kitchen stocked with all the goodies we\u2019d like to munch on during the breaks and at lunch.\u201d There was a small round of applause from the employees. \u201cSo I just posted a piece of paper to the bulletin board that\u2019ll be our shopping list and everyone is free to write what they\u2019d like to have in here. Then on Sunday a couple of you can come with me to whatever grocery store is closest to get everything and bring it back here. That\u2019s all I have to say, everyone can go back to what they\u2026 Are those pumpkin doughnuts?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next few months, Courtney\u2019s itinerary for improving the office finally came full circle. In time she had managed to almost completely remodel the Gordge building to suit her tastes, taking great measure to ensure that her employees were getting exactly what they wanted. Jenna may have been the most benevolent boss anyone could have asked for, but Courtney had a certain way of getting things done. She was an ambitious go-getter, even this late in the game, who had more or less been watching Jenna do her job for years now. The main difference between the two was follow-through\u2014Courtney had the drive and corporate know-how to get things done, whereas Jenna was more or less content her (admittedly positive) results. Sales improved, customer feedback improved, and thus so did their funding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that money, funneled by her impressive head for business into investments and partnerships with local businesses, their branch\u2019s budget was becoming as grossly overfed as its employees. In that time, Courtney made sure to implement as many of her ideas as she could with the money that was left over; the break room was rewired with new speakers for the radio, the snacks in the vending machine switched to name brands, she remodeled everyone\u2019s cubicles and put <i>minifridges</i> in them! Morale was so high around the office that she had somehow managed to trade everyone staying an extra thirty minutes each day for an extra lunch break <i>and</i> extending their fifteens to thirties! Their local partners in the community were getting rich, the office girls were all happy as clams, and frankly the CEOs were left scratching their heads as to why they hadn\u2019t put Courtney in charge in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course all these perks came with the downside of dependency and complacency. Despite how happy everyone was, the suggestion box was usually overflowing with further suggestions on improving the office. The office chairs were considered so \u201cflimsy\u201d by many of the local Gordge employees that Courtney had finally broken down and begun ordering exclusively from the company that made her own chair, replacing everyone\u2019s one day without warning. Doorway widening was becoming less of a kindness to the heavier-set folk and more and more of a necessity. Replacing the (brand new!) fridge in the break room with something a little bigger wasn\u2019t exactly the optimum way to spend their resources, and even Courtney was sure that what food they bought specifically to keep in the break room should have lasted longer than a few days considering she\u2019d bumped up the budget\u2014twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even still, Corporate couldn\u2019t have cared less. It seemed the better she did, the more money she got thrown at her for her to do what she pleased with. Sure everyone may have been abusing the system a little bit with all these nifty perks\u2014but who could blame them?</span></div></div>",

Would you cook the little M&amp;M guy or join the sane side and let him live? Give us a call at\u2014\u201c</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe break room was the biggest hit out of Courtney\u2019s many \u201cimprovements\u201d on office life. It was chock-full of anything and everything that the gluttonous Gordge employees could ever want. Two vending machines, a phone charging station, a fridge filled with yummy treats packed to the brim with various foods and lunches. The tables had been replaced with much more sturdy and dependable ones that were promised to be able to handle any abuse given to them. Each of the three microwaves were whirring, a veritable harmony of hoggish delight as three identical meals circled slowly in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big fat ass painted floral by a stretchy spandex-polyester dress shimmied anxiously as its weight shifted from one foot to the next. The black panties beneath it were practically etched into the design, the great girth of each cheek stretched the garment to a stubborn thinness. Two and a half feet of heavy hips drew the fabric tight over a massive ass, while a pudgy avalanche of belly struggled to win for the other side. Each fold was outlined, the three distinct rolls that made up each segment of stomach perfectly traced and drawn by the clingy dress\u2014the floral blobbiness oozing onto the countertop. She outstretched one thick arm, her flabby arm wing sinking slightly as she searched the cabinet for one of those clear plastic cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNgh!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina White grunted as she fought against her own girth, weighed down and obstructed by her extreme thickness. Her spare tire rested uselessly on the countertop while her lowermost belly roll pressed uncomfortably against the wooden door. Her chubby fingers felt the thin plastic of the starbucks cup\u2014she lurched forward and grabbed at the stack before recoiling back down, cups in hand. The overfed office drone smirked self-satisfactorily at the stack, grabbing one off the top before placing the rest of them down on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled over to the coffee machine, Christina\u2019s great gut bobbed a good foot in front of her. It entered any room well before she did, and warped the flowers on her dress beyond recognition. Her mammoth mams spilled over the lip of both her bra and her dress\u2014she was practically popping right out of the thing. However she seemed to pay no mind; she had on a happy little smile as her chubby cheeks dimpled and her double chin bunched up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in the microwave wasn\u2019t hers\u2014just the one on the right. Leftovers from last night\u2019s Chinese binge with Alice and Melissa sizzling and popping in the Styrofoam container. It would make for a good lunch after the Jimmy Johns guy got here with her sandwiches, and a <i>great</i> lunch if there were any of those fudgesicles left in the freezer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina stretched out her hand to rub her belly, which purred hungrily in response to all these mental images. The big blonde sighed thickly as she waited as patiently as she could, biting into the cupcake she\u2019d bought from the snack machine to tide her over.</span></div></div>",

It dotted the corners of her mouth, getting nestled into the little nicks on her chipmunk cheeks. A few crumbles followed suit, bouncing down and settling on her vast cleavage. The pale fleshy melons pooled to either side of her enormous gut as it hung from her office chair, each arm loaded with a donut for her to shove down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez Al, you can slow down a little.\u201d Melissa (believe it or not) chastised her friend, \u201cLunch is in, like, two-point-five seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while now, it was becoming increasingly clear that Alice\u2019s weight was beginning to get out of hand. For years, Melissa had relied on her level-headed friend to reel her back in whenever she went off the deep end. Until now it had never been needed to be reciprocated, even with Alice\u2019s weight slowly overcoming Melissa\u2019s own enormity she had always managed to stay cool as far as indulgences went. But for the last few days or so, Alice had been like a woman possessed\u2014she\u2019d been eating non-stop since Monday, and even Melissa was beginning to get a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least save some for me!\u201d Melissa snatched the box away, much to the displeasure of her blimping best friend, \u201cYou\u2019re taking all the good ones\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa plunged in a chubby hand and returned with two chocolate crullers, popping the end of one into her mouth lusciously as her friend watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive\u2019em back!\u201d Alice cried out hungrily as she lunged towards Melissa, her efforts counterbalanced by the extra four hundred pounds on her mighty frame and kept her seated, \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be a jerk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot until you tell me what\u2019s got your big ol\u2019 panties in a wad.\u201d Melissa said knowingly, biting into the cruller again, \u201cYou\u2019ve been eating like crazy since Monday and I wanna know what\u2019s up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had been eating like crazy for a while now\u2014it was only just now that she was beginning to overtake Melissa\u2019s scope of reason. Alice\u2019s weight had risen to the higher regions of the four hundred pound range, nearing the big quarter-ton a little bit more every day. She was practically spherical, with a fat gut that slapped against her knees with every awkward hobble forward. Her face was still sweet and kind, though the roundness of her cheeks forced her eyes to squint slightly, and her jowls had completely enveloped her neck by this point. Alice couldn\u2019t even touch the tip of her belly anymore\u2014what with her well-padded bingo wings and the overall thickness of her sides, <i>and</i> with how big that thing had gotten lately\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Alice huffed, \u201cMy sister\u2019s coming to visit\u2026 I need comfort food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw shit, <i>Stephanie</i>?\u201d Melissa whined, curling one nostril up, \u201cJesus, here girl. You need \u2018em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith permission, Alice resumed gorging. She picked up two donuts and stacked them on top of one another, biting into them helplessly as she chewed with a mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just so\u2026 gulp\u2026 worried\u2026\u201d Alice looked down and frowned, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t seen me in a while\u2026 and you know how judgmental she is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I do.\u201d Melissa answered bitterly, biting into her cruller, \u201cIs she the one who got you that diet book for Christmas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d Alice swallowed, \u201cAnd I\u2019ve put on even <i>more</i> weight since then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa watched as Alice bit eagerly into the next few donuts. Within moments the entire box had been demolished, save for the untouched cruller Melissa still had sitting on Alice\u2019s desk. She watched as her friend leaned past her own ample side-fat to reach into the mini-fridge, whipping out a pre-packaged Starbucks Frappuccino blend. Despite her own tummy rumbling, Melissa sighed and pushed the little treat towards her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere. Eat up.

When the hell did that happen?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took an instinctive sip of her strawberry smoothie, loaded with protein and bulk-up powder for flavoring. It helped whet her tongue, but did little to discourage her rage. How had that place shut down? She was there like, <i>every</i> day giving them money for smoothies and junk! Sure it had been a little lonely in there lately, but that was no reason for them to shut down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted in her seat angrily, her belly bunching up into a pudgy pagoda as she shifted the weight on her hips. The chair groaned beneath her giant ass as it swelled to fit its seating arrangement. There was a full foot of space between the shelf of her ass and her rolling hillside of backfat, and her hips forced the arms of her swivel chair deep into her fat thighs. Vicky could no longer sit leaned over for long periods of time, nor could she comfortably reach the back of her chair without wedging its spine into her crack. This did little to discourage her delusions of a slender bod, the byproduct of going to the gym.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So getting to Fit Life wasn\u2019t exactly the easiest thing in the world to do for a girl of Vicky\u2019s size. While most women in the office were either small enough to drive standard-built cars without much of a problem or were large enough to warrant something custom-built to cater towards their bulk, Vicky was in the one-woman camp of the latter trying to accomplish the former. As such, since her car was \u201cbroken\u201d, she\u2019d been relying on her mother and other coworkers to take her to and from work until such a time that it was \u201cfixed\u201d. And since her mother was at work, her sisters were all preoccupied, and her daddy was caught in a meeting, this meant that Vicky didn\u2019t exactly have a decent ride. Even still, when she wanted something, Victoria was a woman of considerable conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow taxi dipped noticeably to the pavement as it struggled to support the intensely bottom-heavy brunette, puttering and knocking as it tried and failed to go the speed it was being directed to. The speed limit was forty, but the driver had to press hard on the gas pedal to ensure that it could keep momentum with the extra four-hundred or so pounds it had so close to its trunk. As the soon-to-be-abandoned building came into view, Vicky frantically urged the driver to stop. The yellow car stopped immediately at the entrance of the gym, whereupon Vicky attempted to wriggle herself out of her wedged position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky was easily too big to shimmy out of the back seat of the \u201csurprisingly small\u201d taxi cab. Her ass was so fat that it left almost no room for anyone else to sit next to her, and her belly rolls poured between her legs and touched the back of the cab\u2019s front seats. Her arms were too flabby to do much of anything than shake helplessly when she tried to use them\u2014it was so bad that, after a full three minutes of struggling, the cabby had to get <i>out</i> of his car and pull the super-sized secretary from between the seats of his cab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever the less, Vicky was always the unfettered. Her gym was going under, and she demanded answers! After taking a few moments to compose herself, leaning against the valiant yellow vehicle for support, Vicky trekked onward towards the entrance. She eventually reached it a sweating, huffing mess in a purple pantsuit tailor-made for a hippopotamus with a glandular disorder. Her round cheeks shiny with perspiration and glowing bright crimson, and every inch of her glistening in fresh sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d she hollered, banging on the glass, \u201cHeeey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did this for a while before somebody, presumably one of the employees remaining to help close up shop and make sure all the equipment went to the right place, finally came to see the source of the racket. The poor woman was met with Victoria, easily one of the biggest women in town, pressed against the glass double doors. Her fat belly spread like butter against the reflective material, and her ridiculous rump all but eclipsed the doorway. Her triply-chinned face looked quite angry\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 yeah, sorry we\u2019re closed.\u201d The little black-haired woman said with a mix of fabricated and genuine sympathy, \u201cSorry Victoria.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarianne, don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t be like that you... you little...!\u201d Vicky puffed, \u201cI come here like every day! How can you guys be closed?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, we served the same people over and over again. And only five of them bought premium memberships.\u201d Marianne said flatly, \u201cI guess we couldn\u2019t afford to give everyone <i>discounts at all the places they ate at to try and win premium memberships.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Vicky roared, \u201cThat, like, doesn\u2019t even\u2026 make any sense! I wanna see a manager!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019d better check out the unemployment line.\u201d Marianne said crossly, \u201cLook, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in here\u2026 so unless you wanna work up a sweat, please leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But I just bought a Gold\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne dropped the curtain over the glass, leaving Vicky with only a white backdrop to voice her complaints to. Vicky stood there for a while, dumbstruck. Where was she supposed to get her hot bod from now? It wasn\u2019t like there were any <i>other</i> gyms that gave out discounts like Fit Life did\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026 just leave, Vicky.\u201d Marianne said flatly from behind the screen, \u201cDon\u2019t make me call the cops.\u201d</span></div></div>",

They both had proud noses, big blue eyes, and stunning features. Whereas Alice\u2019s features were smoother though, Stephanie\u2019s were characterized by their comparative roughness. Her eyebrows were thicker, her nose just a bit larger, and there was a slight cleft carved into her chin. She was still gorgeous and, in fact, these features managed to fool most people into thinking that <i>she</i> was the older sister between the two of them. Something that Alice had hated the most before her almost 400 pound weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it\u2026 <i>really</i> wasn\u2019t hard to tell that they were sisters anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping off of the plane was a wide woman, and Gordge-sized at that. This wasn\u2019t just your regular fat lady, this woman was easily the size of girl that Alice and Melissa had grown accustomed to. Somehow that made them feel <i>more</i> wary of Melissa\u2019s descent. Because, obviously, no matter how hard they blinked their eyes or did double takes\u2014that double-wide lady was Alice\u2019s sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was colossal\u2014unlike anything Alice or her gal pal had ever seen outside of their workplace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie\u2019s elephantine legs buckled and ached as she lugged her meaty mass out into the terminal.

The last time that they had seen each other, Stephanie had been so thin! Lithe! Active!

Both had very conventionally pretty faces, with elegant noses and big blue eyes. Alice\u2019s eyebrows were a bit more trim than her sister\u2019s, whereas Stephanie had the slightest cleft chiseled into her chin. They were about the same height, and more or less the same hair color. Stephanie tended to highlight the blonde in her hair a bit more than Alice ever had, but otherwise they could have been basically indistinguishable\u2014one would have never guessed that Alice was the older sister between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, <i>should</i> have been indistinguishable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest key difference between the Gellar sisters was that, despite their similar facial structure and upbringing, the two couldn\u2019t have looked more different as far as body sizes were concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was a big, pillowy hippo who had only grown bigger and more pillowy in the coming months since she had seen her sister last. She was barely able to stand without growing winded, with her great belly seizing in place as she breathed heavily from the exertion of supporting her own massive body right there in the middle of the airport. Meanwhile Stephanie was a lean, muscular blonde of considerably smaller size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie looked around the airport\u2014but not for very long. The familiar sight of her humongous older sister stuck out like a sore thumb. Likewise, Alice had no trouble picking out the familiar face of her sister even through the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Stephanie?\u201d Alice ventured timidly as she took a few heaving steps away from Melissa and towards the slightly version of herself, \u201cIt\u2019s, uh\u2026 it\u2019s Alice! Bet you\u2026 um\u2026 didn\u2019t recognize me, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie, taking a good look up and down at her sister, said\u2026</span></div></div>",

She loves the donuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie turned to Melissa. Her eyes very smoothly and quickly rolled over the expanse of her fat-with just a blink of skepticism, someone would have to be peering intently into her eyes to notice it. But if noticed, her expression almost said, <i>Sure you try, lardass.</i> \"Melissa, pleasure to meet you.\" Stephanie said. \"Sis talks about you all the time in her e-mails.\" Melissa smiled in return. \"Your sister is an absolute treat at the office, pleasure to meet you as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shook hands and traded hugs, the sight about as absurd and full of contrast as could be seen. A comparative rod that was Stephanie's chiseled form being engulfed by the bean-bag-like body of Mel. The hug was brief and courteous- Melissa could feel Stephanie's subtle physical hints leading to an eagerness to pull away from the hug. \"Come on, jet-lag's an ugly slut, let's get some drinks!\" spoke Melissa. \"Couldn't have said it better myself.\" said Stephanie. \"Come on, sis. I can show you how good I've gotten at Quarters since last time we met.\" Alice smiled. \"Sure, let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humanoid, inflated forms of Melissa and Alice chugged behind Stephanie's easy strides. Steph couldn't help but hear the pained huffing that came from the back and right where Alice was walking. \"You alright, sis?\" she asked. Alice huffed a reply, \"Yeah... Just... A little winded..\" Stephanie slowed her pace noticeably, visibly attempting to slow her pace in front of her sister. Of course, Melissa was huffing just a little louder- Stephanie could plainly hear. A subtle jerk of the head to the left- the kind a person naturally makes when identifying a sound. Melissa could tell- she turned her face aside to Alice, to gauge her reaction. Alice turned to her as well. Their faces were mutually uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio passed through the doors to the outside of the airport, Stephanie turning with a chuckle. \"Woop, why am I leading? You guys know where your car is.\" \"True, true.\" replied Melissa. The walk was silent from there on, until they reached Melissa's car, which she raised her key-fob and unlocked with the 'ch-chnk' of the locks disengaging.  Alice hung on the passenger side, opening, and leaning into the seat, pulling to a seat. She pulled her other leg into the foot of the car, only to be met with the obstacle that was her thighs. Her other foot dangled in the threshold, Stephanie preparing to get into the car until she saw her sister struggle to try and pull the door closed. With a look of bewilderment, Stephanie looked over her sister's blubbery side, dangling out of the threshold and the door unable to compress the fat on its own. \"Need some help, -big- sis?\" Alice could not contain the sigh that came before a \"Uh, yeah, if you would.\" Melissa pulled her door closed as she rocked the car, shimmying further to the right. Stephanie couldn't help but behold how absurdly fat these two were. Alice and Melissa's blubber was nearly touching, but it gave Stephanie an idea. \"Shimmy further in, Al.\" Alice did so, and Steph was able to shut the door. She went to her own seat, and was able to pull her own seatbelt down with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister and Melissa were not as fortunate. Melissa struggled for a moment, but pulled it down a bit easier-into a seatbelt extender. There was no such invention in the passenger side, as Alice struggled. Stephanie watched the metal buckle jimmy ever closer to the slot. Alice was an inch short, but the belt had no more slack to give. Melissa spoke up with a sigh. \"Steph, get the other extender for me, will ya?\" Alice interrupted. \"No, I don't think I need it. Sis, just help me.\" Stephanie tugged and tugged with her might- it only got the buckle a bit closer- it tickled the rim of the slot, but no click. Stephanie groaned. \"Suck that giant thing in.\" Alice groaned, \" I -AM-!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie exhaled sharply. Steph dug around in front of her, but found the extender. \"This is a whole other level, -big- sis.\" Alice groaned. \"I know...I know I'm fat, Steph.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first thing that hit Steph about the place was the wooden interior, and the incessant smell of peanut dust and booze. There were the usual assortment of characters- a sloppy mid-aged man with a receding amber hairline and a beer gut, a few college-aged girls, and not many besides save for Stephanie and the tubby twosome who had to come in one at a time by merit of their wideness. Their weighty, ponderous steps resounded, drawing eyes from across the bar. Alice began to cringe, but memories of the night with Courtney came up. She held all of her bulk up with pride, as did Melissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a seat on the other end of the bar, farther away from the mid-aged man. \"This place is like the Daydrink Saloon back home.\" remarked Stephanie. \"Yeah,\" replied Alice, \"Except there's no Edna and her scream-y husband.\" Stephanie gave a hand wave. \"Pssht. Don't shit-talk my mans Alvin. Besides, Edna's a hoe anyway.\" Alice and Melissa chuckled as the thin blonde bartender speaking to the middle-aged man gave him a remark and walked over to them. \"Hey, ladies, what can I get ya's?\" he inquired in a light Brooklyn accent. Melissa spoke up first. \"Gimme J.D.\" The bartender nodded and strode handily to the tap and the paired shelves, grabbing a bottle of Jack Daniel's and a shot glass. \"Uhh, Corona.\" The bartender put down the bottle of Daniel's whiskey and picked up a bottle of Corona. \"Lime or no?\" he asked. \"Lime.\" replied Stephanie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Melissa. \"Straight Jack? I thought you were driving.\" Melissa spoke up. \"You guys know how to drive too.\" Alice began the infant stages of a laugh, but choked it down and replaced it with a winding sigh. \"Well, guess I'm the Designated Driver. Uhh, just give me a coke.\" Before the bartender could reach for the drink cooler, Stephanie barked out, \"-Diet-. Coke.\" Alice sighed and spoke up. \"Regular coke.\" Stephanie threw up her hands. \"Giiirl. That stuff has as many calories as a snickers bar, and more sugar. Did you even wipe your ass with that diet book?\" Alice shrugged as the bartender slid their drinks onto the bar-top. \"I tried it for January, but it was Paleo and I love donuts to death.\" Stephanie jabbed at Alice's doughy, expansive midsection which rubbed and spilled an inch or so onto the bar, \"If only they felt the same.\" Alice rubbed at the jabbed flesh, contained in its jiggling by the wooden counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa spoke up. \"Oh, if it's not too much of a bother, can we get some Nachos?\" Steph began to roll her eyes until she began to accept the situation- she had a bit of a nacho craving anyway. \"Sure, be back in a moment.\" Stephanie spoke up as the thin blonde man disappeared behind the thick metal door, the mid-aged man stared into his liquor, and the college-aged girls snickered about something. \"Oh, god. You guys wouldn't believe the shit-show that was this flight.\" Alice turned keenly to her sister, speaking up. \"Oh? Do tell.\" Melissa sipped on her Jack, mumbling something to the affirmative before putting down her shot. \"Yeah, go on.\" Stephanie began to ramble as she picked up her beer. \"So, I get on this plane. It takes, like, <i>forever</i> to get up to the pilot's... happy place or whatever, and, stupid me, I didn't -go- before we left the terminal.\" Alice and Melissa nodded at the story, as Stephanie went on, Alice interjecting, \"Oh, gawd.\" Stephanie nodded in reply. \"It gets worse. So we finally get to cruising speed, and the seatbelt light turns on. I get up to try to head to the -only- bathroom on this god-forsaken plane, and guess what's blocking it? The damn service cart!\" Both Alice and Melissa gave a groan of sympathetic annoyance. Melissa spoke up. \"The hell? Why would they bring it up from the -back- if that's where the only bathroom is? And what hell-spawned company makes an airplane with bathrooms only on <b>one end!?</b>\" Stephanie rolled her head. \"Satan's Toenanils, Incorporated, apparently!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bartender slid smoothly out as the heavy metal door, which weightily slung open. In one smooth motion, he slid the basket of nachos onto the counter-top, with two containers of cheese stacked on the chips. Steph continued, pausing only for a brief \"Thankyou,\" and resumed, \" And, the -only possible way- to the bathroom past the cart gets stopped up as some ancient geezer stops her for a coffee, which she takes forever to pour and hand to him!\" Alice spoke up. \"You should have shoved your way past them, that's, like, a national emergency.\" Melissa spoke up immediately. \"Did you pee your pants?\" The trio broke out in giggles. Alice reached for a nacho and uncapped one of the cheese containers, attempting to speak through her giggles. \"The first thing....you could think to ask... Did you pee your pants..\" Alice munched on the nacho chip as her sister joined her in munching on the chips, and Melissa joined as she polished off her shot of whiskey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio got back to Melissa's car, Alice sliding into the driver's seat with another can of coke. \"Sis, you -really- ordered a can to go.\" Alice nodded. \"Yes, yes I did.\" Stephanie groaned. \"Bitch, don't you groan, you ate like half the nachos!\" Stephanie giggled. \"Difference is, I'm not, like, five hundred pounds! I got wiggle room!\" Alice bit back. \"Nothin' to wiggle in all that room, girlie!\" Melissa cooed in amusement, \"Oooooo!\" \"It's not a joke, Al.\" griped Stephanie. \"You were barely, like...What, still in the three-hundreds last time I saw you! You were pretty tubby, but shit, girl! How can you just stay this big?\" Alice grunted and cranked the car. \"That's not a rhetorical question,\" poked Stephanie, \"We're going to the gym tomorrow.\" Alice groaned. \"Fiiiiine. If for no other reason than to spend some time with you.\"</span></div></div>",

It was technically an elastic waist, and in theory it should have been form-fitting. In reality, though, the flowing, blue-and-black marbled skirt only had so much room in the waist, and every inch was being taken up by Courtney's expanding, rolling gut. Although Christina and Alice had been targeted hard by the nearly predatory changes that Courtney had made, Courtney herself had begun to feel real damage to her ever-expanding waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her skirt which she had bought barely the week before the renovations as a flowing and loose but tasteful skirt had now become a constraining nightmare which felt like it was burrowing through her massive stomach. Its tightness could no longer belie the fat below the clothing, and every waking moment, thick folds of fat stuck out and jiggled with every breath and movement, conspicuous as they joined with the continuously expanding shelf of fat above Courtney's belly button that no longer was content to be contained by the skin-tight blouse, and even on an 'empty' stomach now hung out at least an inch and a half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney sighed at her clothing woes, and adjusted her blouse, trying in vain to stretch it back over her midriff, which it refused to do. Her black blouse, which once smoothly transitioned to her lower half and concealed her midriff now had become an airtight crop-top which rose and fell with each shallow breath. The short sleeves revealed another area of Courtney's body that had been inflated by fat; her arms. Courtney's bicep was flabby and fat before, but now it would be inadequate to compare it to a ham. The forearm and the attached shoulders were pumped with fat by the injection of endless calories, the very top of the arm bursting from the choking sleeve like dough emerging from a can. Courtney's sausage-like fingers were always in motion, whether to type on her keyboard, or to retrieve her weakness- a Boston Creme Doughnut from the break room, now always fresh by her decree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such changes on top of her pre-existing, already hoggish work environment, it was no wonder to anyone keeping track that Courtney had climbed into the five-hundreds. Courtney grunted as she hefted her massive form up from her chair, with the aid of the ever-steady desk, and she thundered towards the break room with a mixture of a pant and a grunt. With a bulk of over five hundred pounds and climbing, Courtney shook the floor as she walked. Every worker on her floor heard the tremulous reverberations that resulted from Courtney's treads. She entered the break-room, populated additionally by Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hey, Court!\" barked out Victoria. Courtney nearly winced at the loudness of Victoria's voice. \"Hey, Vick.\" replied Courtney in a cool, calm voice. Courtney's thunderous footsteps traced towards the state-of-the-art coffee machine, and poured herself a Latte- a complex process reduced to the push of a button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney looked at Victoria as her hot drink was poured. She must have gained nearly sixty pounds- now hovering in the high four-hundreds, but not quite in the four-nineties. Victoria's gains had recently come mostly in her plump rear-end, but not to be outdone by her other parts of her body, her belly still was quite sizable. It simply wasn't to the standard of Courtney or Alice. \"That project you've been working on, how's it coming?\" Victoria raised a brow. \"Huh? Oh, yeah, uh... That, uh...\" Courtney kept up her stare. Few could browbeat by eyes alone like she could. \"Uh...\" Victoria had drawn an utter blank. Courtney gave a <i>tsk, tsk</i> as she spoke up. \"You know, Vick, this break room isn't meant to replace actually working.\" Victoria crossed her immense arms and shook her blubbery face in indignation. \"I'm working!\" she barked. \"I'm just taking a well-deserved break!\" Courtney rolled her eyes. \"Ya' better. The deadline is next monday's work-day, and if we don't have it, Jenna's gonna visit us to shove a heel up my ass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria shoved a donut down her gullet, and spoke up. \"Dunno if she could.\" Courtney turned to her. \"What do you mean, are you saying that my butt is too fat, or that Jenna is too fat to shove her foot up it?\" Victoria gave for an answer a knowing grin and a shrug. Courtney and Victoria chuckled together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney treaded off, while Victoria gulped down a swallow of her coffee in nervousness- Court wasn't nearly as complacent as Jenna, she actually expected work to be done, and to not have the day be one long feast of donuts and snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria returned her greedy, plump, bejeweled hand to the donut box. She'd get back to work. She just needed a donut or two... or maybe the rest of this box.</span></div></div>",

She feared to remove her hand to wipe her vision clear for fear of losing her grip and falling off the tread-mill. Suddenly, a voice seemed to burst the veil. \"Sis, c'mon, you're only going  three-point-five!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie had insisted on putting a heavy emphasis on cardio today- she had insisted that it was necessary to counteract the ills of the many sugary, calorie-laden sodas that Alice had drank in place of alcohol. Alice tried to reply, to make an excuse for her horrifying lack of stamina, but all that came out was blustered mumbling. Her lungs were on fire and her legs felt like every muscle fiber was about to pop off. Her jiggling pillars of lard that were legs wavered with each step. It was almost comical to see this immense wad of belly-heavy fat waver left and right on the treadmill if it didn't seem so absolutely dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's voice called from the bench. \"You can always join me in my exercise, Al. I call it doing fuck-all and not giving a shit about cardio.\" Alice blustered more sweat. Stephanie called out to Melissa. \"You know, it'd be a good idea to join us. Never such a thing as too big to exercise.\" \"Yeah, but there's such a thing as not giving a shit about exercise.\" Stephanie spoke up. \"Suit yourself. It'll be your money you've got to spend to get bigger pants.\" A few moments later, and Alice heard the sound of another treadmill cranking up beside her. Alice straddled the track and finally wiped her eyes. Melissa, <b>the</b> Melissa was in fact on a treadmill. Alice spoke up after catching her breath, just before resuming her work-out. \"Am I seeing things, Mel, or are you actually working out?\" Melissa spoke up. \"Sue me. I'm allowed to get on a treadmill. Besides, it's not like I'm eating kale and drinking kombucha now. I was just getting bored on the bench.\" Alice giggled, with Melissa speaking up shortly after, after barely a few seconds already beginning to get out of breath from just going three miles per hour, \"Fuck you...I'll kick your ass...Al..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie turned to Alice as she wiped her eyes and resumed walking. \"Gotta admit, Al, I'm impressed you're keeping up. You're struggling but you're going.\" Alice turned to her sister, and spoke, saying, \"Not like I'm...immobile...yet...\" She wheezed out a laugh and so did Stephanie. Five long, punishing minutes followed the thirty Alice and Stephanie had been on the treadmill. Melissa was horrifically out of breath, her mouth gaping and literally gasping for breath, as Alice and Stephanie's treadmills finally wound down to a stop. \"Ohhhthankgod,\" Mel mumbled out, as she stood on the sides and stopped her treadmill, before hopping off the treadmill and wobbling towards the water fountain ahead of the pack, chugging down a steady stream of water for a solid minutes. Alice and Stephanie both exchanged looks of bewilderment. Alice came up to the exasperated, bloated form of Melissa and patted her on the shoulder. \"Ya did good, Mel.\" Melissa scoffed. \"Don't bet on it. I don't know how you nuts do this, let alone how..\" She pointed at Stephanie, \"This one has fun doing it!\" Stephanie spoke up. \"The trick is to do it <i>more.</i>\" Alice hitched up her hands, clawing them like an old, evil crone, and spoke in a faux-raspy voice. \"More, more, yes, my pretties!\" Stephanie giggled and picked up the act. \"Sooon, my diabolical plan to have you lose <b>ALLL</b> of that weight will be complete!\" Melissa shook her head. \"Y'all are fuckin' nuts.\" Alice and Stephanie broke down laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Alice were soon led to a bench with a bar suspended by a tether to a stack of numbered weights, all on top of one another. \"This is a lat pulldown, it helps with your back n' stuff.\" Stephanie spoke. She then pulled herself to a seat and demonstrated. The stack was set at a daunting 150, and stephanie pulled the bar down to her chest, her muscular back flexing in the strain. Stephanie went on, completing this maneuver nine more times before letting the bar slide up before catching it, pulling herself up and indicating the seat. \"Give 'er a try, Mel.\" Melissa shrugged. \"Okay, but I'm toning that weight down.\" Melissa pulled to a seat and removed the pin from the stack of weights, shifting it up to a weight labeled '30.' Stephanie handed the bar to Melissa, who carefully took it, and awkwardly pulled the bar down to just above her great bulk, made even wider by her sitting position, sticking out somewhere short of half a meter either way. Melissa grunted as she repeated the maneuver about eight more times. Alice and Stephanie looked with pride as the blob of fat that was Melissa was actually lifting weights. Melissa gritted her teeth, pulled the bar down one more time, and then let the bar ascend, with a loud 'Thunk' resounding from the stack of weights. She stood up and lifted her flabby arms, flexing. \"Wooo!\" she whooped. Alice and Stephanie gave her a high-five. \"I think I can actually get used to lifting stuff. Just keep me off that torture machine.\" Stephanie and Alice chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's turn came, and she was able to move the weights down about 20 more. Both Alice and Melissa went about twice more before they were properly worn out. As the trio left the gym, sweaty but satisfied, Stephanie patted both of the blubbery women's shoulders. \"You know, you two aren't half as bad as I thought you were gonna do.\" She thought, long and hard, as Alice gave a reply. \"Aw, thanks, sis. I appreciate. We can head back to my place and I can cook something.\" Stephanie spoke up. \"You know what? Let's head to a buffet place- you gals deserve it.\" Alice and Melissa looked at each other with eyes of wonder. Stephanie- THAT Stephanie- had just offered to take them to a buffet. \"Yes! Thank you, sis!\" spoke Alice as she bear-hugged her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie returned the fierce hug as best as she could around Alice's great bulk. She felt pride in her sister's hard work that day, but another part of her was quietly whispering to her that maybe it was best to let Alice be as she wanted to be. It was a part further on the edge of her psyche, though- she still believed with most of her heart that Alice and Melissa both ought to keep at the gym.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Victoria giggled with glee as she watched a video on her computer. Having this much fun ought not to be allowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Victoria, it more-or-less wasn't, however. Earlier that day, Courtney'd laid into her about her work. She thought she heard some thunderous footsteps from the office where her mind approximated Courtney was stationed, and she figured she ought to at least -look- like she was working. She tabbed over- she'd watch that other video she'd slated to 'watch later' in a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaced before her eyes was a rolling, nigh-endless spreadsheet. Courtney's task was to account for company expenses for new acquisitions as well as taking into account money gained from subsidy companies. Courtney felt frozen. The amount of space on the sheet actually taken up by her work could be covered by two hands. Nearly the whole screen was blank, and she had to dig through the expenditures of Gordge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria sighed and mumbled, \"Jeeezus, christ...\" She tabbed out and looked at her browser. Her initial intention was to swap over to the corporate bank account on another tab, but she saw the alluring draw of one just before, the bright emblem of her favorite blog website, with a notification next to it- a new post! Victoria clicked on it. Anything to put off the monster that was the unfinished monster that she had barely started. Her eyes poured over the text of the blogger. The warm, inviting style that this globe-trotting, enviable writer had wrote in informed Victoria of foreign locales, complete with pictures and amazing descriptions of all types, from the evening glow of sunset clashing with the light of Paris all the way to the serene, rolling Mekong river in Vietnam stretching like an azure serpent along the verdant, lush jungles of that land. It took Victoria away from this office for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat exact thought reminded her- didn't she remember a great post they'd made about Prague? They had a funny story about a night in a bar, and she had to find that again! It gave her a gut-laugh just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe subconciously reached for her snack bag. Next to procrastination, subconscious snacking was one of Victoria's gold-medal sports. She could do anything and power through months' supplies of various sweet, salty, and sour snacks. In fact, every tip or type at the keyboard was followed by her other hand in a snack bag. To sit near Victoria while working was to hear an endless stream of crunching, munching, and occasionally burping from sips of soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a fist-ful of cheese snacks and crammed them into her mouth as she glanced at a title. Finally, there it was! She read through the post- the whole rolling story of the writer going from a few drinks of beer to running into the bar's tough guy, to winning a fight with said tough guy by jamming their thumb up his butt. Victoria rolled with laughter- that part brought her back to this post at least twice a week, but it was always funny to her, not just the event itself but the way it was built up, the description of the tough guy- it was great! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard shuffling of feet and a lot of movement beyond her office. She turned, to see what the commotion was all about, and saw the workers with their things moving. It occurred to her to check the time. It had gone from returning from the break room at two all the way to five o'clock! She had blown every minute of that looking at the blog and watching videos!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and wrapped up her bag, grabbed her stuff, and pondered what to do as she put effort onto her desk to lift her fat body from her chair.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina sighed in contentment. Finally, the workday was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched her great, flabby arms as she wheeled her over-taxed chair backwards, leaning back as she did so. She was careful not to apply too much pressure- there had been an unfortunate time or two that she'd relaxed too hard and tipped the chair over, her massive form still in it. As she leant back up and prepared to turn off her computer and grab her things, she heard Victoria's voice as her eyes hit Victoria's greatly inflated form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was surprised by Victoria's sudden appearance. She grasped at her chest as she involuntarily gasped. \"Vickie, damn girl, you scared me!\" Victoria did not reply, she merely pouted. \"Courtney's deadline is killing me,\" she sadly spoke, each word dripping with a mixture of confusion and frustration. Christina raised a brow. \"Deadline? Oh, the accounting thing? That's due soon. Do you got it?\" Victoria shook her head desperately. \"NO!\" She carried on in rapid succession, \"NO, I DON'TGODDITBECAUSETHERE'STOOMUCHWORKIT'SKILLINGME,\" Victoria's litany was to continue, but Christina raised a hand and stated firmly and loudly, \"Stop it, stop it. You're not making sense.\" Victoria hyperventilated and took a seat. Christina spoke up. \"Geeez, girl. This is killing you. Go out and grab a bite, I can just pull some overtime.\" Victoria's eyes lit up. \"Ohmygawd, ohmygawd! Thank you!\" She embraced Christina's greatly inflated form, who embraced back. Christina patted Victoria's blubbery back. She gave three more pats in quick succession to let Victoria know she could let go. Victoria held on for a beat, then released. \"See you later, gal. Thank youu!\" Christina smiled and waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Christina opened up the file, thinking it was just some light work to polish up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock of the horrifically unfinished report nearly stopped Christina's heart, to an almost literal extent. She could do little but glare at the amount of undone work as she clutched at her heart, which soon returned to its normal rapid pace. There was almost nothing done on this report! There was barely one or two rows filled in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed and got up. She returned a few minutes later with the remaining store of donuts of the extant box that was on the break room table, and a mug of strong, black coffee. She put herself to the task, taking in a deep draught of coffee before diving into the document. It became a rhythm, thumb-alt, pinky-left tab. A flurry of key-strokes, then an enter. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Christina broke the monotony with donuts and sips of coffee. Time dissapeared into the void of monotony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClack-clack-clack-clack. Nom. Nom. Clack-Clack-Clack. Clack-Clack-Clack. Slurp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina continued like this for an indeterminate amount of time. She reached for her coffee. The weight was suspiciously low. She leant the cup up. Nothing. She groaned. She reached for a donut, and munched on it. She slowed down, trying to stay focused on the work. She heard footsteps and the sound of creaking wheels down the hall. Soon, the form of the janitor, a tall black man appeared in the doorway. He spoke up. \"Miss? You know it's two at night?\" Christina chuckled, and spoke up. \"Yeah... yeah, I know.. I gotta get this done..\" The man shook his head, and spoke up. \"Alllriiight, you know how to get out..\" Christina nodded as the man slid out of sight with his cart, shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was able to go on a bit further. The time weighed on her. It felt like it was just five when Victoria came in, but the document was nearly done. She had to take a moment to get up. She applied leverage to the table, and her legs shook. Plying herself with caffeine and sugar could only get herself so far on artificial stimulants. This was a moment of driving willpower, though. She -needed more donuts and coffee. She was almost done. She could see the bottom of the page. Her legs tried to surrender, punishment for her physical neglect, the pounds of lard jiggling under the strain of standing under such little awareness, but she would not be denied her coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's massive form trudged wearily through the corridors. Her evenly-distributed fat shook like tree-limbs in the wind, by their sheer volume and buoyancy. She took a moment to look out the windows. The black of the sky was broken by the city lights glinting like the reflection of a sky that might be in a lightless city, lights of almost any color against the pure blackness of the sky with racing pale lights coursing along the highways like yellow-white blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a moment where reality felt purest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina returned to her desk with a mug of coffee, and another whole box of donuts. The monotony resumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClack-clack. Nom, nom. Clack-clack-clack-clack-clack-clack-clack. Slurrrp. Clack-Clack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coffee urged her onwards. More cells, faster. The little white boxes filled with thin black text, dollar signs. She needed a few more rows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed a pale grey hue in the window behind the screen as she filled the very last box. She ate a few more donuts from the box. Out of interest, she double-checked. There were still a few more. She sipped her coffee as she watched the paleness of the 4 A.M sky turn to the hot orange of 5 A.M. She rubbed at her drum-tight blouse. It felt a bit too tight- she looked. Surely enough, the amount of coffee she'd drank and the donuts she'd eaten had bloated her stomach to a size considerably greater than her normal sized stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, and quite a bit more of coffee later, Victoria arrived at the office. Christina waddled wearily past her and spoke. \"You're welcome.\" Victoria simply smiled and spoke. \"Thank youuuu!\" She then noticed the deep sleepiness and slight resent in Christina's eyes. \"Christie...how long have you been here?\" Christie blinked a few times, and spoke flatly, \"All night.\" Victoria's eyes went wide. She walked away and mumbled a \"Sorry.\" as Christina clocked out. She turned and went to her car. She was going to take a -few- days off. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bell on the door of the Opal Ox Chinese Buffet rang as first, the mammoth blonde and black-haired forms of Alice and Melissa entered before Alice's thin blonde sister. Alice huffed and puffed. \"Hooh. Why'd you have to park so far, sis?\" Steph rolled her eyes. \"Oooh, pity you. You had to walk a whole fifty feet.\" The thin asian woman appeared before the trio. Her neutral face belied a weariness, only hinted at by a chuckle. \"Heyy, Alice.\" Alice chuckled. \"Hey, Annie!\" Stephanie stared at Alice. The look told- she had great suspicion over her sister's fast recognition by the waitress. \"I'll take you to your table.\" spoke Annie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio waddled, or walked, to their table. Stephanie spoke up. \"You seem pretty well acquainted with this place.\" Alice spoke up. \"Hey, a girl's gotta eat, Steph.\" Stephanie decided against saying anything else- she knew Alice was trying, or so it seemed. They finally came to their table, a nicely placed table by a corner window, with a view out onto the green lawn in front of the restaurant, with a four-way intersection just beyond, the restaurant being right on one corner. The group sat down at the table. Annie spoke quickly. \"Alice, coke... Uh, you, ma'am?\" She indicated towards Melissa with her pen. \"Uh, same.\" She indicated at Stephanie. \"Diet coke.\" She nodded as she scribbled, and spoke. \"The buffet is open, don't let me stop you.\" She rapidly paced away from Alice, who spoke up. \"Thank you!\" All three got up and shuffled away to the buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's mind was already racing. She raced by the steamed vegtables for their more attractive cousin- the egg rolls placed next. She took the tongs through their paces, grabbing three, then four, then another three egg rolls. Melissa was caught behind Stephanie. She expected quick access, but surprise overtook her face as Stephanie remained at the egg rolls for a good thirty seconds, piling egg rolls onto her plate. She stepped up, and there were a measly four remaining. \"Damn, girl, you guys are some egg roll fiends!\" Stephanie chuckled. \"We both got the egg roll gene.\" Both her and Alice raced to pile their plate. Crab Rangoon, Fried rice, teriyaki chicken on a stick, sweet and sour chicken, the plates were stacked almost to a comical extent, Stephanie's plate actually managed to top Melissa's in height. As they arrived at the table, Melissa didn't fail to express her shock. \"Damnn, girl! How the hell? That stacking is beautiful!\" Stephanie smiled as she put the plate down. \"I played college softball, we get HAWNGRY.\" Alice mimicked shoving food into her mouth a moment before actually committing the act herself. Melissa ate quickly, but not at the speed that Alice and Stephanie dug in. Melissa wasn't saying anything, until Stephanie and Alice hadn't come up for breath, or pulled their heads off their plates in a solid minute. \"Are you girls even breathing!?\" Alice nodded and spoke, muffled by the food. \"Nose breathing,\" before returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The plate of food which would normally take several minutes to slog through even for a girl the size of Melissa, and it was already nearly gone in under two- scratch that, Stephanie's was already clean, a split second before Alice managed to finish hers. \"Awwh, damnit!\" spoke Alice. Stephanie cackled. \"Time for round two!\" Alice got up, physically sweating and her shirt beginning to burgeon to a significant proportion of its full capacity, and her great, heavy belly beginning to shake outside of the bounds of the bottom of the shirt as Alice jogged to the buffet. The staff became visibly exasperated and entertained- absolute gluttons like this were once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to see. The second plates were equally piled high. Melissa began to lack the words, and was barely on her second plate by the time Alice and Stephanie had begun their third plate. By this point, slim, trim Stephanie had a taut, stuffed belly that hung out a good six inches, and Alice's massive gut was straining her shirt which was beginning to ride up from just below her gut to her belly button. By contrast, Melissa's shirt was barely strained. By the time Melissa's shirt was beginning to show real damage, Alice and Steph were on their most egregious violation; the dessert plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey returned with obscenely rich hills of powdered donuts on top of ice cream which layered atop small dessert cakes, which were encrusted with almond cookies. Stephanie's collar was lined with sweat, Alice's shirt had ridden up to below her breasts, her great swinging gut rolling atop her knees as she pulled wearily to a seat opposite her sister. The two were on a final, slow run, and their full stomachs began to show. They winced in pain at how full their stomachs were, but dutifully ate through their dessert plates. At one point, Alice physically gritted her teeth and moaned in pain, and stephanie ate the last piece of her dessert plate, and passed out. Melissa spoke up. \"Oh, my god, Steph!\" Alice waved at her. \"Sh's j'st....\" Annie stepped up. The fairly dim setting sun had turned to ink-black night. \"Okay, ladies, is time to go.\" Melissa spoke. \"I'll get the bill.\" Alice nodded, as Annie looked at the two and muttered something in mandarin. She called to the kitchen, and what seemed like the whole staff came out with two wheelchairs. They teamed up on Alice, almost all of them grabbed a piece of her massive, jiggling, lardy body which had outgrown her shirt, and her seated stomach rolled over her knees. The sweating, whale-like form of Alice was hefted by every fat part of her body. The chinese staff groaned, one of them visibly could not bear Alice's weight as he had to heft her up by her back fat, but by some miracle, they managed to fit Alice into the wheelchair which seemed impossibly big on its own, but just correctly sized for the impossibly obese woman who now sat in it. A smaller one was reserved for Stephanie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen staff attempted to cram Alice into the car, but to no avail. They exerted and tried to fit her in, but her fat stomach was too distended to fit into the passenger seat. They wearily dropped her into the back-seat, wiping sweat from their brows. Melissa herself could barely fit behind the wheel, but Alice had bloated her stomach so extensively by her binge that it was lodged firmly into the seat in front of her. Melissa pulled up towards Alice's home, but was troubled. She didn't want to have to pay for an ambulance to wheel Alice back into her home, so she decided the only solution was to park for the night, and sleep in the car. She kept the air conditioning running, and did her best to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina sat in the break room, rubbing at her temple while downing her fifth cup of coffee that day, and her fifteenth donut. She'd spent the last day sleeping, and she'd spent that night awake, and her sleep schedule needed some re-adjusting. A pair of rumbling feet entered the break room, and about a foot before the rest of them entered, Alice's massive protruding belly entered the room, tight as a drum against even the free-form black gown-like dress she was wearing, still taut from the last night's absurd binge. \"Damn, Al! That dress!\" spoke Christina as Melissa's similarly bloated form followed Alice into the room. It began to dawn on both Melissa and Christine that Alice was, if not right at melissa's level, just behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyy, Christie.\" spoke Melissa. Her eyes widened with concern as she cast a glance at Christine's sleepless form. \"Girl, you alright? You don't seem yourself.\" Christine groaned. \"I had to stay here all night the other night because Vicky doesn't understand how to do work on time.\" Alice wobbled over towards Christine and patted her on the shoulder, speaking through her pants from the exhaustion of walking from the elevator to the break room. \"Sorry, girl. You'll...You'll get you some sleep tonight.\" Christie nodded. \"Thanks, babe.\" She patted Alice on the small of her back. The action created two 'smacks' that jiggled Alice's gargantuan gut from her back fat rolls halfway through her massively blubbery torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina couldn't help but feel some extra fat on Alice's frame. \"Not to be a bitch, but you're feeling a bit thicker than normal, girl. What's the deal?\" Alice's mouth began twitching down- but then her old conversation with Courtney rolled over in her mind- <i>No need to feel ashamed. You be you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just had some fun at the Opal Ox with Mel and my Sis last night.\" Christina replied in slight wonder, \"You never told me you had a sister! Is she a big girl like us, or..\" Melissa chuckled and shook her head, joined by Alice, as she said, \"Ohh, fuck no. She's a fit nut, and she never lays off Al about her weight.\" Alice nodded. \"It's been a bit hard the past week, but I think she's starting to come around to who I am.\" Christina smiled and chuckled. \"That's good, at least! I can't imagine having a sister like that- my dad's hard on me enough about my weight as it is.\" Melissa chimed in, \"For me it's Aunt BeeAnne. She's passive-aggressive about that, won't shut up about,\" she intoned in a loud, nasally voice, \"Yeah, I don't eat those things. Calorie booombs!\" and her face turned to one of anger as she continued on in her normal voice, \"And she has the audacity to take out the scale if we're ever in the same house together. Fuckin' bitch.\" Alice nodded with an impressed face as she took a seat and began her normal routine of sipping at a coffee with far too much sugar and cream,and scarfing down donuts at  Melissa's average of two a minute. \"Sheesh. At least Steph is outright about it. I can't stand passive-aggressiveness. If you think I'm a whale, say I'm a whale! Shit!\" Melissa and Christine gave a good chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the work day progressed well, to the conclusion of the day, and Alice returned home to drive Stephanie back to the Airport. As Stephanie hopped into the car and popped on her seatbelt after loading in her goods, the conversation mulled over Alice's work day. \"Oh, yeah. My co-worker apparently had to stay overnight on Wednesday, day before yesterday, because someone was literally about to screw the whole department.\" Stephanie gasped. \"God! That's crazy! Stay overnight, as in, all night?\" Alice nodded. \"Mhm. All night. Only thing that powered her through the day was coffee. Coffee, and a couple boxes of donuts.\" Stephanie turned to her. \"A <i>couple boxes?</i> \" Alice shrugged. \"Yeah, a couple boxes.\" Stephanie crossed her arms as the drive paused at a stoplight. \"I'm a little scared at how casual you reacat to someone literally eating several dozen donuts over the course of a day. That's over three times someone's daily calories.\" Alice nodded. \"Yeah, I guess it might be a little overboard.\" Stephanie sighed. \"I knew you were being casual about it because I knew you were taking part in it.\" Alice stared a bit ahead. She saw this coming, but she began to hear a hurtful kernel of truth in what Steph was saying. Perhaps she was overdoing it, just a bit. Stephanie continued as the car came toward the Airport. \"I don't mean to be a bitch, because I saw you do some good work. I know you can do this. I'm worried about you, I'm worried about your health. I left a meal plan on your table. I know you can do this.\" She leant over to kiss Alice on the cheek. Alice leant over as much as she could to accept the kiss as she pulled up to the terminal. \"Fly safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched her sister walk into the terminal. Maybe it was time for a minor change- not dedicated weight loss, but maybe time to slow it down.</span></div></div>",

Her fingers darted back and forth across her keyboard, typing a sentence or two, flipping to another screen, examining data, flipping back, typing, tabbing over to her notes to see where she'd planned to go from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some intense planning for a Pizza Monday, but it was a special occasion- it would be 6 months that Courtney'd been the boss at this branch of Gordge, and she'd done stellar work. Her multitasking kept her busy, but with her talent for multitasking, it also kept her full as her other hand could easily dart to a bag of chips, a sweet, a sugary drink. Courtney's waistline had been blooming, and her blouse attested to her growth. It was drum-tight at the navel, and barely any more slack towards her breasts, which were fattened in their own right. Her pants showed every curve in her thickening thighs, and the button held on by a prayer and a dream. Examining it too closely could cause the delicate brass creature to leave its station in Courtney's crammed pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney's phone began ringing. Courtney tapped her hotkey to save her documents, and panned her chair towards the phone to pick up, her hand moving before her <br>\r\ntaxed chair grumpily creaked in that direction. The sudden movement sloshed her stomach, and Courtney's leaning her head towards the phone put her brilliant second chin on full display as it dangled below her subtly pointed chin. She spoke. \"Hello, Branch Manager Courtney. How can I help?\" The familiar voice of Jenna rang on the other end. \"Heyyyy, Courtney!\" Courtney's face lit up, her blubbery cheeks perking up and her mouth drawing a thick smile. \"Jen! Oh my god, how have you been?\" Jenna spoke briefly but curtly, \"Been good, been good.\" She broke off abruptly, uncharacteristic for her- she liked to go off on her tangents. \"Listen, babe, Corporate's been riding my ass about your report.\" The sentence stunned Courtney. She could think of no response besides, \"Report? Which one?\" Jenna quickly replied, \"The mid-year mark report. It's due end of next week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney's heart sank. The quarterly was a monster. The report that had processed from Christina was merely the mandatory biweekly report to the investors. One would think it would be a simple matter of compiling all reports, but it was far more than that- the sheer number of Biweekly's that had to be put together and the mountains of data would take the whole firm's effort. Courtney grimly but shakily replied, \"Uh....Uh, yeah, I'll have that to you by then.\" Jenna spoke. \"Thanks, babe. We'll talk more after that, sorry, if you're panicking about it, imagine the panic over here, it's five times worse. Gotta go. Got busy lines from eight departments. Bye babe.\" The phone clicked. Court had never heard Jenna that curt, quick, and to the point. It worried her immensely. The stress of the moment manifested in her grabbing two bags of cheetos, downing them in a few moments, and she picked up the phone. She began the process of talking to the department heads. This would be the mother of all crunch weeks.</span></div></div>",

Just tryin' to tone it down, y'know? Not going all Jenny Craig on you guys, just trying to spend less money on clothes.\" Alice patted her stomach for emphasis. Her recent gains had been meteoric, and this compromise somewhere between a diet and gluttony left her in just enough of a balance to not shred her clothes at the rate she had been. Christina spoke up as she grabbed two donuts. \"More for me, then.\" She swallowed nearly one whole, and began to reach for a third to beat Melissa to a bavarian creme. \"Yeet!\" exclaimed Christina. Melissa surged for the donut, but Christina pushed her back with one hand holding her spare glazed donut while she used her other hand to bite into the creme donut. Melissa seized the exposed donut, and Christina's face grew wan. \"Hey, no fair! C'mon!\" Melissa chuckled through a full mouth as she bit through the glazed donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe break's jolly mood came to a crash as Courtney appeared in the doorway, her blubbery, breathless figure devoid of her usual characteristic cheer when interacting with her workers. \"Guys...I hate to be the, the...\" she paused to take a deeper breath, then resumed, \"The bearer of bad news, but we need to compile the mid-year, and it's due by the end of the week.\" The room grew silent as the herd digested their donuts and coffee. The group seemed to be stunned, but Courtney pressed the point in an urgent voice. \"As in, breaktime needs to end and you guys need to get cracking. We can't waste a single hour.\" The group stood up and walked back to their desks with mugs of coffee and a few snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office hallway filled with the clicking and tapping of fingers on keyboards, combined with the rustling of plastic packages as the blubbery office workers crunched through bags of snacks that would last normal workers a few weeks, which, in this office ran about one day on a normal day. But this day was no normal day. Alice grimaced as she pressed herself to try to keep her calm and not return to the gluttony she'd just begun to try to curb. She leant into her keyboard, her strokes landing heavier as she tabbed in and out, checking over her work, making sure her numbers were accurate. For now, the sugar high was keeping her on top of her work. As time went on, though, the sugar wasn't enough. The sheets seemed to be endless. She gave in - she reasoned with herself that she wasn't <i>necessarily</i> dieting - it was okay to splurge if it meant getting through her workday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Christina were shamelessly powering themselves through their mountains of work with salty foods, but their reliance on it slowed them ever so slightly. Their bags of snacks ran low soon - they had to break into their cabinets sooner, precious minutes that slowed their work. Even Victoria was putting work in, but she was still more preoccupied with the food than her work. Her belly had balanced out her gains in her thighs and breasts, growing with each bag of chips and cheese snacks she swallowed. Her new blouse that she had bought the past saturday was beginning to countenance the vastness of her stomach which bloated as Victoria ate on. Thankfully for Victoria, she was pragmatic yet sensible with her fashion- this blouse had plenty of stretch, it would sooner ride up than rip. Eventually, Victoria actually filled up and could focus on her work. By that point, her blouse was riding up by a good inch, hinting at her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney spent the day frantically e-mailling and calling, stuffing her face in between calls, e-mails,and compiling finished sheets as they came in. She was almost a master at managing exact timing between calls, able to perfectly time swallowing, chewing. Her poison of choice were sweets - fairly annoying in that they needed unwrapping, but Courtney had that down to an exact science- peel it open from the top just enough to retreive the goodies inside, discard the plastic, begin eating. She was less eating to occupy herself as her workers were as she was to try to calm her nerves. As a result of this and her obsession with keeping good time, she was less <i>eating</i> the sweets so much as she was inhaling them- give them a good two chews then swallow. They were soft enough that they'd dissolve of their own accord going down. Her nerves were able to create a bottomless pit effect for her stomach- her dress began to tighten to epic proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive o'clock rolled around, and Victoria had already stood up and was nearly halfway to the door when Courtney called from her desk. \"If you guys could stick around for overtime, it'd be REALLY appreciated.\" Victoria continued out the door, and Melissa followed her. Alice and Christina remained, along with Courtney. Alice spoke up. \"I'm going to order a pizza for delivery if that's okay.\" Courtney called. \"Yeah, yeah, should be fine.\" The office was nearly dead-silent. The pizzas arrived about thirty minutes later- Alice's jiggling form hurried to collect the three boxes. The black heavyset delivery man's red work shirt hung over his belt as the young man raised an eyebrow at the clacking. \"Man, y'all working hard. What's up?\" Alice grabbed the boxes and turned off with no explanation. The delivery boy grunted at the lack of a tip, and walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's belly jiggled and shook as she dropped a pizza off at Courtney and Christina's desks. Her bloated massive belly, which hung down halfway towards her knees, was stuffed with food, but she was beginning to become numb to the sensation of fullness- she was now stuffing herself just to keep her mouth occupied, as now was Christina. Courtney's dress had stretch build in, but Courtney could feel it beginning to give - she'd barely touched her pizza, but she unconciously kept reaching for slices and working. She was focusing on the job. Her brain was on a sole task. Alice's loosening blouse was now riding up above her navel, and Courtney had unbuckled her dress pants and her belly began to spill into her lap as she crammed pizza and cheese snacks into her mouth while she worked. About an hour passed before the trio tried to leave. Alice grunted and groaned, but was able to roll out of her chair to a standing position. Courtney and Christina tried, but couldn't do it. They checked their chairs - their bloated stomachs were pinning them in. They had to fold their side flab back in through the arms, and stood with force. Christina had forgotten her pants were unbuttoned- they slid down, her undergarments being quickly hidden by her massive stomach. Her thighs were thick with fat, approaching the size of a maturing tree trunk. Embarassed, she pulled her pants up, and tried to force the button back in. She sucked in her gut, tried everything she could, but the button was centimeters off the mark. She took to the fat girl's best friend- a safety pin. She pinned the pants closed as she walked out of the office. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That Wednesday had come as the herd shuffled off the elevators. The crunch on the mid-year report had taken a toll on the group. Melissa's face had swollen with grumpiness, Christina's face had turned to stone-like indifference, and Alice looked eternally exhausted. In addition to the endless snacking at the office, the pack had also been indulging at home. And while normally even these weighty women would be full from the amount of eating they'd been doing for the past week, nothing can create false hunger like stress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blouse which Alice had freshly bought that weekend was beginning to truly introduce itself to Alice's stomach. The frills and puffs of the blouse in more places bound themselves to Alice's green blouse, especially around the navel. This morning hour was normally a golden hour of chuckles, conversations, and greetings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the deathly silence which bound the office itself told of the grim mood of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few short minutes as the band of blubbery ladies had reached their computers, the only sounds that filled the office were the sounds of opening bags and the clacking of keyboards. The dim mood of the office put a cloud on everyone's mind. Even if they had desired to converse with someone else, they were either A, too busy stuffing their face to focus, or B, too busy working to talk. The same pattern as Monday had come on, but the stress of the week had begun to pile up. In with the friends had come fresh restocks of their supplies, and at the moment, things seemed to be holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria, however, had slipped - she had undercalculated. If the others' low morale had resulted in determination to finish the project, her low morale had made her even lazier. She had her blubbery legs propped up on her desk as she scarfed down entire share packages of snack cakes. The others were eating over-filled handfuls of treats and snacks, but Victoria was going beyond this. Her blubbery face was becoming coated in a layer of salty snack residue and chocolate smears. Her mind bounded onto any other topic than work. That funny meme she'd just read - where was it from? She remembered she'd seen it with Alice while out over the weekend - maybe she knew? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick office atmosphere was cut like a knife by Victoria's voice as she, too lazy to get up from her desk, yelled out, \"Hey, Al.\" Alice did not reply. \"Al!\" The second call was getting to be too much for the others. Melissa gritted her teeth and mumbled under her breath, \"This bitch...\" There were about three beats of deathly silence. The sound of a creaking chair and a groan from Victoria's office. The sound of feet coming to bear Victoria's heavy weight upon the floor, then the sound of her preponderance stepping across the floor. Each and every heavy step of the way brought more anxiety. Eventually, Victoria's feet stopped on the ninth step. Alice looked up from her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was not having a good day by any standard. She'd looked in the mirror this morning and felt dissapointed at herself after having broken her promise to her sister about toning down. She'd even e-mailed her sister about how she'd hit her calorie goal this past Sunday, and gotten a congratulatory e-mail back. She was not happy at having her attempt to calm down broken by the stress of the crunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing she needed was Victoria's grating voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Al.\" Alice stared death into Victoria's eyes. Still no reply. <br>\r\n\"When did you show me that meme, the one with the turtle laying upside down, like, \"It's me on monday at the office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice thundered back. \"Vic, girl, I'm trying to WORK here. Pleeease.\" Victoria shrugged. \"Fiiine.\" She stomped off. But not nine steps back into her office, but four to the right into the break room across the hallway, next to Melissa's office. Melissa looked across at Alice. Both of the ladies grimaced at each other as Alice rolled her eyes nearly into the back of her head. Melissa nodded, and mouthed \"Same.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina had kept her head down and said nothing. She cringed horrifically, but she didn't take the time to e-mail Courtney about it. She figured that if her plate was full, Courtney's plate was stuffed. The mid-year report itself was actually coming along very well - it turns out that when the Gordge girls got their heads down, and into the work (Albeit with a hand in a bag of chips on the side) they could crank it out. Halfway through the week, the report was now at around 80 percent done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Christina's blouse was 100 percent overstretched. Her stomach was half-hanging out of her navy blue blouse, taut and round, completely stuffed. In the past, her belly could barely tickle the edge of the table. But now, her stomach rubbed the table sorely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the stress eating was pushing Christina's blouse to the breaking point, Courtney's stress eating had ruined hers. Her blouse, special tailor-made, was burgeoning with her stomach. Her pants were already unbuttoned, and had been since 11. Her growing fatness had been bringing her airtight blouse to its breaking limit for a while now - her fat arms had to be practically jammed into their sleeves, and took nearly a set of pliers to remove. Her shirt had run out of looseness about two months back, but now, the seams strained to exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 5 O'Clock, nobody had even begun to pack up. Victoria had spent the whole day in the break room since her fiasco at noon, gorging herself on the donuts procured by Courtney's reforms. By 5, she had actually started feeling full. This had a side-effect, though - she was stuck in the break room chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys? I'm stuck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" echoed out Alice's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The break room. I'm stuck in this chair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa spoke up. \"Join the gang. I'm just gonna stay for overtime. Maybe you should too. Might actually get some work done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria roared back. \"Ex-CUSE ME? I've been working hard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working hard to bust out of your skirt, you bloated Italian rat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney screeched from her office. \"IF I HEAR ONE MORE WORD OUT OF ANYONE'S MOUTH, SO HELP ME GOD, I'M BUSTING YOU DOWN TO JANITORIAL PAY.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office was once again silent. By 7, the dreaded mid-year had finished. But the toll on the workers' waistlines was to prove to be significant. On average, the whole firm had gained around 10 pounds from stress eating. Alice and Melissa had busted that to 20. Alice couldn't even fasten her dress pants by the end of the day, even at home, and even after her food had digested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney had bested that to reach 30 more pounds, and Christine was at 25 additional pounds. The half-week of non-stop binging had ruined nearly everyone's wardrobe, and certainly had ruined Alice's proposed demi-diet - at least for the moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wooden floor of the same bar where Melissa, Alice and Stephanie met creaked under the thunderous steps of the blubbery ladies which now crossed it. Melissa's bloated form entered the bar first. Her dress shirt was tightly drawn across her bulging stomach which could not be contained by its cooperation nor the cooperation of the skirt below, which created a shelf of stomach hanging over the skirt thinly covered by the black dress shirt. By this point, Melissa had abandoned buttons - as an ever-expanding woman, she had discovered a long time ago that buttons were an obstruction to her wanton gluttony, and required much too much sewing. Her belly, having expanded to titanic proportions, drifted ever downward towards her knees, meeting the goal whenever Melissa sat down. The same shirt which Melissa had been wearing the past week had started this week far looser, and Melissa's stomach occasionally met the fabric, but now the two were nearly melded together on a constant basis. Seams were beginning to pop and strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the real question, ladies.\" spoke Melissa as Alice's fattened form entered the room after, wearing a drum-tight blue dress which groaned under the stress of Alice's bluging belly. \"What flavor of wings?\" Alice chimed in. \"Hot wings!\" Courtney seconded Alice, chiming in just after, \"Hot wings!\" Christina spoke up. \"Garlic Parm?\"  Victoria was absent from the gathering - she was still feeling stung from Wednesday, and was absolutely glum on Thursday. Not a word between her and the rest was exchanged, and she spent most of the day in her office eating. Alice spoke up after. \"How about let's do the wing split option? The sixty wings come with several flavors.\" \"Yes! Thank you!\" replied Christina in a gracious tone. The pack reached the bar and took their stools, and the Bartender leaned in. \"Hey, ladies. What can I get you?\" Alice chimed in, \"What kind of IPA's do you have?\" The bartender listed off, \"We have Blue Dream Pale Ale, Kick My Teeth Stout, Derniere Lager, Brousvaarden White..\" Alice stopped him. \"Gimme the Derniere.\" Melissa followed. \"Gimme Jack D. None of that hipster shit.\" Christina spoke up. \"Eh, Budweiser.\" Courtney spoke up. \"Uh, hit me with some Jameson Scotch. Oh, and we'll have the Sixty wing bucket.\" The bartneder nodded. \"Okay, what flavors?\" Alice spoke up. \"Uh, Hot wings and Garlic Parm.\" \"So, half and half?\" asked the bartender. \"Yeah, half and half.\" replied Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender gave over the selected drink choices to the fattened ladies. Christina began sipping on hers. Christina was wearing one of her older blouses, which she had hoped to use to replace her work blouse - but before a single wing was consumed, it was obvious that it would be inadequate. The bottom of her stomach was peeking out of the chartreuse blouse, and every part of her blouse was stretched to full, with a few bits of folding clothing in patches where the tightness wasn't as bad. Her jeans were doing double-duty, however. It was only by the grace of God and some of the most intensive athletic work Christina had done in the past three years that she'd been able to button the Jeans, and she was fairly certain she'd have to unbutton her Jeans - a task which she undertook while opening up the conversation. \"You think we were hard on Victoria?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa scoffed while beginning to sip on her whiskey. \"Fuck no. She doesn't wanna pull her weight, she can work at a chinese buffet if she wants to do nothing but eat all day.\" Courtney jokingly coughed. \"I said NOTHING but eat all day.\" Courtney shrugged. \"True, true. I will say, Victoria needs to get her shit together. There's enjoying yourself at work, and there's what she's doing - I have half a mind to ration the donuts in her case.\" She mindfully looked to her own blubber. \"And maybe even in mine - this crunch has done a number on my belly.\" Christina spoke up. \"Shit, how do you think I feel? I could barely button these jeans tonight, and I -thought- this blouse would fit. It fit fine like, a week ago.\" Alice followed, \"You think that's bad, my poor spanx could barely come on. I was -trying- to chill out on the eating before that damn crunch hit.\" Melissa spoke up. \"See, that's where you went wrong. Also, spanx? Why bother?\" Alice turned to Melissa. \"Unlike you, I like to -try- to fit into my clothes.\" Melissa spoke up. \"My clothes fit me! Well... Most of me. Not my fault that my shirts can't deal!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wings finally came about, and the ladies dove in. \"Well, all I know is, you ladies sound like you're about to propose something stupid.\"  Christina spoke up. \"How is trying to chill out on our food consumption stupid?\" Alice nodded. \"Yeah. I like that green blouse I got, and the poor baby's about to die out in like a week. How about let's not necessarily try to LOSE weight, but just try to stay the same for a while? Long enough to build up a wardrobe for when we eventually get fatter, at least.\" Courtney spoke up through a mouthful of wings. \"That sounds reasonable. But how would you incentivise that? More food?\" Almost everyone's eyes lit up. Alice spoke up. \"If the point is to try to help us build our wardrobes back up, how about some coupons for one of the clothes outlets around here? Or does George give out any gift cards?\" Christina lit up. \"Yes! YES! A gift card from George's!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the gang celebrated the idea. By the end of the night, they'd ordered another bucket of wings - and a few more beers each. The night became a blur, but the idea of the gift card from George's remained. Whenever the contest began, one thing was certain - this herd of hippos was going to have a problem limiting what they ate.</span></div></div>",

Her shame began creeping back in through a back door as she beheld the damage done by her unchecked gluttony.  She'd checked for upper sizes - one of her favored hobbies when trying to de-stress at work - and found none in a pattern or fabric she liked. This green blouse was the line in the sand for her - further would mean degrading herself to wearing what she considered to be little better than loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strode thunderingly out of the elevator. Not that she was trying to thunder out, but her sheer weight made her average, normal steps sound as if a giant were flicking the floor with its thumb. Loud steps were no stranger to the walls of the office, but their loudness had even been alarming its enlarging occupants, normally so blissfully unaware of their constant fleshy expansion. Alice popped by the break room, but she found herself automatically walking towards the donut box. It had become an unconscious routine of hers, even going so far as to open the box and reach for a chocolate eclair. Then she had remembered as she held it and looked back down at her gargantuan, blob-like torso. She firmly turned her back to the box and grabbed a mug of coffee, and filled it with the hot black concoction which brought life in the office, and walked back to her office. She unconsciously began munching on the eclair she had forgotten to put down, and only recognized its existance as she began to sit down. She groaned, angered by her own lack of self control. She remembered the lectures her sister had given her on her last visit as she threw half of the eclair away in an iron display of willpower from Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice drug herself through her work - occasionally checking her distraction sites to keep herself sane - she woefully recalled the breach between Victoria and the rest of the group. She didn't see victoria in the break room, scarfing down far too many donuts even by the standards of the horrifically fat women of Gordge. She figured she was likely in her office eating more of her preferred treats from her private hoard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice felt a pang of sorrow, though - Victoria knew how to bring the fun at office parties. She could be a shoulder to cry on for many people. It became clear to Alice that it was unfair to judge Vicky by one bad crunch week. She began attempting to piece together an idea to try to bring Victoria back into the fold. How would she do that, though? Fun and parties are one thing, but those are the exceptions in an office? Then she remembered - Easter was around the bend, and by that time Alice wagered that if anyone was still on these demi-diets, they'd be on the breaking point. Alice smirked - she had confidence in her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice began typing up an e-mail to Victoria detailing the basics of her plan. She heard a groan from across the hall, approximately from Melissa's office. Alice turned to the sound and got up, waddling and breaking a sweat to get to her doorway. \"What's wrong, Mel?\" Melissa spoke back. \"I've only had one donut today and I don't know if I can make it without number twooo..\" Alice spoke up. \"I'm feeling you, girlie.\" She rested a hand on her stomach, rising and falling from the exertion of the short walk Alice put herself through to get herself up and walk to Melissa's office. \"I had to stop myself halfway through an eclair,\" she said, pausing for a gasp,  \"I don't know if I can make it.\" \"That's not reassuring, Al.\" replied Melissa, leaning back in her overtaxed office chair, the gravity making her double-chin far more pronounced as it hung down towards her collar, just tickling the edge. \"You're supposed to be the diet mom of the office stopping us from getting here, if you're having this issue, what hope do we have?\" Alice shook her head, getting some breath back. \"I don't know, I don't know.\" The two respectively stood and sat in the area, taking a breath before Alice spoke again. \"So what do you think about an easter party?\" Melissa spoke up. \"Ooh, an easter office party! That'll be awesome!\" She took a pause for a breath, and spoke. \"Who do you think could get the food for that?\" Alice spoke up. \"I was thiiinkiiing...\" She leaned her head towards Victoria. Melissa cast an unsure glance at the ground and then took a pensive facial posture. \"Well... She does love her some food... Maybe she'd be good at that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The main issue was that there was nothing much to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina had gone whole skinny hog on the problem of her rising weight. She had mentally mapped her whole plan - she'd go back on meal prepping and go to the gym after the office. She figured she could cut back really easy - she did this all the time back in the day, why can't she just do it now? She had prepped a chicken and rice for today and had it very near at hand - she wouldn't be caught in the trap of even going for a donut. She kept herself busy with anything she could find - checking up on her templates and refreshing her e-mail. But it wasn't working. Christina was unable to truly stay busy. She picked up the phone - if she couldn't stay busy with what she has, she'd <i>find</i> something to do. Even if that meant calling Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney's phone rang, and the blubbery suit picked it up. \"Hello, this is Courtney.\" \"Courtney, hey, it's Christie. Got anything you need doing?\" Courtney hummed, and spoke. \"If you could call Jenna and ask about the schedule for the next audit, that'd be great.\" \"Great,\" replied Christina. \"Anything else you need?\" Courtney cocked an eye into the phone - this was unlike Christina. \"Uh... could you e-mail Hiring and get them to hire another intern?\" \"Will do,\" spoke Christina. Surely enough, as Courtney prepared to put down the phone, she faintly heard, \"Anything else?\" Courtney annoyedly spoke. \"Yeah, grab me a pizza from Dannio's around the corner after those calls. That's it.\" She hung up before Christina could say anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was happy to have something else to do than hit F5 all day as she simply dialed the extension to talk to Jenna. A few rings, and Jenna's familiar voice came over the phone. \"Hello, Jenna here. How can I help?\" Christina spoke. \"Hey Jen! It's me, Christina! Courtney wants to know what the schedule for the next audit is.\" Jenna replied, \"Hey, Christina! Yeah, uhhhh....\" She paused, taking a breath, \"I think it's scheduled for next month, May 13th, 3:00 over here.\" Christina nodded and spoke. \"Alright, sounds great.\" Christina continued on, wanting to blow as much time not eating as possible. \"So, how's it over there, Jenna?\" \"Oh, it's great!\" replied Jenna. \"They have a 24/7 Pizza bar, and it's great!\" She took a moment to take a breather, audible through the phone. \"It's not been great for my waistline, though. I swear I've gained fifty pounds while I was here. I might have to cut back so that I can actually wear clothes.\" Christina spoke. \"Same, sister. We're all trying to cut back over here - Alice has been going crazy recently and we're all trying to extend our wardrobe's lifetimes.\" Jenna chuckled and spoke through the phone after a gasp. \"Well, I've got to get back to work- Nice talking to you, Christina!\" Christina spoke in reply, \"Bye!\" The clunk of Jenna's phone sounded into Christina's end, as she hung up in reply. It was not too reassuring to hear that Jenna had kept stuffing herself, but Christina tried to take heart that Jenna was going through something like the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina typed up an email to hiring - she wanted to put the phone down, especially as her arm strength was not what it had been and she was beginning to physically tire of talking on the phone. Christina made a mental note to go for a jog after work. She rocked her mass to her feet, and thudded towards the stairs - she figured she would try to get some cardiovascular health back as soon as she could. She opened the door - creaky from disuse, and leaned forward to try and see over her massive gut. She managed to do so and picked her way down, each step down feeling like someone giving a massive jiggle to her gut - making her breathless by motion downward and not even accounting for her difficulties simply walking. She kept descending as fast as possible, but her forehead became drenched in sweat as she got further down. Eventually, she did reach the bottom of the stairs, but she was absolutely out of breath and felt like her heart was trying to leap directly through her chest cavity. She breathlessly trudged towards her car, as her stomach groaned from lack of food at its regular massive rate. Christina managed to get over to her parking space and opened her car door, sliding in and rocking her vehicle back and then forth. She struggled to pull down the seatbelt but sweat blocked her vision. She wiggled the metal of the buckle back and forth until she eventually heard a click as the oppressive heat of the interior of her sun-warmed car doubled her sweating. She cranked her car as fast as possible and turned on the A/C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Christina returned, she came back with two pizzas - both meat lovers, if she remembered Courtney's order right. She had stopped for a snack to calm her stomach so she could get back to her meal prep. She trudged towards the elevator - she wasn't insane enough to believe that her massive form could trudge <b>up</b> four flights of stairs when she nearly had a heart attack from simply trying to go down. The elevator was chugging today, though, and her stomach demanded tribute. Christina gritted her teeth - she was determined to hold on just a little longer. Eventually the elevator arrived, though every minute was like an hour until she finally trudged toward Courtney's office. As she approached, she saw Courtney munching on a pizza. \"Oh, Christie.\" she spoke, though a full mouth. \"Sorry, but I already ordered delivery. You can keep those two, though! Sorry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo boxes of pizza later, Christina unbuckled her burgeoning pants. She groaned as she came to a realization - cutting back was going to be much harder than she had thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice groaned as the next week had rolled onward and her green blouse grew tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she had sworn that she would keep her gorging down, she couldn't stop herself from an \"accident\" or two a day. The sugary, calorie-laden \"accidents\" were taking a toll on Alice's waistline - it must have gone up another inch. She was ever so slightly more sweaty and exhausted as she made the long trek from the elevator to her office. Her pants became that minute longer to put on. Her stomach's fullness was becoming more pronounced, and the top of her stomach was forming something of a 'shelf' as it edged outwards, forming the very cradle of a massive blob-like gut that doubled up on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was beginning to reach the end of her patience one week in, and she was perplexed. Wasn't she the one with all the self control? That was who she was. Almost as if a sign, she noticed a lack of thunderous footsteps that bore Melissa's waddling pattern. Melissa happily sat in her office, focusing and typing away at her computer as Alice leaned and examined Melissa. Alice had to look hard past her own fattened face, but she could almost swear that Melissa hadn't gained a pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an oddity - at about this time, she'd always hear Melissa stomping to the donut room. She'd heard it last week plenty - but come to think of it, last week's end, she was making fewer trips. Was it possible that Melissa was actually <i>cutting back?</i> Alice struggled upwards, her first effort resulting in failure as her 500 pound form came back into her chair. The attempt left her breathless as she panted to get her strength back. She grappled with her desk and strained her calves to support her massive weight, after a groan and a supreme effort, succeeding. She took a moment to catch her breath, and then thudded towards Melissa's office. The office could begin to tell how the \"weight\" was shifting - Alice's footsteps had become that micro-decibel louder than Melissa's as her form became that extra bit fatter and Melissa's remained the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice panted from the exhaustion of walking across the hall. \"How the hell..\" she began, sputtering out of breath before she could finish. Melissa finished for her, \"I'unno. Guess I'm just tired of Donuts.\" It was like hearing a body snatcher talking through Melissa's lips. Melissa surveyed Alice's form - her arms were beginning to fatten out, starting to form a ham-like appendage around her bicep with the fatness of her bingo wings and the lard on the arm itself. \"How the hell can you be...\" spoke Alice, gasping for breath mid-sentence, \"tired of donuts? You're Mel!\" Melissa shrugged. \"I mean, folks change.\" Alice shook her head. She still thought of Melissa as the larger of the pair - she always thought like that. Christina chimed in from her office. \"I swear to god I'm three dress sizes from just giving up and going naked.\" Alice leaned to look at her. \"I feel you, girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was barely keeping pace with Melissa, barely maintaining her weight. If she had gained a pound, it wasn't obvious. \"Christie, I'm literally about to break down.\" spoke Alice. \"I just can't deal, I can't stop fucking eating even when I want to\" Melissa stood up with a grunt and a gasp, and waddled to Alice, struggling to fit an arm around Alice's roll-proliferated back, patting it and shaking her gut mightily with the contact. \"There there, Al.\" spoke Melissa. \"You know, if you want, we can take a walk.\" Alice sniffled. \"I-I could try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took off at a pig-trot, and for approaching the first time, Melissa was ahead of Alice as the blubbery, porcine woman thudded breathlessly behind Melissa. \"You okay, Al?\" spoke Melissa. \"You really don't sound so hot.\" Alice spoke. \"Ij'st...\" She gasped, speaking hoarsely. \"Needt'...siddown.\" She wobbled her way to an open bench, plopping down. Melissa thought about taking a seat next to her, but Alice took up the entire bench with her vastness. Her shirt was drenched in sweat. \"Wh... Wh't happen'd to me?\" spoke Alice. Melissa comforted her friend. \"You've just gotten a little bigger, Al.\" Alice grabbed her gut for emphasis \"A little? Melissa, I'm fucking massive! I can't walk properly, I can...\" she took a few breaths \"I can't breath properly.. If I keep going like this, I won't be able to walk or breathe at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa took a while and breathed the air. She began to fully appreciate the moment. She rubbed Alice's back. \"Al, it's no shame to be bigger than other folks. How do you think I felt when I became, literally, the biggest girl on the block?\" spoke Melissa. A beat passed as a Taxi honked and its driver screamed an obscenity at an SUV which nearly swerved into its lane. \"It wasn't easy for me. I tried to diet for god knows how long. I might, <i>might,</i> several years later just now be about to start one that's actually successful.\" Alice hung her head a bit. She had always assumed Melissa never cared about being the fattest girl on the office. It began to dawn on Alice beyond her own speculation that she had assumed the title. The moment had come like falling through a trap-door onto a prepared mattress - there was still some shock in the moment, but cushioned by the understanding acquired by Alice for a while. Melissa comforted Alice. \"So what if you're the biggest girl now? Enjoy it! One day, you might be back to being smaller. Maybe sooner, maybe later. That's life. You're a different person at different times, based on what goes on. Hell, places change. Who knows? We might be the oddballs out one day, and the rest of the company's taken over by Cali health nuts. Time goes on and the best we can do is roll with it.\" Alice chuckled and spoke up. \"In our state, literally.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a good laugh in the street, a pair of laughing fat women in a busy April city street together. Melissa's mind turned back to Victoria as the stone grudge began to soften and melt. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day of the party had finally come. The skinny(ish) interns and ground-floor workers prepped the conference room. It had all the extravagance that a Gordge party should have. There were two full pizza buffets, a gorgeous array of cakes, donuts to be generously consumed, and row upon row of two-liters of soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's gut was the first in, followed by the rest of her immense, flabby corpus. She had planned the party at first, but had left much of the detail down to others. She couldn't resist thudding over towards the pizza and \"sampling\" the goods, opening a box and shamelessly eating a slice of meat-lovers. She was wearing her blue dress, but it was becoming far too stretched to be called anything short of enhanced nakedness. Every one of her multiple rolls along her back was visible, and her mighty love handles which had become more pronounced in the week leading up to Easter had only grown, to say nothing of her expanded stomach. She was beginning to plainly take Melissa's place for gluttony, and had begun to plainly surpass her in girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the others panted in. First was Christina. She had padded her belly ever so slightly, but not to the degree that Alice had. If there was any pretense before, it was obvious now that Alice was giving up on restraining herself. Christina waddled over towards Alice. \"I gotta say, girly. This is gonna be good. I've been holding back a lot recently, it'll be good to let go.\" Alice chuckled. \"Same here. Though, to be honest, I've let go a lot more since last friday. when Mel and I took a walk.\" <i>It seems like it's the last walk she took since then,</i> thought Christina. Even to Christina, Alice's size was becoming a bit much. Christina, aiming for the beam in Alice's eye, could not pluck the log from her own, seeming to miss her expanded stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing was Melissa. Infuriatingly, she seemed to stick to her program. Did her dress actually fit better today? \"Okay, come on Melissa, now you're just showing off.\" Melissa faux-strutted. She still wobbled greatly, her gut shaking side to side as she did so, but less than normal, some unseen muscle seeming to check the bounce. Quite plainly, something was changing about her. Melissa spoke up. \"Alright, I'll budge. I've been visiting that gym Steph took us to.\" Alice cackled and Christina chortled, as Alice followed her burst of laughter, \"Of the two of us...You were the one who followed Steph's...Advice...\" Alice took a moment to breathe as her laughter wore down, exhausted by this vigorous exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney and Victoria were soon next up. Victoria's orange tan was as radiant as ever, but it was quite obvious she had more than kept up with the pack with her gains. Her ample rear and thighs had taken a great blow by her gorging, and she had CERTAINLY grown from when she last truly communicated with the rest. But she was slowed by her lack of partaking in the office ritual of donuts and coffee every other hour. The walking horde of blubber lifted their bingo wings and cheered, \"Vicky!\" They embraced Victoria, looking like a great singular organism of fattened bellies and limbs, all panting and heaving, their guts rising and falling in rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they parted, some eyes passed Courtney. She was able to absorb herself in work to the extent that she was able to avoid the gains of Christina and especially not the outright surrender of Alice. However, she was certainly not unscathed. Her stomach and calves fattened just slightly. However, next to the whale that was Alice, she went virtually un-noticed. Everyone talked, even fat Jessica from the higher end of the ground-floor workers. The fact that Alice was gaining and Melissa was, in fact, losing, weight, was shocking. \"So, Vick, how's things been?\" asked Melissa. Victoria shrugged and spoke up. \"Better than crunch week - God, I thought I was gonna die.\"  Alice chimed in, having grabbed three slices of pizza, forming a grotesque kind of \"'Pizza Sandwich.' \"We all did, sis.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit into the tip. Nobody said a word - everyone tried to continue talking, but some worried glances were cast Alice's way. It seemed as though this was but the tip of the iceberg. Christina followed, though. She folded the slices and ate them one atop the other, but only going two-deep. \"Hey, save some for me!\" spoke Courtney, followed by Victoria. The pizza boxes were being raided hard by the pack - thus,the reason for two pizza buffets. Melissa engaged in double-fisting individual slices, but none could match Alice, who took to a similar practice with her triple-stacks.  Melissa and Victoria spoke while Christina listened. Alice seemed focused on the pizza for a moment longer, but came to the conversation having killed a whole pizza in a matter of a few minutes. \"So, Mel, you're looking pretty slender! What's the secret?\" Melissa nodded. She couldn't contain the smile on her face. \"Thanks, it's really just holding back on the donuts - we'd made a bet that whoever could hold back enough could win a gift card to George's tailor shop.\" Victoria sighed in annoyance. \"Damnit, sucks that I missed out on that. I would have loved that. I love his women's suits -they fit my form so well. What do you think you'll get there?\" Melissa spoke. \"Well, I'unno. I might pass it on to Al - it's looking like she'll need it more than me.\" The blue dress' straps were digging into the fat, meaty shoulders of Alice, as her blue dress strained to bursting to contain her great, heavy stomach. She replied merely by eating more pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the night came to an end, the air had cleared almost to a crystal degree. Victoria was one hundred percent back in the group. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How did she spend so much on it?\" rang out Christina's voice as the gaggle of blubbery women trudged towards the elevator. \"It was becuase it was a real small breed - real tiny thing, but she's so cute.\" spoke Victoria. Easter had come and gone and the company was now in the dawning days of May. Christina's gains had slowed, but still trudged on as the ponderous woman led the way into the ritzy elevator. Her well-rounded gains had resulted in both the need for a new pair of work pants which hid her gains and a fresh new blouse bought to cheer her up. In part, this was also to hide her mid-400's pound weight from herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Melissa followed Victoria. \"I can't get why someone would get a dog. I've always been a cat gal. Dogs are too damn hyper.\" Christina spoke up. \"Yeah, but they're sooo-o loving! I love the little scritch-scratch at the door when I wake up. Cats just don't give a shit.\" The elevator carried the group upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator arrived at its destination and the familiar floral patterned hallway of their floor, they trudged onward. Halfway, Christina and Victoria's stomachs rose and fell with increasing frequency as they panted from the effort. Melissa spoke up, somewhat belabored but not as much as the duo, \"You can make it. Almost there.\" Melissa's old blouse was slightly baggier than the easter party - if she had lost weight, it was a slight amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was wrong, though. Normally by now, the smell of freshly-brewed coffee and donuts would be wafting into their nose from the quickly approaching break room.  There was a sole donut container remaining of the normal mountain of donuts. It was shocking - this had never happened before. \"What the hell?\" said Christina. The source of the shortage of the donuts soon became evident with the sound of hog-like stuffing down the hall and to the right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had fundamentally changed since the easter party. The words implanted into her mind by Melissa did not merely stop Alice's woes, they made her turn down a whole new road. If she was going to be the fattest girl in the office, why not embrace it? The Dionysian gluttony was plain by the machine-gun like rate at which Alice ate pastries and delicacies. She consumed a massive eclair in three bites with one hand while she continued her work with her other. For the second, she truly did have to stretch, however. She had to lean forward, scrunching her wide girth directly up to her desk as she could feel her panting breaths between bites of food. Even then, she had to reach over a good two feet to access her keyboard, her fat and flabby forearm covering a good portion of the desk where they rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her green blouse had disappeared from her repertoire, gone to 'the closet' wherein every fat woman keeps the clothes slain by her gains, shelved off to the side from her current tent-like garments. Even these were being quickly taxed. It was barely two weeks after Easter, after which Alice had bought her current lilac blouse, and it was already beginning to stretch across her stomach with some effort. It was mesmerizing to see Alice eat the amount she was eating. It occurred to the onlookers whether or not she was even breathing or trying to replace it with food. It was clear to any who were looking that Alice had broken 500 pounds, while most of the office still hovered around 350-450. She was rocketing upwards, at around 530, maybe even 540. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaggle withdrew into the break room and sat with coffee, finishing off the last box of donuts and pressing a handy little button installed to alert interns that more were needed. They whispered to each other and turned on the radio to the Marni and Cass show for noise. \"Jesus, I'm getting kinda scared about Alice.\" said Christina. \"Yeah,\" said Victoria, \"She's really overdoing it. I think she's got a problem.\" Melissa's face grew grim. \"I don't know. It's not like her. She's been eating more for a while now, but not like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice heard some mumbling. She didn't have to guess what it was about. It was about her. She looked wistfully at her great, rolling gut as she fed its growth with a chocolate-filled chocolate donut. Stupid, always hungry gut. She fed herself more and more in this cycle fed not just by sheer gluttony, but also out of no small amount of self-loathing. She was feeding herself as punishment for eating too much. It was illogical to be sure, but her mind was beginning to lose logic in the aftermath of her altered status in the office and recognize its own change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on, it seemed as though Interns were bringing bags of fast food every other hour to Alice's office. She kept eating more and more, a day's worth of calories in each bag. It was never enough. After the day ended, Alice drove back to her home and sat on the couch with an array of delivered pizzas, finishing two before the night went out. Her feeding became less about punishment and more about addiction. Everybody recognized the problem, but nobody knew what to do. </span></div></div>",

Her small vehicle was definitely not designed with a person of her dimensions in mind, and it was hard for her to get out of the auto without getting stuck on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Almost!... Almost!...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrection: it was hard one or two hundred pounds ago. Now it was nearly impossible. Alice had her overtaxed muscles pushed to the bitter edge. Her right hand was gripping the driver's side handhold, while her left elbow was dug into the door frame, trying desperately to force her lardaceous figure through the door. It was quite an uphill battle. Her massive gut rolls had firmly wedged themselves around the steering wheel, and even stretched to her limit, her gigantic booty still remained planted in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a fair bit of the center console, to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her flabby arms and watermelon-sized breasts were acting as obstacles today, as her attempts to scrunch herself small enough to extricate from the vehicle forced them into her face, cutting off her already critically short air supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, God damn it!\"</i> Alice flopped back into her seat, bested by her fatty frame for a third time. As she sat there panting, her treacherous stomach let out a soft growl of hunger. Despite having a large breakfast at home, and a fast food binge on the way to work, her belly <b>needed</b> more. Six months ago, she'd have been in the breakroom by now, filling that need. As her weight went up, however, Alice's mobility was suffering more and more, pushing her third stuffing later in her day then she'd have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay Alice, get it together. You know what they say; fourth time's the charm...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... actually, you'd better make it three double cheeseburgers with fries, two slices of pizza, at least six pieces of chicken, and whatever cake they have for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice finished listing off her lunch order to the intern, intending to work (re:eat) at her desk rather then chance the breakroom. Whoever this girl was, she was clearly new. Tall, thin, and blonde, she was very obviously trying to hide her disgust at having to help a land whale stuff herself beyond obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you mean a slice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl choked back a sound of incredulity. \"Um, anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coke, no ice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, regular.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Alice had noticed the intern's not-so-subtle jab, she gave no sign of it. The young woman left to get her order, watching as Alice grabbed a jam-filled bear claw, her wobbly bat wings drooping heavily with fat, and scarfed it down in two messy bites. She was grabbing a second one as the intern entered the elevator, and was taking a bite as the door closed, despite her lunch being mere minutes away. The intern shook her pretty, blonde head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What an absolute pig. I'll bet she doesn't even know her fat ass split her dress...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just e-mailed you the figures for last week. Yes. Yes, I'll have this set ready to go before closing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was on the phone going over her work with her higher-ups. She was doing it in true Gordge fashion, however, with a pastry in one hand and the phone in the other. Alice had long ago perfected the technique of talking on the phone without the other person realizing she was eating, allowing her to maintain all but a breakneck pace without pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice leaned back in her chair, eliciting some alarming creaking sounds from the suffering piece of furniture. This chair had been designed with fat people in mind. It was a beefy thing, well reinforced, armless, and with a large, solid base. However, it hadn't been made with someone Alice's size in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cccccccrrrrrrreeeeeeeaaaaakk!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, it held, but it was only a matter of time. Alice's body engulfed the poor thing, and depending on which direction you approached from, you wouldn't even be able to see the chair. Her large rolls of back fat pressed around the top and sides of the office chair, while her gargantuan thighs and massive ass drooped heavily over the seat, hiding it fully from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. Of course. Yes, Ma'am.\" Finishing her current doughnut, Alice leaned forward to grab another, a task made rather difficult by her huge belly and breasts. Pressing her gut hard enough into the desk that it left the furniture groaning under her considerable load, she grabbed another sugary pastry with her still surprisingly narrow fingers, despite the enormity and droopage of her fore and upper arms. She leaned back with a smile to enjoy her hard earned treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SNAP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her overworked chair collapsed, and her conversation was cut off with a loud \"AAAHH!\" as she fell backwards onto the floor. She landed with an almighty crash that echoed through the building, and the people on the floor below her looked up in fear and wondered if the floor was about to collapse under an errant I-beam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was aware of three very important things in the immediate aftermath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne: she was pretty sure she'd just split her clothes at work. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo: it takes a surprisingly long time for her jelly-like rolls to stop jiggling after a shock like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd three: she still had her doughnut. As the first people arrived to see what happened and offer assistance, Alice was already licking the last of the jam off her fingers...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<i>\"Where the heck is he!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was really starting to get worried. She'd ordered those pizzas almost thirty minutes ago, when it seemed like there would be plenty of time for the delivery guy to get here. But now, she was down to four (<i>\"Just four!\"</i>) slices, and was starting to panic a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He'd better hurry up,\"</i> Alice thought as she crammed one of her remaining slices in her trembling maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had been given a week off in lieu of the chair-crushing incident to give her time to recuperate, and she'd tacked on a week's worth of vacation days to give herself a nice, long break. Unlike most people, however, Alice had spent her entire break on the couch stuffing her face. Between online grocery purchases and delivery meals, she hadn't even attempted to leave her place in the last twelve days, and certainly wasn't going to start today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buzzer sounded off, bringing a smile to her face, and causing her to start drooling. Alice now began the long, arduous process of getting her fat ass off the couch. She couldn't just slide forward, as her gigantic cheeks would drag the couch cushions off with her. Instead, she shuffled from side to side, moving her body forward a bit at a time. Already, she was getting red in the face and short of breath, as this was the hardest she ever worked anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bzzzzzzzt!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm *gasp* coming, *gasp, gasp* keep *gasp* your pants *gasp, gasp* on,\" Alice half shouted-half panted as the buzzer sounded again. She'd finally made her way to the edge of the couch, and, placing one hand on her end table and squaring off her feet, prepared to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrrrrrrrrgh!\" Alice let out a grunt of exertion as she forced herself upright on the second attempt. Her table creaked loudly as she did so. Already, the piece of furniture had a noticeable bend to it from the number of times she'd abused it lately. Alice wiped the sweat from her brow as she began to waddle towards the door. Her thighs had grown so immense that she nearly had to turn sideways to get one foot in front of the other, and all her precariously swaying flesh did nothing to help her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have got to give him his own key or something. This is getting ridiculous...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice grabbed as much of her huge belly as she could and tried to pry it off her steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not having much luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she'd had any doubts about whether or not she'd gained over her extended sick time, they were gone now. Alice had put her car seat as far back as it would let her, but her enormous body had simply surged forward and flattened the wheel the moment she was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part of the ordeal, beyond how loud and public it was, had to be just how much of her was in the way. Her hips and ass were so large that she couldn't even reach the seat controls to try and grab an extra inch. Her tits were so big and propped so high on her immense belly that she couldn't see a thing below her chin except flesh! Copious amounts of lardy, fatty, jiggly flesh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't even get her one leg in the car at all, not that it would have mattered much. Even with her right ass cheek and thigh covering the center console, her left hip stuck far out the door, precluding any chance of closing the aperture anytime soon. And even if she could have closed the door, it's not like Alice could drive like this, anyway. She could barely move, and her arms were so thick with fat that they were almost immobile against the rest of her. With a lot of difficulty, Alice managed to get a hand on her purse and dig out her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing a little, Alice made three calls. The first was to the office, claiming she'd been in a car wreck and couldn't come in, which was pretty easy with the horn sounding non-stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was to her building's superintendent to help her get out of her car, as her fat ass was completely wedged in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed some more as she dug a 3 Musketeer bar out of her purse and devoured the sweet treat with indecent haste. She placed her third call as she opened and ate another bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ling's Chinese? I'd like to place a delivery order for the Dinner for 12. My address is...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice heard another knock on her door. <br>\r\n<i>Ugh, who is it now?</i><br>\r\nShe began the long and hard task of getting up from her normal napping state. These days, if she wasn't eating, she was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her gut had long since developed into a great double-folded gut which stuck out a foot and a half, draped in an online-ordered shirt which was enough to cover her massive, fat torso. In the weeks - maybe months - she had spent off, 'ballooning' would be the only word adequate to describe what had happened to her. Her eating disorder combined with her lack of activity in any regard had been disastrous for her weight. Tens of thousands of calories each day had sent her up a hundred pounds easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms were great rolling tubes of fat, like pastry tubes full of custard and equally jiggly. Her breasts, free of the constraint of a bra, bounced atop her stomach, always the dominant force in the relationship, though her breasts approached the cusp of the stomach like two gelatinous demi-orbs of fat, laying flatter to her stomach against the pressure of her shirt. Alice heaved a deep breath to try to stand up. She learned better  than to lean on the table, and so she had begun trying to use the arm of her couch. It had served her well, but just then she noticed that the arm had begun to try and bend - it was too late, a 'Crack' left the wooden spine of the arm laying dangling within the cloth. Alice had not been able to stand up, and was still on the couch. She shuffled over to the other side of the couch by sidling over, jiggling her immense, fat body as she eventually arrived, short of breath, to the other side of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her cup of soda and drank - she seemed to always be thirsty these days, even though she was doing nothing. She sat there for a moment, panicking about what was going to happen. The knock came again. \"Hello? Al?\" Alice recognized the voice, and the panic in it - it was Christina. Alice sat and called out with the power in her fat-laden lungs. \"Christie, hey...Check to the right side o...of the door...key there..in the rocks..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, the door opened. Christina had put on a few pounds herself - around ten or so, which showed themselves only in the heightened fullness of her thighs and a belly that was just that much more broad. Christina was shocked quite plainly. \"Jeez, Al..\" she said. Alice laid back in apathy and shame. She felt the eyes of Christina. It felt almost as if Stephanie had come back. Alice's heart picked up in rate as Christina spoke. \"I figured something was up, but dear god, girl.\" Christina came up to Alice through the hoard of undiscarded pizza boxes and a corner full of plastic containers. Christina spoke up. \"Listen, uh, I figured you were having some problems.\" Alice took a sharp breath through her nose - and mouth, the weight on her lungs was too heavy for just one or the other - and began to speak. \"I don't know anymore, Christie.\" She took another one. Her eyes began to wetten and she began to sob, her great gut and massive chest heaving. \"I - I get so fat, I figure there's - there's nothing to do but eat, and get bigger, and fatter, I can't...\" she took a moment to breathe, but she couldn't continue as she broke down into tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina patted her on her shoulder. Before, when such had been done, Christina could at least feel the bone of the shoulder below. But the fat accumulated in the months since Christina had last seen Alice had taken their toll - the bone was completely intangible, it was as though she was touching a warm, gelatinous mass. \"I figured I ought to get you some help, girl. Let's help you up.\" At that, a strapping, bulky man and a lean, strong man entered and took Alice by her underarms, aided by Christina. The two struggled to lift the mass of fat that Alice had seemed to become. The task was arduous, but the two combined managed to lift the 600-some pound, elephantine woman. Alice was able to help them by waddling along as they brought her towards a comfortably - painted light red van with a logo on the side - \"Daniella's Eating Disorder Rehabilitation Services.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine remained with Alice through the waiting process. The waiting room was a mixture of characters - some skeletal and anemic, some approaching Alice's size. All eyes were on her, though. She felt it. Christine did her best to comfort Alice. As always, the massive woman's stomach rumbled. Alice gritted her teeth. She didn't want to say anything here about her hunger. It would make her seem ungrateful - not wanting help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice?\" called a voice. Christine and two aides helped Alice stand to. Christine helped Alice towards the door, but the attendant stopped her from following. \"Sorry - patient privacy, nobody else is allowed.\" Christina raised a brow. \"But I'm her best friend.\" The attendant sighed and spoke patiently. \"I get that, but it's just clinic policy. It's for her mental security.\" Christina sighed. She had hoped to be there for Alice in this moment, but she gave it up and drove back towards the office. Her own stomach rumbled -maybe she ought to grab something for the office?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was greeted by the sight of an average - built woman. She had some fat about her hips and her doctor's coat revealed a slight fatness about the waist, but to Alice's eyes and in comparison to Christina, she seemed positively slim. The red-headed woman spoke. \"Heyy, I'm Doctor Daniella Goodrich. So you came here for some help?\" Alice nodded and spoke. \"I just can't stop eating. Like, I physically can't stop. Even when I know I'm not hungry and when I know I shouldn't, I keep eating more and more, and it feels like I can't do anything..\" Goodrich nodded. She didn't stop Alice, but added on as Alice trailed off. \"Well, we can help with that. I'd like to know what you normally eat in a day.\" Alice sniffled. \"Well, I... I start off with some order-in breakfast... two sausage and gravy platters, two stacks of pancakes.. three sides of bacon, I love my bacon..\" Alice paused to take a breath. \"I drink, like, a cup of coffee with some regular coke... I eat some donuts for something sweet, like two or three, not many..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dizzying list went on. Breakfast alone had over 3,000 calories. She ate well over the same number for snacks, with 4,000 calories at lunch and 5,000 at supper. There was no wonder that this woman was massive. Daniella spoke up. \"Well, that's a lot of food. So it seems you've been doing what we call binging. That's not a judgement, but it's just a term. How long has this been happening?\" Alice wiped at her eyes. \"Uh... a month, a few months...I think it started around easter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniella kept a damn good poker face, a sympathetic one, but if her face spoke what she felt, she'd be gawking. This woman had gained something in the span of 100 pounds in a month. It was only May 18th, easter was a month and five days ago. \"Well, we can help you. Are you comfortable getting on a scale?\" Alice took a moment to breathe. She dreaded it, but she was curious in a way. \"Uh... yeah..\" Daniella looked at her. \"You don't have to get on, you can just avoid it if you want to.\" Alice shook her head. \"No, I want to get onto the scale.\" Daniella smiled. \"Excellent.\" She turned to a great slab of steel in front of a digital display and indicated. \"Step on, when you're ready.\" Alice felt truly comforted by Daniella. Part of it was in the way she phrased things, the other was that comforting smile. Another thing was her form - she didn't feel like stick-slim Stephanie, always judging her wordlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stepped on. The numbers ticked up and down, and then arrived at a number - 659.283. Alice stared at the number in despair. Daniella noted the number and turned the scale off. \"It's okay, it's okay. You didn't try to do this - you have a problem. But you can help that, if you let us help you.\" Alice turned to Daniella and asked with sorrow, \"How the hell can you do that?\" Daniella nodded and spoke. \"Well, part one is therapy - we need to help you understand exactly where this comes from.\" Alice nodded. \"Part two is nutrition - helping you get a better direct relationship with food. No dieting required - just good eating. Part three is optional - exercise. I definitely recommend it.\" Daniella added very quickly, \"Mainly because it helps you divert your attentions from your inner demons, and it also helps you reduce your weight. The habits you're at right now put you at big risk, and reducing your weight to whatever you're comfortable with will make you overall a healthier person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice contemplated. \"You can feel free to back out, if you want. I hope you stay and let us help, but you're making the decisions.\" <br>\r\nAlice accepted. She felt genuinely welcome here with Daniella, and she knew what awaited her at home. She figured being here a while would definitely have helped her out. She needed it, and she knew it.</span></div></div>",

It landed on the gang of Christine, Melissa and Courtney. Victoria waddled in at the end of Marni's line. Her fat form approached like a great flabby pear, bloated by a good 2 inches in the hip, maybe 1 in the waist. The bottom- heavy emphasis on her gains resulted in the bottom of her blouse failing to cover the lower part of her stomach. \"Hey, girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney swivelled her head. She had gained significantly in her face, stomach and thighs - her head looked like it was mounted on a small mound of fat, thick at the back and a double-chin which began to become less of a flap below her chin and more of a \"necklace\" of fat. Her gut had grown a good half hand's length, still lacking behind the mammoth fostered by Alice but not insignificant in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Vic,\" spoke Courtney, \"how's it going with you?\" Victoria shrugged her shoulders and spoke, \" Better the Alice. Is it true that she's in rehab?\" Christina nodded. \"I had to help take her. She was in a real bad way, she couldn't get off her couch without help. She looked bigger than Jenna did when she left - she looked like a blob.\" The group hummed in concern. \"Yeah,\" spoke Melissa, \"I was getting afraid that she was going to eat herself to death. I hope she gets the help she needs at Rehab.\" Melissa's slimming had slowed, the reason why plain as the donut in her hand. It was nearly impossible to lose weight in the office for a reason. Her waist had shrunk a good inch, she even seemed to be in a smaller blouse. Her morose face spoke her concern. \"All that fast food isn't good for your heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria spoke up, \"Yeah, we'll need her around for a while. She's real nice to have in a pinch. But yeah, she was ordering so much food I could barely get new copy paper in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a decently long silence, filled only with Cass ranting about the coldness of the studio. \"Oh,\" said Christina, \"did you hear,\" she said, planting one flabby hand on the table as she spoke. \"That intern who was bringing Al her food got canned?\" Courtney chuckled bemusedly, her knowing smile indicating everything. Melissa queried \"No, what happened?\" \"Well,\" said Christina, \"It started with Jessica, she's been packing it on lately, and when she saw that the Intern wasn't carrying food for Al, she tried to order the intern to get her, like, two pizzas and garlic bread.\" Christina paused to drink some coffee. The room grew tense until she resumed. \"She. Flipped. Out!\" \"What'd she say,\" asked Victoria, \" What'd she say?\" Christina spoke up. \"She said something like,\" Christina assumed a low, faux-angry voice. \"If you want your diabetes, go get it yourself! I'm not fattening you stupid cows any more! I'm not your feeder, you dumb fat bitch!\" The rest of the room gawked at the re-telling. Christina resumed normally, \"They had to pull Jess off of her, and Courtney fired her the next day.\" The rest of the office cackled. </span></div></div>",

Taking a moment to pick out the loose bits of skin from the bottom of the container, she slurped the deep-fried goodness off her fingers. Pitching it aside. she leaned her enormous, flabby body to the side. It took her a couple of attempts, but with a throaty \"oomph,\" she managed to get her fingers around the next tub and drag it to her greedy maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two weeks had not been kind to Alice. Even without her subconscious, her belly had been massively stretched by her rampant overeating, meaning it needed far more food to feel full. Combined with her inner demons, and its demands to be fed had been nearly deafening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatters had taken an even worse turn when she found one of her old high school year books. Alice had taken some of her therapist's advice and tried to clean her place, which was admittedly rather difficult at her size. Still, she'd persevered and managed to get a couple old boxes of books on shelves when she found the photos of her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been so different in high school. Thin, pretty, popular, voted Most Likely to Succeed. She'd been the envy of the girls of her school, and the boys would have given anything just to date her. <i>\"If only they could see me now,\"</i> Alice thought as she scarfed down another piece of chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing herself as she'd been in her junior year and comparing it to the amorphous blob she'd become had been too much for the poor young woman to bear. Attempts to get hold of Daniella had been fruitless endeavors. Unknown to her, Daniella was dealing with several life-or-death cases at the moment, and her secretaries were keeping Alice and other secondary clients in the dark as to why she was unavailable in the name of confidentiality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Alice fell back on the only thing she seemed to do anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had spent the last two weeks eating, and eating, and eating. Ordering greasy and sugary foods in ungodly massive quantities, Alice stuffed herself to the point of painfully full, slept, then woke up to do it all again. Time had lost all meaning, except where what places were open was concerned. Her belly <b>needed</b> to be full at all hours of the day, and she was only too keen to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also some of the delivery guys to consider. While some were flat-out disgusted with her and made no attempt to hide it, others had been more... accommodating. The delivery drivers for Orange Star Pizza had been particularly forward, with one of them even suggesting a camera set up for online viewing, insisting that people would pay to see her. Alice had been both rather disbelieving and a little uncomfortable with his claims, but she'd been willing to tolerate him for the food her brought her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, a couple of them had even been kind enough to help her move around her apartment when she needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already overflowing waistline had taken the brunt of the abuse she was heaping on it. Even in her gargantuan internet clothes, her body was stretching the material dangerously thin. Alice thought she might have already burst the inseam of her pants, but her gigantic gut rolls and massive mammaries kept her from seeing or feeling if that was the case. Her shoulders and upper arms had surpassed being ham sized and seemed keen on outgrowing turkeys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd taking all that into consideration, it was really saying something that she could still see her ass without any difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice ate and ate, her long suffering couch was beginning to creak ominously. She'd already broken both arms on the piece of furniture, which sagged uselessly in the cloth upholstery. As she crunched into another greasy morsel, the body of the couch gave way with a mighty crack. Alice gasped as she felt herself drop 18 or so inches, hitting the floor with an almighty thud. A mix of couch and fat crashed into the wall behind as she struck earth, and the accompanying cracks informed her that she'd certainly destroyed a fair bit of her drywall and possibly the studs behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the jiggling of her lard subsided, Alice took stock of her situation. Her fat ass had already destroyed her bed, and now it seemed her couch had finally followed suit. Her shirt had ripped in multiple places, leaving her flabby flesh on display. Her pale skin was covered in stretch marks, and had been slick with sweat since her a/c broke down last week. Her body's opulent deposits of sagging fat wobbled as she tried to grab what of her scattered chicken she could. She devoured what few pieces she could reach, cursing herself as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Of course my fat ass broke my couch. I'm so unbelievably fat. From prom queen to Jabba's sister, and I can't stop this. I just need to eat and eat and eat. It's all I can do, all I'm good at. Eating more and getting fatter. How much bigger can I even get? God, I'm so, so fat...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, Alice had finished what chicken she could reach. Groaning, she tried and failed to reach anymore of the chicken that had scattered across the floor, succeeding only in tearing more holes in her clothes. \"C'mon, c'mon!\" she muttered as she tried to reach the rolling cart the delivery guys brought her latest feast in on (as if she needed any proof that they were trying to fatten her further).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ergh! Damn it!\" Alice fell back panting, her back hurting and her legs wiggling uselessly in their excessively fatty casing. Perhaps this morning she could have walked, even with immense difficulty, but after all she'd had today, that ship had sailed. Pinned under her lard, she felt herself tear up with a sense of mounting horror. She wasn't crying because she was immobile, if only temporarily. Not because she was out of control, which she totally was. Not because she desperately needed help, which she really did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she was crying because she couldn't reach her food, eat it, and get even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with me!?\" Alice dug her left hand into beachball-sized breast's equally massive bra. Fishing around her overflowing bra cup, she dug out her cell phone from its jiggly prison. Alice's belly let out a terribly loud growl as she called...</span></div></div>",

By the time the order was placed, she had ordered that plus a large cookie - for something sweet, of course. The irony of ordering all this food was not lost on the stocky, olive-skinned delivery man. He looked at the couch and spoke. \" Wow, miss Alice, that couch is broken pretty bad.\" Alice sniffled. \"Yeah, Greg, it's broken pretty bad. Just set that pizza on the table, will ya?\" Greg did so. As he walked, he pondered, <i> Just how damn fat do you have to be to not care about that?</i> As he regarded the piles of delivery from today alone, he decided, <i> About that fat.</i> He sighed and spoke, \"Lemme help you get up.\" He braced himself for the task - Alice in this sorry, blob - like state looked like a daunting task. Alice spoke up. \"Sure, thanks..\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg took a deep breath and tried to pull by Alice's flabby underarms, reached only by a dedicated drive by his hands to penetrate the fat folds and flab of her arms. The clammy, jiggly, unwashed folds repulsed Greg - but if he didn't help, this whale would lay on her cracking floor forever. He heaved as Alice tried to get up as well, and with a great heave, Alice stood on her two feet. She looked exhausted from this miniscule feat, but went for her wallet. She paid the Delivery man, who spoke. \"You know, you should get some help if you need help moving around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next week, Alice had a fresh routine. She now laid in an ultra-strong, widened gurney in her living room atop where her couch had once been. She didn't care about the damage - to her house or herself. She meekly accepted the  fact that she couldn't move and only needed a hand opening the door and occasionally a bath. A fat attendant now lived in her bed, her name was Sandra. She was almost just like Alice was around 400 pounds ago - a belly - gaining blonde, eating her way to Alice's fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was not exactly in a prime state of health beyond her bed - bound nature. Her perpetual windedness had only gotten worse with her gain, but luckily Sandra happily provided an oxygen tank hooked up to Alice's nose via a catheter. As a benefit, Alice could speak more. For her other ailments, an array of pills were now necessary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Alice began not to care. She began to live merely to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more months passed, and Alice soared over 700 pounds. She neared 800 as her face began to be eternally sunken behind rolling hills of fat.  Her stomach rose above her a foot, a feat only achievable by such a fat beast as Alice. Her legs almost seemed to merge as they rubbed together at the thigh. Alice could feel her sheer weight pressing her organs in. <br>\r\nThe only thing that made anything bearable was Sandra. She always tried to keep Alice's mind off of her condition - always talking about something but her weight.  \" So, who you got for the Stanley cup?\" Alice nodded firmly. \"Oh, Caps for sure. Saanin has a beautiful way with the stick, just, \" Alice swung an imaginary hockey stick, aiming away from her oxygen. \"Wha-bow! So precise, too.\" <br>\r\nSandra, however, didn't feel too discouraged by Alice's state in terms of her habits. Whenever Alice ordered, she'd slip in a \"little\" something. She wasn't quite binging like Alice, but she was plumping up at a fair rate. From the August when she was hired until that late October, her great gut grew about three inches to about 63, and her legs grew more gelatinous. Her ass lagged behind in it's gains, always smaller than the rest of her. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The elevator opened on the fat, fat form of Jessica, entering the usual 11th floor den of the group, while the normal pod of fat women jawed away in the break room before cracking at the morning workload. Jessica had grown considerably since joining Gordge at an already large 300 pounds. In her first three years, she'd gained 40 pounds - and by this time, five years after, she had gotten up to 400, square and even. Her gut was every bit of 65 inches, being similarly belly-centered to Alice, with more of her fat distributing to her arms and thighs, with considerably less going to her breasts. Her body resulted in what resembled an apple - her great, girthy stomach - thickly bordered by flabby arms, pumped with fat, and thighs which gave her legs staying power against the might of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her department, she was somewhat fat. But in her department, the thin interns which put on a bit of the gordge weight either transferred away and lost the weight, or got with the program and fattened up. But few adapted to the environment like Jessica, the only thing stalling her temporary rise was the lack of openings. That had been mostly fixed with the  semi-opening of Alice's position<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so are you firing Alice?\" inquired Christina with a wan face. \"No, I'm not firing her.\" spoke Courtney to her and Melissa in the break room. \"But she's been MIA for 7 months, from what I hear literally eating up her paid sick leave, and straight-up abandoning the rehab we helped fund. I'm cutting her off on the paid leave so that I can pay Jessica to do her job until she finds some way to get back to work.\" Melissa spoke up. \"So is there a cut-off point?\" Courtney spoke with obvious forethought to the question. \"It's November, and if she's not back in by New Year's day, whether it's in crutches or what have you, she's out and being replaced by Jessica.\" Melissa and Christina sighed. \"But we love Alice..\" Courtney spoke up. \"So do I, and I've been hoping she's okay. But while I love accommodating you guys, I can't enable you guys to take me for a free ride. Had enough of that as an intern.\" Courtney crossed her lardy forearms atop her bulging, rolling stomach which exceeded all others in the room as Courtney's busy-eating had taken her up to 550. \"If Alice can't work by New Year 2020, she's fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the girthy and bubbly Jessica entered the room. Oddly, however, she was, in fact, below average. Christina's fat had continued piling on - the liberation of snack domination from Alice's grip had given Christina a free hand in eating more, and over the three months since Alice had seen her, she'd gone up from around 450 to 480 while Melissa had held steady at 420, but her determination began to show signs of wavering as she began slipping in a donut or two more each day. \"Hey, Jess!\" Jessica wobbled towards Melissa, an old pal in Gluttony, and the two still considerably blubbery women hugged, smushing their two great guts together. Jessica looked at Melissa's stomach. \"No way, you've been losing weight on us, girlie?\" Melissa chuckled. \"Nah, just staying the course - trying to slow down. Don't wanna eat myself silly like someone.\" Jessica hummed in understanding. \"Yeahhh, heard about Al, sad story. I heard that there's an ambulance at her house, like, every day now, or something like that. Maybe it wasn't one of those emergency ones, but one of those.. I don't know, private ones?\" The group raised eyebrows at Jessica. She chuckled and shrugged. \"We're getting to where Jessica doesn't even understand herself.\" spoke Courtney. The four laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe topic returned to Jessica, \"So, I heard you blew up on an intern the other day.\" spoke Melissa. Jessica's face turned red with rage with the memory. \"Don't fuckin' get me started on that bitch, oooohhh, the nerve. I ask her to do something simple, just bring something back on me, then she goes off on me like I'm asking her to kill her baby!\" Courtney chuckled. \"I soo enjoyed firing her. My favorite firing.\" Jessica turned to Courtney. \"What's your second favorite?\" Courtney thought, then spoke. \"There was this bigger girl - Madison - she was about 400,she was big. Had a heart attack, had to lose weight for medical reasons. Understandable. But when she came back, she thought she was a health guru. She had to go when I caught her trying to destroy other people's fast food orders - something about \"I'm just trying to help them, I'm just trying to help..\"\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group had a good chuckle before the work rhythm set in. Jessica pulled her suitcase into Jessica's office. The chair had to be replaced, obviously, as it had been broken badly by Alice the last time she was at work, 7 months ago. Her snacks were gone -shipped back home and consumed within 2 days. Jessica set down her suitcase,and began unpacking her belongings onto Jessica's desk. She was happy to be here, truly she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if the stories and rumors about Alice's health were to be believed, she truly didn't want to be here because of what was going on. Alice's long seclusion had given way to rumor en masse. Everything was being suggested from a theory that she was getting weight loss surgery, to the idea that she had a heart attack and died, to the idea that she was bed-bound now, and needed help moving. Mary Jolynne suggested that Alice was secretly cavorting with freemason lizards, to channel the apocalypse to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many people listened to Mary. The most logical idea seemed to be the bed-bound theory - if Alice was dead, people would know. Jessica was hoping that it was not weight loss surgery - she was truly an embodiment of an old world mother - she believed that bigger meant healthier, or at least happier. If that was the case, Alice would be bouncing with joy. But most unfortunately, she could barely bounce from the constraints of her gurney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica adapted quickly to the workflow in this high branch of the office. While she loved to eat, she also knew she had to work - she knew that there had to be a balance between the two. She tried to put the worries over Alice's condition behind her, and focus on her job. In her first week, she was very productive - exceeding easily Alice's last hours of productivity. If Alice was to be pink-slipped, Jessica had a promising career to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, if she could avoid eating herself into immobility, like Alice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The city in which Gordge was nestled turned into its usual white-matted self as the first snows came in later November. Of course, with the snows came the holidays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the holidays came the exact type of treats which Jessica was sipping on and munching on as she breathily trudged into the office. It was the monday after Thanksgiving, and she had stuffed herself to bursting - her waistline already had begun to tell the effects of the first few weeks of the holiday season - it had expanded a good inch already, and that extra inch gave her buttoned - up blouse, upsized on her promotion, that extra inch of tightness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sipped idle-mindedly on her white - chocolate peppermint latte. The drink easily had 400 calories, but her chocolate-brownie-batter-donut had around 450. She was averaging about four of these a day - paired together, of course. She sat typing in her slouched-forward pose that she usually worked in. This accented perfectly her already increasing fatness - her great stomach rolled towards her knees, about five inches short of the goal, slowed by her fat thighs which, in their growth, fought Jessica's pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in addition to her snacks, Jessica had to share holiday lunches with the group. These were special occasions - catering was brought in for holiday lunches, but not decently healthy sandwiches and chips. Horrifically decadent pasta dishes, double-patty burgers with all the bacon and sauce that the blimping women of the office loved. Christina munched on a monster of a burger while Melissa treated herself to a plate of pasta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's hips and waist had resumed their old forward march, and Christina had noticed. She subtly intoned, \"So, Mel, how's the gym been treating you?\" Melissa shrugged. \"It's too damn cold to get to the gym. Plus, it's the holidays - I can put it off for a while.\" Christina smiled. \"Atta girl. I was worried you weren't gonna be yourself this holiday season.\" Melissa snorted a laugh. \"Well, I'm still me. What, did you think I was lay off sweets for the holidays? I'm Me, you know I wouldn't do that!\" Jessica followed up as she munched on her second plate of pasta. \"I had a cousin who would diet specifically over the holidays. That was like, five years ago - this past Thanksgiving, I saw her, she was like 200 pounds heavier.\" Christina spoke up. \"I mean, what did she expect she'd do? Starving yourself while everyone else is stuffing themselves isn't something that's gonna last. Shit, I'm amazed she didn't get fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's gains -had- started slowing leading up to Thanksgiving. She had only gotten up to 485 - but with the holidays cranking her eating up beyond maximum, she was eating almost at an Alice-like level, slowed only by the fact that she was still at work. While Jessica was up an inch, Christina over the past two weeks was up easily three, and her work clothes were showing it, as well as her physicality. It had been a great while since Christina had even attempted exercise, but walking to the copier or the break room felt like epic treks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the break room, a team of unfamiliar feet tread, with a slight shuffle of something else. The group watched as two movers shoved a box along the turquoise carpet of the hallway. The group, one Hispanic man and one man of indeterminate origin looked in at the group while they caught their breath. \"Holdon,\" spoke the mixed-race man pushing from the back while the Hispanic man leant on the box, sneaking a sideways glance at the break room. They had to stop themselves from outright gawking at the gluttony before them, each woman at the break room like a great glob of fat shoved into a suit, and given sometimes equally, sometimes less fat legs and arms. Christina spoke up. \"Need some help?\" The mixed-race man spoke in an english accent to Christina. \"Yeah,\" he said, pronouncing a hidden 'r' afterwards, \"where's, er, Courtney?\" Melissa spoke up. \"Oh, uh, she's just down the hall and to the left. To the right of the Printer there, at the end of the hall.\" The mixed-race man raised two fingers to his forehead, horizontally, and shot it towards Melissa in a salute. \"Right, cheers. Don't mind us.\" He got back to his side, having caught his breath and gotten his directions, resumed shoving the box. It was then that the group noticed what was on the label of the box: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WorkEffic Treadmill Desk - Standing/Walking Combination Work Desk'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group shot surprised glances at each other. \"What does Courtney need with a treadmill desk?\" asked Jessica. Christina shrugged, \"Maybe a snippy early Christmas gift? I got one of those one year from my cousin Doris - she just stopped coming to Christmas dinners when I'm there. More ham and cake for me.\" </span></div></div>",

Alright. You as well. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra hung up the phone, her meaty arm shaking as she put the hand set down. The pudgy nurse had put on a considerable amount of weight since she started working with Alice, and that process had only accelerated as of late. She was now living with Alice full time to better help with her needs, but one obvious result was a clear spike in her consumption. Already a terrible snacker, she was only eating more frequently and larger portions as time went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined with the recent deluge of holiday goodies, and it wasn't much of a surprise that Sandra had put on a good amount of weight. Her belly and bust had borne the brunt of her recent gain. Her gut rolls drooped down heavily and spread a good distance across her lap when she was seated, which was quickly becoming her natural state of being. Her breasts, meanwhile, had become huge, lardy things totally devoid of any self-support, resting heavily on her enlarged belly those days she chose to go braless. She was currently wearing her largest pair of scrubs, and would very soon need to replace the all-too-tight garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still looked minuscule next to Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing on the counter to help herself up, Sandra rose with a grunt of effort. Grabbing a couple boxes of doughnuts from the table, she sampled a couple on the short walk to Alice's room. She heard the sounds of eating long before setting eyes on its sole occupant. Once she turned the corner, Alice was pretty hard to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past few months, Alice had put on a bit of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that. Alice had put on a ton of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even the minimal exercise of walking to her desk, and nothing getting in the way of her eating, Alice's weight had simply exploded. She had quite literally spent every waking moment stuffing her face with the fattiest, greasiest, or most sugary foods she could lay her pudgy mitts on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that her nurse could bring her, rather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had been having mobility issues back in the spring and, just like her, those had grown immensely. By summer, she'd been unable to rise and walk unaided, and she hadn't even tried to move since November. And so, she'd just laid in bed, stuffing herself until her belly hurt, followed by sleeping it off, then doing it all again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps somewhat ironically, her finances had never been better. Alice was now on long-term disability, which was netting her a solid chunk of change each month. On top of that, she'd finally caved to the pizza guy's suggestion about the cam site. And though Alice was loathe to admit it, he'd definitely been right about the audience. She'd made over $500 her first day, and that amount had increased exponentially since she started eating on stream for money. She hadn't even had to send Sandra on a grocery run since her web guy set up a bot for her fans to purchase her food and have it sent to her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's growing fan base were sending her an absolute mountain of food, and she was only too eager to find a place for all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra looked over her greatly bloated charge. Her double wide gurney had been replaced with a massively overbuilt medical bed, which was currently tilted forward. Alice's belly was beyond huge. Divided into four massively thick rolls, her gut was a mass of stretch marks and cellulite. It rose above her frame by about two feet, and stretched to both sides of her bed and down to her knees. Her gargantuan breasts were as big as medicine balls, and rested both on and to each side of her belly. They had adjoining rolls of fat under her arms, and the two together greatly hindered her arm movements and left her limbs splayed out to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms were flabby things, grown to near-uselessness by sheer fat. Her upper arms were the size of large turkeys, and her forearms were as thick around as many peoples' thighs. Even her hands, which had remained thin and dexterous in the face of her positively massive gain for so long, had begun to grow into clumsy, chubby mitts. Despite the general ineptitude of her remaining useful limbs, their ability to funnel food to her mouth seemed undiminished. As Sandra watched, Alice was grabbing Christmas cookies by the fistful from the tins resting on her belly like a lardy, fleshy table, moving them to her mouth as fast as she could swallow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had taken a fair share of her newfound poundage, as well. Her plump, greasy lips were half hidden behind the smothering embrace of her softball sized cheeks, and her large triple chin rested on her plump chest, which wobbled with each shuddering breath. Even her neck had gotten fat, and Sandra knew if she pulled Alice's hair to the side, she'd find a large and growing roll of blubber starting just behind her ears and running down to her massive shoulders. Her face was well marked with spots of grease and crumbs, as Alice had been filling her bottomless belly since 8 o'clock this morning, and currently showed no signs of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her back had gotten larger, and there were times that Sandra was convinced that she could see Alice rising higher in bed day by day as those thick, heavy rolls grew even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's lower half had taken the brunt of her new girth, however. Her ass was beyond enormous, overhanging both sides of her bed. Sandra knew it was only a matter of time before they'd have to move Alice to an even larger throne, and at her size, it was becoming a dicey prospect. At her weight, even with help the nurse wasn't sure if Alice could move, and she was only getting fatter by the day. Her butt cheeks and love handles were so huge that even her massive belly couldn't cover them, and the suffering skin holding in that ungodly quantity of fat resembled nothing so much as a road map of Utah stretched over an overstuffed bag of gravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs were separate entities only in the loosest sense of the word. Even Sandra with her sizable weight gain was smaller around the waist then Alice's significantly larger thighs. Her fat stuffed pelvis, or \"gunt\" to use the somewhat inappropriate slang, had inflated larger then a basketball. Both her thighs and pelvis, however, were well hidden under Alice's unbelievably huge belly, leaving only a sliver of her thighs protruding from the sides of that mass of blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer knees could only be found by locating the dimples that divided her leg fat, and even these were starting to fill in as her body grew ever more rotund. Her calves outsized Sandra's thighs, and even her feet were rounding out as Alice's body struggled to find more places to store her unbelievable quantities of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer scale of Alice's belly, the thickness and depth of her rolls, and the fact that they were growing by the day all added up to one thing; namely, that one of Sandra's core duties, keeping her charge clean, was getting unbearably difficult. Sandra required the help of a lot of increasingly long-handled tools to scrub out Alice's deepest crevices, crease being too small a word in her mind. Her belly gave the nurse no end of trouble, and there were many days that Sandra could barely shift it. More and more frequently, the nurse was finding herself a panting, sweaty mess by the time she was done cleaning the unnaturally huge woman, and she was quite certain she'd very soon need to bring in some extra staff to help her deal with her charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought that part of her problem stemmed from her own increasing mass never entered her mind. She was also rather hesitant about bringing another couple of people in. Although she knew she needed the help, and honestly should get Alice to a hospital, this was frankly the best job she'd ever had. She was paid very well for doing practically no work, save getting Fattie Cakes more food, and was loathe to lose that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Besides,\"</i> she thought, <i>\"she's remarkably healthy for a woman her size. Save for slightly high blood pressure and needing some additional vitamins, she's doing stunningly well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's gorging was accompanied by loud, hoggish grunting, her body slick with sweat despite her a/c pumping at max, her arm fat creasing to the point of contortion as she forced herself to surmount the sheer obstacle her body had become, all in her desperate need to feed herself. She strained against her twin enemies, her mass and gravity, not caring how much harder this would be tomorrow as she continued her marathon eating session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of what she was doing to her health, or what her family and friends might say, or the fact that she was panting and sweating like she'd just finished a day of track and field from merely <b>eating</b>, meant absolutely nothing to her. In fact, there was only one reason she stopped eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand closed around the last six cookies in the tin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuffed all six into her mouth at once, a process made more difficult as her arm fat bunched up and tried to limit the action, and her wobbly cheeks caught on the edges of the cookies. Alice pushed the empty tins off her belly and looked around, her piggish eyes desperately seeking out her next course as she chewed her final cookies. She saw Sandra standing there with those two wonderfully big boxes of donuts, and reached out her gargantuan arms to receive them. She was barely able to raise them high enough, and their anvil-heavy bags of fat remained inert on her belly, only jiggling slightly at what was, for Alice, an excessively huge maneuver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, perfect timing. I was worried I was going to start wasting away. Thanks, Sandra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra cleared her throat before she spoke.</span></div></div>",

She might have been enamored with her job, perhaps even criminally negligent with regards to her charge's health and well being, but she wasn't totally irresponsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"... you know, when I think about it like that, I really sound like kind of a bitch.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra mentally shook her head as she replied to Alice's query. \"They were phoning to see if you were planning to come back into work, and made it rather clear that, if you didn't at least make an effort to come in, your employment would be terminated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have just said fired,\" Alice said as she patted her belly, causing the lardy flesh to wetly ripple, indicating to Sandra that she should hand those donuts over. Preferably right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra placed the boxes of pastries on her greatly expanded belly, making sure that they were placed where they wouldn't slide out of her extremely limited reach. Drooling, Alice started pushing donuts into her mouth as Sandra said, \"I was trying to be delicate, Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Fair. *chew, swallow* So- *bite, chew* -what'd you tell them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that I would talk to you, and that either you or I would call them back with your response.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating another couple of pastries before responding, Alice swallowed an obscenely large mouthful before answering. \"Did you mention I probably weigh over a thousand pounds and can't even walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" Sandra told her, watching as she made her way through the box at an impressive pace, even with the conversation distracting her. It seemed Alice had picked up at least one talent from her time at Gordge Inc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, currently eating a boston creme, swallowed it nearly whole in her haste to answer. She tried to wipe off the creme that had smeared on her fat cheeks and large chins, but her arms were so large she could barely able get her hands to her mouth, and could only manage a cursory cleaning of her swollen features. \"Thank you,\" Alice said as Sandra wiped her face with a napkin. \"You told them that, and they still expect me to go in!? Seriously!? How would they propose I do that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't say, Miss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPP!\" Alice, despite herself, let out an impressive belch as she finished off the first box. She pushed it to the floor, and opened the second. She blushed a little in embarrassment, usually trying to keep the worst of her excesses behind closed doors, which was a little silly with the woman who washed her bloated, naked form. \"Excuse me. Well, there's no way I'll be going to work ever again. 'Come in to work' my foot. Just how,\" Alice questioned as she pushed a bear claw into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra made a quick mental note to get her some more food right away, as at her current pace, Alice would be out in the very near future. \"Should I call and tell them you quit, then, or do you want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was already starting to slide back into two handing her food. \"Neither. *bite, chew, swallow* Just let them fire me. It's easier to apply for E.I. when you're fired rather then quit. *bite, chew, swallow* These are really good. We got anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid that's the last of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's a shame,\" Alice said as she finished off the second box in record time. Adding the second container to the growing pile of garbage on her floor, she attempted to rub the spilled sugar off her belly. Unfortunately, it only stuck in the sweat, causing her to create something of a sticky mess on her cavernous gut. Sandra went to a nearby cart which had been loaded high with a large amount of delectables. Grabbing a large pizza box, she placed it on Alice's belly, amazed that even with her bed at a 30\u00b0 angle, her huge stomach managed to rise to her nose height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Alice began to dig into her pizza with gusto, the previous conversation nearly forgotten. Sandra, meanwhile, began to clean all the empties off the floor. \"What are we having for lunch, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that Alice regarded all she'd eaten so far as a preamble to her actual meal didn't even phase Sandra anymore. \"One of your fans, Sidmeister69xxx, placed an order for Chinese to arrive at 12:00. Didn't say what he ordered, only that it should be enough to fill you up. He did request you film it for the channel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he did.\" Alice kept eating her pizza, wiping any drops a grease off herself and bringing her fingers to her mouth. She sucked her digits dry, refusing to waste single calorie. She was beginning to pant harder, the effort of dividing her limited energy between eating and talking leaving her more winded then usual. \"Well, we should probably set up the camera, then. No need to disappoint them. *bite, chew, swallow* Do we have any pie left? Or cookies. I'd take cookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her horrifically obese charge another pizza and opening a box of Oreo's for her, as Alice no longer had the fine finger control for even that simple task, Sandra made her way to the kitchen. Alice had a 2 liter bottle of coke on the table set just below her head height with a long straw. Having emptied it into her bottomless gullet, Sandra went to grab her a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but wonder about Alice as she grabbed a new one from the fridge. <i>\"How many calories is she consuming everyday? 50,000? A hundred? Maybe more?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a pumpkin pie from the fridge while she had the door open. As she slathered it in a thick layer of whipped cream, she thought, <i>\"I wonder how much she even weighs? Seriously, how much fatter can she even get?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypocrisy of that thought was totally lost on Sandra as a seam on her pants gave way under the growing pressure of her own expanding tush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, meanwhile kept stuffing her face on her throne. Every now and again, a small, nearly imperceptible creak invaded the silence of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, silent except for the sounds of the gigantic fatty stuffing herself as much as possible in the center of the room. Grunts of exertion as she fought against her overwhelming large fatty protuberances mixed with the sounds of her panting as she pushed her air supply to its limits, refusing to slow her caloric intake long enough to even catch her breath. The end result was a sound not unlike a pig feeding at its trough, a simile that Alice felt was all too apt for her at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"God, I'm such a fat fucking pig. Screw whale, I'm just a living blob. I'm so hungry all the time, and I just want more food. No one's ever been as fat as me. Even Mel at her biggest was way smaller then this. I'm literally too fucking fat to walk, but God damn it, I'm so, so hungry.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of her best friend made Alice pause for a second, though she kept eating even through her moment. Alice had all but cut contact with everyone she knew, friend or family, after her weight left her bed-bound. At this moment, she couldn't help but miss Melissa, as the two hadn't talked in nearly seven or eight months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It'd be so nice to see her again, but I don't know if I could stand her to see me like this. What would I even say?\"</i> The slight creak once more invaded her private thoughts. <i>\"And I really hope that's just the bed giving out and not the floor.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's hands hit the bottom of her most recent culinary conquest. Unbelieving of even herself, she cried out, \"Sandra! Could you bring me some more pizza!?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice rubbed her gut as best she could, which is to say, not very well at all. Her sore stomach, packed drum tight with enough Chinese food to feed a family thrice over, was buried under such a deep layer of blubber that what little pressure her fat-engorged arms could muster had no chance of helping her poor belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSidmeister69xxx, whoever he was, had managed a nearly impossible feat: Alice was stuffed painfully full, and for an exceedingly rare moment, actually didn't feel like stuffing her face with whatever was on hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't to say Sandra wasn't preparing for the next feast, however. Moments like this were few and far between, and never lasted long in the wake of Alice's bottomless appetite. She was taking a moment to clean both the room and her charge, and was currently cleaning the remaining containers off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Alice softly groaned. \"I think I ate too much, even for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. You just don't remember what it's like being full,\" Sandra replied as she carried out the last bag of empties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice could only groan once more to an empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotund nurse came back with a pail of warm, soapy water and a sponge. She wiped the surface food and sweat stains off Alice, drying the soft, jiggly flesh with the towel she had thrown over her shoulder. Normally the immense blonde was quite ticklish, and she'd be wobbling like a sea of gelatin as she tried to hold back her laughter. For right now, though, it was all Alice could do to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her fingers up so Sandra could wipe them off, only managing to raise them a few scant inches. As the nurse cleaned her face, she moved Alice's cheeks and chins as she needed to make sure she didn't miss a spot. As she wiped off Alice's lips, she said, \"There, that's better. You just rest now, Miss Gellar. I'll get everything cleaned up out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded and leaned back to take a nap. Well, mentally at least, her vastly overfed frame having left her in a perpetual position of rest for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandra left the room, Alice closed her ice-blue eyes. Her ineffectual hands once more ran across her blubbery belly and lardy breasts. She thought about how unbelievably fat she already was. She thought about the enormous quantity of greasy, calorie-rich food packing her belly. She thought about how much she'd already eaten today. About how much more she was going to eat today, and about how much fatter it was all going to make her. She thought about her sister, and how Stephanie would react if she saw what Alice had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she knew that tomorrow, her sister would eat even more and get even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh God, I'm already drooling just thinking about eating.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecure in the knowledge that Sandra wouldn't be coming back right away, Alice felt comfortable enough to release a bit of gas she'd been holding in. A long, muffled \"pppppffffffffftttttttt!\" sounded out, buried deep within her vast, growing empire of fat. One unexpected consequence of her size that Alice had had to get used to was that her opulent, heaving rolls loved to trap her gas and release it at random intervals. Her body had basically turned into a hellish dutch oven, cooking harmless bum-burps into something the Germans would have used in the trenches of World War One. Alice could only hope that whatever part of her was blocking the methane's exit would shift and allow it to vacate the premises before Sandra came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, as much as I hate to say it, she has dealt with far worse from me,\"</i> Alice thought with some embarrassment. She felt a familiar bass rumble echo from her deeply buried stomach. The last truly powerful organ in her body was already hard at work, breaking down this huge boulder of calories and opening up space for Alice to add even more. Alice rubbed her belly once again as her mouth dealt with the unusual sensation of not-chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she contemplated the unbelievably heavy weight in her stomach, Alice slowly drifted off to sleep. As she at last nodded off, one final thought passed through her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"God damn it, why does this have to feel so good?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra closed the apartment door behind her after she returned from throwing out the trash. Making her way into the small office, she booted up Alice's computer and looked through the long list of pre-ordered meals her fans had already purchased for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A twenty piece bucket of chicken, with two salads, a family sized fries with gravy, and two three piece meals. That seems like the winner,\"</i> she thought as she placed the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had a stream later on today, during which her fans would be able to purchase her pizza which she'd then eat for her paying audience. Despite this, Sandra knew from prior experience that Fattie Cakes would wake up starving after only a couple hours, so she needed to make sure she had a meal on hand for the gargantuan glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I should probably get something for myself.\"</i> That thought was interrupted as the door buzzer sounded off. Sandra frowned as she looked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's way too fast for the food. Who could that be?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss? Miss Gellar? Miss, wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Alice awoke slowly as she became aware of Sandra gently shaking her shoulder fat. \"Is it already time for the stream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Miss,\" Sandra said as Alice yawned. The obese cutie stretched out as best she could, which at her size basically amounted to some light popping from her fingers and her arm fat briefly taking on some unusual creases. \"There's someone here to see you. A woman by the name of Melissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's eyes went wide as she felt her heart drop into her stomach. Her belly, grossly misinterpreting her brain's signals, growled in hunger and made ready for another impressive deluge of calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I let her in?\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice wasn't sure what made her let Melissa in, as she really, REALLY didn't want her to see what she'd become. But she'd been terribly lonely with only Sandra for company, and for her best friend to show up quite literally moments after she'd been thinking about talking to her again? It was too much to be just a coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... just give me a moment. A-and let her know, you know,\" Alice stuttered a bit. \"Just warn her about me. You know? At least try to make her ready for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Miss.\" Sandra nodded, and went out to get Melissa. Alice took several deep breaths. She could feel her heart pounding in her chest, her nerves firing on all cylinders. What would Melissa say when she saw her? Why hadn't she come to her before now? Why now? Why had she come to visit a fat-ass like her? Would she be mean about this? She'd been fat too, though not like this. A friend wouldn't just come here to photograph this and laugh, right? Were they even friends at this point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice felt ready to cry. <i>\"Why did I make myself so fat!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door to her room started to open, Alice closed her eyes, too scared to see Melissa's reaction. And so, the first thing she heard was Mel's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow. Holy. I mean, Jesus. Alice? Um, are you okay, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargantuan blonde felt her eyes beginning to tear up. \"No, Mel. I'm really not. That was a really stupid question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa winced, though Al didn't see it. \"Yeah, that was. Sorry, I really didn't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't worry about it, Mel. I know how big I am,\" she answered as she unconsciously rubbed her massive belly rolls. The ones she could reach, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa stepped forward and placed her hand on Alice's. \"Al, could you please open your eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to. I don't want to see your face when you look at me. I don't want to see you disgusted by me, or hate me, or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not disgusted by you, Al, and I definitely don't hate you. Never have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why didn't you come before!?\" Alice opened her eyes as she gave that outburst. She found herself looking into Melissa's face, and true to her word, there wasn't a hint of disgust in her features. She didn't seem to have changed at all from Easter to Alice's eyes. She'd been lighter then Al then, and seemed to be holding the course, which only made her feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Melissa's weight loss had begun to reverse slightly. While she was still lighter then she'd been this time last year, holiday snacking had added to Melissa's waist line. Her hips had widened and her belly was drooping lower then it had been a few months ago, but this was far more noticeable to the girls in the office then it was to Al, as they'd watched her build back up to about 450 pounds. It certainly didn't help that, compared to herself, Alice could define everyone as skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I texted you, you said you dealing with some stuff, but would be fine! You told me not to come! What was I supposed to do, just barge in!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I don't know, alright! I really don't know! I was just so hungry and ate until I disappeared and I missed you, okay! I missed you, and wanted you here, but I didn't want you to see me like this, so I just sat alone and ate more and got even fatter, and I kept hoping someone, anyone, would come here, and then even my therapist left me and all I could do was eat and eat and eat, and-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al, Al! Calm down, okay, just calm down!\" Melissa rubbed Alice's hand as the bigger girl sobbed, tears falling freely down her face. Melissa hugged her as best as she could. It took her quite awhile to start calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, *sniff* sorry, I just-\" \"It's okay, Al, it's okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she calmed down a little, Melissa said, \"You feeling any better, Alice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled a little. \"Not really, but a little bit. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to thank me. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween sniffles, Alice asked, \"So what made you come now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel sighed, as she really hadn't been looking forward to this conversation. \"Well, I take it you haven't heard much from the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'll be fired soon, if that's what you mean. I didn't even think I was still on the paperwork, to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are, for now at least. Courtney basically gave a cut-off of New Years before you're canned and replaced with Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice frowned a bit. \"I mean, it's not like this is a shock or anything. But I gave Courtney more credit for intelligence than this. Seriously, I'm too fucking fat to walk. What does she expect me to do, learn to hover? Honest to God, what a stupid, heartless cow. Well, she can send me a pink slip. It doesn't matter at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa winced. \"Um, there's one thing that does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney cut off your paid leave in late October. And once your final termination goes through, you're not covered under the company's mental health portion of our HMO. In short, those checks will stop, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice gulped as she took in that information. She had of course noticed when her paid leave ended, but rather then figure out why, had instead chosen to deal with her stress by eating even more. The cam site had more then made up for her loss of revenue, however, so she'd figured everything was fine. But her medical checks were a significant portion of her income, and if those stopped as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she even do that!?\" Alice asked, a tinge of panic noticeable in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, yes. It's in the employee contract we all signed. I tried to find a way around that, but no dice. I'd have to unionize the entire workplace and force a strike before I could get that changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I need that money! I can't afford to live without it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I did the best I could do, okay!? It wasn't easy to find out what I did without arousing suspicion. I have to chum up with Jessie, and be polite with Courtney, then ask funky questions of HR and hope nothing gets back to anyone.\" Melissa winced again. \"And, I should probably tell you, but there's a few rumors about you going around the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice gave a grim chuckle. Patting her belly, she said, \"I bet those girls are just loving this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as many as you might think, but some, yeah. Also, when they talked smack about you, I didn't defend you as much as I should've. And I may have joined in a couple times. Just something like, 'Wow, Mel, you're so skinny,' 'Oh, just trying to avoid winding up like someone we all know.' That sort of thing. I'm so sorry, Allie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice wanted to be mad at Mel, but looking at her tearful face, couldn't bring herself to angry with her best friend. \"It's okay, Melissa. I know, it's just office politics b.s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of weird how their roles had reversed, Alice thought. From Mel comforting the immobile blob, now it was the blob comforting her. It could almost strike her as funny, except for one rather major worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, I... I don't know what to do. The channel's doing well, but I need that money. Even if I did nothing, I'd be broke in a month. I, I just don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Channel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa raised an eyebrow, but ignored her curiosity for now. \"That's actually part of the reason I came here. Al, I want you to move in with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice blinked in confusion for a moment. \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. I want you to move in with me. You can't stay here. Even if you could afford the rent, you're too big for this apartment. If something happened to you, there's no way to get you the help you'd need fast enough. Also, that bed has been creaking since I walked in here, and even with that nurse helping, there's no zero chance you'd get out of that wreckage and into a new one. And honestly, you're already almost too big to fit through those French doors. Another month as you've been going, and you probably won't, so it really is now or never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was still a little hesitant. \"But Mel, your place isn't any better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I moved into a house a couple months ago. The mortgage was less than my rent, so I said to hell with it and bought the place. It's a big ranch style house with an absolutely huge two car garage. The doors are 10x10; you would literally have to be the size of a whale not to fit in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... A garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, yeah, I know it sounds bad, but the previous guy spent a lot of time making the place into some kind of ultimate man cave. It's got tiled floors, the walls are dry walled and painted, it's well insulated, there's a ton of vents, so heat and a/c aren't a worry. Also, he left this monster of a TV there. Thing has to have, like, a 65 inch screen, and even has a Bose sound system. There's some den furniture too, but we can rearrange that once we get you inside. And there's no basement to worry about either. The whole thing is sitting on a big, reinforced concrete pad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice gave a somewhat sad little smirk at that. She grabbed the closest fatty part of her body, which was her gigantic, lardy breasts. She gave them the best shake she could, making the adipose clogged tissue jiggle like a wet, gelatinous sea for a few seconds. \"Worried I was going to fall through the floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Mel said. She wasn't lying either. \"But I knew you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was still unconvinced. \"I don't know, Mel. Are you sure you want to live with someone as stupidly fat as me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, babe. I don't want to move in with some gigantic fat ass. I want to move in with you. Just you. Alice. The loveliest woman I've ever known, and my best friend. So, what do you say? Shall we make this happen or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I get fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you get <b>WAY</b> fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you put it like that...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"... let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, seriously? It was that easy? I had this whole convincing argument ready to go and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice chuckled a bit. \"Oh, you can use those anytime. Melissa, I just... thank you. If you hadn't been here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey, don't be like that. I don't deserve that much credit. If I did, I'd have been here a lot sooner, and you wouldn't have had to face any of this alone. Not saying I'd have been able to help, but I'd at least have been there. Well, physically. Might have been playing on my phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice rolled her eyes and sighed. \"Couple sentences too far there, Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Mel said, giggling. \"Alright, how soon do you think Sandra can have everything ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we should make her pack all my stuff by herself. That seems kind of rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no shit. I meant the important stuff, like you; a lot of the rest we can just leave to the movers. And to be honest, your living room set is kind of junk, so I'm just going to have them pitch the lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice flinched as she remembered how her ever-expanding ass had outgrown and destroyed every piece of furniture in her apartment, one piece at a time. \"Yeah, that's probably a good call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as for getting you out of here...\" Melissa walked to the east side of Al's bedroom. Pulling back the curtain, she saw that the French Doors she noticed earlier opened onto a small, ground-level patio area. Though Alice didn't say anything, even 5-600 pounds ago, she'd been too embarrassed to use the provided outdoor space, worried about making a spectacle of herself. \"Oh, perfect. I was worried we'd have to take down some railings or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Or cut out a wall,\"</i> Mel thought, though she kept that to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she closed the curtain and turned around, she asked Alice, \"I gotta know. Why on earth do you have your a/c on in December? It's freezing in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice shrugged as best she could. \"I overheat really easily, so Sandra leaves it on for me. I'm, well, you know, kind of well-insulated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel blushed a little at her faux pas. \"Ah, right. Should have guessed that. Sorry. Still, at least it means we won't really have to worry about you taking a chill from here to the truck, or the truck to my house. Anyway, they can get pretty close from the street, so loading you on shouldn't be too difficult. And if you aren't too set on any particular timetable, we could probably get you moved this weekend. My Christmas holidays start on Friday, and I don't know when the moving companies break for the season. Actually, yeah, this Friday would be perfect. Sure, there'll be more traffic, but nobody will be at home, so we'd be able to move you without an audience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of an audience, what about the movers? Won't they be a little leery of me?\" Alice asked as she unconsciously rubbed her morbidly obese frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. These guys do discretion. If you add a big enough tip, they'd probably help you hide a body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm not sure that's really comforting,\"</i> Alice thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Melissa noticed her discomfort, she didn't give any sign, being too busy with the minutiae of prepping for a rather big move. \"Now, as for your stuff, we can probably just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the distractions at work, Melissa powered through the move with remarkable energy. For someone who was once the fattest, laziest woman in the office, unwilling to exert a single ounce of energy unless there was food for her at the end of it, she had everything planned and executed like a military operation. Douglas MacArthur couldn't have planned a better op then Mel did with this move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin two days, Alice could hear the sounds of movers emptying the other rooms of broken furniture and her stuff. Her landlord, who as it turned out was currently on vacation in Hawaii, had been informed of her leaving. Her utilities had been cancelled, and her mail was switched over. Everything went along smoothly, and all too soon, it was Friday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice hadn't been looking forward to this day. No matter what, she was about to be a spectacle for a whole bunch of people, and she really didn't like the sound of that. Though she'd done her darnedest to keep it hidden from Melissa, she'd been stress eating pretty heavily for the last week. And now, with a belly packed with food, the dreaded day was upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet knock sounded from her door, and she heard Mel behind it. \"Alice, you ready for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl shifted her weight a little, though the only visible reaction was a wiggling of her toes. She gave an experimental tug of the sheet that Sandra and Mel had helped her put on to try and save her some decency. It didn't do anything to hide how fat she was, although it did keep her naughty bits hidden. <i>\"Though my belly by itself does a pretty fine job of that for everything down south.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As ready as I'll ever be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here we come,\" Melissa said, opening the door wide. She was followed in by Sandra and almost a dozen workmen. The general reaction was exactly what she expected- a mix of disgust, amazement, and disbelief was written on every face. Still, Mel had been right about their discretion. No cameras were snapping photos or shooting videos, nor were there any snide cracks. With a few words from their foreman, the workers had assembled around her bed while Sandra went to stand by the doors. Melissa took position with the movers, eager to lend a hand to move Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a fair bit of grunting, but at long last, her medical bed began to move. It was slow going, though they did pick up speed as they went along. As the wheeled bed passed the threshold and into the light, Alice saw the sun directly for the first time in a matter of months. It was a lot brighter then she remembered, and her attempt to cover her eyes was laughable, her arms bloated to near-uselessness and far too fat to reach her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she passed through the threshold, she felt her widened rear press into both halves of the door frame, and Alice blushed at the thought that she'd quite literally outgrown such a big opening. She felt a pair of hands, one on each side of her ass, push her flabby rear in to allow her to fit out of the door. It proved a success, and with the second attempt, she was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing Alice noticed, both during the loading process and again while driving down the road, was just how unbelievably jiggly she was. Every little bump had her body sloshing like a bowl of Jello, and the ripples seemed to love passing through her whole core. This was the first time she'd driven (or been driven, rather) anywhere since she'd hit such a massive size, and she really was not enjoying the experience. Matters were made even worse by the fact that she'd eaten such a huge lunch, even by her standards. Frankly, she was hoping she didn't throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was riding in the back of the truck with her, and Alice struck up a conversation to distract herself from the gelatin wars taking place in her grossly oversized body. \"How much further to your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our place. And not too much. We've already been on the road for thirty-odd minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pothole sent another wave through Alice's trembling lard, and she groaned softly at the uncomfortable sensation. \"So, you never said where you heard about these guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was watching an episode of 60 minutes, and- oh good, we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice never had time to ask her \"wait, what!?\" as the truck pulled to a sudden stop. She was once more blinded as they opened the back. She got a good look at Mel's house as they rolled her up the driveway. It was a good sized place, with blue siding, white trim, and a bright red front door. As they rolled her up to the garage door, she saw that Melissa certainly hadn't been lying about this place. The garage doors were absolutely huge, and even a pair of Alice's would have been able to comfortably exit one. And the interior was perhaps even nicer then described. Even a lot of her stuff was already here, though it was mostly in boxes piled on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite to cold temperatures, the workers were panting and sweating as they rolled Alice through the ultra-wide door, and they let out a collected sigh of relief when Melissa said, \"Right there's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wheels of the medical bed were locked, Melissa cut them a check and closed the garage door behind them. Once the door was firmly shut and locked, she turned to Alice with a big smile on her face. The blob-girl smiled as well, genuinely happy for the first time in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, Alice,\" Mel said. \"And Merry Christmas.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You too, Mel,\" Alice said. She was grateful that what had been a very tiring day was over. Although she hadn't done anything to help move her enormously bloated body, her atrophied muscles still had the audacity to feel tired and sore. However, as she was about to find out, though was one more step to be taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Sandra, grab that end and let's roll it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Alice tried to turn her head towards the other two, but couldn't see from her position. She thought about asking one of them to prop her bed up and let her get a better look, but heard the sound of wheels rapidly approaching her. As the two rolled the device into view, Alice's eyes widened a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where on earth did you get a bariatric crane from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a guy,\" Mel said as the two lined it up over Alice's bed, not offering any further details. \"We'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bout of squeaking followed, and this time they rolled their prize into her view range. It was easily the largest medical bed she'd ever seen. It clearly had a lot of weight to it, as the two women were breathing pretty heavily as they pushed it into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Al,\" Melissa said as she wiped the sweat off her brow. \"The plan is pretty straight forward. We'll lift you up with the crane, move out the old bed, and set you on the new one. And that should be that. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, already tired and worried about how they'd manage to move her gargantuan body, said, \"I don't know, Mel. Are you sure that thing'll lift me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you weigh over 4800 pounds, it'll take it. This one's a little beefier then the average unit. And that bed can take up to 6,000. Trust me, this'll work like a charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, is this really necessary? Like, you know, right now? We just got here, and there's only two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alice, trust me. I'm not going to let anything happen to either you or us. And you can't see what the two of us can. If we don't deal with this now, it'll get be a whole lot worse in the near future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Alice couldn't see was the sorry state of her current seat. Her frame supports were starting to develop some pretty severe bends, and Mel had been legitimately worried during the move as with each wobble of Alice's fat, the bed was letting out another awful creak. It'd survived, but Mel really wasn't sure how much life was left to the suffering medical device. She was pretty damn close to saying this was happening, whether she liked it or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice bit her lip. She was still rather nervous, but she also knew Mel wouldn't have been pushing like this without a reason. \"Okay, just... just be careful, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we will.\" And with that, Sandra and Mel set to work making Alice ready for her brief trip to the sky. It was a difficult task, to say the least. The material of the crane had to be slid under under the massive blonde one inch at a time, and seemed to have a particular knack for getting caught on her various anvil-heavy rolls. Sandra and Mel had to take it in turns as to whether they were the one trying to feed the material under her, or the one straining to lift Alice's fatty frame up a scant hair to allow any further access. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Mel didn't say anything aloud, she was a little taken aback by just how much give Alice's body had. Her body's fat rolls were so soft that they were surprisingly hard to grip without pinching the corpulent cutie, causing her to give a small gasp of pain. Mel wasn't even sure how far down she'd have to go to find the woman under all this blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came as something of a shock when they managed to get the material fully under Alice. Making sure it was evenly divided between both sides of her, the two nurses hooked it up the crane mechanism proper. \"Alright Alice, you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud grinding sound, the crane slowly but surely lifted her. True to Mel's word, the device showed no signs of struggling with this considerable load Alice must have been. She felt a tight, uncomfortable sensation as her more distant pockets of lard drooped under the pull of gravity for the first time in quite awhile. Still, it was far from unbearable, but she definitely didn't like the feeling of being off a solid surface. It may have only been a few feet off the ground, but at her weight, Alice was under no illusion how bad even a small fall could potentially be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to getting Alice loaded up, swapping out the beds went remarkably quickly, and she was lowered into the new one in a matter of moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll admit it is actually really nice not to feel my butt falling off my bed,\" Alice said, avoiding admitting that she meant both sides simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel wiped some sweat from her brow. She pulled Alice's hair out from behind her flabby shoulders so she wasn't laying on it as she replied, \"I'll bet. This one also has a few more features then your old one. It's designed to breathe a lot better, has full tilt controls, and we can even set it up with an emergency button if you want. Tilt your head forward a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice tilted her head forward, pushing her real chin into her fatty ones, her treacherous belly let out a deep, rumbling growl. Alice blushed as Mel smirked. She said, \"And once we get the old bed out of here, I think we should do something for supper. Delivery pizza work for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice went a little redder as her stomach growled once more. \"Yeah, food might be a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice ran her chubby sausage fingers over her thick layers of blubber, her blue eyes looking over her new home. She saw just how bent the frame of her old bed was, but refused to say anything about it even as her heart dropped into her stomach. <i>\"Every time I start to relax, something has to remind me how fat I am, doesn't it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Melissa got back, Alice said, \"Mel, thanks again for letting me stay here. Could you just, you know, not tell anyone I'm staying here? Like, at the office. I don't care about the rumors, but I really don't want them to know what's actually going on with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can keep it under my hat for now,\" Mel said as she opened the take-out menu. \"So, what do you want?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While winter was still around after the new year, the holidays had finally gone. Besides the winter, however, the weight accrued from the fattening feasts of the holiday season remained as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina wobbled her way breathily from her office to the break room. She rubbed at her knees - she was surely somewhere over 500, but her stomach was in that range where it's enjoying its golden age of singularity - but tellingly close to being a great fold of fat in its own right as the fat folds on her great, wide, lardy back lined her sides, from her upper back to her love handles. Her great stomach solidly lay over her crotch, its very lower regions dangling and jiggling in front of her taxed, fattened legs. Christina panted intensely. What made her walk so much more difficult? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer could be found in the first objective she aimed for in the break room; the donuts. While the tasty holiday varieties had switched out for the more mundane varieties, these still fattened just as much. Melissa, Jessica and Victoria sat in the break room, munching away at their own waistline-widening treats. \"Hey, Christie.\" spoke Melissa through a mouth of Cruller. \"Hey...Mel..\" panted Christina. \"Phew...I don't know...Feels like an...eternity...\" Before Christina could finish catching her breath, Victoria asked the question. \"What does?\" \"Walking here from my office.\" finished Christina, taking a breath after the sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria herself hadn't escaped the holiday gains. Her rear and legs had especially widened - she wore a new set of turquoise pants bought in her new, expanded size. Her belly hadn't gone without its own gains, naturally, but Victoria's love handles which expanded with her hips were more of a threat to her shirts. \"Yeah, I been feeling the same. Maybe it's something to do with all that eating over the holidays.\" Christina sighed. \"Yeahhh, probably.\" She gazed down at her gut. Somewhere in the back of her mind, it panged that she had, a short time ago, been much smaller. \"Like, I'm probably gonna do what I can to cut down. But I don't know if I can -diet- anymore, ya know?\" Melissa nodded. \"Yeah... It's hard for me to get back on track after the holidays.\" Melissa's old gut began to put its foot in the door as her old blouse stretched in a desperate gamble to hold back Melissa's grown stomach. \"I keep trying to remind myself to get back to the gym, but it's hard - still pretty cold.\" It was always the temperatuare that was the reason why, and not her growing laziness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Jessica was growing to outshine the rest of the office in her gluttony and lethargy. Her red blouse with its flowers of gold was bursting at each possible opening with Jessica's gut which was on the verge of surpassing her knees while sitting, just short of being level with her kneecaps. Her gut wasn't quite the size of Christina's, to say nothing of Alice, but it was still considerable and its expansion gave her a bit of physical grief, but clearly not mental grief.  \"I don't get dieting, you know? Like, yeah, clothes are nice to have, but why bother starving yourself when you can just buy new, better clothes?\" Melissa and Victoria chuckled, giving a hearty \"Amen, sister!\" Christina leaned on the counter, rubbing her stomach self-consciously. \"I mean, I don't know. It's getting a bit much - it's hard to walk, and I don't want to have to be waited on to go take a crap.\" Victoria and Jessica gave a little chuckle. Melissa joined in half-heartedly. A brief silence followed, broken again by Christina's voice. \"I might try to relax on eating so much. Like, the holidays are nice, but.. I don't know. It's starting to get boring.\" Jessica spoke up. \"I mean, you do you, girl. More donuts for me.\" As if to prove the point, great, fattened Jessica took another donut while finishing her current treat and washing it down with a gulp of coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time to get back to work came, Christina struggled upward, but failed her first attempt. \"Uh, hey, Jess, could you give me a hand?\" she inquired. Jess looked quizzically. \"Hmm? With what?\" Christina sighed and explained, \"I can't get up, can you help me up?\" Jessica nodded and with a bit of effort, she also shoved herself up, stretching before going to help Christie. With Jessica as a crutch beneath her left arm and her right focusing on getting up, Christina ascended from her seat. \"Whoo! Thanks, Jess.\" She gave Jessica a pat on her great, blubbery back, perforated with rolls of fat which jiggled on Christina's pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difficulty in getting up concerned Christina. She had seen Alice the last time anyone but Melissa had seen her, and the concept of being immobile frankly scared her. She valued her physical independence, and she did not want the fate that Alice now faced - confined to a bed and an oxygen tank for years. She grew a determination in the face of this fate - she was going to stick to her resolution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what she told herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, folks, we'll be back after this quick break.\" spoke Marni's radio-carried voice over the Gordge breakroom. Jessica and Melissa munched on their lunches - respectively, a grilled cheese with a cookie and a bag of chips - with a few donuts, to be sure - and a burger with a medium fry, and a medium coke. \"Aww. Was just getting good with that story about the bear in her backyard.\" spoke Melissa's voice. \"Yeah,\" spoke Christina through a mouthful of Caesar Salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was frustratingly stuck to her diet. She had glomped onto online claims about the benefits of Keto - or to be more brief, focusing on eating less carbohydrates. Normally, Christina would consider really any diet short of just sticking to baked chips too extreme, but Alice's worsening health and mobility had truly shocked her. It had been a few weeks - and she'd dropped a good twenty pounds. All water weight from cutting most of the sodium out of her diet - but it didn't fail to impress the girls. \"I just can't get over how good you are at that.\" spoke Victoria. \"Good at what?\" asked Christina. \"Sticking to that diet. You've lost how much already?\" Christina blushed and spoke proudly, \"Oh, uh, twenty pounds. I'm back down to 482. I'm telling you, keto's great. I figured out how to make Keto pizza which is a quarter of the calories of normal pizza!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica chortled, jiggling as she did so. \"Yeah - tell me when it tastes as good.\" Christina bit her tongue, stopping her mouth. Though the heights of holiday gluttony were temporarily gone, that did not mean Jessica hadn't stopped gaining. She herself had put on a good ten pounds by the February after the new year, not hurt in this aspect by the strictness of Christina's diet. Jessica swore that her blouse had shrunk in the wash, but it was clearly on its very last legs. It was almost anxiety-inducing to watch Jessica breathe - every single shallow breath of the lard laden woman's great, heaving gut seemed prone to rip out a button. She guessed that the brunette was either at weight parity with her, or just below - somewhat terrifying, as Jessica had just come in 5 months ago, and had gained nearly 60-70 pounds in that time. Christina couldn't hold back just one snipe. \"Certainly will. You really ought to try it.\" Jessica chuckled. \"Nah - I'll stick with the real deal.\" Christina rolled her eyes and dug back into her caesar salad. \"Your loss.\" For the moment, she could swear that the change of pace in what she ate was actually refreshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the workplace came to closing time, Jessica gave off a small yip of terror as a small series of 'snaps' came from her office. As the rest of the office shuffled bloatedly out into the hallway, Melissa glanced at the sight of Jessica's fat, pale, heaving gut exposed bare, dangling towards the floor and between her knees, rubbing her calves as her red-gold blouse hung open, exposing her ill-fitting red bra which held up her breasts. All of the buttons had popped out, and laid in front of the bent-over obese woman. \"Need some help, Jess?\" The sweating, half-naked fat woman nodded breathlessly. Melissa helped pick them up and held them. She meant to ask Jessica if she wanted to borrow a dress jacket, but the small whale of a woman was already jiggling towards an elevator. Melissa watched, but followed her. \"You'll need to change for our bar-hop tonight.\" Jessica beamed. \"Oh, yeah. You know I've got my new big girl dress for tonight. Probably made for a real woman like me.\" Her very public wobble out to the parking lot was met with a lot of whispering, even for Gordge. Though fatness was more or less encouraged, it was still a business. Jessica barely missed one snipe which was overheard by many - \"I didn't know employees over 500 pounds didn't need to wear clothes.\" While she wasn't literally there - it was nearing the mark to say that she could be mistaken for 500. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two blimps pulled up to Miko's Bar and Grill about 6, hugging each other in the parking lot. Melissa wore a black blouse, whose buttons struggled to maintain their fattened owner. Melissa hadn't quite gotten out of the holiday mentality, and she still hadn't gotten back to the gym or on her old routine, and it was showing. She was just a pound or two ahead of Jessica, whose burgundy dress was not as loose-fitting as she had sold it - still clinging to each fat fold in her great, blubbery back. \"Hey girly!\" spoke Jessica. \"Let's get fucked up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waddled in as a hockey match was on - their local team, the Rollers were on against the Rock City Giants. The bar was full of cheering and yelling as one of their players shoved a man in a teal Giants jersey aside and smacked the puck home  for a goal. Jessica and Melissa wobbled up to the bar, aloof of the snickers and stares of a few pairs of fresh college graduate sorority sisters, giggling at the absurdly fat pair. One especially inebriated one could barely control her voice. \"Do-Doesn't she know that, that, that dress doesn..n't fit? She'sss a little too fat for that.\" The increasingly drunk booth giggled, drowned out by mostly by the screams, and Melissa's order as she struggled to sit properly on the high stool with her great wideness. \"One Moscow Mule.\" Jessica beamed. \"Can I get an Old Fashioned? Oh, and a basket of Mozzarella sticks.\" The overtaxed and blubbery man of a bartender nodded and spoke. \"Comin' right up for youse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere was thick with the smell of alcohol and excitement as Jessica leaned in to ask Melissa a question, \"How's Alice been doing? Have you seen her lately?\" Melissa had to quickly gauge how honest to be - this was a hard question for her. She wanted to try to save Alice's reputation, as a friend - but she also wanted to be truthful to Jessica - for friendship's sake. She found a middle road. \"Oh, uh, I've seen her lately - she needed some help getting up.\" Jessica nodded. \"How big is she now?\" \"Uhh,\" stalled Melissa, \"Bigger, definitely - she has somebody helping her out now. But she's a nice girl - name's Sandra. She's a big girl - bigger than Christie.\" Jessica chuckled as the bartender came back around and spoke. \"Anything else I can gets for youse?\" Melissa spoke. \"Yeah - let's get 24 wings, half Garlic Parm, half hot.\" The bartender nodded and placed the drinks and hot, delicious-smelling Mozzarella sticks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two blubbery women chatted away as best as they could - but Melissa ensured to move the topic to the game. She wanted to reveal as little about Alice's true, worsening condition as she could. The mozzarella sticks depleted quickly, and the Bartender was able to serve the two another round of alcohol, two beers. The two got around to ordering two more as the wings arrived, swiftly delivered. Their speech began slurring and concentration became harder. They cheered that bit more enthusiastically. Eventually, after the two finished their twelve wings each, they had another pair of beers. The game had pulled to a stop, but they were in no mood to stop celebrating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings became blurry.. Somewhere to Melissa's right, she heard a rip. Jessica gave a drunken chuckle - a rip had opened in the front of her brand new dress. \"Whoopsh..\" spoke Jessica. \"Guess I- Gu-Guess I'm full.\" The bartender chimed in, \"Youse got that right.\" Jessica giggled and slapped her partially exposed belly. The bartender chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the night, the two ladies needed the bouncer, a few unfortunate wait staff, and the bartender to drag them to their taxi, which needed to break out its belt extenders for the two great, fat, women. The night was one which Jessica and Melissa would talk about for weeks - one which solidified their relationship for a while to come. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Christina's response to Alice's drastic change in condition was to try to go the opposite way in an extreme way, Sandra seemed to have learned no lesson at all as she panted her way from the front door to Alice's garage lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde, obese mirror of who Alice was had become more and more like her patient as the holidays turned into February and March. Her massive stomach which dangled downward now continued its race outward, sideways, and downward as it began hampering her movement, and her thighs and arms which had taken an extra blow from the past round of gains had made her blue nurses' outfit stretch. Her waist, about 63 inches before the holidays, was now 70. Odd as it was as a nurse, she did not step on a scale, and she did not hear criticism much as her \"office\" had moved to Melissa's kitchen. If one had to guess, she could be guesstimated at the upper 400's, but it was plain by what she snuck into Alice's orders that she would not stay there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer steady stream of fattening appetizers between meals, and her actual meals themselves, though, still paled in comparison to what Alice's 'normal' amount of food. An actual norm was establishing itself - it was as though the voices of Alice's demons were finally being quieted under the sound of the oxygen tank which allowed her struggling lungs to distribute air to a 1000 pound body. Her massive appetite had been curbed as her demons petered out slowly, and as a result of her decreased intake, she had lost about 7 pounds as the year had ground on due to the metabolism needed to sustain such a massive size. However, she was still not close to losing any large amount of weight - not that it seemed that the monument to obesity that was Alice could lose weight at this point. But for where Alice was in terms of her appetite, it still seemed a miracle that she could achieve anything like a balance in eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acceptance that Melissa gave off was therapeutic in that aspect.Melissa's increasing poundage as the year creeped from the dying days of winter into the pale dawn before spring, however, was not exactly enticing a life change in Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that might seem to help that in Alice was the fact that Sandra's ballooning waist hindered her ability to continue feeding Alice the volume she had grown used to as a 'minimum' as she struggled with her eating disorder. Alice watched a discovery channel show as she allowed her lunch to digest, only to feel a familiar grumble in her stomach. \"Sandra.\" she spoke. Sandra gave a drowsy \"Hmm?\" in reply. \"Uhh, I'm feeling a little hungry. Could you order some take-out from Guo Min's? Tell him I want the General Tso's chicken with a side of egg rolls. Sandra nodded and attempted to stand up, but was hindered by her weight. Her arm strength had suffered as well as her weight increased - she struggled to get out of her chair after the 'exhausting' exertion to retrieve Alice's lunch from the door. \"G'mme a sec...\" She panted and huffed, giving it another shove, finally lurching forward, a glistening of sweat lining her forehead. \"Phew.\" She waddled out the door and to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about that time that Melissa waddled in, about as winded from the walk from her driveway through the door. \"Oh, heySandra..\" she spoke. She took a breath and called to Alice. \"Hey Al!\" Alice called heartily back. \"Mel! How was work?\" Melissa unbuttoned her dress jacket and hung it in her closet, releasing the great strain on the taxed buttons. \"Oh, not bad, the workload's starting to pick up so we can get profits up for mid-year.\" Melissa's trips to Miko's had become more frequent after their last excursion, and the toll of the liquid calories of the alcohol and the fried, fatty food of Niko's grill really began to show. The dress jacket had begun to give its last effort, and Melissa strained to even get the pressed buttons to move to the hole. \"C'mon, damnit... stupid jacket must've shrunk in the wash. I'll have to get it up-sized.\" Revealed below was her white dress-blouse, skin-tight and fighting to contain Melissa's increasing vastness, which was achieving just around Sandra's old size. Her fitting for the blouse last week had given her waist size as 59, but she'd easily put on another inch since then - the blouse was going from well-filled to struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid confronting such blatant evidence that her routine was fading away and that she was on track to gain her old pounds back, she changed into sweatpants and a 5XL shirt - Men's, of course - women's sizes were getting a bit too small for comfy clothes. She grabbed a bag of chips and plopped her massive rear-end onto her couch.</span></div></div>",

She was seated before not only her direct superior at the hospital, Head Nurse MacDiarmid, but also his superiors, doctors Elizabeth Smith and Malcolm Fidler. The fact that all three of them were present for this meeting had Sandra scared beyond words, as this couldn't mean anything good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Initially, this meeting was just going to be the two of us regarding your lack of regular status reports. In particular, the fact that your charge changed her address and the fact that you failed to notify the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant to, but I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacDiarmid cut her off. \"I wasn't finished. Then there's the number of unusual expense claims, or rather the lack thereof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Smith added her two cents at this point. Pushing her wire-framed glasses up her nose, she brushed a blonde hair out of her eye and said, \"However, the reason we're here is because of the state you came in after all this time. Namely, the fact that you've blown up like a balloon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra rubbed her enlarged belly at the accusation. \"That's hardly fair, Miss. I've always been a bit heavy, and you can't discriminate against me on those grounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Sandra, Elizabeth was prepared for just such a response. \"It's not discrimination if your physical capabilities are not up to the task of aiding in the care of your charge. I watched you walk across the parking lot, and you took four breaks on the way in. You then sat in the waiting area to catch your breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For nearly twenty minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you see, Miss, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you last weigh yourself, Sandra? Or do any sort of exercise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... has been awhile, I'll admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured.\" The blonde doctor scribbled something on the pad in her hands. \"I'm scheduling you for a full physical in order to assess whether or not you can still carry out your duties. The simple fact is that you need to get back into some kind of shape, and soon. If there was a medical emergency right now, you'd be more of a hindrance than a help in your current state, and that is totally unacceptable in a home-stay nurse. We'll speak more after your physical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra simply nodded, and rose to follow Doctor Fidler to the examination room. Already, she was trying to think of a way to get out of this terrible situation she found herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus. 462 pounds, eh? How exactly did you fail to notice the scale of your gain before now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra rubbed her hands together as she answered. \"I did notice a bit, Miss, but I didn't think it was as bad as this. I was so busy taking care of Alice Gellar that I failed to appreciate the scale of the problem until it was too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Smith turned a page in the folder in front of her. \"She's bedridden, as per your reports. How would you rate the difficulty of her care, on a scale of 1 to 10?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A 7 or an 8, I think. She doesn't need intensive care, but she does require someone constantly present to attend to her needs. This made it rather difficult to attend to my own, Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor,\" Elizabeth corrected her. \"Would you be able to better care for your patient and yourself with additional help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra mentally smiled, equal parts happy and amazed that her plan was working. \"Yes, Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Smith started writing in the file as she said, \"Alright. I'm assigning two additional nurses under you to aid in Miss Gellar's care. This will ease the burden placed upon your shoulders. However, this is not an excuse to ignore what brought you here today. While I can only recommend losing weight, you still need to meet the minimum qualifications for Home-stay. If your physical abilities haven't improved in six months, you will be pulled off duty until such time that they have. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ma'am,\" Sandra said as she got up to leave. <i>\"I can't believe I survived that!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option 1:</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree nurses, two fit and one not, are better able to get food to Alice then just one out-of-shape nurse. Combined with her slowing metabolism, Alice begins to rapidly balloon once more. Though it is admittedly a little hard to tell with a woman that massive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A/N: Please do not harm Alice or make her suffer unduly. I have a happy ending in mind for her, but the road to get there is going to see her get rather huge first.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her room mate, between work and after-hours binging, Melissa is beginning to pack on the pounds again in a big way. She's also been joining Alice in the garage frequently to eat and watch movies, and is inadvertently benefiting from the nurses as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra, meanwhile, is a big \"what do?\" She knows she needs to get in better shape. Does she stick to her guns and shed some pounds, or fail and fail hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option 2:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the office, Jessica is growing by leaps and bounds, but what about Christina? Is her developing mobility issues and memories of Alice enough to make her stick to her diet, or is she already starting to backslide?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option 3:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay it with me now: And now for something completely different </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A matter of a few months and more than a few pounds seemed to pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina grew a new appreciation for coffee - she had read that it helped suppress appetite. On the downside, she was drinking it progressively more than she had before, and it became almost second - nature to reach for the dark, black drink. At first it gave her the jitters, but she was growing used to increasing amounts of caffeine. This technique and her steadfast dieting had done her weight wonders - she was dropping the pounds so fast that she could hardly keep her clothes in size - she had eschewed her old beige blouse and gold skirt for a black and white dress which showcased her slimmed figure. Her love handles had shrunk significantly, her tree-trunk legs had similarly shrank, and the same could certainly be said of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had dropped another fifteen pounds. Still good progress, but Christina couldn't help but feel slightly dissapointed at how her weight loss was slowing down. Additionally, Keto was getting to be a bit rigorous - she was sure to do her research and double-checked on the RIGHT way to do it. But had she gotten it right? Along with these doubts, cravings began to sneak back in, and she found herself dreaming about the break room donuts. She responded to recalling this thought now by taking another sip of her coffee. Of course, this wasn't the only craving that was calling her - she always used to love the Ultimate Meats pizza from her local pizza delivery place, Uncle Giovanni's. The crust was always almost buttery, with pepperoni, and bacon, and sausage, and beef...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, her mouth was watering. She wiped her mouth and drank more coffee, as if to drown the thought. To try to properly drown it, she finished her cup and waited a second. The thoughts began to leave as she converted the caffeine into hand speed. The heavy dosing of coffee was leading to an improved output from Christina, and she was already pretty brilliant at moving her workload forward. While the future of her diet was becoming uncertain, it had held so far, and being down <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the exact opposite could be said for Jessica. She was as social as ever, sitting in the break room and talking with Victoria and Mel. Of course, being social in the Gordge offices meant eating. Melissa had put on another good 10 pounds at least and was up from around the mid 450's to the high 460's, maybe even 470. Of course, she was dwarfed by Jessica. She seemed to get fatter every single day. While Christina had lost 15 pounds, Jessica had put on 20, and was officially into the 500's, and Jessica had the curse of perpetually looking 20 pounds fatter than she was. Her stomach still held out from being double, but her 4 rolls had grown to 5 as a small mini-fold between her two thickest ones respectively on her upper back and one above her ass. Her red-gold blouse had long gone into the trash, replaced by a fairly bland white blouse with far too many X's in the XL. At the moment, most of the shirt was stable, save for Jessica's mammoth gut eternally protruding and stretching the fabric at her stoutest point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, of course, Jessica wasn't worrying about it. She was enjoying talking to Melissa about one of their latest excursions. \"I don't remember doing that.\" said Melissa after swallowing a bite of donut. \"Hoe, I've got the damn photo~-\" \"Show me, show me.\" Jessica chuckled. \"Alright, here, gimme a second..\" She shoved up and did her best to heave her mass up. She raised herself up, slowly - there was a lot of mass to heave up - thirty seconds on, however, Jessica managed to get up with difficulty, causing beads of sweat to drip down her brow as she wobbled over to Melissa. It may have been the fact that Jessica had never really had a \"fit phase,\" but her fat always seemed especially loose and jiggly as her stomach jiggled in waves to the beat of her heavy footfalls. She showed off the photo of Melissa stripping her blouse off while standing on a table, which had just cracked in half as Melissa's bloated form had stood atop it in the photograph. \"Oh, shit, I really did break that table!\" chuckled Melissa. Her expanded gut shook with delight as her hands rested subconsciously on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina walked in with a mug of coffee and her lunch - a Tupperware bin filled with disgustingly healthy Keto baked ziti using specially bought pasta made from cauliflower. Christina subconsciously flared her nostrils and quietly snorted when she bit into the cauliflower pasta. She'd heard about the supposedly wonderful taste of the vegetable, but its frequency in \"clean Keto\" recipes were frankly pissing her off. \"Hey, Christie.\" spoke Jessica. \"Hey, Jess.\" Melissa chimed in, \"How's the diet going?\" \"Pretty well, Pretty well.\" said Christina. \"I'm starting a kickboxing class tomorrow - the old Gym routine is getting a bit stale, and I heard kickboxing can really whip you into shape.\" Christina worded her phrase very carefully - she was partially becoming more frustrated with her ever-expanding co-workers as she focused on getting healthy, subconsciously trying to pin her cravings on them. <i>If I don't straight up ask them, they'll become just like Alice,</i> thought Christina. \"You really ought to think about joining me.\" Jessica sighed and spoke. \"Uh... Hell, when is it?\"  Christina's face perked up. \"Uh, it's tomorrow, at eight.\" Jessica shrugged. \"Eh, hell, why not. Been getting a little stir-crazy anyways.\" Melissa shrugged and spoke. \"I'll pass.\" Christina's eyes darted to Melissa's stomach as she thought, <i>You really need it.</i> Christina didn't say this - she still wanted to stay Melissa's friend and there was no shorter path to losing that than outright calling her fat - but she thought she could get away with just staring at Melissa with a glance that said the same thing. \"What?\" asked Melissa.\" Christie's eyes visibly moved to Melissa's large stomach, then back to her face. \"Oh, get out, I've been good recently.\" Christina shrugged. \"Alright, if you say so.\" Melissa scoffed indignantly. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Christina shrugged. \"I don't know, what is it supposed to mean?\" Melissa's eyes narrowed with anger. \"I'm fine, I've lost a lot of weight.\" Christina couldn't hold her frustration back any longer, \"Lost as in, past tense. Now you're gaining it back.\" Jessica sighed and spoke up. \"Christie, don't - \" Melissa's eyes widened more in shock. \"Bullshit, no I haven't..\" her words trailed off as her crossed arms rested on her stomach. She heaved herself up and stomped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sighed and turned to Jessica. \"I didn't mean to say that.\" Jessica shrugged. \"I mean, it's whatever, she has put on a bit of weight, but like, you shouldn't get so on her about it. Especially with me in the room.\" Christina turned to Jessica. \"Oh, girl, don't get so hard on yourself.\" Jessica spoke honestly, calmly, and bluntly. \"No, but it's true. I'm fat. Like, really fat. I'm just fine with it.\" Christina was somewhat shocked by this honesty. Jessica chuckled. \"What, you thought I wouldn't notice? I have a scale at home. I'm just happy with being fat.\" \"But how do you just deal with everything that comes with it?\" asked Christina. \"I've been getting big for the past few years since I got here, and I just... I don't know, getting so big...How do you ignore everyone?\" Jessica nodded. \"I just realize that they're judging me based off of what they've been raised in. It's a societal bias - like, when airplane seats are designed for someone half my size and I have to buy two seats. That's what I mean. People get told you can't be fat and happy - well, hell, I'm happy, and I'm getting fatter all the time.\" Christina nodded. Something inside her really ticked with this statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After her third trip to the kitchen, Callie was really starting to rethink her career choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd gone to nursing school, she'd thought she'd be making a difference. Helping people with serious health problems; aiding returning a child to health; helping ease the burden of lost loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never thought she'd be helping a living blob get even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie also hadn't expected she'd have to sign for so many deliveries. Her patient, Alice Gellar, seemed to have quite the following online, and she'd set up a system for her fan base to send groceries to her house. And there was a ton of food being delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie rubbed her back as she put the last package on the counter. She brushed a long strand of her red hair behind her left ear as she thought, <i>\"If I hadn't seen how much she can eat, I'd really be starting to worry about all this going to waste.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie and her coworker, Jennie, were the new nurses sent to aid Sandra in taking care of Alice. So far, Callie was quite happy working with Jennie. The short young woman was a hard worker with a bubbly personality, and her face was often lit with a bright smile, which seemed all the brighter when contrasted with her caramel complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer opinions of Sandra weren't quite as rosy. She seemed eager to drop as much of the workload on her two underlings as she could, and it often took threats of calls to the hospital to make her hold up her end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor right now, at least, the three had managed to come up with a working system, with the nurses taking the different roles in turns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would be based in the kitchen and also had duties monitoring the front door. This nurse would sign for the endless stream of fatty foods, organize it into the cupboards, and cook the few things that weren't ready to eat out of the package. This was Callie's day for these duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would be running between the garage and kitchen, which was admittedly a very short walk, funneling food and other needed items into Her Lardness' bottomless maw. Jennie currently had this role, and was in fact rolling her cart into the kitchen to reload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie raised her one eyebrow. \"Already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennie merely shrugged. \"You know what she's like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. But still, Jesus. How can she eat so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practice,\" Jennie giggled as she grabbed a couple pizza boxes and a bag of burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie only sighed. In truth, she had nothing against Alice. She and Jennie had found her to be one of, if not the, nicest person they'd ever known. Still, she was already so huge, and nothing she was doing right now was helping that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie shook her head as she passed Jennie a box of cookies and a six pack of coke. \"I suspect she'll want dessert and something to drink as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third duty roster went to the nurse dealing with Alice directly, which today was Sandra. This nurse monitored her well being, opened packages, passed her things, and other such things. This was the nurse who was primarily responsible for keeping her clean, although the three had very quickly realized that was a two person job minimum, and Alice was well on her way to making it all three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde behemoth had gotten a lot fatter over the last few months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it wasn't currently possible to get exact numbers, there was no doubt that Alice's weight had risen in a big way, and would only continue to do so if she kept eating at her current pace. The sound of Alice's chewing made a steady backdrop of noise, and Jennie didn't even notice it anymore as she rolled the cart in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's cheeks jiggled merrily as she happily chewed, and her huge triple chin spread across her lardy collarbone. Her arms had expanded in girth as well, going from turkeys to whole hogs. The largest rolls on her arms now stretched so far from her bones that they remained inert and only jiggled slightly despite the fact that her arms (much like her jaws) were in constant motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the neck, however, was where her gain was most impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were unbelievably huge, each individually able to outweigh a normal person. Between them and her dome-like belly, her once vast shelf of flesh had finally grown too large to be useful as such. With their sheer mass, had it not been for her gargantuan belly, they would have eventually forced their way to the bed far, far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut, though, was something else entirely. Her four belly rolls had thickened and widened immensely, and had been joined by an equally massive fifth. Her knees had first disappeared into their own fat, and now her belly had expanded forward to leave them forever a mystery to everyone, save when her nurses had to shift her fat for cleaning. Even with her bed at maximum tilt, Alice's face was barely able to peer over her enormous middle features. Her belly and bust was rising further into her view by the day, though Alice was so far too embarrassed to ask anyone to raise the TV to a better height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's ass and thighs were certainly not about to let her pretender of a belly take the title of the biggest around, however. Her butt cheeks by themselves probably outweighed even the largest of her three nurses, and though they hadn't yet reached the edges of her bed, it seemed only a matter of time before they did so. Her fatty thighs and calves had maintained pace, leaving almost no gap between her splayed out limbs for her belly to sink to the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice finished the last of the doughnuts in her hands, she licked her fingers clean as a massive rumble echoed from deep within her titanic amount of fat, signalling her endless hunger. <i>\"How hasn't she plateaued yet?\"</i> Jennie thought as she pushed the cart alongside the beached whale's resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How fat is she, even? 1100? 1200? More? How much fatter can she actually get?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch questions would have to wait, as Callie came in with a phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alice, there's someone calling for you? Doesn't sound like a fanboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice accepted the first burger from Jennie with a quick thanks. \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost choked on her first bite as Callie said, \"She says her name is Stephanie, and claims to be your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A/N: Sorry if this is a little rushed. I've an early day at work tomorrow, and this was taking way longer to write then I'd thought it would.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice frantically waved her hand. She had NO desire to talk to Stephanie - Stephanie had seemingly lost her mind when she had discovered Alice was over 500 pounds. Alice was now around double that size - so fat that she could not care for herself in any way at all. And now Stephanie was trying to touch base with Alice, after her demons had taken hold and fattened her to the size of an industrial-sized sack of lard. \"No, uh, no thank you.\" She wolfed down the rest of the burger, stressing over this revelation. Callie spoke over the phone \"Uh, sorry, she doesn't want to speak to you right now. Thank you for calling!\" Some indistinct rushed protests were quickly silenced by the ending of the call, and the hanging up of the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa entered the house, carrying two great bags of fast food. She went with the first into the garage and handed it to Alice. \"Hey, Al.\" Melissa handed the great elephantine woman her bag of fast food. The black-haired woman had been eating with an increased intensity tonight, after since Christina blew up at her in the office. The argument over her weight made her think about the scale in her closet, subconsciously, worrying - <i>Is Christina right? Am I getting fatter?</i> Alice replied - \"Hey, Mel. Thanks - really appreciate it. How's the office?\" Melissa angrily shook her head. \"Christina's been a bitch. She's been on this diet and now she's got that whole \"Fat girl who's losing weight\" thing - she bitched me out and said I was gaining weight.\" Alice sighed. \"That's sad to hear - I always liked Christie.\" She took a breath from her oxygen tubes and spoke. \"Steph tried to call me today - told the nurses to hang up on her.\" Melissa opened her bag and started munching on a fistful of fries. \"God, not her. She was unbearable. Don't tell me she's gonna try to come up here again?\" Alice quavered slightly as she replied, \"I really hope not. Then again, I don't know what she could do to me. I can't even get up, so she can't take me to the gym anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa munched on the first of her double bacon cheeseburgers as she spoke, \"Heh. Build a wall around your house, maybe.\" Alice chuckled. \"I always wanted a castle. I told you when I was little, I wanted my dad to do that? Build a big stone wall around the house so we'd have a castle?\" Melissa smiled as she shook her head. \"No, I never knew that - that's a real mood though. Like, I'm a queen, bitch, you peasants shouldn't come NEAR me.\"  Alice's great mountain of fat rose and fell as she laughed, as did Melissa's moderate hill of fat which rode atop her growing thighs which strained her pants, having already dug a hole through in the inner thigh of the pants. Her D breasts sat atop her gut, up from her old C. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, Melissa brought herself to the couch to dig in to her great, fattening feast of another double cheeseburger and her two orders of fries - one large, one small. She dug through the food and her drink hungrily, having changed into her looser black shirt - though the old Pajama shirt was starting to get less loose and tighten as her belly began peeking out from the bottom, just above her grey sweatpants. After finishing her meal and as nighttime closed in, Melissa couldn't stave off the curiosity - <i>How much DO i weigh?</i> She had to find out. She opened her closet and stepped onto the ready electric scale, which was white - browning slightly at the glassy pressure plate which was dusting over. Melissa waited the requisite 5 seconds, holding still, then stepping off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing blue display read out: 487.5 pounds. Melissa was shocked: Christina had told the truth - she was certainly getting fatter. But what to do about it? Part of her wanted to get back on track of losing weight - but she had gone so far from where she was, could she even go back now? These questions plagued the fat woman as she laid down for a night of sleep. Her dreams were troubled - she had traded places with Alice - she was just as massive, barely able to see past her own fat. Standing at her bedside was her mother - fairly standard for her nightmares, berating her for her weight - but not with her usual bitchy, angry tone. This one was almost with a bereaved, mourning tone. She was speaking in the past tense - that was odd as well. What the hell did any of this mean? <br>\r\nMelissa thought on this, and the larger question of her largeness as she woke up the next morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The evening was quite humid, and Christina could truly feel the comparative heat of the summer night in her grey tee shirt and shorts. The still bubbery woman's fat jiggled significantly less, but her tank top still struggled to hold her slightly more firm bulk, which was still considerable. She stood in sharp contrast to the rest of the toned, even the fairly chunkier women. She was still somewhere around 75 inches on her belly, which was dwarfed by the normally brunette Jessica waiting for her on the sidewalk by at least ten inches. Jessica's hair was now a shade brighter than blood red, stretching just above her shoulders.. Christina's eyes widened. \"Jessiee! I love what you did with your hair!\" Jessica smiled. \"Thanks - I figured it was time to do something new with it. I wanted to go red for a while. Matches my new boxing gloves!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's great, jiggling mass of fat was far more exposed in her pink tank top and overtaxed white leggings which showcased the trunks of fat that were her legs, her knees struggling to remain visible below the mass of her fat thighs and especially her stomach. The bottom of her fat sideways-boulder of a stomach hung out a good three inches from the bottom as she moved in what seemed like a great wobble towards the door labeled in big yellow letters bordered in white: \"Hi-Impact Kickboxing Gym and Fitness Center.\" The steady stream of mainly female attendees raced ahead of the two blubbery females. Looks were cast backward, mostly at Jessica which told of surprise and slight patronisation- looking at her with some look of pride that she had managed to escape her lethargy to come here and work out. There was at least one look of disgust followed by a brief whisper into her friend's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stared directly through the looks, mostly undeterred, until they had gotten through the doors to an orange-walled reception room.  The comfortable-looking black leather couches lining the walls were lined with a mixture of beefy-looking men and lean, trim women - save two. One brunette woman there was quite tall - five foot nine, her form muscled to the nines, and she was missing her right leg below the knee, replaced by a metal prosthetic. She carried herself like an army vet. The second instructor could not have been more different. She was a five foot three butterball, still quite below Christina in weight, but still quite fat. She stood out among the instructors, just as much as the old vet. Most of the students simply showed their cards and were greeted with a nod or a curt \"Hey, Clara - Danaa, welcome back.\" The receptionist's eyes passed over Jessica and Christina and she spoke, \"Hiii, welcome to Hi-Impact, you here for the eight o'clock class?\" Christina and Jessica both nodded. \"Goood, you'll be in room Eleven. Amanda's gonna be your teacher.\" Both Christina and Jessica shared the same thought out loud after they paid for the class: \"I hope Amanda's the fat one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey trudged down the hallway, Jessica beginning to get out of breath from walking further. Christina patted her back reassuringly, her hand finding its home on Jessica's fat, roll-filled back. They eventually got to room eleven. There was a single great mirror lining the front and sides of the red-walled room forming a semi-circle. At the back were the collected belongings of the other attendees. Sharing the room with Jess and Christina were a motley assortment of different people - a few of the larger folks who came in with them, but still many of the thinner crowd were with them. Eventually, the door opened and in walked the tall, muscled amputee woman. She carried her bag up to the front and gently set it down next to the radio. She spoke to a few of the people up front, away from about the middle where Jess and Christina were. They looked at each other with concern. Eventually, the woman spoke up - her voice surprised the two by how high it was, somewhere in a low soprano. \"Hey, guys, My name's Amanda and I'm here to do this kickboxing class with you guys! 'Cause if I can do it..\" she lifted up her prosthetic leg, a chuckle came over the crowd. \"Then you guys can do it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out her phone and, in a matter of moments, the speaker was playing some medium-paced music with a thick bass that reverberated about the room. \"Thaat's  more like it. Get us all in the rhythm. If you've been with us for a while -  like Samantha and Alex,\" she indicated two lean women in the front, both blonde, one trim, one slightly chubby in build. \"Then you know how this will go. If you're a beginner, just stick with it, you'll be fine. Do your best to keep up with the intensity. If you're sweating, that's how you're meant to be doing, that's good. Take it down if you need to, but as a rule, you should be struggling.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it began with a few loud commands and instructions. They began with some jabs, left, right, right, left. Christina focused in on keeping her form while Jessica mimicked the moves Amanda was doing. She kept her back straight, making her gut stick out more than usual as her tank-top rode up to the midway of her belly button. Everyone glided through this easily for the next ten seconds until Amanda picked up her voice while performing the jabs alongside the class. \"Alright - let's pick up the pace, you should be jabbing a bit faster.\" Jessica was sweating now, though that was fairly normal. Christina was keeping her pace somewhat easily. They carried on for the next minute or so, and then Amanda called out, \"Okay, good, good. Now let's mix it up a bit- bounce a bit while you jab.\" She demonstrated - it was a kind of small jump from side to side. Christina began struggling with keeping herself coordinated - all her weight throwing itself around made her stop a few times and catch her breath, or re-coordinate. Jessica positively shook the floor as she bounced about, both with her blubber and with her feet. She was worse at coordinating her bounces, managing to catch herself a few times. Amanda stopped by and asked, \"Are you alright?\" Jessica nodded wearily. \"Well, don't go too crazy - but try to keep jabbing. You're not trying to jump - you're just lightly bouncing, side to side, side to side.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica toned down her jumps to proper bounces, but by the time the next few minutes passed, she was barely standing on her two feet. \"Alright, guys, let's do something else. If someone's trying to hit you in the head, your best bet is to move your head. This is called a bob, a nice simple move. Let's try it while practicing a simple front-kick, make sure you've got plenty of space in front of you.\" Christina focused in on ducking her head, imagining a thick blow coming from in front of her. She instinctively did the same when she heard a thick 'Thud' from her right. Looking to make sure she didn't imagine it, she saw the porcine form of red-headed Jess lying face-first on the floor, motionless. \"Oh my god, Jess!\" she cried. The class stopped and Amanda hurried over, her face intensifying. She managed to roll Jessica over with some effort, and she listened in through Jessica's sweat-soaked tank top. Her face was uncertain. \"Is it a heart attack?\" asked Christina. Amanda reached for the AED and exposed Jessica's great, fat, heaving chest to apply the white electrodes. Terror coursed through everyone in the room. Jessica came to in pain as the machine spoke, \"Arrhythmia detected. Administering shock.\" After a shock, Jessica's pain subsided and Amanda helped her up. Amanda spoke, \"Well, good thing she's alright. But we don't want to take any chances. You guys can go - she definitely should, at least. Please take it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waddled out of the room, somberly. \"Thank god Amanda knew how to use that thing.\" spoke Jessica. Christina nodded. \"Yeah. I guess you took it a little too intensely.\" Jessica nodded. \"Yeah- guess I'm just a bit too big to work out.\" Christina sighed. She wanted to tell her that she shouldn't give up precisely because of what had just happened - but she was simply relieved that Jessica was alright. For now, at least.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The summer was waning into August, and it was was becoming clear that the office workers had done little but eat their summer away, save only Christina. While Jessica had been physically unable to do even one session of kickboxing, Christina was able to, and the resulting calorie deficit over the next month helped Christina drop 10 pounds. By contrast, the rest of the office seemed to be eating themselves into higher and higher sizes. Jessica, disregarding the fact that she was becoming horrifically unfit, had gained a good twelve - she was now very close to 525 pounds, well over a quarter ton of obesity. Her red-dyed hair had grown out a bit, now gently sitting on her shoulders as she bit into a donut. Melissa had grown subconsciously wary of her weight - but this did not translate into Christina's dedication to losing weight, which now waned as she strained to keep to her rigid eating plan. Melissa had only gained two pounds, Jessica taking the award far and away as the fattest member of the office in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria's gluttony could not keep pace with the rest of the group - she had gained a measly five pounds, mainly in her trunk-like legs and fat hips, her comparatively minimal gut as a secondary accessory to her larger bust and lower quarters, an appendage of fat that was dwarfed by her sideways expansion, an abnormality in this office of mainly belly-centric gainers. She dawdled as she grazed on her donut as Jessica regaled the story of her trial by fire at Hi-Impact. \"Wow, that's so scary! I hope you're alright.\" Jessica chuckled, shaking her gargantuan gut which heroically resisted forming a double belly. \"Oh, yeah, I'm fine. They had to give me a shock, but i'm good.\" Christina's face drew tight, concerned. \"Don't you think you should see a doctor?\" Jessica scoffed. \"Yeah, you mean the guys who think that everything's because of my weight? I mean - it was, but it was really just because I exerted myself too hard.\" Christina held off - she had already pissed off Melissa, she didn't want to distance Jessica from her. Of course, in her mind, she was practically shouting <i>Are you fucking serious?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discussion trailed off into celebrity talk until Courtney strode into view. She had kept her gains well and truly at bay - she was hovering now around 480, greatly reduced in size from the last time the gang had seen her. Quite plainly, this was due to the mysterious treadmill-desk. \"Heyyy, Courtney!\" spoke the gang. Courtney chuckled as she took a breath from the still-laborious journey. \"Hey, guys. You'll never believe who I just talked to and what she wants.\" \"Who?\" asked the group. \"Jenna.\" spoke Courtney, as she stepped aside, and the great blonde stepped in front of the party, ever-laboriously. Her bulk could not have been more contrasting of Courtney. She had to be over 700 pounds, and every part of her seemed to be pumped with fat. Her legs stood like great pillars which grew fatter at the top, all indistinct beneath a great carpet-roll of bulging fat. Her gut entirely hid her thighs which by all context given by her fat legs joined a few inches above where her knees may or may not have been. She was not quite the quivering blob that was Alice, however - to Christina and especially Melissa, her fat seemed absolutely dwarfed by the fatness that was Alice. However, this did not inherently make Jenna skinny - she was still something akin to a walking whale. \"Heyy, guys!\" she breathily spoke, taking a breath for the sentence to come. \"I bought you guys cruise tickets, starting tomorrow!\" She shifted on her cane, which made itself known as it clacked. It became plain how she managed to get up the hallway, a task which was already difficult even for the skinniest member of the office, Christina. It was a harrowing look into a possible future for the office workers. It provoked an instant contrast between the comparatively trim Christina and the blubbery, hamlike Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news of the incoming vacation gave the group cause to cheer, blowing the brief crossroads out of sight. Jenna waited for the cheers to die down as she spoke, \"It'll go for two weeks, it has a pool, an arcade, and, best of all, a buffet.\" A second, louder cheer issued forth from everyone - to her own surprise, even from Christina. <br>\r\n The announcement had given rise to questions, first from Melissa. \"So, how has corporate been?\" Jenna chuckled, taking another deep breath which swelled her already massive gut. \"Uh, it's been good. Stressful, but good. And I guess you can tell how I deal with stress,\" she added with a smirk as she gave her belly a firm pat. The great hill of fat shook slightly with the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, the party met at the seaport, bustling with cargo traffic, and the great multi-decked cruise ship which sat at dock before them. The host of heavy women stood sweating in the august sun and under their own bulk, dressed not in their usual work blouses but in more loose mumu clothing, even Christina. Christina had begun to lower herself into a mentality of toe-dipping - she'd reward herself, but caution herself against excess. \"Here she is - the Ocean's Jollil...\" spoke Jenna, stumbling and taking a breath, wiping her brow with a lardy forearm. \"Tide's Repose\" Jessica raised a brow. \"Repose?\" \"Rest, relaxation.\" replied Jenna. \"Good adjectives for what we're gonna be doing here. Enjoy yourselves!\" Jessica turned to Christina and winked. Christina nodded. </span></div></div>",

Especially after Stephanie's momentary look of confusion was quickly replaced by her trademark shit-eating grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel's smile was just as wide. \"That's cute, 'Lesser Alice' (Alice had secretly become less fond of Mel's playful nickname for her sister ever since it began to take on its double meaning). There are easier ways of telling me I look different with my hair short, just sayin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" began Alice, \"I guess the last time you s-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only teasin you, beautiful person,\" Stephanie casually interjected. Stepping forward, she stood her carry on up on its own next to Alice and cheerfully embraced the bovine brunette in a fleshy but loving embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least tried to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough only the 'second' fattest girl at the airport that day, Mel's jutting, swollen stomach completely prohibited Steph from doing more than leaning into the shorter girl's bosom and sinking her manicured hands into Melissa's thick, squishy upper arms. Likewise, Melissa was growing so ponderously fat these days she had trouble reaching her arms all that far past her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I guess you have changed a little in other ways, sweetie,\" Stephanie added with a wink, lightly patting the protruding tummy keeping her at arm's length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh tell me about it,\" Alice attempted again, shifting impatiently this time (she had been standing for what felt like fifteen minutes now!), \"I think I might have put on some-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk- guilty, girl,\" said Melissa animatedly, completely ignoring Alice. \"But you know how it is when you get a call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From who?!\" Alice blurted out maybe a little too loudly, eager not to be left behind as the two fell into their usual synchronized banter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From,\" Steph turned and said in a deep-voiced, poor attempt at an Austrian accent, \"Da Hungerrr!!!\" Both Stephanie and Melissa burst into uproarious laughter, clearly on the other end of some inside joke that Alice would never have the context to understand. She could only stand there and chuckle weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Mel had to silently take note at how much she jiggled lately when she laughed. Or when she did <i>anything</i> nowadays, really. Mel, always one to prioritize comfort over conformity, had finally surrendered to the sartorial demands of her bulging tummy and now took to buttoning her slacks <i>under</i> her belly instead of over, her surging belly fat finally proving too much to contain in even her biggest pairs of jeans. In her skin-tight baby blue t-shirt, Melissa's heaving, single-tiered stomach quivered and wobbled with as much enthusiasm as she had, catching up with her old friend. And kinda accidentally ignoring her best one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're one to talk about about hunger, Freakazoid (Mel's other passionate nickname for Alice's baby sister. Two? Alice didn't even have one!). I haven't seen you put anything in your mouth in like 5 whole minutes,\" the obese, short-haired beauty said as her much, much leaner friend reached into her hoodie pocket. \"How are you not passed out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie grinned sheepishly as she pulled out what she had been storing in her pocket. \"You just had to say that right as I was getting these,\" she said, revealing two rather impressive king-sized candy bars and quickly demolishing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are-\" Melissa began, but it was Alice's turn to interrupt this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brought Yeng bars?!\" She exclaimed, This time definitely too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm\" her little sister softly cooed. \"I brought a whole suitcase of big sis's favorite snack all the way from home,\" she continued. \"Sort of my way of making up for that shitty Christmas present,\" she added with an apologetic look before stepping over to give Alice a big hug. Finally. \"You were always so upset about your weight when you came home, I thought it's what you wanted. I didn't even think about what it meant until after I sent it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Alice blushed. \"It's fine. I mean, I'm the one complaining about my weight all the time so I know you were only meaning well,\" she said. Her mouth was slowly creasing into a smile but her eyes stayed glued to that second Yeng bar the entire time. Sure, Alice wasn't necessarily famished or anything, but she hadn't had any comfort food in like forever. And with all the standing and waiting and.. reunioning it wasn't long before-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ghrrrrllllllll</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Alice huffed, breaking the hug to look down at the noisy culprit- her stomach. At least, she assumed it was. Generally a safe assumption to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, that would be me. Stephanie said, patting her toned, flat stomach as it let off another impressive rumble, loud enough to be heard over the general bustle and hum of airport activity. This only elicited another giggle as she turned back wistfully in the direction of the air plane she had flown in on. \"The meal on the plane was like an hour and a half ago and they only let me have like 3 of them. Which is bullshit, I know they have more back there,\" she growled more to herself than to the two enormous co-workers, sourly recalling earlier events of the day. To be fair, the older man in the seat next to her <i>had</i> been kind enough to give her his in-flight meal on top of the other ones when he had seen the hurt look in her eye and heard the audible complaints from her stomach. But that was forever ago, she thought to herself, and it still wasn't enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, like, seriously,\" she snapped out of her reverie, \"I <i>really</i> want food cuz I haven't eaten anything since the plane,\" she said, quickly scarfing down the second of the candy bars even more quickly than the first. Alice could only moan inwardly as her heart sank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said,\" Melissa restated, flowing seamlessly back into their A and B only conversation now that the family moment had passed, \"how are you not passed out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, 'How are you still hungry? How come you're not a million pounds? Where does it all go?',\" Stephanie snickered, going through the usual questions before Melissa could have a chance to fire them off. \"Everyone in my family's just blessed, dude. TLC even wanted to do like, one of those sitcoms about us. My mom's skinny, our little brother is skinny, I think Allie here is the only one in the family who got the appetite half but not the metabolism half.\" She leaned over onto her sister's soft saddlebags and gave a hearty laugh before giving Alice a big pinch on her puffy cheek. \"I guess I don't have to feel bad about sending you that  diet book after all- you clearly didn't use it for anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, nice one,\" Mel added with another belly-shaling guffaw. All this movement was causing her shirt to ride up, exposing the massive, wobbly ball of fat to anyone making their way from Arrivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, super funny.\" Alice contributed with another weak attempt at a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the obvious truth was that it was anything but funny to Alice, but she kept that to herself. Poor sweet Alice hated to come off as the jealous type, especially because Stephanie was such a sweetheart too and would be absolutely devastated if she ever felt for a second that strong, wise big sis would ever not be there for her goofy little sister. But, well, it just wasn't <i>fair</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the only one not blessed with The Flash's metabolism meant that the former cheerleader had had to spend her entire childhood denying herself and her unnaturally amplified appetite. But not Stephanie. Stephanie just ate. And ate. And ATE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl must have swallowed a vortex when she was a baby, Alice surmised. Sure, it made little sense, but so did a size 4 who could, on any ordinary day, put away enough food in one buffet sitting to leave even Melissa in a food coma. And she had proven so time and time again in their de facto \"eating competitions\", the foundation that Melissa and Stephanie's peculiar friendship/rivalry was built on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that only made Alice all the more jealous! But Mel could hardly be blamed for being swept up by Steph's natural charisma and tried to do her best to assert that Alice was 'first bestie' when she could remember to. Hence playful nicknames like \"Lesser Alice\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, nothing could change that Steph had the charm, Steph had the looks, Steph had the metabolism.. And, subsequently, Alice inwardly fumed, the body to go with it! Alice had tried (almost) her whole life to stay thin and what did she have to show for it? She was just over 500 pounds! And, more importantly, Alice was 500 pounds and <i>hungry</i>. All this inward fuming and fussing was NOT helping her aforementioned \"blessed\" appetite. Her gut, of course, made its grievances loudly known to the other two similarly \"endowed\" girls. Stephanie's stomach responded by reinforcing its earlier message and Melissa's vastly larger belly offered an equally vocal statement as well. Stephanie, completely clueless to her obese idol's inner monologue, now stood up on her own and gave Alice's now-partially exposed tummy a healthy pat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I don't need to ask big sister if she's hungry too,\" Stephanie said, her immensely fattened sibling's double-tiered belly now rumbling to match hers in volume and intensity. \"We are related, after all,\" she smiled, giving Alice another hug and giving her  soft, bare lower belly roll a firm jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe this won't be too awful,' she thought, her mind momentarily at ease as it drifted on to thoughts of an alleged suitcase stuffed to the brim with Yeng bars. </span></div></div>",

As her fat gut sloshed lazily from side to side, her tree trunk legs struggling to so much as keep her going, it occasionally collided with the fleshy but comparatively smaller obesity of her best friend Alice. The super-sized blonde woman braced her elephantine acquaintance with one chubby hand placed against Melissa\u2019s sweaty padding of back fat as she lurched hungrily towards the donut that her friend held out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little bit further, Mel.\u201d Alice smiled as her big dumb stomach of a coworker took yet another floor-shaking step towards her desk. It would only be a matter of time before they managed to get there safe and sound, and the workday could begin\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026 have to\u2026\u201d Melissa panted objectively, her eyes still locked squarely on the donut, \u201cI\u2019m not some\u2026 some kind of\u2026 of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonutaholic?\u201d Alice piqued an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Melissa puttered, huffing and puffing like an old steam engine, \u201cStop\u2026 stop being such a bitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was more frustrated by the prospect of the object of her affection being routinely yanked away from her pitiful reach. She was getting so fat these days, her arms so heavy and weak, that she could barely swat at the sweet little treat that Alice was bribing her with. Despite her protests, the corners of her mouth were moist with saliva and her greedy gut growled with the fury of a beast being denied its patronage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Courtney\u2019s changes to the office, some had taken to them better than others. Most of the women around had put on weight, yes, but none had done so with quite the same gusto as Melissa. She was always a lazy glutton, yes, but ever since the changes implemented into the Gordge building, she had really gone into overdrive. All she would do is eat, eat, and eat some more until quitting time. Then she\u2019d go out with Alice or Christina or Vicky and they\u2019d eat and eat and eat and then she\u2019d go home and eat and eat and eat\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa collapsed into her office chair. It had been Jenna\u2019s before she left. Her pillowy face was red and glistened with sweat, but her bovine brown eyes managed to light up as Alice tossed her the single donut that had so motivated her this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really starting to worry about you, hun.\u201d Alice frowned as her veritable mountain of a bestie wolfed down the pastry with the same ease one might reserve for breathing or drinking water, \u201cAre you\u2026 okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Melissa panted, \u201cI\u2019m exhausted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Alice\u2019s point entirely. In just a few months, Melissa had become this massive woman, completely obsessed with keeping that greedy gut of hers fed! Now, Alice was in no room to really lead the discussion, but her friend could barely get in and out of the doors at Gordge anymore! It wasn\u2019t healthy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel, sweetie?\u201d Alice lowered her voice and placed one hand on her friend\u2019s most reachable asset\u2014her giant stomach that sagged towards the floor...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As much as she valued her friendship with Alice, she had also gotten pretty friendly with the raven haired butterball recently. Part of what she liked about Melissa was that she was basically the ultimate enabling fat friend. She was always down for a chance to eat. In an office full of gluttonous fatties, there as no one more culinarily permissive than Melissa. In fact, the more embarrassingly indulgent the request, the better. Of course, Christina wasn\u2019t one to show restraint around food herself, but when she was with Melissa it was like they were on a hedonistic expedition to let themselves go as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Alice paused to gather her thoughts. \u201cWhat if we went on a diet together!\u201d She said with a kind smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had two more candy bars shoved into her chocolate stained cheeks. She simply looked up at Alice and shook her head. \u201cNhh nhh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea that might solve this situation.\u201d Christina said, grinning with cleverness. \u201cWhat about a wager?

And if she can\u2019t\u2026 uhhhh,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she can\u2019t she has buy me dinner for a whole week.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c20 pounds\u2026 but in 4 months.\u201d Alice counter-offered. Melissa gave a cocky smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh this is fun. I\u2019ll be the referee.

Her ample waistline and ridiculous hips had gotten her wedged into the doorway to Christina\u2019s apartment. Her vast white belly, stretching her flowery flowy tent of a dress to the point of visibility, was too wide at the flanks. Once she\u2019d pushed past the first few steps and it had hurt, Melissa knew that she ought to have stopped\u2014but the promise of pizza was too inviting, and they\u2019d already ordered it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll call my landlord.\u201d Christina answered, calm and collected, as she whipped out her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristy, wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think you could\u2026\u201d Melissa smacked her lips, her eyes locked on the kitchen counter, \u201cFeed me some of that pizza?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>What</i>?\u201d Christina almost laughed, \u201cMelissa, you\u2019re stuck in my doorway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well my arms are behind me and I\u2019m <i>really</i> hungry!\u201d the great girth of gal whined petulantly, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s right there and I\u2019m so\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 I <i>need</i> it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright\u2026\u201d Melissa grabbed the greasiest, cheesiest slice she could find in the first box and carried it over to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered it into her mouth, much to Melissa\u2019s delight. The belly-heavy behemoth moaned throatily as Christina fed her bite after bite, careful not to get her fingers too close to Melissa\u2019s maw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, how much can you fit in there?\u201d Christina asked idly as she pat the bloated bubble of blubbery belly that was wedged in her doorway, \u201cHow are you <i>still</i> hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2026Yeah\u2026\u201d Melissa puffed, her eyes glassy and her cheeks rosy, \u201cCall your landloard and\u2026 hfff\u2026 maybe get me another slice?\u201d</span></div></div>",

But on the plus side she found herself with a lot more time to hang out with her friends and have fun then go to the gym like she\u2019d been doing for the last year or so. Victoria was content to let herself go a bit after keeping to her strict regiment of\u2026 well\u2026 mostly just slurping down smoothies and getting massages, but still she more than deserved the opportunity to indulge her appetite and relax some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that\u2019s what the big blubbery Italian girl told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Christina offered that Vicky join Melissa and herself for dinner tonight, she happily accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey first met up after work at a bar for drinks\u2026 and of course Melissa ordered some appetizers too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! that\u2019s so goooood.\u201d Victoria practically moaned in a nasally voice as she devoured whatever these greasy fried cheese balls that Melissa ordered were. She washed it all down with a gulp of her sugary cocktail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, URRP only thing is that the portions are so small. Lets get seconds before Christina shows up.\u201d Melissa said having already cleaned the entire plate in front of her. She now was trying to get the bartenders attention while simultaneously slurping the last of her margarita. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Vicky were quite a sight sitting next to each other at the bar. Both young women had parked their massive bodies across two backless stools. Their enormously ripe and overly plump butts bulged on display behind them, as the four stools were completely enveloped by their vast, pillowy, and well-padded bottoms. Two greedy swollen bellies generously hugged the rounded edge of the bar. Their immense meaty midsections bulged out to strain the large tops, which both girls had artfully adjusted to emphasize their bountiful abundance of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Christina waddled her big blubbery belly up to the bar. \u201cHeeyyy babes. Wait are you getting started without me?\u201d she joked with fake surprise. With a cute little whimper Christina managed to haul her luscious rump up onto a bar stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are Christy!\u201d Victoria said, giving her coworker and friend an awkward hug as their gelatinously fluffy fat rolls embraced one another more than their arms did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t save you any but I ordered more just a minute ago.\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now that we\u2019re all here can we talk about where we\u2019re like, going?\u201d Victoria asked with a piggish desire in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonally, I have been craving tacos from Juan Gringo\u2019s all day.\u201d Mel said with a rub of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait did you see not see what my last Instagram post? The BurgerBus is back!\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO.

They retrieved their greasy lunches of cold pizza and leftover burgers than Alice walked into the room. \"Afternoon, Al!\" Alice smiled a gentle smile and spoke. \"Hey, Melissa! Hey Christie!\" Christina's face had grown some substantial chub, as the rest of her had filled out. She didn't quite look fat enough to be obese, but she looked to be approaching the higher limits of being overweight. She couldn't be less than 170 Pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something had struck them about Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, her figure seemed to stay the same or increase ever so slightly, fluctuating a few pounds around 300. But as of the past few weeks, they could tell her stomach had been actually receding. Her losses were noticeable as she removed her lunch of a chicken sandwich and a salad out from the fridge, as well as a shake. She plopped her still considerable mass onto one of the chairs. \"Man, all these reports make me hungry.\" Melissa replied \"Amen to that, sister. These corporate bigwigs, I swear. The only thing that makes this place standable is you girls and Jenna.\" She stuffed a slice of her pizza into her mouth. Christina nodded as she continued into her leftovers from the drive-through. Alice continued. \"Yeah. That's why I love going to the gym. Great release for exercise.\" Melissa spoke. \"We can tell, look at you! Skinny minnie!\" Alice looked down at herself in awe. \"Well, now that you mention it, I guess I have made some progress!\" Melissa was taken a bit aback. \"Some progress? Your belly is so much smaller now! By summertime you'll have your beach body and we'll still looked like beached whales!\" Alice shrugged. \"Well, all you have to do is save for the premium!\" Melissa shook her head. \"With the amount I spend on my weekends out? Get out of here. I pay my mortgage as it is, and I save up for my kid's college. Maybe you could see about taking me sometime, though?\" Alice nodded. \"Sure thing! Maybe this weekend?\" Melissa spoke. \"Well, maybe. I'll text you after work, kay?\" Alice smiled. \"Sure thing, girlie!\" The herd of fatties ate their lunches and, once consumed, they sat for a bit, chatting over coffee until they figured the bosses would notice they weren't at their desks. </span></div></div>",

Her stomach was no longer rolling out in the vast expanse it once was, but it had pulled to a still considerable size as compared to someone of normal weight. Something new was also present: Muscle definition. Her shoulders and her legs were still meaty, padded with fat, but there was a new rigidness to them, a hardness which had not existed there before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, she became an enviable person to the rest of the office. To many, this resulted in similar results, radiating out from Alice's office: More and more of the blubbery women of Gordge had suddenly stopped going out and coming back with fast food and other greasy products, but a sudden, real health craze had hit the offices. Rumor had it that even Jenna was slowly replacing some of her foods with healthier, leaner alternatives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith envy, however, also came despise. Courtney and Melissa sat at break, eating from fast food bags from around the corner. They recieved judging glances from those who had fallen in with Alice's new fad, the new, slowly slimming co-workers who went to and fro with salads and paninis. Melissa spoke. \"I don't know. Alice used to be cool, but, I don't even know now.\" Courtney interjected. \"When was the last time we even talked to her?\"  Melissa replied. \"Uh, like, two months ago, when we asked her out to lunch?\" Courtney nodded. \"See, that's what I'm talking about. I think we need to find some way, some way to get her back to herself.\" Melissa nodded. \"We need to get her off this so we can have our Alice back! I know what I can do.\" Melissa got up from her chair, which gave a groan of relief, and waddled away, while Courtney shrugged and passively sipped on her coffee. By the time Melissa returned with a large chocolate cake, Courtney and most of the workers were at their desks. Melissa peeked into Alice's office, and saw that she was away. Seeing this as her moment, Melissa put the cake on her desk, and slipped back to her office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice returned from the restroom, a relaxing break from the usual routine of work, when she saw the Cake. This twisted her and shook her. On one hand, she wanted it. She rationalized it in many different ways. She deserved it! One cake couldn't hurt. One bad day doesn't equal a ruined diet! Right? But then her shame started competing for space in her head. She should feel ashamed of herself! Does she want to ruin her good work! If she gives in to this, this opens the way for her diet and her new lifestyle to be ruined. She wanted it. But she hated it. She wanted to have the cake, but she wanted also to stay away from that feeling of outgrowing clothes she had bought a week ago and hating herself for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much internal debate..</span></div></div>",

She managed between eating slices of cake and managing the reports and quarterlies. She was about halfway done with the cake by the time the 2:50 Coffee rush came, she had topped her coffee off before-hand, however, so she avoided it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt, however, did not avoid her. One by one, the fitness devotees glanced the leader of their fitness revolution cheating on her diet, not in a minor way, but in a big, big way. Their willpower was sapped, and the donuts which, before, were creature comforts to the few holdouts on that floor, were touched by them. The fitness movement, in that hour, had died. Alice, of course, had not noticed her rebellion dying out. She was too busy focusing on the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time 4:30 rolled around, the cake was done, and her button-up shirt was about to burst at the seams. Melissa peeked into the scene, and she could tell. Alice's diet was defeated. She leaned in. \"Hey, Al!\" Alice sighed, no longer ashamed and now unabashed about her gluttony and the death of her diet. \"Hey, Melissa!\" Melissa chimed. \"Hey, me and Courtney were planning to go out to that pizzeria on 4th Avenue. You wanna come tonight?\" Alice nodded. \"Sure. Give me a moment, I need to get some coffee and a donut.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had seen Marni a few times in the premium member facilities. It had been a while though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarni?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you\u2019re the one that won the membership on our show!

Christina thought the same. Marni was huge! She remembered her being really big but not as massive as this. <i>She looks bigger then Melissa!</i> Christina thought. Marni\u2019s gut spilled over her thighs and hung several inches over the edge of the bench. Her bikini bottom wasn\u2019t even visible as her crotch was covered in the cascading rolls of doughy flab. The absurdly thick leg fat seemed to actually be hanging low around her buried thigh bones. Even though she was sitting on it you could still see her wide butt struggling to fit on the thin (at least for someone the size of Marni) bench. <i>Well it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been keeping my figure intact either.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy coworkers freaked out when I told them I met you.\u201d Christina said sitting next to Marni. \u201cWe listen to you and Cass every day in the office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Where do you work?\u201d Marni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGordge,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you in charge of the gift baskets?!?\u201d Marni said with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 no.\u201d Christina said with a puzzled tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 well that\u2019s still nice I guess.\u201d Marni said. They both went silent for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just found out my membership expired today.\u201d Christina said. Having heard Marni\u2019s voice almost every day she felt weirdly comfortable opening up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to renew it?\u201d Marni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to\u2026 I really want to so badly, but I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Christina sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could possibly pay $100 a week\u2026 or even a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m dealing with something similar as well.\u201d Marni said. She had dropped the peppy energetic tone she used for the radio. \u201cMe and Cass were offered a TV deal yesterday, to do a morning chat show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A TV show? Alice\u2019s head would explode if she were here right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is that similar?\u201d Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 The studio would only do it if I lost some weight.\u201d Marni said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you?\u201d Christina asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAH No freakin\u2019 way!\u201d Marni cackled. Her chins jiggling. \u201cNo contract is gonna turn me into some salad muncher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow so the deal\u2019s off? What did Cass think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCass was pissed but she\u2019s never gonna leave my side.\u201d Marni said. \u201cAnyways the point is that you can\u2019t have everything you want. I want a tv show but I can\u2019t. You want a premium membership but you can\u2019t. You\u2019ve just got to make do with what you\u2019ve got.\u201d This was certainly not what Christina wanted to hear but she saw Marni\u2019s point. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure bumping into Marni was something she could expect these days, but Marni actually inviting her to go out and do something was new. Given how long it took Christina to make friends and feel acknowledged in a small pool of office workers, having a celebrity specifically ask for her to do something with her felt amazing. Marni, perhaps projecting a little, saw it another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you're pretty hungry.\" She chuckled, rubbing her belly. Christina had to admit, after the stress of discovering her premium membership was up, eating just about everything she could sounded tempting. A drink might not hurt either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\" She said with a nod. \"But not just yet. This is going to be my last day in here for a while, I better enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoy it,\" Marni said with a nod \"I'm going to get one of those smoothies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Christina was properly pampered, sweated, and practically begged by the staff to leave, and Marni had laboriously made it though the process of getting changed (not that it was all that easy for Christina these days) they started turning to the question of Dinner. By now Christina really was hungry, and Marni seemed starved. She couldn't stop rubbing her enormous belly in anticipation, like it was a great beast she had to soothe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're tight for cash.\" Marni began \"So why don't we go for Ten Dragons? They have the best dumplings...and fried rice....\" Marni closed her eyes and looked like she was doing an impression of Christina when they first met. Fortunately, before Christina could get too weirded out, her eyes opened wide and she started again \"and the second best part...they have a buffet. So you can get a meal cheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...great.\" Christina said uncertainly. She felt one of her own lovehandles nervously. She imagined the very idea of going to an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet  with Marni had added an inch to her waist. On the other hand, she didn't have many options. Even Taco Bell could tally up to be a painful purchase for her these days, and it wasn't like she was going to pass up this opportunity. Besides, today was a special occasion, even if it wasn't Marni offering. She deserved to indulge. \"That'll be great\" She said, with more enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina thought she had seen it all working for Gordge industries. Working alongside Victoria, Melissa and most of all, Jenna, when she was around, she'd thought she'd all ready witnessed the limits of human gluttony. She was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women she worked with were fat, but they were coddled, and sluggish. They ate at a pace that wasn't refined, but lacked any urgency. They were just as guilty of sloth as they were of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so with Marni. Though her increasing weight had slowed her pep down on air a tad, it was clear she still had loads of it at the dinner table. She loaded up her plate with little care for what she was grabbing, chatting away with Christina as she did, until it was loaded so high Christina was worried Marni had forgotten what she was doing. Once both of them were convinced it couldn't handle another grain of rice without spilling on the floor, Marni took the plate back to their table and in a tradition familiar to Christina, gorged in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, silence wasn't quite the right word. Marni was far too busy to talk while she was eating, but she certainly made a lot of noise. She chewed, slurped and happily groaned her way through 10 plates of dinner without even slowing down. The orchestra of appetite finished with a crescendo as Marni let out a belch so loud it caused Christina to skiddishly duck her head, in case the roof came down or the manager kick them out. In the awkward silence that filled the restaurant in the aftermath, Marni licked her lips a few times and asked \"Have you thought about what I told you earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About?\" Christina asked, her train of thought totally interrupted by Marni's shameless display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you can't have everything you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Christina said, glumly. \"I guess I should just give up thinking about that sauna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did not understand me at all.\" Marni informed her bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...\" Christina started awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to finish that?\" Marni interrupted her, pointing at Christina's fourth plate of Chinese. Christina shook her head and handed it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought the point of the story was I couldn't have a TV show and should just accept it.\" She said, lifting the plate so she could literally shovel rice into her mouth. \"It wasn't. *umf* I <i>could</i> have the TV show...but I'd rather have this, and enjoy it.\" She said, finishing the plate while lost in thought. Meanwhile, Christina was really taking in what Marni was saying for the fist time. \"The problem isn't that you can't have that membership. The question is, what do you really want most right now?\"</span></div></div>",

But no, Christina had forgotten all about that since last night. Her new job offer weighed heavily on her mind. The year she'd spent with Gordge had been wonderful, but stressful, and this was yet another crisis that  she just didn't want to deal with anymore. So she ate, and ate, and hoped with enough food in her, there'd be no more room for this stress inside her. Her plans were interrupted though, when Victoria actually tried to get an answer out of Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think Chris? Chris? Chrissy?\" Victoria asked, growing impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rude to ignore her like that.\" Alice noted, thinking Christina was annoyed at Victoria, and feeling a little tired of hearing about the gym herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what was the question?\" Christina asked, slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if you had any idea when you'd be getting your gym membership back.\" Victoria huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...about that,\" Christina mumbled, figuring this was as good a time to unload as she was going to get. \"I got a new job offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Victoria gasped, nearly losing balance on her precariously perched posterior. Alice didn't say anything, but she certainly sat up and took notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I met with Marnie last night at the gym, and we got tlaking and...she offered me a job at the radio station.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina was asked to come in on Saturday to help Melissa and Alice with something. She wasn\u2019t really excited to do it but being a newbie still she wasn\u2019t really in a position to say no. She was a bit nervous for some reason. She really liked Alice and Melissa, but she knew they had their own thing going on with them being best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the office to see Melissa sitting by herself. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Christie, Alice should be here any minute.\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay cool.\u201d Christina said as she sat down next to her. She noticed that Melissa seemed grumpy, like she was annoyed by something. Melissa was fidgeting in her seat causing her blubbery body to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright? It seems like something is bothering you.\u201d She asked Melissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 Alice is supposed to be bringing doughnuts for us but she\u2019s like 15 minutes late.\u201d Melissa groaned. She rubbed her massive belly. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten anything since breakfast which was\u2026 30 minutes ago!\u201d Christina was a little surprised. She knew Melissa was a big eater but she hadn\u2019t seen how desperately addicted she was. Now that she thought about it, Melissa really never stops eating. Even when she walked by her desk she always had something in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew I should have brought something with me, damn it.\u201d Melissa said. Christina looked at Melissa. She was like a huge whining baby. Her enormous belly rolls filled her entire lap. She was fat all over. Her thighs were thick and full, her breasts were large and plump, her hips were wide, her arms were doughy, her face was chubby and soft. But they were hardly noticeable compared to her monstrous gut. Both physically and mentally Melissa was dominated by her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d Alice said as she waddled into the room. Indeed she was carrying several boxes of what surely was pastries of some sort. She dropped the boxes on the table and landed heavily in her seat. She was completely out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to eat first.\u201d Melissa said as she laid her eyes on the pastries. Alice just nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Christina\u2026 *huff* here\u2019s yours.\u201d Alice said as she slid one of the boxes across the table to her. Christina was about to say something but paused as Melissa and Alice ripped open the boxes and started to stuff their faces. The two best friends didn\u2019t even look up as they shoved food in their mouths. Christina was a little disturbed by their piggish act of gluttony. Alice must have been starving as well by the way she desperately gorged. Christina wasn\u2019t very surprised to see Melissa eat with so little restraint. She was however taken aback by Alice\u2019s equal level of feasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really liked Alice (who didn\u2019t?). She was so nice and pretty. Her jiggling fat spread elegantly throughout her body. Christina had never equated Alice to be a glutton like Melissa, Jenna, and Courtney. But watching Alice mindlessly eat, she for once saw the indulgent beast that was hidden by her polite, bubbly, gracious personality. In fact Christina had never really paid attention to just how fat she was. Maybe it was because Alice wasn\u2019t as big as Courtney, Jenna, and even Melissa, that Christy never noticed how plump and obese she had become. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a distinct smell of coffee and caramel floating in the air, and the skinny barista in the green apron was handing out plastic cups the size of footballs. Some new-agey stuff filtered in through the radio, but the volume was reasonable. There were windows on either of the walls that faced the road, giving just about everyone a view of the people walking the streets and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s the gym!\u201d Christina said excitedly, taking a few steps closer to the window, \u201cI knew this place looked familiar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Melissa shuffled in, both left breathless from the twenty feet walk it took to get inside. They\u2019d suggested the place, and said that it was a favorite outing for everyone in the office\u2014kindly informing Christina that all of Vicky\u2019s coffee runs had come from none other than this specialized little iced-coffee heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys wanna head over there after we\u2019re done?\u201d Christina asked eagerly, maybe still trying to justify her rather lacking workout from three days ago <i>and</i> the half-dozen donuts she\u2019d scarfed down after breakfast\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa did a double take before a wry smile crossed her lips, obviously the big-bellied brunette was doing her best to hold back some throaty laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She said with a snort as she waddled her way to a booth, \u201cCome on Al, let\u2019s <i>jog</i>, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice laughed politely before turning to her svelter counterpart for the day, her soft eyes telling a silent apology on behalf of her rather uncouth compadre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three women seated themselves, a lanky teen who couldn\u2019t have been but barely legal came over and too, their order, smacking her gum uninterestedly as Alice and Melissa rattled off a long list of caf\u00e9 items and muffins. By the time the millennial girl had turned to Christina, she\u2019d been forced to flip the order pad to a new sheet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll just have a muffin.\u201d Christina said self-consciously, almost sorry for the girl with the nose ring as she shuffled back behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she was rude.\u201d Melissa said a little too loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d Christina said with a curl of her nose, \u201cIf you\u2019re not a people person, just stick to making coffee. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo right.\u201d Melissa said with a slurp of her frappe, \u201cHer loss. Alice is a good tipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, this is so good.\u201d Christina said wide-eyed as she choked down her muffin, \u201cWhy havent\u2019 you guys ever taken me here before?! This is like <i>the best muffin ever</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice laughed that geeky little giggle she had, her cheeks bunching up into rosy little bunches as her mouth made them dimple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d She said with a smile, \u201cWe usually get something little here before heading somewhere else. It\u2019s a little expensive, but I think we can manage a little treat every now and again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa nodded, unable to answer with her mouth\u2019s capacity capped out on krulers. She had hardly ordered a little treat\u2014more like something Christina would have called a very expensive lunch for two\u2014but Alice didn\u2019t seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Christy.\u201d Alice began, \u201cHow\u2019d you like your first real taste of work? I know Courtney has you do her stuff all the time, but you\u2019ll probably get put on accounting and sales rep with me and Melissa. Do you think you can handle it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I think so.\u201d Christie said with another bite of her muffin, \u201cMellissa let me handle the KISS102.5 account, and I think I just bought us a butt-ton of advertising.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Alice said before taking a slurp of her coffee, \u201cThat\u2019s great! You better not tell Jenna you did it though. She wasn\u2019t too happy we called in a rookie to help us do our jobs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jenna can suck it.\u201d Melissa said, having finally swallowed, \u201cShe found an extra <i>$200</i> in our advertising and puts it <i>all</i> towards commercial development. So for like, the next six months we\u2019re getting commercials that aren\u2019t just the CEO narrating what Gordge does <i>and</i> had enough left over to increase the care packages from bi-weekly to weekly! I\u2019d say the newbie did pretty good for her first shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d Alice said with a smile that wasn\u2019t unlike the kind you\u2019d give a child who passed her first spelling test, \u201cThat\u2019s so great Christie, Jenna\u2019s getting onto us all the time about how we don\u2019t ever have any money for commercials. Maybe you have what it takes to be one of the girls after all, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie looked at Alice\u2019s belly as it enveloped a part of the booth, her heavy breathing making her whole body rise and fall. Melissa looked up at her with stuffed cheeks, little crumbs caught in the corners of her mouth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-Thaaaanks\u2026\u201d the little blonde girl said with a forced smile, \u201cI, uh\u2026 don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Melissa and I were going to head over to Carrie\u2019s house\u2014you know Carrie, right?\u2014for dinner. You wanna come with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina looked down at her lonesome muffin, half-eaten on her plate as she caught sight of her modest belly in the peripheral vision. She was suddenly overcome with guilt over her latest dietary slip...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No thanks, I think I\u2019m gonna hit up the gym\u2026\u201d she said apologetically, \u201cBut, uh, you can tell her I said hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself, Gym's closed on Saturdays.\" Melissa burped, \"<i>And</i> we're your ride home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa, don't be mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina pondered for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... is Carrie's cooking as good as I remember it from the Christmas party?\"</span></div></div>",

During work days, she was assigned tasks by just about everyone, and so she worked with Alice, Melissa, Victoria, and Jenna on a variety of tasks, and she had proven excellent in her work in every regard.  As she grew ever invaluable to the function of the group, she was included not only in work activities, but more of the social ones as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis newfound popularity was associated with major lifestyle changes.  She took snack breaks with the girls, ate with them in the food court daily, and partied with them on weekends.  Exercise occurred sparingly, usually during episodes of extreme guilt over some dietary indiscretion.  This wasn't happening very often anymore, though, because the lines between gluttony and daily routine were becoming ever more blurry.  It was normal to eat five or six donuts in a sitting, right?  Alice ate them a dozen at a time.  A second double cheeseburger at lunch?  That would just be getting started for Melissa.  Christina's perspective on what was normal and abnormal was rapidly changing as she did her best to keep up with the onslaught of work and food that she faced each day.  This had made it easier to accept the changes that were occurring in her body as well.  She didn't have a gut - Jenna's belly was so big that she couldn't see her feet!  Fat?  She was by far the skinniest girl she knew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the real world, though, Christina was getting to be a plumper.

Christina didn\u2019t think much of it. Around the office button popping was just something that happened often after a big meal. She rubbed her stuffed belly in her lap. It didn\u2019t use to sit in her lap. She didn\u2019t think about that though. Instead she looked next to her at Melissa and Courtney. The two women\u2019s bellies were spilling over their chairs. She admired all her empty lap space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not everyone is naturally thin.\u201d She thought with a smirk. She might not have thought that if she saw how big her gut was becoming as it slowly pushed further over her thighs.

Christie finally had that well defined cleavage with her plump boobs just barely touching.

It had been some time since there last few trips together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you been to the gym since we last worked out together?\u201d Christina asked. They were entering the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, too busy. But I figured that chair breaking was a sign that I may have gotten a bit out of shape. What about you?\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce or twice but then I couldn\u2019t find the time. I haven\u2019t been keeping track of my weight but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gained anything\u2026 Do you think I have?\u201d Christina said. She was pretty sure she hadn\u2019t but it couldn\u2019t hurt for a second opinion. Still in the middle of changing she showed off her underwear clad body to Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky paused. She actually liked Christy despite what she said about her in the break room. She just didn\u2019t like all the praise Christina got for being so skinny, since it used to be Vicky being called skinny. That didn\u2019t bother her much (since Vicky knew she looked good). So she looked at Christina\u2019s bare flab. She was at least 40 pounds heavier than their last trip to the gym. She had a chubby gut and a soft layer of padding all over. It was hard to ignore her near 200 pound body, but Victoria did not want to be the one to tell her she\u2019d gained weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you look great. You\u2019ve got everyone in the office jealous (except for herself, Victoria thought).\u201d Christina smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. You look great too.\u201d Christina said. That\u2019s when she saw Victoria\u2019s half naked body. Victoria had gained just as much as Christina had. She decided not to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey first decided to use the treadmills. While Christina started a slow jog, Victoria was barely walking. She slowly plodded one foot at a time. Christina was a little embarrassed to be next to her jiggling friend. The machine groaned as the near 300 pound Victoria shifted her weight from one foot to the other. Her workout attire was incredibly undersized for her. Her tight spandex leggings struggled to cover the top of her enormous bottom and her shirt failed to hide her love handles and belly rolls. She had an energy bar in both hands. Christina noticed people staring with judging eyes at Victoria\u2019s blubbery body. She was like a poster for the young, lazy, and obese. Sweat dripped down her face as she waddled at a slow crawl, occasionally taking bites from her two chocolate bars. Disgusted faces looked as her bulging bottom and bloated belly wobbled with each step. Victoria of course didn\u2019t even notice, Christina did though. However what she didn\u2019t notice was that people were staring at both of them. While she paled in comparison to Vicky, Christina looked like a whale compared to the skinny toned gym regulars. Her extra soft hourglass figure was bouncing and wobbling as well and her plump belly hung a bit over her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you been to that all you can eat Chinese food place yet?\u201d Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 Is it\u2026 Any good?\u201d Christina said breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s great! Their dumplings are to die for. We should go sometime. I went last weekend with Alice and\u2026 *giggle* and she broke a chair.\u201d Victoria giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas she\u2026 Okay?\u201d Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah she was fine. I guess she\u2019ll need a booth next *huff* time.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did the restaurant do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe restaurant? They\u2026 *pant* they were really sorry about *wheeze* it. I think she gets to eat their for free now.\u201d Victoria said. \u201cThe food was really good though. Not as good as the *huff* all you can eat place on Turner Street. That place has so many *gasp* stuff.\u201d Victoria then listed a wide range of fattening foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though Victoria stopped her treadmill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 *huff* done. Let\u2019s\u2026 go eat.\u201d Victoria huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? It\u2019s only been\u2026 9 minutes.\u201d Christina said. 9 minutes of walking and Victoria was tapping out. Not only that but Victoria had reached a full sweat and was completely out of breath. Christina felt like a track star next to Vicky. She probably could\u2019ve worked out a little longer (although not that much longer) but she decided to join Victoria for lunch (all that food talk made her hungry).<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Food was a reward for a job well done, celebration for someone else's achievement, a needed energy boost during a late afternoon, and an opportunity to be social.

Her soft hourglass was morphing into a snowman-type figure with a round face over big round boobs over a big round belly over a big round butt.

Getting to the gym is a real workout\", Christina huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it... I'm, like... I already had my exercise for today\", Victoria panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the fat friends started to change into their gym clothes. It gave them both a good view of how the other had changed since their last visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way Christina's old gym clothes would have fit the full-blown fatty she had become. The double chin that now adorned her face came into full view as she looked down and reached for some clothes. Her big, bulging breasts bounced as she struggled to fit a new top over her torso. Her round belly now had two distinct folds that were clearly showing even under her top. Her big rear pressed against her tight pants, the curves of her fat cheeks and thighs visible against the thin fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 240-pound Christie may have been undoubtedly fat, but standing next to 298-pound Vicky made her seem slimmer than she was. Victoria had a very round face, big, jiggly melons and a soft, expansive belly with an incredibly meaty spare tire. Her well-padded hips flared out and led to a massive rear. Two titanic globes of fat stuck out behind her and provided her a thick, curved shelf of wobbly lard, leading to her wide tree trunk thighs. Christie never thought she'd see someone as big as Vicky dressed in a tank top that was so small it was almost a sports bra, her rolls and love handles in full view, and shorts that were so insufficient that they revealed more than just the <i>curves </i>of her huge ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving changed, they both took a moment before entering the gym area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think I might have gotten pretty out of shape\", admitted Christina.

The other gymgoers stared at the two portly girls, who looked anything but in place, their blubbery curves jiggling profusely and the struggle to maintain their pace betraying their utter lack of fitness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina couldn't help but join the ones who were staring at Victoria. The way her mass jostled with her every step was almost hypnotic in a way. Her fleshy spare tire and enormous, bulging rear wobbled and rippled in unison, both exposed to all viewers thanks to Vicky's intentionally scant clothing. The strips of fabric that were supposed to be her shorts were barely decent as it was and had noticeable difficulty keeping up with her huge boulders. It distracted Christina enough that she paid no attention to the way her full-figured curves undulated in much the same way. She was actually big enough to attract almost as much attention as Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exercise was quickly taking a toll on the blubbery babes. Vicky panted, her skin starting to get sweaty as she slowed down to a crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I'm totally done. Let's go Christie...\", she pleaded as she stopped and dragged herself onto a nearby bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her increasingly sweaty forehead, Christie decided she might as well stop too. They had spent more time filling themselves up with snacks than they had spent actually doing anything. They really were living up to the prejudices of the other gym people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, they were totally staring in there\", Christina said as the two were changing into their regular clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know- I love it! And I think I could spot one or two who couldn't take their eyes off you either\", said Victoria. She kind of wanted to add that maybe they were staring at Christie because she was getting so fat. But she didn't, and she didn't even consider that the same might apply to her. Victoria shook her hips, causing her shelflike rear to almost wobble out of her underwear. She gave it a slap, the soft flesh quivering as her hand smacked the side of her cheek. \"It's like, I feel hotter every time I come here. It's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to get dressed in their regular clothes. Christina's dress was clinging tightly to her curves, hugging every inch of her soft flab. Vicky squeezed into a very short skirt that certainly emphasized her incredibly fat ass. They were both looking forward to rewarding themselves with the most indulgent of meals.</span></div></div>",

The four big girls had each ordered more food than two people would usually get, all getting double meals to get twice as much soda and extras. The service was in fact quite smooth, and soon the girls' lunches were ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking their seats at a booth (none of them wanted to risk a \"chair accident\"), the girls hardly had time to get comfortable before they began to gobble down their meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was enjoying herself fully as she scarfed down the first of her several burgers. Alice was a little less able to appreciate her food. She was looking at Christina's lunch, trying to hide her concern and failing completely. Her stack of burgers, fries and soda was as big as Alice's, and Christina seemed like she didn't even notice (or care about) it. Surely Victoria had also noticed? Looking over at her other friend, Victoria seemed as lost in her food as Melissa, greedily stuffing her face with fries and mouthfuls of burger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Christie-\", Alice said awkwardly quietly, almost whispering. \"Are you... Are you really going to eat all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Christina said, smiling happily as she took another gulp at her first soda. \"I've had bigger meals. Did you order too little, or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... I mean, no. It's nothing\", said Alice. With the way Melissa and Victoria were gorging themselves right next to her, Alice had a hard time convincing herself to worry about Christina's meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-uurp!\" Christina began to respond, but couldn't hold down a belch. The other girls giggled for a moment, Christina blushing a little and covering her mouth with her hand. But they couldn't keep themselves from their food for long, and soon everyone was reaching for their second huge burger, completely engrossed in their delicious, supersized lunch.</span></div></div>",

She turned sideways to try and fit her 315-pound frame between the two precariously placed desks. This had never been a problem before, but now Victoria's girth was almost too much to fit, even standing sideways. Her soft butt-blubber pressed against the desk behind her as she tried to squeeze herself into the gap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound of steps, Victoria turned her head to see Christina round the corner, chewing on a snack bar. She's getting so fat, every week she's bigger than the last one, Victoria thought as she spotted the 260-something-pound Christie. Christina's mass was filling out her outfit to the limit, straining every button that still held on. Her shirt failed to reach all the way down her belly, letting a sliver of her white, meaty flesh remain completely exposed and uncovered between her shirt and her skirt. Her round, jiggly boobs bounced slightly as she took another bite at her snack, and she couldn't resist moving one hand to rub the side of her soft lower belly roll slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina hardly even noticed the situation Victoria was in, the first thing that caught her attention was Vicky's outfit. It was the tightest dress she'd ever seen anybody wear at work. Victoria's monstrous rear pressed against the back, creating two bulges that were the exact shapes of her expansive ass cheeks. The dress dug into her upper body so tightly that her thick back rolls, her love handles, her spare tire, all her curves were completely visible. Christie felt sort of embarrassed that she was able to see so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hngh! Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria had resorted to trying to push the desks away from each other to give herself more space. They were pretty heavy, though, and even as Victoria strained her thick, flabby arms she wasn't making much progress. Instead, she shuffled sideways, her incredible thickness completely filling up the space between the two desks the entire way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tight space?\" Christina commented with a smile before taking another bite at her snack. Victoria shuffled a little more, her body finally flopping out of the narrowish gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I almost didn't get through! Good thing I keep in shape\", said Victoria, moving one hand to her waist in a smug pose. It was a little comical, seeing as her bulging slabs of fat were so obviously visible when combined with the dress she was currently wearing. Nothing about Victoria was in shape, whatever she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... wanna get some snacks?\" Christina suggested. Victoria sighed and moved some of her dark hair away from her face, taking a minute to catch her breath. \"Maybe a soda? You look thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe both\", Victoria said and snickered, causing her rotund rolls to wobble inside her skin-tight dress. \"This stuff, like, stresses me out. Yeah, let's go get something.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Christina. She could barely believe that the formerly thin office worker was the same person as the almost 400-pound whale lumbering towards Victoria now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's newfound appetite was surprising everyone in the office. Even in an office full of big eaters, only the eating machine Melissa could hold a candle to the huge lunches and ceaseless snacking that Christina had been displaying over the last few months. She was filling herself up to the limit of passing out from overeating, day after day after day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pounds were piling on Christina so quickly that it was hard for anybody to keep up. Her newest office garb was already about to burst at the seams. Absurdly inappropriate amounts of cleavage spilled through her neckline - her huge, heaving breasts were almost completely bare, swaying lazily in front of her torso. Massive arms packed with fat were forced through sleeves that pinched and stretched desperately over their girth. Her hips bulged out to an impressive degree, and on her back side her chair-crushingly huge rear wobbled with enough force to make her ass cheeks clap against each other. Her legs were rounded pillars of lard, her enormous thighs pumping almost uselessly with each heavy footfall. Her spectacled face, once sharp and well-defined, was now absolutely round, her cheeks fat and puffy, her double-chin drooping down over her whole neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how fat her friend had gotten herself filled Victoria with a sense of pride and superiority. As far as Victoria was concerned, she'd barely put on a single pound since she started working at Gordge - because she, Victoria, knew how to stick to a good and healthy lifestyle, she knew better than to let office life turn her into a lazy office fatty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, to anybody else, everything about Victoria's appearance and behaviour screamed 'lazy office fatty'. Victoria's delusion over her weight just downright didn't make any sense. Every inch of her desk was covered with food scraps, plates and empty snack wrappers. She hadn't moved for hours, her elephantine hips shoved into a chair that wasn't nearly wide enough to suit her, the armrests visibly pressing deep into her soft flab. Even as Christina was blowing up into an absolute butterball, Victoria was accumulating pounds and inches at a steady pace. For as little as she did realize it herself, Victoria's body was beyond fat, it was a huge, bottom-heavy pile of dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that entered Victoria's mind for a single second. She was still in the middle of judging Christina. The dark-haired secretary shook her head. Christina seriously needed to get back to the gym, she silently told herself. Victoria hadn't heard anything about Christina working out for like, half a year. No wonder she'd gotten so fat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Now that she thought about it, she hadn't gone to the gym either. The last time she went was with Christina! Well, that was different. Victoria didn't need to work out. She was in great shape anyway, she was sexy as hell and she knew it. More than that, Victoria knew that for every roll and dimple on Christina's body, she would look even more like a bombshell standing next to her. Maybe she should drag Christina along to the gym again, if only so that she could show off her own smoking hot body. With a smug smile, she rotated her chair, looking up at Christina just as the blonde arrived at Victoria's desk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The edge of the desk cut sharply into Christina's very, very well-padded middle. A pile of doughy flesh quickly enveloped the edge and began to ooze onto the top of the desk. The heavy, lardy mass rolled over the wrappers, plates and food scraps laden all over Victoria's space. A single unopened chocolate bar was sent tumbling over the edge on Victoria's side. Luckily, it landed right in the secretary's lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it Christy!\" Victoria couldn't help to blurt out as she snatched the chocolate bar from her lap. She deftly peeled the wrapper off and, without giving the action a single though, stuffed a big part of the bar into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh - did I do that?\", Christina responded, looking down at her ginormous plump torso - or just straight into her own cleavage, it was hard to tell. \"I-I just wanted to ask if you wanted anything. I was gonna go get a snack,\" Christina continued. Victoria chewed absentmindedly for a few moments before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I think I'll get myself a little something. Give me a moment and I'll come along,\" Victoria answered before taking another bite at the chocolate bar in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Christina said, her dimpled, fat cheeks and jowls contorting into a happy smile. Victoria glanced once at her computer, chewed for a while, and then took another bite at the remains of her chocolate bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just gotta finish this. Still hungry, must have been walking a lot today or something,\" Victoria mumbled, gesturing to the little bit of chocolate bar she was still holding on to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina hoisted herself upright and ponderously turned around as she waited, relieving Victoria's desk of the immense pressure for a moment. But then, the blonde office worker backed up her enormous ass against the desk. Victoria took a final bite at the remaining chocolate scraps, warily eyeing her friend's gargantuan rear. And sure enough, just a few seconds later the whole desk gave off a horrible KREEEEEK as it shifted a few inches towards Victoria, pushed by Christina's incredible weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christy!\" Victoria yelped, as her friend, startled, stopped leaning against the desk. The blonde turned around, her fat cheeks now red with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria let out a flustered huff. \"Ugh, Christy, you're like a wrecking ball!\" She looked up to see her friend mouth a silent \"sorry!\" in return. Victoria just shook her head and tossed the now empty wrapper in her hand onto her desk. \"Alright, let's go,\" she grunted towards Christina, and started the arduous effort of squeezing her rear out of her office chair.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yeahh imagine how good I\u2019d look next to a whale like that in workout gear. I\u2019m so glad I was able to stay thin, cause like everybody in this office is huge and they seem to be getting bigger and there always busting their pants, I mean I did bust my pants once but that was just a washing shrinking incident, wow I must look like a stick next to them.

It was like some sort of fat veil had been lifted, and now every pound on her gigantic body was completely exposed and clear to her. She observed herself in the mirror, almost looking as if she was about to cry at the fact she didn\u2019t even completely fit in the mirror. As she was feeling her large stomach and all it\u2019s new (well New to her) flab she thought to herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could I let this happen, how could I get so..so FAT.\u201d<br>\r\nShe turned around and cringed at the size of her huge ass. \u201c ehh my perfect ass, it was so trim and firm and now look at it, it\u2019s huge and flabby and it wobbles when I move ehhh\u201d Christina started to tear up.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so fat. I miss my hot, thin body\u201d she cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Christina decided she would do everything she could to get her hot perfect body back. But it proved harder than she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first couple of months, due to her new found awareness of her current weight, she started to notice how much she struggled with, what used to be simple and easy tasks for her when she was thin. She notice how she always used the elevator instead of the stairs, which at the start of her job was her main way of getting from floor to floor. She notice how she had to cram her now large ass into her chair just to fit in it and how the bars at the sides dug into her waist. She notice how difficult walking had become and how quickly she became out of breath, as well as how difficult it was to move around, without knocking things over with her huge mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made it very difficult for Christina to lose weight as it took her quite a bit to get used to her new blubber and this made it challenging to exercise. The gym had become like hell on earth for Christina, all the judgy looks for all the other women as she tried to lose weight and all the little demeaning whispers around the gym \u201cOMG. Do you see that girl over there, I swear down I saw like a year ago in this same gym and I\u2019m telling you she used to be skinny. God she got fat.\u201d<br>\r\nAlso dieting had become a new challenge for her. Giving up on her most favourite foods proved impossible. All day she spent craving some delicious foods and dying  to just eat a burger. And this lead to snacking... lots and lots of snacking. She would bargain with herself saying things like \u201cone donut won\u2019t hurt\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve been the gym so I can treat myself today\u201d but as time went on, one soon became two which soon became four and so on, ultimately leading to the inevitable outcome....</span></div></div>",

Lauren was a new assistant for Jenna in the office. Jenna had got so big that she was forced to hire someone to assist her when she was in need. However her new assistant was a bit of a b*tch. <br>\r\n\u201cHaha. And I thought Jenna was a whale but if you keep up the way your going it want be long before your the fattest in the office.

Im not gonna lie but she looks as if she\u2019s gained like 200lbs since the last checkup\u201c Melissa said, as the 3 girls stared at the behemoth known as Christina as she wolfed down her 9 donut in the last 5 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 months later (weight check up day)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap\u201d said Melissa as she watch the titanic sight of Christina struggle through the elevator door holding 4 bags of McDonald\u2019s. <br>\r\n\u201cWow she got fat\u201d she said as she stared in amazement as the oversized blonde wobbled to her desk her gut on full display as her cloths look like they were about to pop of her. She took up the entire row as walked down to get to her seat, knocking almost everything she walked past over. When she finally got to her desk, wheezing and sweating from her short journey she pulled out a burger plonked herself down and began stuffing her face. <br>\r\nThe other office girls just thought<br>\r\n \u201c how did someone so thin let themselves go that badly\u201d as the stared at her panting and stuffing her face. \u201c<br>\r\nAs the new weights were posted some off the other office members were amazed at the results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna : 867lbs 9 out of 10<br>\r\nCourtney: 597lbs 7 out of 10<br>\r\nAlice: 613lbs 8 out of 10<br>\r\nMelissa: 580lbs 7 out of 10<br>\r\nVictoria: 568lbs 7 out of 10<br>\r\nChristina: 874 lbs 9 out of 10<br>\r\nLauren: 126lbs 1 out of 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible. I didn\u2019t think anyone could be bigger than Jenna. \u201c said Courtney. <br>\r\n\u201cTrue but remember, Jenna had been trying to cut back she didn\u2019t want to get fired, whereas Christina.. Jeez that girl can eat, who knew when we first met that slim girl would turn out like that\u201d said Melissa. <br>\r\nChristina just looked in amazement at the result. <br>\r\n\u201c I used to be so thin, now I\u2019m the fattest in the office, what happened to me\u201d she thought in despair as she waddled back to her desk to comfort eat her sorrows away. </span></div></div>",

How the heck did we miss this?\" Christina said, slowly making her way across the hallway with Victoria on her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, I mean, I didn't get a chance to notice because you totally stopped coming to the gym with me\", Victoria complained, before taking yet another sweet, chocolatey bite off of what she insisted was just another healthy 'energy bar'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stopped coming because you stopped going, Victoria\", Christina sassily replied, nudging the fat, malleable flesh of Victoria's flank with her own equally fat and malleable elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but like, <i>you</i> stopped going too, Christy\", Victoria muttered in response, feebly swatting her free hand at Christina's elbow to protect herself from her friend's prodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shrugged at the response, turning her head around and letting go of a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I still can't believe they got a frickin' pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two incredibly hefty women were currently waddling their way to the gym's indoor swimming pool area in their swimsuits, causing quite the commotion in the hallways. Of course, the two of them were totally unable to process how every other gymgoer who as much as glanced in their direction stopped to stare in shock. The sight before the judgemental gymgoers was completely outrageous to them, and stunned, silent faces appeared wherever Victoria and Christina showed up on their way to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina had dressed for the occasion in a very, <i>very</i> revealing bikini that didn't leave anything to the imagination of the flabbergasted gymgoers. With each swing of either of her thick thighs, her drooping middle was struck  and her gargantuan heaps of fat flopped upwards before settling back down again. Every inch of her girth, from the thickest of her belly rolls to the most minute, hard-to-reach flap of fat jiggled along with her motions, now that there was barely a strip of clothing left to hold back her tonnage. Two monstrous sacks of breast flesh were crushing the poor cups of her bikini top, pouring out the sides of it and really stretching out the thin straps that were digging deep ridges into her chest, back and shoulders. Further down, the waistband of her bikini bottom was buried under an bulging roll of flab hanging from her middle, making her look almost naked, and her backside wasn't much better, as the immense dimensions of Christina's posterior by far eclipsed the pesky little bit of fabric that was meant to cover her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria wasn't one to be outdone, and her choice of outfit was just as skimpy as Christina's. Vicky's doubly tiered voluptuous stomach and wide, doughy love handles were completely out in the open, and her bikini bottom was little more than a few strings hugging the olive expanse they were supposed to cover. Viewed from the back, most of her bikini bottom was in the process of wedging itself into the deep gorge between the two bulbous halves of Victoria's vast, overgrown ass, letting every single inch of thick, dimpled blubber hang out in full view of everyone around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were absolutely breaking every single dress code and rule of decency imaginable, but none of them would note the stares they got from every passer-by as anything other than jealousy and desire. They were eating up every bit of attention they were getting and none of them felt the least bit insecure as they finally arrived at their destination, the door leading to the swimming pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff and a shove from her doughy elbow, Christina pushed open the door. As Christina and then Victoria squeezed themselves through the opening into the room, the girls were hit by a wave of warmth and the sight of the rectangular swimming pool that took up most of the space in front of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they were surprised to find that the pool and the whole area around it didn't have a single person present. The rest of the gym had been bustling with activity, but this room was totally deserted. A few drips and shrinking puddles near the pool indicated that someone had in fact been here not too long ago, but for now the room was clean and empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed behind Victoria and Christina, muffling the cacophony of blaring music, exercise machines and strained grunts they had been hearing outside. Without the bustle of the rest of the gym, the pool area became almost unnervingly calm, the droning sound of the lights overhead and the gentle rippling of moving water making itself heard in the otherwise absolute silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's empty\", Christina stated flatly, her voice echoing as she looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe we shouldn't be in here, what if they're cleaning or something?\" Victoria hissed, as if speaking too loudly might alert a hidden janitor to their presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls hesitated. They huddled together for a moment, taking a little time to consider what to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...Oh, screw it. If they're gonna chase us out, I'm getting in while I have the chance\", Christina finally asserted. She threw her towel onto one of the nearby benches and approached the pool. Victoria held still for a moment, stuffing the rest of her snack into her mouth, quickly chewing and swallowing, before dropping her own towel onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this, Christy\", Victoria called out to Christina, brushing through her long hair once before spreading her feet into a wide stance. She fished her flimsy bikini bottom out from between her bare butt cheeks, before rubbing her hands over her hefty hips for a moment. A look of concentration took hold of her face, and she squinted her eyes at the pool a few steps in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a sudden swing of her rearmost leg, she brought her immense bulk into forward motion. Her arms wobbling wildly along with her legs, she power-waddled to the edge of the pool. At the edge, Victoria bent her knees, and sprung into the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria threw her arms forward and tried to bend her body downwards towards the pool beneath her. One moment she was looking like an obese seagull diving for fish, somehow elegant in her own way. But she twisted awkwardly, losing her balance and tumbling gracelessly for a second before having the whole length of her body smashing violently through the water's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden splash created by Victoria's plunge reverberated across the pool area, and a huge torrent of water was launched into the room. The wave blasted Christina all over the front of her body like a water hose set to full power, sending her staggering backwards and splashing onto the floor behind her all the way to the entry door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torrent stopped as suddenly as it had started and left a dripping wet mess in its wake. Christina shook her head and rubbed her eyes, attempting to recover from the blast of water. Meanwhile, Victoria's sputtering head appeared at the water's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez that stung kinda hard...\", Victoria mumbled to herself, just as Christina came back to her senses. With the entire front side of her body having already been painfully splashed, Christina gingerly made her way over to the little ladder at the side of the pool, uneventfully lowering her incredibly plump frame into the comfortably warm water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I knew you wouldn't be able to match that dive\", Victoria said with a smug smile as her friend's poofy chest and shoulders submerged into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You caused a frickin' <i>tsunami</i>, Vicky. It almost knocked me on my butt over there!\" Christina retorted, taking the chance to splash a little water at her friend's face in return. Victoria raised an arm, but she was too slow, and was left sputtering again as the water struck her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, not my fault - it's called diving, there's gonna be a little splash\", Victoria huffed callously, clearly having failed to notice the massive displacement of water she had just caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that tidal wave wasn't a little splash\", Christina remarked, rolling her eyes at her oblivious friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of adjusting themselves, Christina and Victoria began to tentatively make their way around the pool. Since they were all alone in the room, they could goof off all they liked. They playfully splashed each other with water and chased each other back and forth across the length of the pool, giggling all the while like a pair of kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of their playful approach, swimming around was definitely strenuous enough to wear out the girls, as their lack of visits to the gym had not done any favours to the physique of either of them. Their movement through the water gradually slowed down, but their play defied their aching muscles for a while longer. They breathlessly kept chasing each other back and forth, until one of the girls just couldn't take it any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, my <i>arms</i>...\" Victoria grunted after one too many chases across the pool. \"Ugh, my <i>legs</i>... I'm totally taking a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria pedalled to the edge of the pool, taking her arms out of the water and putting her hands on the solid ground next to her. She proceeded to try to heave her whole body straight out of the water using her arms, a movement that wasn't really possible at her size, especially not considering the weary state of her weak muscles. The best she could do was to half-beach herself onto the edge of the pool, but she couldn't quite pull herself up, and the sharp edge of the pool dug painfully into her plush middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end she was forced to slip back into the water, but rather than giving up, Victoria instead moved on to an even more outlandish attempt at acrobatics. She attempted to heft one of her legs over the edge of the pool, so that she could simply roll out of the water onto the floor. Of course Victoria's legs were heavy, rotund piles of lard, and such a manoeuvre was absolutely not feasible for her. Although she struggled and became increasingly flustered by her failed attempts at throwing her ungainly legs over the edge, she couldn't get anywhere close to climbing out of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally admitting defeat, Victoria took the easier route of clambering over the ladder out of the water. As her body emerged from the pool, little drops of water began dripping from under her copious girth, quickly forming a little pond beneath her as she wearily waddled over to her towel and collapsed with a loud, wet thud onto a nearby bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina followed her friend up the ladder, her own body having become quite sore as well. She felt surprisingly heavy and sluggish out of the water, and she slowly plodded back to where she'd put down her own towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I feel like this was the first time I've swum in years... How did you like it Vicky?\", Christina wheezed between heavy breaths as she wiped the water off of her bulbous curves, one drooping and dripping body part at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, it was fun I guess, but it's way tougher than I remember\", Victoria responded, her slick, shiny limbs still dripping slowly onto the floor next to her feet. \"Although, the best part is getting to put on <i>this</i> for a change\", she chuckled, grabbing both cups of her bikini top and fondling the undersides of her meaty breasts for a moment. Christina let that particular comment pass by without responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the warm room the girls quickly dried out well enough, though large puddles still led like trails from the pool to the benches where they were seated. Curiously, not a single person had made their way to the swimming pool during the time Christina and Victoria had been there, apart from the two of them the room was as empty as they had found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So d'ya wanna get out of here or what?\" Christina asked when her body had dried enough that the heat in the room was starting to feel stifling, rather than pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's just go before the janitor arrives or whatever\", Victoria said, scrambling to haul her weighty frame back on her feet. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll make sure there's plenty of cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the girls were gathered around the conference room table.  The seat at the end was left for Christina.  At every seat, each of the girls' favorite foods were piled high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna addressed the group while they gorged themselves: \"So you see, ladies, our business is expanding, and we need to find the right person to help it grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina had butterflies in her stomach.  Could this be her big chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna winked at Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Christina?\"  Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"  Jenna answered.  \"Christina, are you ready for an opportunity like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try.\"  Christina replied meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Jenna scolded.  \"I need more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"  Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me that you're committed!\"  Jenna barked.  \"Eat this cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna slid a red velvet cake across the table while the others watched in anticipation.  They snacked on their own goodies as though they had popcorn at a movie theater, giant tubs of popcorn drowned in butter and covered in chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was still full from lunch, but she knew that she had to do this.  At first it was going down on pure adrenaline, but then the task in front of her started to unfold.  She made it through the first 3/4 before the taste started to make her sick.  The girls encouraged her on with every bite, and that kept her going until the last piece.  At that point, blind ambition took over.  She was going to make it here, by God!  She was going to do whatever it took, eat all of the cake, be the biggest star in this company!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, it was gone.  The women roared their approval, and knew that they would be seeing big things from little Christina, but none of them could know just how big.</span></div></div>",

From her meticulously groomed hair to her spotless grade point average, she wanted everything in her life to be immaculate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmbition had led her to this job.  She saw how well the company was doing, but once she interviewed, she saw nothing but upward mobility.  This place was being run by a bunch of bovine women who were lazy and slow.  She was certain that her looks and sharp behavior would lead her quickly to the top.  Her first couple of months had confused her.  Status seemed to be directly proportional to weight here.  The lunch and meeting had confirmed this suspicion, and it became clear to her what she needed to do.  Other than Jenna, the boss, these heifers were simply self-indulgent cows without direction.  That their weight translated to position was a concept that was lost on them - getting fat was just something that was happening to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she knew now, and she had two choices: stay lean and look for another job, or use all of her discipline and ambition to rapidly rise to the top here.  No other company would have such a simple promotion process, but was it worth being so fat that getting out of a chair would become exercise?  She ultimately knew that she could be a millionaire by age 30 in this company if she applied herself properly.  She could hire people to carry her around when she became the boss.  This hunger for control was too much to overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina studied and laid out a plan.  She'd have to start slowly, get her body used to things.  It would only take another 500 calories per day to add a pound per week.  These women dropped 500 calories worth of crumbs each day.  That would be a good goal to start, she thought, but if she chose her foods wisely, she felt certain that she could accelerate the process and gain 3 pounds per week.  Once her body was used to the extra food, she'd ramp it up.  As she planned, she dreamt of herself getting bigger and bigger.  How would she carry it, she wondered.  She'd never possessed any extra weight.  Would it go to her boobs, her belly, her butt?  Eventually, she thought, she'd be so gigantic that it wouldn't matter.</span></div></div>",

Three milkshakes per day with Bulk-eeze would give her 3,000 calories if she ate nothing else.  Nutritional facts were committed to memory: cake donuts had more calories than glazed, cinnamon buns have more calories than donuts, a fried chicken sandwich has more calories than a hamburger if you add cheese and mayonnaise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed with knowledge and her powder, she faced the next day with enthusiasm.  She carefully selected her meals and filled in the gaps with milkshakes.  This did not go unnoticed by her coworkers, who universally encouraged her when they saw her drinking milkshakes at her desk.  By the end of the day, she had consumed 5,000 calories, and she was uncomfortable.  She felt bloated and as she lay in bed, she was hot and sweating as her body's rapid metabolism attempted to eliminate the extra calories.  By the end of a week, she had added 3 pounds.  By the end of two weeks, it was 5, but she was starting to be more comfortable with the volume, so she cut herself some slack for missing her goal weight by a pound.  At a month, she had added 11 pounds and she was no longer sweating through her nights.  She was a little behind schedule at this point, but she knew things were getting easier, so she showed patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rewarded over the next month, as she was able to begin to add extra snacks with the girls in the morning and afternoon.  She couldn't come close to matching Alice or Courtney's gluttonous behavior, but she knew that she was adding another 1,000 calories per day to her diet, and what's more, she was enjoying it.  The food was incredibly good, and she was finding it easier and easier to take just one more donut at Jenna's behest, or share another brownie with Victoria.  Like them, she was preoccupied with food now, but she maintained a focus that they lacked - this was a means to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her metabolism effectively waylaid, the second month saw bigger gains.  4 pounds in the first week, 5 in the second, and 6 in each of the last 2.  32 pounds in 2 months, bringing her to around 150.  She was still the skinniest girl in the office by far, but she noticed the changes.  It turned out that she accumulated most of her weight in her belly and boobs, with a little extra making it's way to the area below the waist.  Her coworkers hardly noticed, but she had started to receive compliments on her healthy appearance.  She had enjoyed the added inches on her bust and had begun to dress in a way that accentuated her bigger breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonth 3 brought 25 more pounds, and an increasing appetite.  She was starting to count her coworkers' calories, and it became a game for her to eat a little bit more than Melissa or try to match Courtney.  By month 4, she was eating nearly 8,000 calories per day.  Jenna increasingly commented on the high quality of her work as she approached and blew past 200 pounds in the 3rd week of the month.  She was now getting big enough to catch her coworkers attention as her boobs had ballooned to DDs and her once flat stomach became rounder and rounder.</span></div></div>",

She commended the others for bringing food to Christina throughout the day after their own breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with this additional assistance, Christina was eating almost nonstop from the time she woke up in the morning until she rolled her bloated belly on its side in bed at night.  Her breasts were inflating like a pair of airships, and she seemed to be adding a cup size a week as she proudly strained her tops to their limits.  To say that the weight was just there wouldn't be accurate though, as those same tops were beginning to ride up on her growing gut.  Her entire body was adding a thick layer of fat from her chubby cheeks to her thunder thighs.  She wore it well, remaining as well-dressed and groomed as she could for someone getting so fat so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several weeks of help from the team, Christina had shown dramatic effects, rising to nearly 300 pounds.  She had passed Victoria in weight and was closing in on the others.  Her boobs were like a pair of ripe watermelons, perched on top of her medicine ball belly.  Each of her thighs was as big around as she had been just a few months earlier.  She was now hardly getting up during the day, as others made sure that she had piles of food in front of her while she carried out her tasks.  Each day, they brought more, awed by her transformation, waiting to see if and when she would stop her rapid expansion and remarkable productivity.</span></div></div>",

Her transformation had been astonishing.  Christina weighed about 500 pounds, and Jenna was glad that she had invested in new oversized office furniture as she heard the chair creak under Christina's girth.  As she sat, she had to lean back to create room for all of her fat.  Her thighs were spread apart but still touched, her bean-bag chair belly was pushed up by those thighs, which forced her equally bean-bag chair sized boobs upward into what remained of her chin.  She looked over the domes of her breasts and breathed heavily as she reached her fat hand to the side to grab a cookie, even as she finished chewing her cinnamon roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, I'll get right to the point.\"  Jenna said.  \"You are doing a phenomenal job, and I've let corporate know that I think you're special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph...\"  She answered with a mouth full of cookie.  \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Effective immediately, I'm making you my assistant manager.\"  Jenna said.  \"You're going to get a raise, a new office, and your own personal assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina had already loaded up another cookie.  \"Mmmphwow, really!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna smiled.  \"Yes, really.

But as business seemed to pick up, and the company made more money, there wasn\u2019t much need to look backwards\u2014no need to correct those little feelings of entitlement without proper performance.

They had the break room.  The entirety of it. The fridges, the smoothie makers, the blenders and the snack machines, just about anything that Jenna could cram into that rapidly cramping section of the building was fuel to the fire for those two. Not to mention the minifridges underneath their desks, the complimentary donuts every morning, and their own lack of booming social lives; suffice it to say that Gordge\u2019s philanthropy was beginning to take a toll on both of the already overfed office drones\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dAlright guys, let\u2019s get everybody in a good mood for lunch with today\u2019s Foodie Friday\u2014easily <u>my</u> favorite part of the week.\u201d</i> a deep, though distinctively feminine voice flooded the breakroom through the PA system, <i>\u201dThis one comes from favorite foodie Alice Gellar\u2014love all those submissions, girl!\u2014who suggested that I try the vanilla sheet cake from Quaker Bakers. Let\u2019s see if she hits the mark again, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYou know Cass\u2026 I don\u2019t think most people consider a sheet cake\u2014a <u>whole</u> sheet cake\u2014to be lunch material.\u201d</i> another, decidedly lighter pitched voice spoke, \u201cI\u2019m starting to think that this whole Foodie Friday thing is just an excuse for you to get to pig out.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dOh what do you know, Marni.\u201d</i> Cass said through a mouthful of (what was presumably) cake, <i>\u201dYa party pooper.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the breakroom, two humongous hills of women sat plopped onto the reinforced seats that surrounded the circular tables. On one side, an overly bloated brunette easily big enough to be two or three women sat with her nose deep into an already almost empty box of pizza. On the other, a blimpy blonde as wide as most women were tall choked down cruller after cruller from the sole survivor of the earlier onslaught that had been breakfast at Gordge industries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir meals were mostly silent, given the intense amount of concentration that each one had to dedicate to their meals in order to feel mostly satisfied with the enormous amounts of food that they shoveled down into their stomachs, but there was still a feeling of great camaraderie between them. Despite the fact that neither of them could so much as wrap their arms around themselves anymore, much less each other, the two of them had never felt closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did <i>Marni</i> become such a pill?\u201d Melissa puffed briefly as she glanced up from her meal, her breathing heavy from exertion, \u201cI thought she was\u2026 <i>rrrrrrp</i>\u2026 the fun one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had grown into a true hog over the many months since Jenna\u2019s initial aspirations of revamping the office had taken place. Due to the enormously enabling systems set in place, she and her friends were allowed to stuff themselves to their hearts content without much payment or second thought. Her willpower already weak, Melissa had done a wonderful job of ballooning herself into the outer regions of mobility. She was spectacularly belly-heavy, with a great swollen sack of a stomach that hung heavily in front of her whenever she walked. It spread her knees and legs apart even now, as she sat on the padded bench of the break room. She had put on a decent amount of weight in her already ample rear\u2014enough to keep her well-padded wherever she chose to sit\u2014but her breasts were rather small for a woman of her epic proportions. She had squeezed herself into the biggest blouse she owned, and her tailor-made khakis were beginning to cut into the equator of her gut once more. A few more lunches, just a few, and she would need to go see him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight?\u201d Alice burbled through a mouthful of cr\u00e8me and sugar, \u201cRemember when we used to hate <i>Cass</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had grown similarly to her friend\u2014though she was much more top heavy comparatively. Her great chest rose and fell like a fleshy empire, heaving up and down with every belabored breath the overweight worker could manage. Her face had widened and softened supremely, as had her now pillow-like arms, to the point where even her wrist had been absorbed by a stray roll of encompassing fat. She could barely reach beyond her chest at this point, given its superiority and the severe curve of her belly. Crossing her arms was, at this point, completely out of the question. Alice was far too fat to do much of anything, including see in front of herself. She usually fell behind one of her friends so that they could guide her, in addition to the fact that she was just not nearly as swift as she used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent much of their days in the break room, binging and dishing about various things between bites or bouts of fullness, and get very little accomplished before heading home\u2014usually with dinner as a segway between the two destinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know, I used to <i>hate</i> her so much.\u201d Melissa said cattily, her chins wobbling with every word, \u201cBut now Marni\u2026 you know, with how much she bitches at Cass lately, is starting to get on my shit list.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I know.\u201d Alice agreed readily with a chuckle, sending a ripple into her vast chest, \u201cI mean, Fitness Friday was kinda cool way back when, but Foodie Friday is <i>so</i> much more fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate, filling the breakroom with the symphony that was their chewing munching and swallowing, the PA system followed in kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI\u2019m just saying Cass, it\u2019s been an <u>awful</u> long time since you\u2019ve seen your feet.\u201d</i> Marni teased over the intercom, <i>\u201dMaybe just limit your lunches to a pound cake for a while, huh?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dMarni, the whole point of Foodie Friday is for a <u>judgement free</u> lunch experience.\u201d</i> Cass said with playful defensiveness through a mouthful of cake, <i>\u201dFeelin\u2019 pretty judged right now.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Melissa stuffed themselves eagerly, the effects of their spectacular meals barely holding any weight against the potential stretchy capacity of their own overfed stomachs. Melissa in particular, without Alice\u2019s penchant for things like \u201cguilt\u201d and \u201cmaybe I shouldn\u2019t\u201d and \u201cmy sister\u2019s coming to visit\u201d had blossomed into a truly great beast of a gut. She was an impressive specimen, completely unrepentant in filling the vast void of her belly with anything and everything she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, watch it!\u201d Alice spat as she slapped the back of her friend\u2019s hand, forcing her to drop a pilfered pastry, \u201cThose are mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Melissa said weakly, her eyes still locked on the treat, \u201cYou know how I get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, <i>hungry.</i>\u201d Alice plucked up her cruller, \u201cHonestly, you\u2019re such a piggy sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, Alice had gone the other route with her rampant obesity. While she was mostly content in her lifestyle of eating and growing, she had plenty of times where she realized the end result of her new hobby. She wasn\u2019t able to dissuade herself from eating any more, of course\u2014in fact, all the extra stress caused her to eat more if anything\u2014but she was the more remorseful between the two of them. It had always been that way, so it shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise that a few extra hundred pounds or so had done little to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dSeriously Cass? You\u2019re not even gonna save any for me?\u201d</i> Marni whined, <i>\u201dI didn\u2019t get anything <u>last</u> Foodie Friday either. Or the Friday before <u>that</u>! Throw me a bone, girl!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dHey, this is Foodie Friday with <u>Cass</u>.\u201d</i> Cass barked declaratively, <i>\u201dYou have Marni on the Street Mondays, I have Foodie Fridays.

Quiznos?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026 I could actually go for a pound cake right about now\u2026\u201d Alice licked her lips greedily, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll phone up Quaker Bakers\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alice and Melissa let out two matching moans as both colossal women struggled to come to terms with the fact that they would have to wait another three hours before either of them could adequately recharge. Setting aside their disappointment, the two women turned their energies to rising under their own power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming a monumental effort, considering their ever climbing weights. Both Melissa and Alice had become so completely consumed with stuffing themselves that they had hardly worked in an adequate upper body strength regimen. Both women were totally ill-fit to lift their flabby bodies under their own power without expending herculean amounts of effort on their parts\u2014something that was becoming harder and harder to do with almost every passing day. Melissa\u2019s mighty meaty arms quivered as she struggled to push herself up from the table, while Alice rocked on her bloated cheeks in an attempt to gain enough momentum to launch herself upwards. The break room was a duet of husky grunts and labored puffs as both super-sized sows clamored to their feet and left the break room in a single-file line of two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir expansion around the office was nothing short of noticeable. In an office environment where almost everyone was putting on weight, it seemed that Alice and Melissa had perfected the art form. Many considered them to be the biggest women in the office\u2014and they weren\u2019t that far off from the truth. The cubicle aisles shook as both women trotted down at an awkward and uneasy pace, rattling knickknacks and personal decorations on everyone within range\u2019s desks, their pathetic gasps for air filling the floor as they struggled to get themselves back to their desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa led the way, her big belly bobbing in front of her by a considerable amount. She had grown so belly-heavy that she was forced to lean back whenever she walked, lending her a very pregnant appearance. She swung her arms blindly as she shuffled her fat feet across the floor, hoping to keep the momentum going so that she might make it back to her tiny little cubicle and to the mini-fridge inside. Meanwhile, behind her, Alice fought against the belligerent bouncing of her bazongas as they danced in timing with the gait of her gut. Both elephantine women had their own issues to face, but it certainly didn\u2019t help that most of the women on the floor were actively ignoring them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be mean, of course. It was just\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Alice and Melissa had let themselves go. To the point where almost everything they did revolved around eating. Anyone kind or na\u00efve enough to agree to a lunch date with the two of them would surly live to regret their decision when they left feeling three times as full as they ought to have been. Those two just\u2026 <i>ate</i>. And ate and <i>ate</i>! And they made so many runs to the snack machines and they always brought someone something back\u2026 it wasn\u2019t like they were doing it to be mean\u2014but it was so hard to stay trim around such enormous women!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys!\u201d a voice called out from them deep in the neighborhood of cubicles, \u201cOver here! I wanted to talk to you about where we should all go for second lunch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the familiar tone struck a chord with both women, their heads perking up and their pitiful pace beginning to pick up slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been the voice of their third of the groups, the only woman in the office who was willing to hang out with such toxic influences anymore. It was the voice of\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally at about 12 30 they all came back to Alice\u2019s place to crash for the night, since they were all way too drunk to drive home. The trio stumbled there way into her apartment Melissa and Courtney sat down while Alice got food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 How funny was it when Alice ripped her\u2026. Her jeans.\u201d Melissa said, laughing like a true drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeaaaah. Oh my god you could hear it from across the room.\u201d Courtney chuckled. What was about to take place was a rare conversation. It would certainly never take place if it weren\u2019t for the power of alcohol. Anyway, Alice came back into the room with snack food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got snaaaaaaaacks\u2026 Whats so funny?\u201d Alice said as she plopped down into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere talking about you bursting\u2026 your pants.\u201d Melissa said. All three gigantic women were laughing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t laugh\u2026 *chuckle* at my fat.\u201d Alice giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFat! You\u2019re not fat!

But I think we\u2019re all *burp* I think we\u2019re all fat.\u201d Melissa said, still uncontrollably laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I think your right, we\u2019re all fatties.\u201d Courtney said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourtney I think you may be the biggest one here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I\u2019m so fat guys.\u201d She said grabbing her big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*snort* How\u2019d we *cackle* How\u2019d we get so fat?\u201d Alice joked. The laughter died out. There was a long moment of silence. The three large women each reflecting on what was just a rhetorical question. Having a moment of thought that drunkenness tends to cause. How did they get so fat? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is kind of personal, but how much\u2026 how much do you guys weigh?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least 400\u2026 I\u2019m not even sure I can see the numbers on the scale.\u201d Courtney said. There was a quiet laughter that quickly died out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m probably getting close to 390, at this point.\u201d Melissa said. Alice was a little surprised by how big her friends were. She wondered if she\u2019d <br>\r\nend up like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m only like 330 right now.\u201d Alice said. \u201cI wonder if I\u2019ll ever be as big as you guys. I still have moments where I try to stop eating as much. That\u2019s why I never gained as fast as you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike who cares if you get as big as us. 300, 400, what the difference.\u201d Melissa said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019re just delaying the inevitable. Why restrict yourself. Just enjoy it.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are making way to much sense.\u201d Alice chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, A join us. You know your belly wants to.\u201d Melissa said. The laughter finally returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Join us. Join us. Joins us.\u201d Courtney and Melissa chanted.

Alice had yet to feel these effects herself, though Melissa and everyone else didn't seem to notice either....at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Alice was at her desk, filing away some old documents and assignments while she took a few calls. she leaned back in her chair, one hand resting on her belly as the other fed her doughnuts. Today seemed like a rather slow day, as she didn't have many clients, so she made her way back into the breakroom where she found Melissa and Courtney, leaning against the counters and snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls\" Alice said, bending over and raiding the fridge, her large, wide rear sticking up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Al, it's a really slow day, huh?\" Melissa greeted, sipping a can of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh isn't it though? It feels like we should be really laid back though.\" Courtney chimed in, scarfing down a twinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice heaved herself upright, a large amount of snack cakes in one arm, and a soda in the other. She sat down in one of the chair across from the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's a laid back day, but it's just so <i> boring!</i>\" Melissa said, punctuating her sentence with a light burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is\" Courtney said with a yawn, leaning more heavily on the counter, her belly jutting even further outwards, her shirt ridding up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was busy listening while she snacked on numerous candy and chips. She took a quick swig of her soda. \"mmm, you know, it may be a slow day, but at least we can have a bit of a break from our usual work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa finished off her soda \"I suppose you're *uuurrrp* right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo things continued like this, very lazily as the day went forward. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She used to work late almost every other day. With the large decrease in work Alice\u2019s workday changed a lot. She had a lot of time to goof off at her desk. She started to hang out a lot more after work now that she wasn\u2019t working late. All of this culminated to an increase in Alice\u2019s consumption. She started eating all the time. She adopted the same habits as Melissa and Courtney. She was starting to become lazier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey girlsh, I\u2019m shtarting tah *burp* like not having sho mush work.\u201d Alice said with a mouthful of snacks. She had been snacking all day. It was really showing. As she sat in the break room with Melissa and Courtney she continued to stuff herself. Her gut was barely contained by her shirt. There were large gaps between her shirt buttons. She clearly looked larger than ever before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can relaxsh mush more.\u201d Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Al.

She reached down to unbutton her bottom shirt button. It was tough due to the pressure of her engorged middle. She finally let the button lose. Alice felt a brief moment relief until she heard POP POP POP! The other three bottom buttons flew off as her big belly surged outward. Her whole body jiggled as the buttons flew across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBet you feel a lot more comfortable now A.\u201d Melissa chuckled looking at the true size of her friends stuffed body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While after-work outings and some barhopping on the weekends with Courtney and Melissa were normally common occurrences in Alice\u2019s cute little datebook, mustering up anything more laborious than a text message was slowly becoming an incredible feat for their absentee coworker. It seemed as though that the fewer days left remaining in her impromptu vacation, the more Alice worked at not working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the night had come\u2014Alice\u2019s month of absolute abdication and lethargy had ticked down \u2018til only twelve measly hours remained until she was expected to clock back in at eight \u2018o\u2019 clock in the morning. Despite the haste with which she gleefully forgot her responsibilities, Alice had managed to send a few text messages to Melissa over the course of her day (which began promptly at eleven forty-one in the morning, thank you!) inviting both her and Courtney over for dinner and a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of her big buddies arrived promptly at eight, give or take the few minutes it took for either of them to haul their overfed keisters from their respective vehicles. Courtney was still dressed from the work-day, a long flowing tent of a dress with an unflattering though festive floral design that made her look like a big Vera Bradley themed blimp and a half-jacket that compressed around her hammish upper-arms. Melissa had dressed down for the occasion, never the one to waste a moment in getting comfortable, and had managed to find her stretchiest sweats and a t-shirt that almost kind\u2019ve fit properly. Her big belly hung further down than Courtney\u2019s, her shorter stature making her look proportionately bulkier, and despite her lighter size Melissa\u2019s waddle was far more pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were accosted by a young thing in a Pizza Hut uniform, a balancing a teetering stack of matching boxes awkwardly on Alice\u2019s doorstep. Apparently she\u2019d already paid, but the young woman was having some trouble with the door\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh <i>we\u2019ll</i> be taking those!\u201d Melissa said wolfishly as she snatched the top half of the pile from the delivery girl, \u201cWe\u2019re headed inside anyway\u2026 mm, is that Mushroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a good night, sweetie!\u201d Courtney was equally as incorrigible, her own hungry grin matched dimple for dimple with Melissa\u2019s as she removed the remaining boxes, \u201cI sure hope Alice tipped you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney lumbered over to the door while Melissa popped open the topmost of her boxes, the bigger of the two women knocking daintily while the shorter eagerly lowered a thick slice of cheese sauce and mushroom into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>said</i> it\u2019s open!\u201d came an irritated expectant tone from inside Alice\u2019s house, \u201cYou can come in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney raised a chubby finger to her full pink lips as she shushed Melissa, signaling that they were going to go in and surprise her. Melissa giggled thickly, still chewing on her first slice while steam rose from the top of the box. Courtney twisted the handle to Alice\u2019s front door and wriggled her way inside. Courtney\u2019s impressive immensity meant she and doorways weren\u2019t exactly on the same side. Her flaring thighs and mountainous lovehandles scraped the sides of Alice\u2019s doorway, Melissa faring no better. At this rate, Courtney thought idly, she would soon have to turn sideways like she did at the bar. Twin tremors of heavy footsteps shook the room as the two hoggish hotties clogged the hallway, slowly making their way towards Alice\u2019s living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you can just leave them there on that little table\u2026urRRUp\u2026 I\u2019ll get \u2018em.\u201d Courtney recognized Alice\u2019s voice from the hallway, \u201cThanks a ton.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa kept giggling, so Courtney had to shush her again. Courtney\u2019s padded elbow meeting Melissa\u2019s airbag of a belly didn\u2019t seem to slow her pizza intake, the big-bellied brunette was already on her second slice after only a few steps into Alice\u2019s house. It wasn\u2019t like they really had to try and hide their heavy footsteps; Alice had the TV up really loud. Even still, Courtney and Melissa attempted to keep up the illusion. The two overfed employees slowly descended into the den of their truant third party, and were mildly surprised by what they saw\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of her month away from work, Alice had apparently been hard at work enjoying herself. She looked as well-rested as she was fed; Alice had easily put on another thirty pounds in her time off. Alice had never looked so content with herself, lounging around in her pajamas while simultaneously pouring out of them. The creamy ocean of her stomach swelled over and onto her lap despite the width with which she kept her legs apart, the smile of pale flesh that rode up against the lower-most of her stomach folds only served to make her look larger. Her pajama bottoms squeezed the life out of her flabby legs, which eclipsed the seat of her well-worn armchair in an inky-black thickness. Her chubby feet were kicked up on the footrest, unable to cross over the other due to their swollen size, with one chubby elbow resting on the arm with a big can of Coors between her fingers. In the other, the remote. And on her belly, a plate of cookies\u2014the crumbs dotting the great white surface of her marshmallowy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww! You had <i>cookies</i>?!\u201d Melissa whined childishly, \u201cNo fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s big blue eyes widened at the sound of her friend\u2019s voice, and her big body went immediately into a quiver as she jiggled in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys!\u201d Alice\u2019s voice had grown somewhat huskier in her time of abdication but that did little to dull her genuine excitement, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I thought you were the Pizza girl\u2026 Melissa! You couldn\u2019t even wait \u2018til you got in the door?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhu?!\u201d Melissa barked back, the cheesey mush in her mouth restored as she took yet another bite, \u201cYo doh ish my fuvrit\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, c\u2019mere!\u201d Alice beckoned with a wave of her chubby hand, \u201cGimme a hug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney and Melissa exchanged hugs with the bigger Alice, the difficulty with which the three of them found in wrapping their girths around the other was only increased by Alice\u2019s stalwart refusal to rise under her own power. The boxes of pizza were divvied up as each girl took their seat in Alice\u2019s living room\u2014Courtney taking one half of the couch while Melissa took the other in an ill-advised attempt at seating all three girls. The correct idea would have been to have the lighter of the two sit on the couch while Courtney took the chair, but Alice didn\u2019t exactly look too keen on giving up her spot\u2014especially not now that there were pizza boxes warming the crest of her impressive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Alice purred thickly as she wiggled her chubby fingers, licking her lips at the sight of a whole pizza pie just for her, \u201cOh\u2026mm\u2026 lemme just\u2026\u201d the big couch potato blonde downed the rest of her beer and grabbed at the unopened can on the table by her chair\u2014what remained of a twelve pack of 18oz Coors Light sat as a mostly empty cardboard box chairside. Alice cracked it open with a husky Melissa-esque chuckle before taking a big greedy gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrrRRUP!\u201d Alice let out another big burp before giving a half-hearted little tug on her too-small tee, \u201cAhhh\u2026 s\u2019the stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice!\u201d Courtney\u2019s mouth hung agape with amusement and confusion at her friend, \u201cI thought you <i>hated</i> beer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did!\u201d the vacationing vegetable said with a hearty appreciation for her pizza, \u201cBut it\u2019s an acquired taste\u2014plus it goes <i>super</i> great with pizza!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been saying that for <i>years</i>\u201d Melissa agreed heartily as she got tossed a can by Alice, \u201cBeen needing that since 5 \u2018o\u2019 clock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney watched as Alice intensely devoured the pizza before her, the close proximity from her belly-tray to her mouth meant that not so much as a drop of cheese was wasted. She would lower it decadently into her mouth with her otherwise useless arms, causing her shirt to ride up again, and chew with loud appreciation for tasty it was. She would take a large slurp of Coors between every other bite or so, a girl of her size with a stomach as full as hers was could easily handle another beer. Apparently she\u2019d spent the last month building up her tolerance. Alice had finished a pizza <i>and</i> a beer before Melissa could finish either of hers. Courtney watched warily as her friend quickly dispatched another box of pizza, an eager glint in her greedy eye<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, aren\u2019t you glad I talked you into using those vacation days?\u201d Melissa inquired as she ignored the movie and focused solely on the food in front of her, \u201cI wish <i>I</i> could lay around all day and get paid for it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know s\u2019been <i>great</i>.\u201d Alice said thickly before stuffing another slice into her mouth, \u201cIt just <i>sucks</i> that I have to go back to work tomorrow. I need a vacation from my vacation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, it must be <i>terrible</i> getting to lay around all day Al.\u201d Courtney half-teased, \u201cMaybe getting back to the office will do you some good, Al. We\u2019ve all missed you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been enjoying myself so much I kinda forgot all about you guys.\u201d Alice joked with a hearty laugh, clearly just a bit tipsy, \u201cStill, y\u2019think Jenna might be mad if I called in sick?\u201d Alice dove back into her pizza, her head lowered into the box as she resumed stuffing her face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuugh\u2026 work suuucks\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was a large round thing not unlike the women who most frequently occupied it, and it could be shared between three women of their overall size rather snugly. Once they had convinced Alice to take advantage of her vacation time, the two sizeable sweeties noticed an immediate abundance of elbow room in the latter corner of their little table in the breakroom. Over time this extra room came to mean slightly larger portions between them, leading to some slightly extra amounts of Melissa and Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Alice had returned however, noticeably larger than when she\u2019d left, the two chair-squashing sows were beginning to feel comparatively cramped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone, Alice\u2019s extravagant meal took up plenty of room on their table. It wrapped around the oozing inlet of her belly, forming a semicircular pattern based around what was within her reach. The main issue being that Courtney and Melissa\u2019s meals were laid out in a similar fashion; Alice\u2019s entrees and sides encroached very noticeably within her friends\u2019, where it did not outright overtake them. In all the confusion of everyone laying out their meals for the day, combined with a haphazard layout and a sizeable appetite clouding her better judgement and memory, Alice may or may not have outright taken a few dishes from her friends. All in all Alice\u2019s lunch was a spectacular smorgasbord of takeout meals, a veritable Borg of logos and wrappers, one that rivaled and outclassed Melissa and Courtney\u2019s meals respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, Al.\u201d Courtney snorted as she watched her returned friend snack heartily into some delivered pasta, having given up trying to find her tiny dish of macaroni, \u201cThink you got enough food? You know Jenna gives us two hours for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Alice asked defensively, referring to her massive spread, \u201cI only got the pasta because it came with the pizza and the breadsticks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did you get two?\u201d Courtney pointed to the pepperoni pizzas, baker\u2019s dozen of breadsticks, and the fettucinni alfredo to go with her current course of the chicken<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a light breakfast.\u201d Alice concluded definitively with a bite onto her fork<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s breakfast had <i>not</i> been light, even by the Gordge standard of measurement. Melissa had been there first hand to witness it\u2014the battle of the bakery, as Alice stuffed herself with what probably amounted to about two boxes of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and a decent sized pot of coffee. While that wasn\u2019t exactly unusual for someone who worked at Gordge, Alice probably shouldn\u2019t have been as eager as she was to scarf down those whole pizzas. And all that pasta. Or those breadsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh lighten up, will ya Courtney?\u201d Melissa pat her friend on the back while she stuck her slender pink tongue out at her HR rep, \u201cAlice is just takin\u2019 our advice and living a little\u2014isn\u2019t that right, Al?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Alice said with a smile, skewering herself some pasta, \u201c<i>You</i> said it yourself Courtney.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d She rolled her eyes and let out a puff of disgruntled air, \u201cI did say that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s been the <i>best</i> advice I\u2019ve ever gotten.\u201d Alice said giddily as she loomed over her mid-day feast, \u201cJust let go.

Christina watched as her coworkers slowly waddle their way out of the office reminding her of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade. After exiting the office they entered the elevator 2 at a time. This was because A: they didn't want to exceed the elevators weight limit, and B: there wasn't enough room for three women of so much thick rolling fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the lobby Jenna lend the parade of flesh (and Christina) out of the lobby of the building, her massive gut swaying as she went...until she felt her massive gut run into the handicap security gate that usually opens when she leaves the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was stood stunned as Jenna waddle backwards and tried to waddle forward to make the gate open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the second attempt, Jenna, yelled to get the security guard that seems under qualified \u201cHow can I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This gate will not open!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, mam but it is broke.\" The guard said in a sigh. \"The repairman should be here this afternoon.

Jenna was visibly angry and he didn\u2019t want to deal with her attitude. The door that he was referring to was smaller than the double door main entrance (that was broken), but it was still a completely suitably sized doorway. He had a hard time believing anyone couldn\u2019t fit through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have a problem? Well fine I\u2019ll just try to use the other gate, then it\u2019ll be you who has a problem!\u201d Jenna said. She wasn't yelling at him but she made it clear she was angry. Her employees begged for her to just use the entrance on the other side of the building. \u201cNope, this guy says I won\u2019t have a problem!\u201d She waddled over to the smaller exit. She turned sideways and shuffled through the door. Pushing the door open with her blubbery hip. Soon her belly made contact with one side of the doorway while her fat butt brushed against the other side. Her massive fat rolls started to smother the doorframe. Her pace slowed until she could no longer push through the exit. Her wide 500 pound body stuck a couple feet outside of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI err\u2026 Think there\u2019s *gasp* a problem.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god she\u2019s stuck,\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease help her!\u201d Alice said to the security guard.

She was once just a young chubby young office rookie, now she was a corporate blimp. The man first daintily pressed against her blubbery side, but realized it would take a lot more than that to move this wedged whale. He leaned into Jen\u2019s wall of flab. He sunk into the deep layers of bulging flesh. She had more padding than a mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo progress was made until finally a janitor walked by. The other girls recruited him to help out their friend. Jenna was definitely large enough for both men to lean against. Slowly Jenna\u2019s immense body oozed through the doorway. After many grunts and groans Jenna was finally squeezed through the door. The sweaty butterball stumbled as she was released from the clutches of the frame. An audience had built up inside as people waiting to exit the building witnessed the ridiculous sight. The small crowd applauded as the big blob of blubber made it outside of the building.</span></div></div>",

Jenna had always been a bit chubby, but since coming to the office, her waistline had exploded with fat. The sedentary lifestyle and cushy salary had certainly allowed Jenna to expand her portions, wardrobe, and body without so much as noticing. And as she rose in the corporate ladder and her income increased, Jenna was able to stuff herself fuller and fuller with rich foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Jenna's body was not the only thing that had changed as she ascended in ranking. Jenna had grown lazy and spoiled, accustomed to a certain standard of treatment which many in the office would have never conceived of. Despite taking nearly all credit for office tasks, Jenna increasingly delegated even the simplest of labors to her employees, mostly taking on tasks that entailed travel, eating (and lots of it), or at least sitting on her dumpy ass. She became more and more bossy with her employees and especially lower-status workers at the building. Last year, an intern had spent their entire summer busing food from restaurants to Jenna's desk, feeding the sow and pandering to her increasingly gluttonous demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmffff, I'll see to it that those guards are replaced! They'll regret making my day difficult!\" growled Jenna to herself as she left the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled loudly, no doubt upset by its recent compression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first, lunch.\" Jenna remembered the various venues near the office and thought about where she might like to go.

Billy's was not exactly known as a fine dining establishment, but it had all manner of starchy, fried, and greasy American fare at a mere $8 per person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the buffet, Jenna skipped the mediocre vegetable section and immediately loaded a plate with brisket, mashed potatoes, and sliders. She got a large glass of coke without ice (why water down the sweet drink) and sat down at her usual spot, a booth with a lot of \"leg room\" (for Jenna, stomach room) that was probably intended for handicapped people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit into her beefy course and rejoiced as the fatty juices rolled onto her tongue. She knew this lunch would be a long one and she dug right in. Yet the first plate did not fill Jenna's cavernous stomach -- on the contrary, it made her more hungry for the heavy comfort foods at the buffet. She rocked herself up and waddled back to the buffet line for more. She didn't notice a dribble of beef juice that left a mark on her blouse. After another plate, she was out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibs, fried chicken, meatloaf and fries slid down Jenna's gullet as condiments splattered her shirt and skirt. Jenna entered a haze as she shovelled three, four, five plates into her mouth while only getting up for additional portions. Her heavy, apron-like stomach filled with food and gas as she slammed back coca-cola. The syrupy drink poured down her jowls and double chin, avoiding her dark hair which was tied into a ponytail. Jenna grunted and wheezed as she glutted herself. She lost herself in the sheer <i>quantity</i> of what she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiters and patrons of the establishment stared at the obese businesswoman making a pig of herself in the booth. To be sure, the wait staff had seen Jenna several times now, but was never quite prepared for her indulgent visitations. They stared as her stomach inflated, pushing the limits of her blouse and already-unbuttoned jacket. In their mind's eyes they could see her . Jenna didn't notice, or if she did, she revelled all the more in the attention the wait staff and patrons were giving her. They could see all of her -- her power, her wealth, her sheer size -- on display. They could recognize that Jenna was a woman who was in control -- not only at work, but of the wait staff here and indeed the entire establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna finished her eight plate -- consisting entirely of fried chicken wings -- and swung back her seventh glass of coke. With a loud belch she realized she was finally full. Surveying the damage, Jenna slapped her stuffed stomach (seemingly not noticing the grease and syrup on her shirt) and rubbed it, letting out another burp or two. Realizing she had to get back to work, Jenna rocked her body to build momentum and checked her watch...</span></div></div>",

The event was still fresh in everyone\u2019s mind though and it had caused a bit of a stir around the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, how much could she possibly weigh?\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is soooo big. She\u2019s got to be like 400 pounds right?\u201d Victoria said.

At 140 pounds, 500 was a weight that she couldn\u2019t comprehend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably.\u201d Alice said. There was a long pause as the girls soaked in the realization. \u201cYou know there was a woman that was here a while ago that apparently got to 600.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean Jessica? Yeah she\u2019s Jenna\u2019s boss now, I think.\u201d Courtney said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did she get so fat? I mean 500 pounds\u2026 That\u2019s like\u2026 crazy.\u201d Victoria said a little dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell apparently she was just a chubby young thing out of college when she started working here.\u201d Courtney said. Everyone was gathered around Courtney desperate to hear the story of Jen\u2019s immense weight gain. \u201cShe was as big as you are Vicky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No way.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay. You\u2019ve all seen her eat. After ten years her appetite took a toll on her.\u201d Courtney said. Victoria was a little spooked that Jen used to look like her. They might not have known it but all of the girls at the office were destined to reach at least 500 pounds. Jenna was a sign of their future at the office. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad sign either. Jenna loved working at the office. She was happier than ever. And so was Courtney. Courtney was probably the only one who knew Jenna\u2019s current state was foreshadowing of what was to come. She had been at the office for the longest besides Jenna. She had seen many coworkers come into the office. Some skinny, some thick, and fat, but after a while they all became blimps. Courtney accepted her fat fate. As long as she kept living the office lifestyle she was fine with being fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing she didn\u2019t like about the office lifestyle was going to and from the office. Courtney was not a morning person, nor was she a moving person, so mornings were tough for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney woke up and made herself some coffee. She picked out a shirt and pants to wear to work. The shirt sleeves went on easily. Courtney went to button her shirt but realized that her enormous swollen breasts blocked her vision. She went over to the mirror. Courtney looked at her big bloated belly hanging over her panties and crotch. She buttoned her shirt together as she looked in the mirror. Her shirt stretched around the large circumference of her belly rolls. She struggled to pull her pants up. As she tried to grab her pants from the ground her stacks of belly fat blocked her from bending down. She barely managed to snag her pants and pull them up. The further she pulled her pants up the harder it got. Courtney\u2019s thick blubbery thighs had swollen to fill out her pants. As the pants slid over her thighs they struggled to reach past her flabby butt. After a long battle she finally got her pants on. She got her things for work and waddled outside. She dropped her obese body into the front seat. On her drive to work she stopped to get breakfast at McDonalds. She went through the drive through. Courtney rattled off a massive breakfast order. She placed the large pile of food on the passenger seat. As she sat in traffic she shoveled food in her mouth. She gorged on greasy fast food breakfast. As she drove closer to the office she decided to stop for another breakfast. She drove into the Burger King drive thru and got another huge breakfast. She pulled into the office building parking lot. She ate her second breakfast in her car in the parking lot. Courtney filled herself full of fatty breakfast foods. When she finished her morning feast she loosened her belt buckle and took off her seat belt. The overfed porker struggled to lift herself from her seat. Her fat bloated gut sat heavily on her lap. Slowly she jiggled her blubbery body out of her car and onto her feet. She slowly waddled into the building and into the elevator. She breathed heavily as she heaved her bulging fat. Years of sitting at her desk left her with almost zero strength and endurance. She waddled into the office and towards her desk. As she moved her enormous butt bounced and wobbled and her flabby hips gyrated. Finally Courtney made it to her desk. Her heavy frame crashed into her wide desk chair. She breathed a sigh of relief as she rested her 400 pounds in the overtaxed chair. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenna sat back in her chair, leaning back, resting her hand on her immense, rolling belly. She toyed with a snickers bar she held before her face, and then ripped the black paper from it, devouring it while mimicking Godzilla. \"Raaawr!\" she spoke before she chomped into the long chocolatey bar, getting chocolate splatter on her cheeks. She giggled, and wiped the chocolate from her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone beeped in its long tone, and Jessica's voice emitted. \"Hey, uh, Jen. Could you come up to my office for a sec?\" Jenna picked up, and spoke. \"Uh, sure. See ya there, Ma'am.\" She hung up afterwards, and heaved herself up to the best of her ability, giving out a grunt. She then trudged towards the elevators, and moved to press the up button. And then she saw <i>it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note on the elevator read: \"Elevator on this floor up is out of service. Please use stairs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, there was no way, this elevator HAD to work. Did they not understand that the elevators tortured her and her fat and happy employees? She had ran it over and over with the lunkhead maintenance idiots could have POSSIBLY let this elevator fail. She tried to keep pressing the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not light up, nor did she hear the whirring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer overtaxed, atherosclerosis-ridden heart sank like the titanic. This meant one thing: She would have to do -That-. That which she loathed. That which she saw as the enemy. That which she would dare not do voluntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to use the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the daunting single flight, and gulped. She had to get up there, because Jessica would never even think to move down. She never moved anymore. She had pretty much literally made her house in the office due to her lethargy, and absolute lack of will to move so much as one hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna began her intrepid trek upwards, her mental emphasis on the size of the stairs overly much making it so that she panted by the fourth step. Her buttoned shirt strained as her gut heaved downwards, and Jenna began leaking sweat at a rapid rate. By the time she'd reached the halfway point, the sweat was falling at a machine gun-like rate from her forehead and hair, leaving almost a full-on trail of sweat behind her as she panted and huffed, and continued her trek up the stairs. She had reached the 3/4ths point, and the sweat began pouring out almost, especially from her chest, soaking her skin-tight buttoned shirt's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She saw the golden end, and surged on towards it, and as she reached it, she fell to her hands and knees, hearing a *RRRRIP* from behind. She had not the energy to get up and continue on, so she simply lay there in a pool of sweat, panting and huffing, and wheezing as though she'd just tried insanity. As she slowly regained her energy, she  stood herself up, her entire shirt drowned in sweat, and her forehead beaming with the evidence of her trek upstairs. As she finally entered Jessica's office, she got a good look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette was like a pile of living lard: Her stomach may have been hidden behind the desk, but her breasts were not, large blobs of pure fat jiggling about in her shirt. Her second chin had been fed a good amount of that fat, dangling down and hiding a good three quarters of her neck. Her blubbery, fat face showed inquisitiveness. \"Jen, what happened?\" Jenna spoke through her pants. \"Elevator..*pant*..Out..*pant*...Of..*pant*...Order..*Wheeze*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica spoke. \"Shucks, sorry about that Jen. I'll make sure somebody down in maintenance hears about this.\" She waved her hand. \"But, anyways...\"</span></div></div>",

Victoria and Christina were the first to join Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina actually looked a lit thicker than usual. Perhaps the rest of the office was rubbing off on her.<br>\r\nVictoria dropped her carry-on bag and sat down next to Jenna. Victoria\u2019s hands were full of food from around the airport. Her chubby cheeks had numerous sauces and stains on them from her recent snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Vicky, I thought you were on a diet to get into beach shape?\u201d Jenna asked. Victoria had been declaring ever since the trip was announced that she was going to lose weight so she would be in shape for the beach. Of course at 270 pounds the idea of getting into shape in just a month was ludicrous, but Victoria was a bit too na\u00efve and oblivious to understand that. In fact Victoria had actually gained weight. She was almost 300 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ve been on a diet all month. I figured that now that were on the trip I could celebrate.\u201d Victoria said, taking a sip of mountain dew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much weight did you lose? What\u2019s your weight now?\u201d Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I didn\u2019t bother to ever weight myself. Numbers can be deceiving. Besides if you just look I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that I\u2019ve gotten slimmer.\u201d Victoria said. She patted her fatter growing belly. Christina rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder where everyone else is. They should have been here by now.\u201d Jenna mumbled.<br>\r\nJust then Courtney and Alice arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry we\u2019re late.

I\u2019ve been eating quite a lot recently.

An interesting noise was made when there was a chorus of groans from both Jenna and Jessica as they lowered their hefty bodies, from the padded business class seats as a combined 1000+ pounds of flab sat down, and from the XXXX\u2026 L clothes that struggled to cover the enormous amount of moving flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the rest of the office crew made their way to economy class.

Alice was looking at her hips, which were touching the edges of her two seats, with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Alice? Getting a little rounder than you use to be?\u201d Melissa said as a tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 Stop it Mel.\u201d Alice blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh, looking pretty large there.\u201d Melissa giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re still fatter than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I\u2019ve got plenty of room with these two seats. Not something you can say about yourself.\u201d Melissa poked Alice\u2019s bulging hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re fatter than me.\u201d Alice said with a bit of doubt. A stewardess told everyone to buckle their seats. Alice pulled her seat belt over her big soft belly. She struggled to connect the buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving some trouble?\u201d Melissa teased. Alice managed to click the seat belt over her bloated waist. Melissa herself was having some trouble with her seat belt. She wasn\u2019t even close to getting it around her enormous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything all right miss?\u201d A stewardess asked the bloated squirming woman. Alice giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 er\u2026 yeah oof, it\u2026 won\u2019t fit.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a seatbelt extender.\u201d The stewardess walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelly getting a bit too big for ya?\u201d Alice chuckled. Melissa could only smile at the embarrassment. The stewardess returned with an extender. Melissa wrapped the extender over her overfed blubber. The stewardess left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jenna and Jessica were trying to relax in first class. The two whales were trying put on their seatbelts. They were squirming as the belts barely reached past their hips. A stewardess walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse\u2026 er\u2026 Excuse me oof miss.\u201d Jenna panted. The stewardess stared in disbelief <br>\r\nat the two butterblimps laying in their seats. She retrieved several seatbelt extenders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m having some trouble\u2026 Could yo- oof you do it for me.\u201d Jessica asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah me too.\u201d They were simply too rotund to reach around their bulging bellies. The stewardess sighed. She tried to wrap the extender over Jessica\u2019s puffy midriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually you\u2019re gonna need two extenders.\u201d The stewardess said. She attached a second extender and buckled Jessica in. The stewardess was very uncomfortable. She had never seen anyone so fat on a plane. She had never had someone incapable of reaching around their own belly. She attached a second extender to Jenna\u2019s seat. She squirmed as her hands brushed by Jenna\u2019s doughy rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay that comfortable for you?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 Oh ugh when will there be food.\u201d Jenna asked. The stewardess sighed. These women were pigs!

I just can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m always just so hungry.\u201d Jenna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I swear it\u2019s just my appetite.\u201d Jessica responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of appetite, where is our food? How do they expect us to wait this long.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, I haven\u2019t eaten in like\u2026 15 minutes.\u201d Their enormous guts started rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, why aren\u2019t there any snacks?\u201d Jenna moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of snacks there\u2019s this great snacking tip I discovered. Recently I\u2019ve been putting butter on everything. I swear it goes with everything.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do the same but with maple syrup.\u201d Jenna added. Finally they received their meals. Jessica struggled to adjust her heft closer to the tray table which her meal sat. The two bloated babes were lucky that they were in business class for they actually had enough room to pull out the tray table in front of their immense bellies. Unfortunately Jenna\u2019s employees in economy class were not so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on.\u201d Melissa said in frustration. The heavy glutton was not even close to having the tray in its proper position. The fat girl\u2019s gut filled up her entire lap. Alice watched her overfed friend struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it may be time to throw in the towel, Mel. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re using that tray.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but\u2026 errr\u2026 If I just\u2026\u201d Melissa stubbornly tried to manipulate her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa come on, if I can barely use mine I doubt you can use yours.\u201d Alice said. Alice had just barely managed to pull out the tray. The edge of it pinching against her soft double belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Melissa said almost out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but think this plane is trying to tell us something.\u201d Alice said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 Alice you always say stuff like that, yet you never end up doing anything about it anyway.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make what I\u2019m saying any less true.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you already come to terms with this like a month ago? You haven\u2019t complained about your weight in a while.\u201d Melissa said. Alice had come to terms with her enormous weight gain about a month and a half ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but then I gained like 25 pounds since then. I was out of control.\u201d Alice hadn\u2019t been in control of her weight in years but in this most recent stint her eating had increased a lot as she stopped worrying about her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. You know that you\u2019ve been way more fun recently.\u201d Melissa had been enjoying Alice\u2019s friendship even more since Alice had embraced her gluttonous desires in the past month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I went up a whole dress and bra size.\u201d Alice complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, I would kill to have your boobs,\u201d Alice blushed, \u201cSecond, you\u2019re not even that big. You\u2019re like normal for America. You\u2019re so much happier when you indulge yourself.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. It was just a bit shocking to get on the scale after the last month and a half.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice you\u2019re on vacation, just stop thinking about your weight until we get back.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine I\u2019ll keep it going until we get back.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool. Jeez it\u2019s like you think you\u2019re as fat as Jenna.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, stop it.\u201d Alice giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019d be able to take off with her on the plane.\u201d Melissa joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jenna and Jessica were still eating. Since the company was paying for everything, including the meals, they decided to order as many meals as they wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here you go\u201d The flight attendant said as she placed down the meals infront of the bloated women. She couldn\u2019t believe this was their tenth meal. Jenna and Jessica just sat waiting to be fed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d They actually ordered another meal for after the one they were just served. The stewardess just walked away in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and Jess wasted no time before continuing their feast. The two obese women were a sight of pure excess and gluttony. Jenna leaned her overfed body closer to the food in front of her. As her body bent forward her shirt started to ride up her pudgy back revealing the exposed top of her enormous bottom. Her gut sunk heavily off the edge of her chair as it fought for space in her lap between her plump thighs. As she shoveled food into her mouth sauce dripped down her chubby cheeks onto her numerous jiggling chins. Her hefty swollen breasts rested partially on the pull out tray table while her flabby shapeless arms rapidly delivered food to her lips. Right next to her sat Jessica. She had completely abandoned the tray table and instead leaned back in her chair resting her food on her great belly. Leaning back she allowed her gut to ooze over her thighs. Her shirt struggled to cover Jess\u2019s mountain of fat as her bottom roll of blubber became exposed. Her swollen belly made a great table as her upper belly formed a platform of flab. Jessica\u2019s plump arms struggled to reach around the enormous swell of her gut to deliver the food into her mouth. As she chewed her food crumbs fell in between her massive fat breasts and her numerous creases and folds of flesh. When she went back for more she struggled to see over her ballooning boobs to see the plate that sat atop her hefty gut. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their expansive hips were oozing into Christina\u2019s seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault they only gave me one seat.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and I should have three seats.\u201d Courtney said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha no offense Courtney but three seats?!? You\u2019re huge.\u201d Victoria said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah again no offense, but how are you that large?\u201d Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just like to eat what I want. If that means I get fat than I\u2019ll get fat.\u201d Courtney said rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I do the same thing but for some reason I\u2019m not fat.\u201d Victoria said. Victoria was actually obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re fat?\u201d Christina asked, surprised by Victoria\u2019s obliviousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Victoria said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Christina poked Victoria\u2019s big soft belly. \u201cMiss I need two seats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey don\u2019t do that\u2026 And I\u2019m just curvaceous. It\u2019s called being voluptuous miss I have no boobs.\u201d Victoria said giving her plump breasts a shake. Christina just rolled her eyes. To be fair Victoria did have a very curvy and voluptuous body. Unfortunately Victoria had eaten herself so large that one of her biggest curves was her hanging gut. Her curves weren\u2019t exactly the same at 300 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry gals but I\u2019ve got to use the bathroom.\u201d Victoria said. This was an inconvenience as Victoria was in the window seat while Christina was in the middle and Courtney was in the aisle. Victoria heaved herself out of her too small seat. She shuffled awkwardly towards the aisle. Her enormous bottom wobbled inches away from Christina\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, don\u2019t crush me.\u201d Christina yelped. Vicky\u2019s belly and breasts brushed against the seat in front of her. Christina couldn\u2019t even see around Victoria\u2019s wide jiggling butt. As she got to Courtney, Vicky had to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourtney I can\u2019t squeeze by you, you need to get up.\u201d Victoria said. Courtney\u2019s 400+ body filled most of her seat space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 Alright gimme a sec.\u201d Courtney undid the buckle around her big gut. She struggled to lift her overfed bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up I really need to go.\u201d Victoria whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristina, give me a push.\u201d Courtney said as she tried to heave herself upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Victoria\u2019s big bubble butt is in my face.\u201d Christina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine I\u2019ll move.\u201d Victoria waddled her large rump out of Christina\u2019s face. Christina used both her hands to push against Courtney flabby hip. Courtney\u2019s massive gut bounced against the seat in front of her as she finally stood upright. She waddled her blubber into the aisle. Victoria squeezed by Christina and made it to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jenna and Jessica were finally finished with their feast. A flight attendant walked down the aisle collecting trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh are you ladies done or do you want more?\u201d She asked. Jenna sat back and rubbed her stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I think we\u2019re *burp* good. Jessica are you\u2026\u201d Jenna turned to Jessica. The enormous woman was fast asleep. The attendant looked at Jessica with disgust. Her massive belly was completely was so full of food that her shirt had ridden up to expose her entire mountain of doughy rolls. The remains of her last meal were still sitting atop her naked midsection, bobbing up and down as the obese whale breathed loudly. Sauce and crumbs were sprinkled over her plump jiggling cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you need anything more just ask.\u201d The attendant said. She was about to walk away when Jen spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I need to go to the bathroom can you give me a hand?\u201d she asked. The attendant sighed as she remembered how Jenna and Jess couldn\u2019t reach the buckle around their bellies. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to find my seat belt.\u201d The flight attendant bent down but was surprised when she didn\u2019t see any seat belt. Then she realized where it was. Jenna\u2019s belly had swelled to the point where her shirt could no longer fit over the great dome of her gut. The seat belt had gotten lost between the folds of two of her thick doughy belly rolls. The attendant hesitantly dug her hands between the two flabby spare tires. She found the buckle deep inside Jen\u2019s soft flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow thanks. Can you help me up?\u201d Jenna asked extending her two hands toward the frustrated stewardess. The poor woman pulled mightily on Jen\u2019s enormous arms. But the overfed rear only managed to lift a couple inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTracey\u2026 Claire\u2026 get over hear?\u201d She said to two other attendants. Three women now gathered in front of the wedged whale. Two attendants grabbed each of Jen\u2019s hands while another reached under her armpits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright let\u2019s try this again.\u201d They all lifted as hard as they could. Jen\u2019s massive body slowly rose out of her seat. Her wide bottom squeezed past the armrests. Finally Jen stood upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Jen huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBathrooms on your right.\u201d The stewardess said. Jen just nodded. She massaged her naked belly that hung like an apron of flesh over her thighs. She slowly waddled into the aisle. Jen tried to pull her pants over her exposed crack. There was still a good 5 inches of her shapeless wobbling cheeks bulging out of her pants. She struggled to make her way past the rows of seats to the bathroom. As she waddled, her thick swollen middle bounced with each step. Her enormous breasts jiggled with fat. Finally she made it to the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

After a quick 3 courses they picked up their bags and got in their rental cars. The man at the rental car service was relieved to find some vehicles that the girls (mainly Jen, Jess and Courtney) could fit in. He was pretty nervous watching Jenna try to fit into the front passenger seat. The seatbelt was too short but they managed to get her door closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls collectively got into the three rental cars.

It was hard for some of them to notice the difference as they were so used to being surrounded by swollen guts in their office building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not really.\u201d Courtney said. Jenna might\u2019ve said something if she wasn\u2019t gasping for breath from the walk to the parking lot. See the resort Jenna chose for the trip was actually designed for heavier vacationers. And with the conference going on the resort was completely booked with visiting office fatties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow this place is busy.\u201d Victoria said. The main lobby was bustling with trays full of greasy food. Big flabby bottoms bumped together, shirts struggled to cover jiggling belly rolls, and heaving breasts bounced and wobbled. Servers and workers whizzed quickly by slow waddling out of breath butterballs. All kinds fat people could be seen moving past the front desk. Chubby women who were still oblivious enough to wear a bikini, leaving there hanging belly out for all to see. Big fatties who embarrassingly tried to cover up the large rip in there too tight pants.

They started walking (well, Christina was walking, the rest were wobbling and waddling) to the front lobby, and the doors swung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lobby was slightly crowded, with the majority of people being extremely thin.

They were the only fat people in the lobby, excluding Christina of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna waddled over to check into the rooms, which were two sets of two interconnected rooms. Jessica would be getting one room to herself, Jen and Courtney would be sharing a room, as would be Melissa and Alice, as would be Victoria and Christina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen checked the girls in as they lumbered toward the elevators hoping to leave their luggage in their rooms. Their were four elevators, and the group had to use all of them separately. They arrived on the fifth floor, where they\u2019re rooms were. They went into their rooms and began plotting out their day. Jen and Jessica had business topics to go over, so the rest of the girls were left to do what they want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on the menu for today girls?\u201d Melissa asked, causing a grumble to appear in both Courtney and Victoria\u2019s stomachs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sure Florida has some amazing food. You guys want to go scouting?\u201d Courtney asked the group, with Melissa getting excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we should go to the pool, I want to lay out.\u201d Victoria objected, her three hundred pound body eager to get into her new bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know guys. You saw the type of people at the lobby. We don\u2019t exactly blend in if you know what I mean.\u201d Alice replied, looking down at her massive three hundred forty pound frame. She didn\u2019t want people staring at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares what they think. Besides, we really aren\u2019t that fat.\u201d Victoria replied, still unaware of how massive her body was getting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristina, you be the tie breaker. What do we do?\u201d Melissa asked, as the entire group looked over at her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenna had worked her way up the ranks of her local branch at Gordge, and at only 32 her hard work and perseverance had been rewarded by being promoted to acting Branch Manager.  She'd shaken just the right hands and kissed just the right butts to get this job, but her job titles hadn't been the only thing to change about her over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who worked at Gordge would get fat at some point. All of Jenna's seniors were chubby, and some of them were much more than that. It was the office lifestyle, she supposed, and the few incentives that the company offered to actually get employees off of their butts and out from behind their desks every once in a while. Plus with all the catered lunches, the easy access to all the local restaurants around them... this particular Gordge branch really lived up to its name. In no time, Jenna was rocking the office bod like the best of them. Muffin top, tight blouses, skirts stretched tight across her thighs. But instead of moaning about it, or trying (usually in vain) to change it, Jenna leaned hard into the lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>loved</i> being fat. Watching herself plump up and up, out of skirts, popping out of shirts, all of it correlating to her success in this stupid office. The more time she spent at work, the bigger she seemed to get. By the time her second chin had fully come in, she was out of internship and into a full-time position taking phone calls for Gordge. And that was only the beginning. As Jenna got bigger and bigger, she only felt more powerful in her position\u2014it was a badge of seniority, it made her feel so <i>big</i> and <i>powerful</i>, and most importantly, it was <i>hot</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the time she cracked three hundred pounds, Jenna really started to notice just how quickly everyone around her seemed to chub up too. The interns would sport potbellies in no time under her watch, and her work friends would always complain about her being a bad influence. Even as the chairs creaked beneath them and dress code violations went up a good 20% in her department, no one seemed able to shake off those pesky pounds and inches that stuck fast to their waistlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when Jenna discovered another important thing about herself\u2014watching <i>other</i> people get fat was even pretty hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day forward, Jenna was as incorrigible as could be. Just as eager to stuff herself as she was to watch others pork out, Jenna's sexual fascination with fat, the overlap between her sense of size and her sense of power, and the ability to chip away at any poor unsuspecting intern's resolve was just her real, honest to God kink. She <i>loved</i> being the Big Boss. Equal emphasis on both words, naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that she was in charge of her entire branch, no one was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years, she'd befriended plenty of girls around the office. She'd worked with most of them at least as their Branch Manager, if not going back even further than that. And she'd been playing the slow, steady game of seeing how round she could help her coworkers get even <i>before</i> her promotion. Now that she was in charge, she'd made sure to make plenty of adjustments to help things along...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice waddled out of the break room belly-first, her back arched as her stomach bobbed obediently in front of her. It peeked out from underneath her biggest pink blouse, creamy flesh rippling with her awkward hulking steps. She was one of Jenna's favorite little projects\u2014a former cheerleader, blown up into a regular chair squasher. Nearing four hundred pounds at just twenty-seven, Alice's pretty face was buried underneath so much chub that you would have never believed she'd ever been on Varsity Squad. She pat her doughy gut heartily, a contented smile on her serene face as the events and contents of her second thirty minute break bubbled into a cute little burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa, Alice's best friend and fellow bad influence, wobbled out behind her. Even larger than Alice by a good fifty pounds, Melissa was even more belly-heavy than her big blonde friend, with a cute little curly brown hairdo that made her look all that more enormous. A fatty through and through, even before Jenna got ahold of her, Melissa was about as lazy as they came around here. Her biggest concern was always when her next break was and, thanks to Jenna, that was one less thing she had to worry about. Greedy, lazy, and as indulgent as a girl could get, Melissa had literally only gotten hired because of the potential that Jenna saw in having a girl like her around the office and what it could do for \"morale\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria and Christina were two works in the making. Twiggy little things that had come fresh off of the recruitment lot. Vicky was this trashy Italian bombshell that Jenna couldn't <i>wait</i> to watch squeeze her way through the doorway and Christina was... okay, she supposed. A bit mousy, not very talkative. She'd worked with plenty of people who quit before they got too big, and something told her that Christina was one of those. Although, she had been wrong before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCase in point, Courtney. They'd started work around the same time and, ten years in, they'd kept each other's pace. She was the only woman in this whole building who knew how to eat like Jenna could, and it showed. The two of them, together, weighed a collective half ton of woman. It was one of the main reasons Jenna had never fired her\u2014she liked having another big girl around like her. Her hands off approach to dieting even as she reached a quarter ton was... <i>pleasant</i>. Even if it went against company protocol, she and Courtney still remained very close. They were frequent buffet buddies, and Courtney often confided to Jenna about things relating to her size, unaware of just how much Jenna enjoyed these little talks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinding on the vibrating head of her \"massage\" chair (custom ordered to her specifications, and none the wiser) Jenna took shallow breaths as she watched her gaggle of girthy gals plod around the office. All of these cows had no idea what was in store for them, now that she was in charge. They were all going to get so fat... <i>so fat</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... so fat...\" Jenna panted, her chins creasing and sweat rolling down her brow, catching in the folds around her neck \"Fuck... fucking huge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna gnawed on her bottom lip and her mind grew cloudy with lust, she knew what her first order as the Branch Manager would be. Her eyes narrowed in on...</span></div></div>",

She knew it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stomped her way along the sidewalk, the cool autumn breeze bit at her bare neck, reminding her that scarf season had hastily returned in the past month or so. But Tina Patrogionnis had a much bigger concern. Much, much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's voice spoke as clearly in Tina's mind as it had earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Victoria! You haven't finished ALL of the bear claws I gave you already, have you?\" Jenna had cooed, not loudly but more than loud enough to make sure at least exactly one other person heard. \"It's no wonder, I've always seen so much productivity out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's brow furrowed as she blanched inwardly. Both being relative newbies, she had always felt a sort of sense of rivalry towards Victoria. Nothing major... it was just, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was Vicki so &lt;i&gt;good&lt;i/&gt; at her job? The girl was a total ditz, a typical North Jersey Italian airhead who should have only been good at swiping daddy's credit card and whining her way out of responsibilities. But Victoria was an organizational pro. Whether it stemmed from years and years of pouring over shopping catalogues or from being just a little bit one-dimensional herself, or a combination of the two, Victoria left Christina in the dust when it came to quickly sorting through and reorganizing client accounts, finding quicker methods to distribute orders and parcels and had even revamped the entire inventory system. So why the hell was Jenna praising her for bear claws?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like yea, they were really good,\" Victoria had licked her lips before she continued, \"but I also reorganized the Stockton portfolio and ordered the Fuentes Files- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and you're an angel for those too dear,\" Jenna cut off quickly. \"I'm just shocked you have the time with all the extra minutes you spend snacking in the break room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria's face had almost turned red, if not for her olive complexion. \"Umm, well-\" she started, looking off to the side as if avoiding eye contact could help her save face. But Jenna was swift to interject once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, naturally, I extended your lunch by an extra half hour,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina had nearly spit out her coffee at this. She was being rewarded for snacking?!? It was bad enough that Tina could hardly keep up with her de facto rival\u2019s efficiency, apparently she couldn\u2019t even keep up with Vicki\u2019s appetite. And it was... oddly apparent which one Jenna prioritized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, to be honest, with the way Victoria\u2019s thighs had been thickening lately, she really didn\u2019t look like she needed extra lunch. Or the extra platter of assorted pastries Jenna had brought with her and laid so surreptitiously in front of her \u201chard-working\u201d secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what I just don't understand, honey,\" Jenna continued, Vicki now rapt with attention, \"is how you get any eati- I mean, work done in this cramped piece of crap,\" she wriggled the back of Victoria's office chair as she spoke. \"Someone's due for an upgrade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cramped? It's the same size as mine,' Christina thought. 'Vicki's ass is just too big for it.' Indeed, Victoria in the past few weeks had been plumping up more and more below the waist as Jenna continuously showered her with equal parts pastry and praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something a bit more... stylish, perhaps?\" Jenna finished, sidling out from in front of what she had been hiding behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, with how massive their ever-eager boss was, it had been completely eclipsed from Tina's view. The \"it\" in question was, in fact, a... A. A BRAND. FUCKING. NEW. OFFICE CHAIR!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, ohh shit!\" Victoria exclaimed, temporarily forgetting her office etiquette. She let out something between a grunt and a squeal as she lurched out of her current office chair and pushed it out of her cubicle, nearly tipping it over in her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had to make sure the seat was half a foot wider,\u201d Jenna said. It\u2019s a bit spacious, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll... ahem, grow into it in no time.\u201d It was hard to miss the literal drool dripping from the corner of Jenna\u2019s mouth as she waddled away, but Vicki seemed far too preoccupied at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on her newer, more-comfortable-than-Tina's office chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no armrests, thank God,\u201d Christina heard Vicki mutter. This was bullshit! Tina worked hard too! \u201cI wonder what I'll do with my extra-long lunch today,\" Vicki continued, her mind wandering off as she reached for another treat, a Danish this time. What was the point of extending her food breaks if she was just going to snack at her desk all day anyway?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. It was obvious that Jenna was playing favorites. And that there was one trait in particular that seemed to earn Jenna's favor more than anything else... Of course, Tina knew that she was in absolutely no position to do anything other than either buy into it or let Victoria blow all the way up to Courtney status while she settled for second fiddle, maybe even help plump Vicki up some more out of spite, but, the question was, which?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The competition was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina racked her brain as she walked the aisles of her favorite supermarket that weekend - she had eaten with wild abandon at every opportunity - stopping at gas stations for pastries, salty snacks, donuts, and nearly anything she could eat, but Christina had begun to already run out of ideas. Of course, she was enjoying the indulgence, but it was a drastic shift - she was working hard to squeeze in extra calories, but it was feeling somewhat exhausting.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'God, how do they just pilot through the amount of food that they do?' She thought. Courtney and Jenna began to seem like raw eating machines - Christina had always had a slim appetite, preferring to munch away at small amounts of food that were just enough to fill her up, even through the usually fattening days of college. But this was a drastic escalation in eating - one that required more than just hard work to pad her slender frame. A pang of guilt shot through her mind - was this job worth her waistline? She pulled up her phone and did a cursory search - to her dismay, nowhere was hiring at the starting pay that Gordge provided. The only way up was to follow the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Christina paused in a deserted aisle - no raw amount of brute force eating would avail her for long. She had to use her brain to truly increase her gains. That was when she considered what was ahead of her - the dairy section. It was then that she remembered something her clique of skinny friends used to quip about. Portly Sierra Windon from her old high school had gotten drastically fatter towards the end of high school, shooting up from the 190's to the 240's, and it had a lot to do with the diner around the corner. She could always be seen with a chocolate milkshake with her usual order of large fries and a double cheeseburger. This now a tool - a tool that would get her that higher salary at the cost of a few measly pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina walked out of that store with a great cart full of chocolate syrup, milk, and chocolate ice cream, not to mention with a metric boatload of cheap fattening frozen pizzas. That was the good thing about getting fatter - it could be cheaper than staying skinny if you played your cards right. And with the idea to fill up on milkshakes, Christina had hit a full house - over the next week, she had easily began noticing her gains, thanks to switching to a higher calorie pastry-based breakfast, the pizza, and especially her secret weapon - a milkshake with dinner and a milkshake for dessert. She felt more stuffed than she ever had before - but the drastic uptick in calories began to show already. Her dress jacket had begun struggling to keep in her expanding waist, breast, and thighs - her gains at least for now had spread out across her body, giving the clear visual sign that she was beginning to gain weight at a rapid rate. Not content with the slight gain that her old plan would have induced, she had gained at least 5 pounds that week - but the watchful eye of Jenna estimated it more at 10 with how drastically Christina Patrogionnis was falling into her trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna stroked her thighs at this realization - how stick-thin Christina was beginning to become thicker. The debate now was only a matter of degrees and how best to get more results. She could try to speed along Christina, but that might spread her efforts too thin - Victoria's gains had been admirable, but she required delicate guidance along the path of fatness. The alternative to directly subsidizing Christina's gains, of course, was to foster a desire for MORE gains - to feed the successful source of competition, and to funnel more food down Vicky's throat. This ran the risk of dissuading Christina from trying to fatten herself and going the way Jenna feared she would go - out the door, and on a diet. Jenna's sexual arousal grew as the decision neared, but she eventually had to make her choice.</span></div></div>",

She would feed Victoria to bursting - and keep Christina close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch came later that month, and blubbery Alice and Melissa were sitting in the break room, respectively wearing a dark red button-up blouse on top of black work pants and a stretchy blue blouse on top of a white skirt. Melissa was eating a Burger Box from Alvi's Drive-Thru, a sloppy, greasy concoction with a large fry and a pile of meat, bacon, and cheese that might be called a burger if the buns weren't struggling as hard as they were under the fat woman's grip. Melissa looked over at Alice's lunch - around 5 boiled eggs with a ham sandwich. \"What's up with the rabbit food, Al?\" Alice gulped down half of one of her boiled eggs. \"This red blouse is one of my favorites - and you can see it's getting pretty tight. I'm trying to calm it down with all the crazy eating.\" Melissa chuckled and shook her head. \"Crazy is relative - for instance, eating a plain ham sandwich with just ham and lettuce with boiled eggs sounds crazy to me.\" Alice shook her head. \"I've always been pretty crazy - speaking of which, feel like hitting up Blue Door for some drinks tomorrow night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had not gotten a chance to answer before Christina entered the room. She was a little later than normal. \"Hey, guys.\" Melissa turned and spoke. \"Hey, Christie. Good timing. Want to hit Blue Door with Al and I on Friday night?\" Christina nodded. \"Oh, yeah. That sounds like fun.\" She took a moment to set her things down, grab her food from the fridge - a chocolate shake and a Philly cheesesteak with fries. She sighed deeply. \"Yeahh~, Jenna's kept Vicky and I in meetings, and Vicky had to stay longer than me.\" Alice asked inquisitively, \"Any clue why?\" Christina sneered and spoke. \"Well, the freshly delivered pizza and cannolis might have had something to do with it. I think she's taking Vicky under her wing.\" Melissa hummed. \"Well, lucky Vick. Not so lucky for her pants size.\" Christina shrugged. \"Maybe she is getting bigger - but at least she's doing it and getting paid more for it. She's been driving that big new station wagon around, and it shines like a diamond.\" She tensely ate a few piecs of her sandwich and a fistful of fries and rested her head in her hands while Alice spoke. \"Yeah, around here, Christie, weight generally means higher status. Might suck to have to buy new pairs of pants around here, but the weight comes with pay bonuses with all the time you spend both eating and working.\" Christina rubbed her temple and spoke. \"I get that, but I've been trying to keep up with all of it, but I have barely even been recognized by Jen. Like, I can eat for my paycheck, but I want to actually see a <i>reward</i> for it.\" She brought her head around to look at Alice, her face filled with annoyance. \"If I just eat like a hog and get no recognition in return, I'm just going to wind up with bigger pants and not enough money to buy more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, coincidentally, Victoria walked past the break room, patting her ever-more taut gut. It was clear that Jenna's efforts were proving fruitful - she had easily gained twenty pounds! The gains in such a short time were staggering - Victoria's walk was becoming more of a waddle than it already was, and her hips which had previously passed for merely plump were being pumped fatter with what seemed like each 'meeting' that Jenna had brought her into. The italian bombshell was beginning to be lit, and with some more prodding, she might explode. Christina grumbled after she had passed. She had still not found anything to match Gordge's starting pay and still stuck to her fattening diet, but she was starting to question the wisdom of fattening herself like a prize hog for no reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it did not go unnoticed. Quietly after lunch had wrapped up and Christina went back to her office with a mug of coffee, Alice whispered to Melissa, \"Tina's starting to look like a gordge girl - I can tell her 'diet' is starting to pay off.\" Melissa nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jenna was also starting to notice - before, she had barely felt anything sexually for Christina as she was - she only felt aroused by the potential of a fatter Christina. She was getting somewhat chubby now - but this was just the beginning of the road. But Jenna was also beginning to notice Alice's efforts to slow or, most tragically, reverse her gains. It was like watching two rabbits run towards a fork in the road, and Jenna had to think and think hard if she wanted to try to keep both gaining. But that would require dancing a delicate line between continuing to fatten both Christina and Victoria while additionally prodding Alice to see if Alice was amenable to female love, as dating often comes with frequent food dates - and even if Alice didn't appreciate the romance, she would appreciate the food. Alternatively, Alice was still considerably large - Christina and Victoria had a long way to go. She could let Alice burn a little fat if she was even aiming to or capable of doing that while focusing on giving Christina and Victoria more mass.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d been watching Alice plump up and up and up from afar for years, but sitting this close to her really gave her an excuse to try and find the former cheerleader buried underneath all that blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d Jenna said in a breathy voice, downing another glass of water to help her cool down, \u201cI\u2019m just <i>so</i> happy you decided to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had come to the office all prettied up for the evening. What that meant, Jenna had no idea. She\u2019d asked her longtime coworker if she wanted to get a drink on Monday, so she\u2019d had all week to prepare. Jenna had been eating herself sick with anticipation of how tonight could go\u2014moreso than usual anyway. Seeing Alice like this, in her prettiest blue blouse (a semi-transparent fabric with solid flowers dotting across her avalanche of a body) and squeezed into what <i>had</i> to have been new khakis (Jenna kept a close watch on whenever her herd of heifers needed some new sizes!), Jenna was having a hard time keeping herself under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry I was late\u2026\u201d Alice ran her big blue eyes, deftly across her billowing belly as it rolled onto the table before reaching for the menu, \u201cI had some\u2026 car trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s \u201ccar trouble\u201d had been well documented in her employee file. Everyone had seen her waddle out to the parking lot and have to wriggle her way into the car seat\u2014she wasn\u2019t fooling anyone by giving it a nonindicative name. Alice was getting to big for her CRV, almost as fast as Melissa or Courtney before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I already ordered for us.\u201d Jenna said with a smile, taking the menu from her coworker<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see.\u201d Alice laughed politely\u2014what a spread she\u2019d been welcomed to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something of an office tradition to begin every venture to the Blue Door with boneless wings. If Alice had to guess, at least twenty of her extra pounds were just her retaining batter and sauces. Jenna must have heard about it from Courtney and Melissa because there were <i>so many</i> of them\u2014four plates of sampler platters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her vow to be good and to not embarrass herself in front of her boss, her mouth couldn\u2019t help but water\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you like wings, huh?\u201d she asked, plump lips moist with desire, \u201cDid you already order the drinks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I mean, this is just the appetizer.\u201d Jenna purred, her lips all the same, \u201cAfter all, us gals have a certain standard of figure to keep up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jenna, I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAht!\u201d Jenna corrected with one extended, sausage-thick finger, \u201cNot another word. Just enjoy yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo punctuate her point, Jenna plucked a particularly juicy wing from the centermost pile and popped it into her mouth. She let out a low \u201cmmmm\u201d as the sweety-sour sauce tickled her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Alice gulped, trying hard not to think about having to replace another set of khakis, \u201cIf you say so. You are my boss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of that tonight.\u201d Jenna corrected again, with a little orange splash on her lips, \u201cJust us girls tonight\u2014deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d She agreed readily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2014now hurry up. The entrees should be coming out <i>any minute</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat set Alice apart, at least to Jenna\u2019s well-trained eyes, was that she tried to pretend that this wasn\u2019t who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, way back when, Alice used to be a cheerleader or whatever. She wasn\u2019t like Courtney, who\u2019d always been a little porky, or Mel who was just an unabashed pig. But Jenna had seen it come out enough to know that this was who Alice was meant to be\u2014a great big fat girl, just like the rest of them. Maybe more than the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women of such substantial size could easily have cleared their table of wings. And given their proclivity towards packing away all things tasty, the regulars didn\u2019t raise an eyebrow at Jenna and Alice having put away five plates of wings between them. They were big women, and the folks from Gordge were some of their best customers. This was more or less pretty normal for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she hadn\u2019t been a few drinks in, Alice would have paled at the thought of Jenna doubling their entr\u00e9e order. And on a whim! She just took the waitress aside, slipped her a twenty as a tip, and told her to bring out two more of everything! Full up on chicken and fruity cocktails, Alice\u2019s turgid tummy was already a little stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Jenna so readily insisted, it was a special occasion\u2014how often did she get to go out with her boss? And how often was it <i>free</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh\u2026 I couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Alice hiccuped, her large body convulsing in a wobbling ripple, \u201cI\u2019ve been so good lately\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo\u2014come on, it\u2019ll be our little secret.\u201d Jenna, emboldened by her many (<i>many</i>) drinks, gave a saucy little wink, \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-kay\u2026\u201d Alice lamented, letting out a stream of air from the tight little \u201co\u201d of her mouth, \u201cLemme just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a move right out of Jenna\u2019s wet dreams, Alice fumbled with the clasp on her bottoms. Lifting up her heavy top tier of her belly, the beluga blonde unfastened her khakis and lowered the zipper. She seemed to <i>expand</i> right before Jenna\u2019s hoggish eyes\u2014impressive dollop of milky white mass surging forward and claiming that much more of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt even rolled onto the table a little bit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d Alice said with a drunk little giggle, patting her tummy appreciatively, \u201cI guess it\u2019s not a night at the Blue Door until I have to make some room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarm sticky cum trickled into Jenna\u2019s panties. She\u2019d never seen this side of Alice before, but <i>God</i> she loved to see her let her hair down. Or her belly out, as it were. As she lusted over her coworker letting loose, blushing from her perpetually rosy apples all the way down to her swaddling chipmunk cheeks, Jenna clutched at a handful of her own belly blubber out of instinct. Pinching herself, <i>hard</i> she struggled to keep herself in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do this a lot?\u201d Jenna pried, her face red hot with lust (luckily, it just looked like she was feeling her liquor a little hard)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, me and Courtney and Melissa come here all the time.\u201d Alice was oblivious to the tension that Jenna was feeling, far far more preoccupied with whatever was placed in front of her, \u201cI swear, sometimes I think those two are trying to fatten me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Jenna asked weakly, feeling like a dam for an ocean as she ate feverishly to help satisfy her lust, \u201cY-You think they\u2019d do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s just a joke. \u201cAlice tittered pleasantly, her belly bouncing with laughter as she took a big girl bite into another burger, \u201cThey just like to tease me about how big I\u2019ve gotten lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalk about a tease\u2014Alice used her free hand to poke one chubby finger deep into her fluffy side rolls. Jenna\u2019s eyes nearly popped out of her head. Munch, chew, crunch. It was all she could do not to cum right then and there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I need to diet but\u2026\u201d Alice gave a silly, tipsy, longing sigh to her burger before taking a bite, \u201cWell, you know how hard it is to control yourself in the office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>do</i>.\u201d Jenna burped, \u201cTemptation is <i>everywhere</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night rolled on and the table was steadily cleared, a herculean effort managed by the wait staff and the weighty walruses rolled up to the booth, both women ate themselves to increasing roundness. Alice out of unleashed gluttony, and Jenna in an attempt to satisfy the \u201cfat\u201d and \u201csex\u201d wires that had been crossed long ago in her calorie-crusted brain. Watching Alice pig out\u2014<i>really</i> pig out, had been a work of art. One that had left the big blonde beached in the booth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 stuffed\u2026\u201d Alice whined, \u201cI\u2014URP\u2014overdid it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna did her best to hide the arousal and excitement in her eyes, the manic twinkle that looked every inch of poor Alice up and down. Stuffed to the gills, her belly round and plopped up on the table in front of her, the prim and proper former cheerleader looked like every inch the greedy glutton that Jenna liked to imagine her to be in her wildest, wettest fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had only ever gotten a glimpse of Alice\u2019s carnal side once or twice in the office. Watching her pig out on donuts in the break room, or scarf down some tasty snacks. Then there were the office lunches, but she\u2019d never gone all out like she had tonight. Not like this. Alice had been hiding a monster appetite underneath all that blonde hair, big eyes, and naif fa\u00e7ade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight confirmed that Alice was every inch the hog that her coworkers were\u2026 maybe even more of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that she\u2019d seen it, Jenna needed more\u2026</span></div></div>",

Their arms swinging from side to side in hopes of maintaining a pathetic momentum. Poor Alice was so out of shape and she\u2019d managed to go toe to toe with her boss\u2014her gut domed outwards as she arched her back, her food baby waddle augmenting her already awkward gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for walking me to my car, Jenna.\u201d Alice puffed, \u201cI feel like a pig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kind of look like one too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStoooop\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing shallow, Alice ran a hand up the surface of her stomach. Pink and swollen, unfurled by her khakis and barely restrained by her blouse, Alice looked miserable. She winced at the touch and let out a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know we\u2019re all kind of \u2018fat friendly\u2019 but I really don\u2019t want to have to buy <i>another</i> wardrobe before the year\u2019s out.\u201d Alice frowned tightly, \u201cAnd if Melissa doesn\u2019t stop calling me Jenna Junior\u2026 oh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pretend I didn\u2019t hear that one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to. The thought of Alice with an extra hundred pounds on her drove her wild. Alice at her size was the tip of the iceberg! Hidden behind the veneer of a boss trying to fit in with her coworker, Jenna was steaming, just <i>begging</i> for release. She\u2019d had an entire dinner\u2019s worth of foreplay, and she needed to get some satisfaction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s me.\u201d Alice puffed, \u201cLemme just\u2026 oh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking one pillar of pillowy pudge up as high as she could get it to go, Alice struggled against the weight of her full belly as she tried to sit in her car. The sizable vehicle noticeably groaned with the added strain of almost a quarter ton of woman, plus everything she\u2019d eaten for dinner. It dipped to one side dangerously low\u2014Jenna grabbed her by the hand in hopes of steadying her and the car a little easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d She gasped, \u201cNow\u2026 lemme\u2026 oof\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how she struggled, Alice\u2019s belly touched the steering wheel. She was due for a new car literally any day now. Seeing that Cheshire smile of pale belly blubber eek out from underneath her blouse to tickle her steering wheel\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenna?\u201d Alice asked, breaking her boss\u2019s concentration, \u201cI need\u2026 a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d Jenna had bitten her bottom lip to the point of blood, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you\u2026squish my belly in?\u201d Alice was bright pink, \u201cJust a little, so that it\u2019s under the steering wheel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna felt her panties dampen as she processed the request. Her hands were on Alice\u2019s stomach. Feeling actual, factual flab. It was warm and soft, the heat from Alice\u2019s big body and her dinner ran up Jenna\u2019s hand and sent goosebumps climbing up her gigantic arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u2026 that feels\u2026 kinda nice.\u201d Alice mumbled as Jenna wrestled her belly blubber, \u201cOoh\u2026 <i>God\u2026 <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I had too much to drink</font></i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low moan escaped the still tispy office whale as Jenna\u2019s hand ran up and down the surface of her stomach. It had been packed tight behind the wheel\u2014Jenna doubted that it would be going anywhere. As she traced the soft pink stretch marks that had faded into her ivory immensity, Jenna ran a hand up Alice\u2019s lovehandle\u2014she winced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCold!\u201d she squeaked, \u201cJ-Jenna, what are you\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna shushed her coworker with a kiss\u2014holding Alice\u2019s limp heavy body with one arm while she pressed their lips together, keeping pace with her free hand as she fondled all of Alice\u2019s exposed belly flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they parted, a moment of silence stood between them before Alice finally said\u2026</span></div></div>",

Like, it was just something that people did. Now that she was almost in her thirties, having had her fair share (okay, less than her fair share) of sexual experiences, Alice liked to think that she knew what those big girl, grown up feelings were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even drunk, she did not know that she\u2019d ever have been okay with her boss Jenna making out with her in the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d she found herself saying, grabbing at Jenna\u2019s hand, \u201cDon\u2019t stop\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled Jenna\u2019s enormousness by the wrist back into the driver seat of the car. Her hand gripped firmly around her monster-sized spare tire as their lips locked again. Sensual moans filled the car as questionable feelings rose from deep within the enormousness that was Alice Gellar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to stay here for a while?\u201d Jenna asked breathlessly between kisses, \u201cMaybe have a private meeting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god yes.\u201d The undersexed marshmallow whimpered, \u201cFuck yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t quite sure what it was\u2014there were so many factors that, whether she liked to admit it or not, Alice was aroused by that night. There was the alcohol, for starters. She hadn\u2019t gotten that drunk in a while. Then there was all of the food\u2026 Alice would be lying if she said that food wasn\u2019t an aphrodisiac. Eating was the closest thing she\u2019d had to a relationship since she\u2019d started working at Gordge. And then there was her own <i>questionable</i> feelings about her size. Feeling Jenna\u2019s weight against hers, playing with her stomach <i>should</i> have grossed her out but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, things got pretty hot and heavy that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmphasis on the heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, both women did their best to seem like nothing had happened. But in a place as tight as Gordge, everyone knew everyone else\u2019s business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna waddled in as she usually did\u2014bearing donuts for the whole office. But this time they were <i>sprinkled</i>\u2014a telltale sign of her getting some, if the ever-nosy Courtney was to be believed. Then there was the fact that she even gave skinny little Tina a nod of approval and an extra donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing to her pride and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Victoria\u2014who got about four to herself as she kicked her feet up on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had gotten three with a sly little wink that went unnoticed by everyone but the flustered fatty. She sucked them down with all the grace that an incessant comfort-eater could manage. But somehow, her friends noticed that something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got laid last night!\u201d Melissa said loudly on the office floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-Wha?!\u201d Alice cried, \u201cH-Hoow did y\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, you\u2019re easier to read than anything else that gets put on our desk.\u201d Courtney chimed in, leaning on the reinforced cubicle wall ever so slightly as her bulk eclipsed Alice\u2019s office doorway, \u201cAnything happens to you, it\u2019s written all over your face\u2014you\u2019re like an open book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice grumbled to herself as she sucked down her donuts, puddling face reddening as she recalled every sordid detail about what had happened between her and Jenna in the parking lot the night before. And then again earlier this morning. How a woman of Jenna\u2019s size could wriggle her way out of Alice\u2019s apartment without her hearing it, she would have never known\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, look she\u2019s getting all pink!\u201d Melissa poked Alice in her chunky cheek, \u201cYou\u2019re like a schoolgirl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA naughty schoolgirl.\u201d Courtney purred, \u201cSo who\u2019d you get it on with?

She had noticed her pants becoming tighter and tighter - she knew any day now her expansion would burst a button. The thought turned her on massively, and she was thankful for it. For a while, she had hit a plateau - hovering still about 505 to 509. But the wining and dining of Alice was a two-way street, and not only was the blonde putting on the pounds, but so was Jenna. She had noticed a jump of about ten pounds over the past two weeks. She had to stop when she realized that it had been even more effective on Alice -  lest she stain her over-tight pants with her own wetness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been obvious to Jenna's delicate attentions that her newfound lover was putting on the pounds - especially when they made love, it became clear that she had put on at least double what Jenna had - somewhere about 20, maybe 25 pounds. Tonight was a chance to be relished, though - Italian food was Alice's weakness, and a four-course special was on at Maggio's eatery. Jenna struggled to her feet, her massive stomach jiggling to her delight as she heaved her weight up and out of the chair. The exertion tired Jenna out, so she just sat back down and picked up the phone - calling Alice. After a few moments, Alice picked up the phone, \"Yeah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetums. Remember, we're on for Maggio's four-course tonight. And wear your button-up blouse.\" Jenna heard a chuckle from Alice's end. \"Want to see all your good work, then? Alright, i'll remember that - but at least bring one of your spare shirts - a couple,actually, 'cause you're fattening me out of my wardrobe.\" Jenna spoke softly and sensually, \"That's the best part.\" Alice oohed over the phone, speaking, \"Not at work... We're already being a bit brazen.\" Jenna spoke again, \"I'm the boss, they can't just throw me aside. Maybe not today, though..\" Alice replied \"I'll keep it in mind - thanks, bye.\" Then the phone clunked closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe night came with speed - time flew when  Jenna was fattening her workforce. She pulled her black sedan into a parking space. She was aroused plenty by the tightness of her packed flab in the vehicle, but the added pounds of the past few weeks made even using her seatbelt with its extender difficult. She would soon be forced to find another solution - a longer extender, or just being ferried around in a limo. She saw Alice's white CRV parked in a spot already, and the pale, obese blonde sitting inside. She opened the door and stepped out, shutting the door behind her as Jenna parked. For a brief, glorious moment, Jenna got a perfect side profile of Alice. Her beige button-up was strained, even at the sleeves, by Alice's  bulging arm fat. Her breasts, expanded by the recent round of gains, were fighting her buttons. But nothing could compare to the mondo-gut that the whale-like blonde was sporting. It had expanded by leaps and bounds - half of it was hidden behind Alice's black skirt, which was already struggling to hold the blonde's fat gut which sported two thick rolls on either side. It became plain that Alice had to have busted the four-hundred pound mark by bounds, and in a few short weeks, would easily be halfway to the 500 mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe porcine pair embraced and kissed in the parking lot, their gargantuan blubbery masses rubbing together like slabs of bacon. Jenna could taste donut on Alice's lips - it turned her on so much that her ever-fattening companion was so greedy that she could not wait until their guaraneedly massive meal. \"Couldn't wait for dinner, huh?\" asked Jenna. Alice spoke up, \"Oh, come on, Tina's been laying off the donuts today, and it was the last one left in the box.\" Jenna's face drew wan with concern. \"Laying off the donuts? What's up with her?\" Alice shrugged as the two waddled breathily towards the door. \"Dunno.. might have just been today. She hit them kinda hard the other day.\" Jenna hummed disapprovingly as their thick, flabby legs carried them into the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of traditional Italian folk music and the smell of meat and pasta almost sent the pair to heaven. The chubby hostess, though nowhere near the pair's weight, asked, \"Hi, Jenna, party of two?\" Jenna nodded. \"Yep. Table if you've got it.\" <i>Yeah, table, definitely don't want to have to shove them out of a booth,</i> The hostess thought. She led the two to their table - awkwardly, one meant for two people of reasonable horizontal proportions, not the globs of flesh that currently were about to sit there. The hostess realized this and was about to re-direct them, catching her breath from the daunting speed-walk, when the most massive of the two, Jenna, pulled her massive rear into a seat. \"Thanks!\" Jenna's fat folds were hanging off the sides of the seat, her thighs already thick expanded to what seemed like the size of Russia, and the sides of her gut hung in the air, jiggling from the motion. Alice pulled to a seat opposite of her. \"Maybe bring a second chair for Jen here.\" Jenna grinned devilishly, and spoke to the waitress. \"Guess I'm a big pig, huh?\" The waitress smiled uncomfortably.  \"Nooo, no, you're not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostess eventually returned with the antipasti - bruschetta on a massive plate. Alice licked her lips. \"Mmmmm. Maggios sure does know how to spoil us.\" Jenna nodded. \"Hell yeah.\" The two hogs began to dig into the crunchy breads and their precious tomato cargo. In smaller portions, this would have been a healthy snack, but in these amounts, they were just as fattening as anything else. At this point, Alice and Jenna talked less and ate more. Their dates were becoming less about getting to know each other, and more about eating for each other's sexual pleasure. Alice had to admit, she was coming around to Jenna's point of view. She was starting to enjoy this feeling, especially as the second course arrived. They had substituted their salad for an early helping of pasta, some caccio e pepe - a heap of spaghetti with pepper and cheese. Alice enjoyed the feeling of fullness and eating past. She began to enjoy every pound she put on - no longer because it helped her climb in rank, but because of the sexual impetus it brought. She felt her skirt strain, and didn't quite want to moon the whole restaurant, and as she pulled her belly out of her skirt, she felt a pang of arousal. She moaned sensually. Jenna looked up, smiling. \"Not full already, are you?\" Alice smiled back and shook her head. Jenna looked and her smile took on a more sexual tone as she bit her lip. \"Getting too big for your skirt, looks like. Lemme know if you need any of those spare clothes.\" Alice shook her head. \"No. I think I like it better like this.\" \"Oh, fuck..\" mumbled Jenna, gripping her own thighs with an iron hand as wetness spread across her crotch. Alice's continued stuffing had caused her buttons to strain to their breaking point, her pale, supple flesh beginning not only to show through, but to bulge through. Alice noticed and jiggled her stomach at Jenna. \"Damn it, don't make us leave early. We haven't even gotten the entree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eating continued through the meal - the entree came shortly after, two huge dishes of both fettucine alfredo with some breaded and fried chicken cutlet, and some similarly fried cutlet on top of some <i>francese</i> sauce. The two fatties continued eating - Jenna had officially unbuckled her pants to let her monster of a stomach rub up against the table. Other diners looked on in disgust, whispering amongst themselves. Jenna caught some of it - \"Don't they have any shame?\" \"Are you serious?\" She even saw a phone blatantly recording them. Interestingly enough, she saw one man with some more enamoured eyes scoping out the two of them. Alice's blouse, though, had enough of her gluttony. It had been rolling up for some time now, but at this point it only acted as a sports bra, leaving the whole of her naked gut exposed to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA manager spoke to their hostess, handing her a check. \"Get them out of here, whatever it takes. It's one thing to eat plenty of food, i'ssa'nother thing to just strip in the middle of the place.\" The chubby hostess waddled to the pair's table and handed them the check. \"We'd appreciate it if you paid and left.\" Jenna frowned. \"Can we at least get our desserts to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were escorted out, wobbling slowly to Alice's larger vehicle. \"Get in the backseat for a sec, babe,\" spoke Jenna. Alice knew what it was time for. \"Mmmmnnn... I'm so fulll.... Ooohhh...\" Jenna rubbed Alice's stomach. \"You have some more room, piggy... I wanna see you fill all of this up.\" She opened the styrofoam container and took one of the cannolis out, putting it phallically in Alice's mouth. This accentuated Alice's especially fat face, her double-chin beginning to curtain around her throat at this compression.Alice slowly began munching on it, filling her cheeks with pastry.This continued on with more pastry next. As the box emptied, Jenna pulled off Alice's skirt entirely, and began pleasuring Alice's clit. She began moaning loudly. The two mounds of fat rested on each other, groping and fondling each other's fat folds and stroking each other's privates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, to both of them, was a perfect night. But not all would go according to Jenna's plan - her focus on Alice came at a cost.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina's lack of donut consumption became more pronounced in the days following the sexy affair of Alice, which was celebrated in the usual style - sprinkled donuts for the office breakroom, to the exasperation of the already fat women's buttons. Only Christina's buttons had any rest, to some interrogation. \"What's with you, Christie,\" asked Victoria, \"You're lookin' a little sickly.\" Christina grunted, \"I haven't seen a bonus or raise for eating like a pig.\" It was becoming obvious that she wasn't wrong. While Alice had been gaining at master pace, she'd been obviously getting spoiled by someone - she brought a new luxury purse and wore a new expensive-looking blouse, nice and baggy until she would inevitably grow out of it in the future. To a lesser degree, talks of bonuses and pay raises populated the rest of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like, for all her gains, the only one not being rewarded was Christina. Victoria and the rest of the group slowly began to drift away from her, leaving her to a cenobitic existence in her office. She was juggling her usual - some work here, some job searching there. She hadn't gotten her hopes up and was starting, somewhere, to accept her place - she was just about to get up from her chair and go back to the donuts when she saw it on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA job offering from Navarin LLC, in the same city, offering more a thousand dollar's more pay than she currently was getting to an applicant with about the same level of experience that she had. Her eyes went wide - she submitted her application and filled out their online form for applicants. She just might get out of Jenna's fattening pen after all. She did not yet suspect that this was, in fact, a feeding ground for Jenna's fat fetish - she simply suspected that this was a prevailing office culture issue that she was starting to be unable to get past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on about her work that day and on the days following - she still had to work the job she had. The routine remained the same - watch Alice stuff herself every second she worked, both of which she could do with some fair skill, and watch the others do part of the same - but Alice still seemed to be sticking out, both horizontally and metaphorically. Christina envied her - especially in terms of pay and position. She noticed massively obese Jenna occasionally jiggle breathlessly through the hallway, and she saw Jenna stop in front of Alice's door. It was now that she noticed that Jenna was carrying a fast-food bag. <i>Of course she is. She always gives Alice the food nowadays.</i> As she turned from the sight in disgust, she noticed something glowing on her browser - she had gotten an E-Mail notification. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tabbed over and checked it - one email was from Naravin LLC. She read the E-mail title first - \"Dear Applicant Christine.\" She could mentally already see what was going to be in the e-mail - \"We regret to inform you..\" But instead, the e-mail read thus:<br>\r\n\"Christine,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have received your application. On further review, we would like to hear more from you. Would you be willing to come in on Thursday, April 19th for an interview at 2:30? If need be, we can help you make arrangements with your present employer. Please RSVP to this e-mail as soon as possible. Sincerely, Joan Beckett, Naravin Profit Margins LLC.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not stop herself from replying any faster. She was not expecting to hear back this soon -this was genuinely a good sign from something she thought too good to be true. This might get her out of what she saw as a hole in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all Gordge company e-mail traveled through company servers, and the title of this incoming e-mail and Christine's reply to it caught the otherwise obsessed Jenna's eye. She grunted in annoyance. Why was it always the skinny ones with potential that tried to do this? However, Jenna had a sense for these things - a part of her tried to draw her away from Alice for the moment. She sensed that if she could convince Christine that she genuinely was wanted, she could keep her here - and get her gaining. She could beat Naravin's price offer by giving her a 5,000 dollar raise - likely out of the scope of a fresh hire, even for a successful firm. Alternatively, she could let Christine go, and focus more on fattening what she already had. She'd be a bit short-staffed - but she'd worked with worse before, and besides, her main focus was fattening the sexy, gorgeous pigs in her office. She could even hire one of the chunky ones from lower in the ranks for a position in this office - there were a few who caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sexual desires and her lust were temporarily stowed away - as much as they could be when Alice was in the building - and she had to make a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The decision to let Christina go had been a hard one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Jenna had been tantalized by the thought of what she could have done with that one. Tina had been a true Gordge girl in the making\u2014the mental image of her waddling through the front doors a few hundred pounds heavier was enough to send shivers up Jenna\u2019s spine (plus a bit more, grinding into the head of her custom-built office chair) but ultimately, she had a decision to make. Suffer one petulant, slow gaining skinny minny who was already searching for another job\u2026 or indulge in a little immediate gratification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with Jenna, the answer was <i>always</i> immediate gratification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a two week\u2019s notice, Christina was gone. She had packed up her desk and left, a meager amount of weight higher than she had been when she\u2019d first stepped through the front door. And while Jenna would, at times, be haunted by the whale that could have been, she had to tell herself that it was ultimately for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all\u2014that meant that there was <i>that much more</i> room for her staff to grow into, given the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad that Tina\u2019s gone.\u201d Vicky prattled on, scarfing down her fifth donut of the morning, \u201cShe was such a nerd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe favoritism in the Gordge offices ran rampant\u2014anyone and everyone who had caught Jenna\u2019s eye had only continued to expand. Vicky especially, given her cushy position and relatively low energy output. Even with the newly acquired distraction that was Alice steadily outgrowing her wardrobe, Victoria was easily gaining weight at the same breakneck pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother twenty pounds had all gone to the right places\u2014her fat, olive-colored ass hung out of her skimpy skirts and bulged over the sides of her waistband. Meanwhile, her soft tum threatened to pop another button any day now. Jenna had been keeping her full and fed as her secretary\u2014and now that Christina was gone, there was little to no reason not to shower her with the affection that the two of them\u2014that is, both Jenna and herself\u2014so rightfully felt that she deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and she was always stealing the last donut.\u201d Courtney huffed, her great weight weighing heavily on her joints as she sunk into a puddle of pudge on the break room seat, \u201cI get being hungry, but\u2026 you know, who <i>does</i> that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, <i>Alice</i>.\u201d Melissa snorted, cheeks dimpling as she nudged her friend in one of her meaty side rolls as she munched on the last donut, \u201cWho <i>does</i> that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blimping blonde could only giggling vapidly in response to the gentle ribbing that her friend had given her. It was no secret among the weight-conscious Gordge girls that she\u2019d been packing it on an astonishing rate\u2014even for one of them. Melissa had been teasing her endlessly about the subject in as goodnatured a fashion as she could manage. Being that a similar ritual happened after hours (and sometimes on the clock) with her boss and secret paramour, Jenna, Alice was beginning to have difficulty uncrossing the wires between teasing and <i>teasing</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice chewed faster, cheeks flushed pink with arousal, she did her best to avoid the topic of who was eating the last of what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was, Alice had been eating pretty much everything in sight these days. Whatever hadn\u2019t been scarfed down by eager eaters like Courtney and Melissa, or gobbled up by young and promising gainers like Victoria and (until her departure) Christina, the chair-squashing blonde had found herself absolutely uncontrollable in the presence of anything even vaguely edible and delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe things that she and Jenna were doing\u2014they were turning her into such a pig!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking around with her boss, getting bribed with everything sweet and tasty that her piggish heart could have ever asked for, it was doing a number on her self control! All she wanted now was food, food, food! And the welcoming touch of her employer\u2019s chubby little fingers tracing around her body. Into her body. Just\u2026 Jenna\u2019s <i>touch</i> was enough to make her shiver right there, in the break room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut since she couldn\u2019t exactly start the day wet, Alice was happy to indulge herself with another donut. And then something from the vending machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a figure to keep up, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna bit her bottom lip as she watched Alice struggle to sit on her desk. The surface creaked and bent dangerously underneath her weight. Even as reinforced as it was, it was proving no match to Alice\u2019s superior size. As much as the former cheerleader, current chunker reveled in the attention she was getting from her boss, the little squeaks she sounded spoke more about her insecurity than Jenna would have liked.She wanted Alice to be big, bold, and sure in her gluttony. Like Melissa. Like Courtney! Like <i>her</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough admittedly, she was absolutely adorable in her attempts to feign confidence. Like a stuffed, spoiled kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re turning me into such a pig.\u201d Alice purred, lifting up the top-most fold of her belly, \u201cI popped another button today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve still got one, two, three\u2026\u201d Jenna walked two chunky fingers up Alice\u2019s hillside of a profile, making the practically (until now) celibate desk jockey shiver with excitement, \u201c\u2026four <i>five</i> buttons to go there, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this one\u2019s right on my tummy.\u201d Alice pouted, hands on either side of her stomach, \u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I see alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna got good use out of her custom-built chair. She\u2019d watch all day long while her employees slowly outgrew this chair and that. It was her favorite part of the job\u2014watching while these cows stuffed themselves until they were too fat to work anywhere else but Gordge. But for <i>her</i>. She was happy to give them everything that their hoggish hearts desired. Like a farmer raising livestock\u2014all she wanted was for her employees to be happy, contented, and <i>fat</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, losing Christina had been a little stressful in and of itself. But she\u2019d made a choice, and she\u2019d stood by it. The ensuing stress-eating of having to pick up that eager beaver newbie\u2019s slack meant that she\u2019d put on a good ten pounds of comfort weight\u2014although it <i>had</i> shown up in other places\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we gonna replace Tina?\u201d Alice asked, rubbing her stomach with both hands as she leaned on the woefully wobbling desk, \u201cThe girls are starting to get a little antsy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat depends.\u201d Jenna licked her lips as she pulled Alice close to her seated shape\u2014their vast stomachs coming into contact with one another, \u201cAre they the <i>hungry</i> kind of antsy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice got pink in the face, the feeling of flesh on flesh foreign to her undersexed and hyperfattened form. It had been so long since before Jenna that someone had given her what she\u2019d wanted. And now that she was in the palm of her bosses\u2019 hand, it was so hard for her not to melt at her touch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I mean I guess\u2026\u201d Alice shivered, \u201cBut\u2026 I mean, i-it\u2019s so hard to get anything done around here without Tina\u2026 she actually did a lot of work\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna snorted\u2014her wide nostrils flaring contemplatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t\u2019 have her girls going hungry, that much was for sure. Hiring a new, chunky intern would be the best way to go. One that wasn\u2019t\u2019 so obtuse. Not like that Christina girl. One that knew how to play the game. And if she assigned her to Alice, that meant that her chubby little office sexpot could kick her feet up and have a lot more time for snack breaks\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, a little stress could go a long way. Jenna knew her ladies inside and out, and all of them were greedy little piglets. They would stress-eat themselves even rounder than before, and that would more than outweigh the (more or less) slight dip in productivity. It might look bad to corporate, but Jenna would risk losing the lead in sales if it meant a bigger, hungrier, <i>fatter</i> staff\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Jenna had secluded herself in her office for a moment to breathe from the exhausting walks around the office - and, of course, to eat - she contemplated the courses she could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, she had thought to simply let the staff stress-eat themselves out of their clothes. The gains had already been considerable. But then, there were rumors floating around - rumors about the truth between her and Alice. She began internally chiding herself, <i>Damn, I've been pretty greedy. If I'm not careful, I'm out of a job here.</i> She had to take more caution - more consideration. If she took all of her decisions on the basis of her sexual lust, she would alert Corporate too fast, and risk another coming into her position. The thought of another in her seat terrified her. The other person could be neglectful of the visceral need she felt to fatten the office. That could risk stagnating their gains - or even worse, send them into dangerous thoughts about losing the weight. That simply would not do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she had to begin taking steps towards hiring - of course, over her considerable lunch of several boxes of takeout. Thank god for modern hiring websites - she could see a profile picture of her applicants before she had to drag them in only to see that they were tiny. Thus, she scrolled right past the skinny ones - only looking at the young chunky things. Then she saw a thing of beauty - a pale, blubbery little redhead named Maria Buszwigo. This little Polish beauty would do perfectly. She rung up the number listed and eventually, the higher-voiced, boston-accented woman picked up. \"Hellow?\" She grinned - she could almost see the little morsel - but she would have to get her in herself. \"Hiii! This is Jenna from Gordge. I saw your profile, and you look pretty good..\" She quickly moved forward, \"in terms of your qualifications. Very well qualified.\" She knew she couldn't pull stunts like this when trying to stay under the radar. \"When are you good for an interview?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice jumped into action. \"Oh, Thank you! Uh, Friday would be good fah' me.\"  Jenna grinned. Friday would bring her closer to this fat little thing. \"Perrfeect! I'll see you about... Three-forty?\" \"Yes, that would be puh-fect. Thank you, you won't rah-gret it.\" \"Thank you, bye.\" Then she hung up. Friday would bring her in the presence of this little beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday came, and Jenna sat in the downstairs interview room. Her journey there had been a sexy one to her - she heard plenty of commentary that the speakers thought was too quiet for her to hear - \"Jesus, Jenna got even bigger. How is that possible?\" \"They might have to make her a new elevator door - she's getting as wide as she is tall.\" They were not wrong. Jenna's rapidly fattening employee base had turned her on and inspired her to go further in her gains. Her gut rolled further down towards her knees, and when she sat they now threatened to overlap her knees, racing dangerously towards her kneecaps. When standing, it easily rolled down to her thighs. Her breasts had begun to outpace bras - the old one was too tight, and though it turned her on, a woman of her size had to be able to breathe - she had officially become too much of a fatass to wear a bra, and that <i>turned her the hell on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat and waited - and caught her breath, as she was perpetually out of breath - while she waited for Maria. Eventually, the familiar face materialized on top of a gorgeously fat body. Her gut was easily in the 40 inch range, and her double-chin perpetually lined her chubby-cheeked face. Her legs and breasts also had a fair hit of fat to them - her legs jiggled about, easily the fattest things on the woman. This would be fun for Jenna, she couldn't suppress a grin. \"Hey, welcome!\" She shoved across a bowl of sweets as she took a fistful from the bowl. \"Here, grab some. Compliments of the office.\" This was the first true teste. Maria gritted her teeth - but Jenna could read faces. The amorous and desirous eyes told her that Maria truly wanted the chocolates -the caramels, but the gritted teeth - obviously something holding her back. Doubtless a diet - she must have put on this weight recently. The ill-fitting dress told her this. Jenna winked, and spoke. \"Chocolate calories don't count.\" Maria grabbed the chocolates without a second thought after that. \"Thankyou.\" she said, breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your experience already looks really good,\" said Jenna,  \"How would you say you tend to build camraderie with your co-workers?\" Maria scarfed down a few chocolates like she was breathing them in, then she spoke. \"Uh, I like ta' sit down and eat with my co-workers. I love food - it seems to love me so much that it sticks to me.\" Jenna chuckled, \"I know something about that.\" She poked her own massive belly. \"Don't worry, we're friendly to that kind of stuff here. We won't bitch at you about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview rolled easily, and by the next Monday, Maria had entered the office for the first time. To Maria, she felt like she belonged here - she felt represented and part of the office, rather than the stock fat lady. In fact, there were plenty of bodies in this office that made Maria look tiny - not just Jenna, but especially her new direct boss, Alice. Alice's massive form looked rather like a ball of dough with great flabby legs of butter, and her face coated in the same waxy, pale fat. Her face, especially, had taken the recent gains, her double chin had now long developed from a slight dangle below her chin to a full on slab of fat that hung thick and heavy from below her smooth, blubbery face. \"Hi. Who are you looking for?\" Maria spoke up. \"Yeah, uh, I'm looking for Alice. Where can I find hah?\" Alice smiled and nodded - both actions making her fat-coated face seem to fatten before Maria's eyes. \"That's me - are you the new assistant Jen assigned me?\" Maria smiled and nodded in return, \"Yep! That'd be me. Nice tah' meet yah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women of varying fatness shook hands, Alice's bingo-wings jiggling intensely.\" Maria spoke up. \"Forgive me if this is a bit weird - but it's real nice tah' see that this oahffice is a bit more...\" Alice finished her sentence, \"Fat friendly? Oh yeah. Don't worry, we all figured out we were big girls a few popped buttons ago. \" Maria smiled in return. \"Well, that's comforting - last office, nobody would shut the hell up about what I was eating.\" She assumed a shrill tone of voice. \"Oh, you know that's got more calories than a, dah, dah, dah, shut up and get back to cheatin' on yah' husband, Janet.\" Alice cackled and slapped her overtaxed knees, then took a few minutes catching her breath from this athletic endeavor. \"Oh, oh, oh... Janet... God, My mom was just like that... Crazy, her name is Janet too. That level of funny is dangerous, you might give someone a heart attack.\" Melissa suddenly interrupted. \"You say that through your second box of donuts today, Al.\" Alice sunk back for a second, blushed, then replied with fire, \"Can't hear you through your half-a-pizza lunch, Mondo-Mel!\" The office erupted in laughter, and the pack came out to greet the fresh face in the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you like to do for fun, Maria?\" asked Victoria. \"Oh, I love to watch some T.V, browse my favorite blogs... I haven't gone to the beach in a while, but I used to love to do that.\" Victoria replied, \"Yeah, I know the feelin.' Bikinis don't fit me no more, and I just love the two-pieces!\" Alice spoke up, \"Same thing - but I just can't wear them without being escorted out by the cops.\" The fat ladies began to bond over their lardy natures and experiences in life - and Maria became more a part of the office than ChrisTiny ever was. And Jenna could appreciate that there seemed to be no flightiness among her employees now - they were all firmly rooted by their gluttony and the pounds on their frames - pounds that would only increase.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In order to keep everyone happy, both officially <i>and</i> off the books, Jenna had pulled a couple of strings to get Maria hired on full-time, rather than as an intern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had made the (compelling) argument to her superiors that it was the purgatorial status of \u201cintern\u201d that had helped chase away their last prospective hire, Christina. As the fiscal year had just begun, risky financial maneuvers were on the table, as well as the need to start this year off right. Being down one woman and potentially passing on another who had promising numbers from a similar field in another company would have been shooting her office in the foot\u2014that is, if any one of her girls could get a good enough angle to hold the gun. Maria was officially given the same title as everyone else, but Jenna had her working in a conjoined cubicle with her superior chair-squasher, Alice Gellar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOstensibly, it was so that the more experienced employee could run Maria through the ropes. Jenna might have had her skip the intern stage, but Maria still needed to know how to do her job, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in practice, the \u201ctemporary\u201d arrangement would last as long as possible. Maria wasn\u2019t being trained to do Christina\u2019s job; she was being trained to do Christina <i>and</i> Alice\u2019s job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not entirely. The fact of the matter was that Alice\u2019s workload would be systematically divvied out across the office in small amounts. Enough that it wasn\u2019t really noticeable. But if someone <i>did</i> complain, Jenna had her \u201ctraining duty\u201d excuse ready at the hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d get used to the extra workload in no time. It was just a couple of extra keystrokes. More rippling movements to jiggle through their flabby arms. A little longer with their bellies pressed up against the keyboard. They would hardly notice, if given the right incentive to stay put at their workspaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all\u2014Alice had more important things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow Alice\u2014issat all fer me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s head piqued up at her name, ripping her from the insipid desire to stuff herself walking down the aisleway. Her cheeks bounced softly as she came to a standstill, hugging her haul close in both hands and smushing various crinkling packages into her sizable chest. She held her food close, feeling her heart skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, no no.\u201d Alice laughed a little, husky and out of breath from her walk to the vending machine, \u201cThese, um\u2026 this is just a little snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle, huh?\u201d Maria snorted, \u201cThat looks more like lunch ta me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 if you want, I can go get you something?\u201d Alice\u2019s porky fingers were already tearing at the end of the clear plastic packaging, her face folding at the chins as she hunkered over her swollen chest \u201cMrmphm\u2026 you know\u2026 in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m tryin\u2019 ta cut back.\u201d Maria pat her plump belly derisively, \u201cI\u2019m really startin\u2019 t\u2019pack it on, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>do</i>\u2026\u201d Alice ran her hand up the side of her stomach, sneaking a sly little squeeze of her fleshy white flank as it poured out from underneath her blouse, \u201cI\u2019m getting so <i>fat</i> lately\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word sounded differently now. Ever since she and Jenna had become\u2026 <i>whatever</i> they were, Alice felt the word \u201cfat\u201d for long moments after it left her lips. The hiss of the \u2018f\u2019, the click of the \u2018t\u2019, and the weight that hung from her waist. The width of her hips and the heaviness of her full stomach as Jenna went down, down, down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, all them snacks might have somethin\u2019 t\u2019do with it.\u201d Maria snorted, \u201cUgh, I wish I looked as good as you do. You look so good for a woman \u2018a\u2019 your size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Maria\u2026\u201d Alice purred, a dreamy expression locked on her face as she came to rest one hand on her robbable, traceable stomach, \u201cI think you\u2019re gonna fit in <i>just</i> fine around here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDate nights between the two of them had to be done in secrecy. Jenna and Alice\u2019s relationship was directly against the Gordge code of conduct\u2014and even if it wasn\u2019t, it had nepotism written all over it. Jenna hires a new employee, sticks her under Alice, and lets her new office squeeze toy get away with doing jack shit all day while the newbie pulls her (ample) weight throughout the day? That was an open and shut case, for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Jenna\u2019s UberEats guy could keep a secret\u2014it just so happened that he was Alice\u2019s too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting so fucking fat.\u201d Jenna said breathlessly as she floundered on top of her lover\u2019s stomach, \u201cDo you do <i>anything</i> all day but eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were far too out of shape to pleasure each other with the vigor that they would have liked. Jenna\u2019s passion was outweighed by her need to constantly take a break. But what she could do was talk. Jenna loved to talk. Almost as much as she loved to play with the supple, swollen shape of her secret chair squashing couch potato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Alice gasped, her blue eyes rolled into the back of her pretty blonde head as she clung to either side of her belly, \u201cI just sit and eat all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt <i>shows</i>~\u201d Alice\u2019s boss grunted, her pathetic muscles flexing as she hefted up  the upper tier of Alice\u2019s stomach, \u201cLook at this <i>gut</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know-w-w\u2026\u201d Alice shuddered, struggling to touch herself, \u201cI\u2019m getting so fat for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot fucking fast enough.\u201d Jenna got her second wind, using it to heft herself on top of Alice\u2019s leg and grind deep into the dimpled dough of her mile-wide thigh, \u201cI want you bigger\u2014I want you <i>fatter</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Alice mewled, shuddering as Jenna\u2019s chubby but surprisingly deft fingers slid between her lips, \u201cN-<i>nuhhh</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of Jenna\u2019s weight crushing Alice\u2019s own\u2014their stomachs stuffed heavy beyond all measure. Alice alone had eaten more tonight than she had in the whole day of sitting back and letting Maria do all of her work. Her fat belly was round and taut, pink with pain and pleasure as Jenna steadied her massive self with one hand pressing deep into Alice\u2019s sandbag stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be popping out of my hand-me-downs before you know it, chubs.\u201d Jenna\u2019s authoritative, commanding voice echoed in Alice\u2019s mind, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make you the fattest girl in the office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Buh\u2026\u201d Alice protested weakly behind glazed eyes, her rational side succumbing to the intense pleasure that was the fantasy that Jenna painted for her, \u201cUh\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn some level, Alice knew that it wasn\u2019t a practical fantasy. Jenna was spoiling her rotten, feeding her enough every time they went out that she felt like she was going to pop. And on top of that, now she was doing nothing at work but stuffing her fat face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on another\u2026 it felt so <i>good</i> to let go. To eat as much as she wanted. To have someone want her for the big, fat pig that she\u2019d become. That (maybe) she\u2019d always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was so confused as to what she <i>really</i> wanted\u2014but became less so with every one of her date nights with Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF<i>uuuuuuck</i>\u2026\u201d Alice groaned, shaking the bed with her bucking orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA near half-ton of woman wobbling on top would send Jenna\u2019s reinforced bed shaking worryingly as the legs began to bend that night. Jenna had gotten it initially with the intention of, perhaps, breaking it beneath her own bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she mused idly as she fixed her girlfriend a midnight snack, she might be willing to settle for breaking it beneath the two of them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night truly changed Alice, irrevocably and permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, she could no longer deny that she drew a deep, unmatched pleasure for the weight gain. Her worries about her work productivity began to shed nearly the next day as she noticed Maria hound the office's work with nary a complaint or a sigh - she was actually increasing productivity while Alice slacked more and more, devoting more and more of her time to being in the break room. She was scarcely ever in her office anymore, almost melding into the great black couch in the break room. She had gone from a box of donuts a day, occasionally two, to two being her baseline minimum, in addition to the mounds of other snacks that Jenna would conveniently stock the break room with. She had food regularly delivered to the break room. Even fat Melissa was surpassed by Alice's gains and gluttony. At least Melissa occasionally devoted herself to her work, and even her usual was to work a little and snack a lot. Alice was simply eating everything in sight with absolutely no shame, a fact Melissa was pointing out - \"Hey, I think the fridge is technically edible, you might want to try eating that next, Al.\" Alice shook her head, \"Nah, I tried, it don't agree with me.\" Melissa shook her head and surveyed Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde's body, though fat before, was becoming overwhelmed by her own gluttony. Several months had passed and the old rate of around 4 pounds a week was becoming a dizzying 10. Alice was even weighing herself semi-regularly now - her last weigh-in, a week ago, was at 548.5. Alice relished in the fact that Jenna's hand-me-downs were beginning to pop - just the other day, a pink, flowery button-down had popped - a blouse that had avoided the same fate in Jenna's hands, but fell to Alice's obesity. Other things were falling victim to her fatness - she had been forced to buy a seatbelt extender and specially modify her car seat to be able to slide back further so that she could be able to propel her hulking mass, growing fatter by the day and the hour. Alice's body was starting to protest at its engorging - her joints complained when she did occasionally move them. Her old routine of sometimes going on walks to relieve a bit of stress had died completely, a routine that survived, though reduced, up to this point. Her lungs were constantly assailed by fat from all sides within her fattened breasts, where not only her boobs engorged and expanded, but her torso began to fatten, accentuating her fattened stomach and propelling it downward. The advance of her subcutaneous fat towards her heart made every beat ring like a bell against her skin, Alice felt every beat of her hard-working heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at any other point, to anyone else, this would trigger an imminent desire to lose weight. But to Alice, this was heaven on earth - she loved the feeling of becoming fatter, and it was truly becoming a passion for her. At night, sometimes, Jenna would stroke Alice's mammoth gut, rubbing it and massaging it. \"God, it's so huge... It's gonna be bigger than mine soon...\" Alice nodded, laying like a great porcine beast, \"I can't wait... to be the fattest girl in the office...\" Jenna smiled. \"You're already fatter than Courtney. I've seen the looks Mel is giving you too - she can't believe that you're such a cow..\" Alice smirked and chuckled, mooing gently. Jenna stroked her belly button, producing an involuntary moan on Alice's part. \"Ohhhhh, god, that feels great - all of it. I heard Melissa talking behind my back when I was headed to the bathroom - she was shit-talking me with the rest of the girls, talking about how I won't be able to walk soon.\" She took a moment to take a few deep breaths, her great fat chest rising and falling and her two breasts falling to either side of her truly massive gut. Jenna spoke up. \"Yeah, babe... Soon, I'll have to do everything for you... wash your fat rolls..\" She stroked one of them, fondling the flab beside her belly, \"cover your ass at work...feed you so that you can't try to get up..You'll just be a mound of fat for me to feed and fuck... One day you won't even be able to come into work... you'll be too fat to get into the office...\" Alice smiled at this. She was genuinely happy that one day, Jenna would be able to take care of her every need. She would be able to sit back and eat everything she was brought, with no need for anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Alice was already running into a few issues getting to that point. For one, she burned almost her whole day's worth of meals off simply by existing - her Basal Metabolic Rate had risen with her weight, and it was solely the snacking that kept her going forward. In addition, she did peskily still have to walk from her car to her office - a herculean ordeal that set her nearly unconscious every day, leaving her breathless with her heart racing against her chest. She was already moving as little as she could to help along with her gains, but she was close to her upper ceiling. She would truly have to eat a massive amount, every single day, to fight her metabolism. In addition to this, some of her attention went outward - \"Babe, I know we both want me to be the fattest girl in the office - but I'm starting to see why you do like you do, feeding us all as you do.\" Jenna purred and nodded. \"Now you're becoming a real disciple, Al. But I don't know if they all deserve to reach your level, hon.\" Alice thought on the subject for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office, however, did not stop for these two. The modern office environment runs on a day-by-day basis. What is going on in the office at this point?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was becoming increasingly clear to everyone in the office\u2014even the new addition, Maria\u2014that Alice was getting too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a normal place of work, this might have been some cause for concern. After all, these women spend so many hours a day together\u2014they liked to think of themselves as friends! Even if they could be a bit underhanded, sneaky, or downright hypocritical when it came to the open discussion of other people\u2019s weight. Alice\u2019s quick ascension up the weight class, zooming past \u201cMel\u201d and right into \u201cJenna\u201d territory, would have raised plenty of eyebrows and perhaps called for an intervention. A call to action, or at least a Come-to-Jesus with their worryingly widening coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in a place like Gordge\u2014where it was every woman for herself, at least in a dietary sense\u2014Alice\u2019s incredible size soon became just another topic to talk about at the water cooler. Or rather, in their particular case, in the break room, over donuts. After all, a second spared to judge someone else was a second spent ignoring their own rapidly widening waistlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were talks about her being put on work-at-home leave\u2014disability, in layman\u2019s terms. She was simply too fat to work. Even Jenna, their boss, could get around without the amount of trouble that Alice did. Her pretty face and features buried underneath hundreds of pounds of excess fat, she was hardly as used to being the size of a small elephant than the small elephant would be at her job! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut until then, she would still be at work (doing whatever work she did, anyway) and she had become increasingly <i>hot</i> towards being the hot topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really starting to worry about you, girl.\u201d Melissa frowned as she watched Alice\u2019s stomach sag towards the floor, \u201cI know we all like to take it easy on the dieting but\u2026 have you <i>seen</i> yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice could only pant in response. Jenna\u2019s fat talk had helped condition her to the acceptance of her size. She liked it when other people talked about how fat she was getting. She <i>loved</i> it. Even if she didn\u2019t fully understand why. She was hooked on the sensation of being Jenna\u2019s fat, greedy piglet. She felt a familiar spasm deep, <i>deep</i> beneath her incredible thighs as Mel talked to her plainly about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026 I\u2019m such a whale.\u201d She used one hand\u2014buried beneath the desk\u2014to jiggle her triply-rolled stomach as deftly as she could, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve really let myself go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying Al\u2014I like to have fun as much as the next girl, but\u2026\u201d Melissa grimaced, \u201cHow long until you can even <i>fit through the doors</i>, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nearly fucking came right then and there. Jenna had often teased her with the idea of getting rounder than she was tall\u2014getting so big around the belly that she no longer fit through the front doors of the Gordge office. She welcomed it. She <i>craved</i> it. She was logically quivering in her boots about it, but the rampant id that had taken control of her subconscious told her that she needed more, <i>more</i> stimulation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019ll really get that fat?\u201d she whispered in a husky voice, \u201cY\u2019think I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice didn\u2019t hear whatever she said\u2014or what Melissa said, for that matter\u2014as she did her best to orgasm in as total a silence as she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, Melissa would make such a great little cow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had brought up the topic while hand feeding Alice cr\u00e8me filled donuts. The interruption of her motion\u2014rather, the inclusion of Mel in their little fantasy\u2014made Alice snort and spit wildly in disbelief. The smaller woman\u2014though only marginally\u2014could only smile as she watched the downright immobile blob that was her former cheerleader sexpot wriggle and write in jealousy and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d she asked, her tone a bit more worried than she would have liked, \u201cBecause, umm\u2026 I\u2026 ufff\u2026 I \u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she was too fat to form a coherent thought. Alice had been spoiled endlessly by Jenna\u2019s tutelage, bringing her deeper and deeper into the fold of immediate gratification that she\u2019d always wanted. Alice was a greedy girl at heart, extending to both food and sexual desires. It was what had gotten her where she was before Jenna had taken her under her wing, feeding her until she was too fat to buckle her car-seat, until she was so big she could barely waddle around the office anymore. Alice wanted it all\u2014all of the food, all of the gratification, and most importantly, all of the <i>attention</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Jenna even mention that Mel might be able to muscle in on her territory made Alice uncomfortable. And hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby\u2014you\u2019ll always be my prize piglet.\u201d Jenna cooed as Alice mooed in distress, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 don\u2019t you think it\u2019d be a little fun to watch Mel get supersized?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s fat-clogged gears turned slowly. Mel was already super-sized. In fact, she\u2019d stayed at (more or less) the same weight that she\u2019d been since Alice\u2019s gain had really started to take hold. In her eyes, more Melissa might have meant less attention for her\u2014and she so <i>loved</i> finally feeling satisfied after years of abstinence. Years of eating her feelings. Now that she could eat and cum to her heart\u2019s content, sinking deeper into desires that she\u2019d never known she\u2019d had, she felt a little\u2026 <i>threatened</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrmm\u2026\u201d she burbled, \u201cBut\u2026 but <i>me</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll <i>always</i> be the biggest girl in the office.\u201d Jenna purred, stroking Alice\u2019s stomach as it domed high, <i>high,</i> above her head, \u201cAt least if I have anything to say about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to abate Alice\u2019s developing narcissism for the time being. She grunted thickly as she sunk back down into the bed, Jenna slowly massaging her neglected clit with two fatty fingers. She made a passive, thick noise of approval before sinking deep into a small orgasm. Cum splashed into Jenna\u2019s palm as she contemplated the status of the rest of her office drones\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s <i>Maria</i> doing, baby?\u201d Jenna asked with a cocked brunette eyebrow, her appled cheeks flustered red with exhaustion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d Alice purred enthusiastically, \u201cShe does my job pretty great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she\u2026 <i>fitting in?</i>\u201d Jenna asked pointedly, hoping that Alice could get it through her fat-soaked noggin to catch the meaning of her question. Her arm wings wiggled a bit with the motion required to pleasure Alice\u2019s clit at such a size<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, she\u2019s\u2026\u201d Alice made a husky, hedonistic purr as she inched toward\u2019s Jenna\u2019s fingers, \u201cShe\u2019s getting fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jenna\u2019s wide nostrils flared instinctively, \u201cHow fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as big as me.\u201d Alice made her belly dance slowly, heavily between her hands. Hundreds of pounds of subcutaneous fat jiggled and swayed with Alice\u2019s belabored motions, bounding and bouncing up and down in a slow hypnotic routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the new standard\u2014not as big as Alice. Jenna had idly (sometimes much more fervently) pictured her office at the same size as her personal squeezeball. It was such an appealing thought\u2014her entire staff, barely big enough to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought alone was enough to get her hot\u2014hotter than even mandhandling the one person in the office who could outweigh her could rile her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should invite them out.\u201d Jenna purred<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Alice asked vapidly, still high on her own stupendous girth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow them what real fat girls are like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>yeah</i>.\u201d Alice bucked at the thought of Jenna and her compared to those twigs, \u201cI\u2019d like that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice\u2019s rampant, wildly indulgent fantasies slowly took hold, Jenna formulated a plan. She\u2019d loved what she\u2019d made of Alice. But there was so much more\u2026 so many more possibilities to be had within her office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might mean peeling herself away from her personal project, but Jenna needed a challenge. Something new, something fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa, Courtney, and even Maria had been dancing on the tip of her tongue since practically day one! And now that alice was the ultimate bad influence, all Jenna needed to do was to unleash her unto the unwitting populace of pudgy computer jockies! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet you would.\" Jenna grunted as she wriggled herself towards Alice's wide-spread thighs, \"I'll show you a few other things you might like...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melissa was calmly eating her fourth donut of the morning in the breakroom. Normally she'd be on her fifth by now, but she had slowed down recently - despite Alice's initial efforts and \"gifts.\" One day, Alice even brought an extra pizza and tried to hand it to Melissa. \"Hey, Mel, I got you one!\" Every inch of Melissa's already considerable body wanted the pizza - but her rational mind saw the woman holding it. \"Nah, I'm good.\" Not that Melissa was on a diet - she was still crawling along the path to becoming a larger woman. Her shirt was already those few centimeters closer to the buttons one day giving up their fight, but they held the line while Melissa was slowing down. Alice insisted, \"Come on Mel, if you don't eat it, I will.\" Melissa rolled her eyes. \"I'm sure you will anyway, Al.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa for a moment checked herself - she wasn't sure that, in good conscience, she could try to speed along Alice's already meteoric gain. Within the past week she'd already <i>rounded</i> up to around 550 - Melissa was not the health freak of the office, but she genuinely worried about Alice's health.  The ballooning blonde could barely walk, and she was rubbing at her chest after any such physical exertion. Melissa had to find someone else to offload the greasy, delicious, fattening food on. \"Uh, Maria, eat up.\" Before any reply, Alice had already laid the box at Maria's place. The bottom-heavy redhead's face gawked at having the whole pizza to herself - but to Alice, there was an unmistakable desire in her eyes. Predictably, the woman spoke a hearty \"Uh... Thank ya's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interaction was quite informative for Alice. For a while she was a little down-hearted that she couldn't speed Melissa's gain - yet - but she had found herself a more than willing target! She began to conspire with Jenna on the subject during a saucy office meeting over a buffet of fast-food. \"So, that Maria girl... she can definitely start fitting in around here. I tried to give a pizza to Mel, but I guess I've been such a bad little piggy that she didn't want it...\" Jenna chuckled and stroked Alice's great, thick double-chin that nearly covered the collar of her shirt, \"It must be because she doesn't want to get as fat as you... You've been blimping up pretty big, lately... Seems like Maria must want to do the same as you. We can both help her plump up.\" Alice looked down with a still somewhat-threatened look. \"And you swear you won't try to make her bigger than me?\" Jenna chuckled and slid closer to Alice, their gargantuan guts rubbing up against each other. For the moment, it seemed as though Alice's gut had outpaced Jenna's, by barely half an inch. \"I don't think I could, piggy.\" Alice's gut jumped as she steeled herself against a buck, she licked her lips. \"Yeah, you're right... I don't think you could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the weeks following, though Melissa was turning a colder shoulder to Alice, Maria was warming quite nicely. The mounds of food didn't hurt their friendship, but they did a toll on Maria's hips. Maria grew horizontally by a fair margin, a good couple inches by Alice's reckoning, a sign of some big gains. Melissa had grown barely an inch around her gut, but Alice continued fattening herself as ever. Another good few five pounds came through as her skyrocketing gains had not yet totally ended. Maria still had her doubts, though - one day as Alice tried to offer her a bear claw, she began to wave her hand, \"Oh, nah, I'm good. I had a kinda big breakfast - too big.\" Alice shook her head, \"Now, now, you do a lot of work. Take this for later, if not now.\" Maria sheepishly took it. \"Thank you.\" It was obvious that beside her hips, Maria had stowed a piece of her gains in her belly - her shirt, tightening a bit already from the baseline that gordge put on everyone, tightened further. The deep ripples curving up towards her comparatively flat chest fled from the tight center of her blouses. Alice noted her good work as Maria threw away the bear claw's open and empty wrapper barely a few minutes later. If Maria had any willpower, it was in hiding now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria and Melissa chatted in the Breakroom as this went on, Melissa talking to Victoria. \"Vic, we'll have to do something to help Alice.\" Victoria's tan face warped to a quizzical look. \"Whaddaya' mean?\" Melissa sighed - Victoria's ditzy nature annoyed her at times, especially on serious topics like this. \"She's getting way too fat. She can barely walk anymore, and anytime she does, she looks like she's about to keel over. I don't know where it came from, but we've gotta help her out.\" Victoria shrugged. \"I guess she's gettin' fat, yeah. But she's always been big.\" Melissa shook her head, \"Never like this. She used to control herself - but now she eats everything. And she must be living out of a fast food place if she's getting this big otherwise.\" Victoria puzzled for a moment. Melissa was never this seemingly puritan about food - and something genuinely must have changed to bring this on. \"Yeah, I guess,\" the tan woman sighed. \"But how do we do that?\" Melissa herself puzzled for a moment. This would take some planning - but she was dedicated to getting Alice back from the precipice.  \"Well, we definitely can't try an intervention. It's pointless unless we know what's hitting her so hard.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice and Mel had been friends ever since they\u2019d started working together. And in the time that it had taken Alice to blow up into a three-hundred pounds chunker (back when that seemed like such a big number) Mel liked to think that she had gotten to know her friend pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever she started going crazy with her diet, one way or the other, Mel always started at the top of her neurosis list with her sister, Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even talked to Alice in a month.\u201d Stephanie said into the earpiece in an exasperated tone of voice, \u201cEver since she started this new relationship of hers, I barely get a word in edgewise from her! You know, I try to be a good sister, and I <i>try</i> to be a good influence on her, but all that woman does is\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>click!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa hung up the office phone and put it back on the receiver. Turning in the signature irritation that followed a conversation with Alice\u2019s annoying skinny bitch sister to the snacking Victoria, the belly-heavy brunette looked every bit like she needed a smoke. For the first time in years, a cigarette sounded <i>great</i> over another donut. Or five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, looks like we\u2019ve found one piece of the puzzle.\u201d Melissa said, steepling her fingers over her gut as it poured between her chunky legs, \u201cIt seems like Alice has a relationship that she\u2019s never told any of us about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ew</i>.\u201d Vicky\u2019s meaty round face scrunched in distaste, double chin bunching as she imagined Alice\u2019s almost six-hundred-pound self struggling to get naked, \u201cLike, who would want any of <i>that</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria\u2019s gains had been just as pronounced as Alice\u2019s had been. In the time it had taken for Jenna\u2019s affection to become soley squared on Alice, her favoritism had still run its course on the already bodacious secretary. Given that her job was mostly hands-off and Jenna kept her spoiled with plenty of goodies throughout the day, she was still packing it on at quite a respectable weight. Even if she tended towards denial (in an office of women who weighed as much as livestock, the term \u201coffice skinny\u201d comes to mind) there was no denying that Victoria was becoming increasingly rotund as she bulged out of her suits, and her neck slowly began to disappear under the steadily lowering crest of her double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like why wouldn\u2019t she <i>tell us</i>?\u201d Melissa frowned tightly, \u201cShe\u2019s been acting so weird lately\u2026 but we\u2019re best friends! I tell her every time I get laid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Double</i> ew.\u201d Vicky\u2019s expression curled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa rolled her eyes. Honestly, she hadn\u2019t had to have that conversation with Alice in quite a while. At least a hundred pounds or so ago. But still, the point remained. It was unlike her to keep secrets from anyone\u2014especially Melissa. Or Courtney for that matter. Alice was always so friendly with everyone in the office, you would have thought that <i>someone</i> would have mentioned that she had a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa knew first-hand that Alice hadn\u2019t had sex since she\u2019d officially graduated into \u201cfat\u201d territory some years ago\u2014right after her last relationship went under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith <i>that</i> much buildup, you would have thought the whole <i>world</i> would have known if Alice was in a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she\u2019s in a relationship, and she doesn\u2019t want anyone to know\u2026\u201d Melissa stroked her chins as they bulged over the collar of her blouse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, she doesn\u2019t want <i>us</i> to know.\u201d Vicky corrected breathlessly after a particularly big swallow of her donut, \u201cShe told her sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s <i>right</i>\u2014she doesn\u2019t want any of <i>us</i> to know.\u201d Melissa repeated, leaning forward in her chair with a mechanic squeak as the hydraulics battled against her weight, \u201cBut why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe because you fucking grill her about every time she gets laid.\u201d Vicky wretched again, burping a little before leaning forward for another snack, \u201cAre we gonna be done soon? Lunch is almost overrrrr\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck\u2026 you\u2019re right.\u201d Melissa curled a nostril distastefully as she checked her phone, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get Burger King. You want some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod yes, I\u2019m starved.\u201d Vicky practically jumped out of the office chair, giving Melissa a good look at her Office Ass as she wiggle-waddled away\u2026</span></div></div>",

Or, more applicably, a ton of Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been big news when Alice said she was going back to her apartment on Extra Long Lunch Friday. It was a legendary time among Gordge\u2019s gluttonous gals that only came around twice a fiscal year\u2014a chance to stuff themselves for an extra two hours and to get paid for it! They all looked forward to it every year, they never missed it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Alice said that she was going to <i>skip</i> it, everyone was more than a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that skipping a meal wouldn\u2019t have done that woman some good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d Melissa said in a hushed voice, \u201cDid you know this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at my face\u2014tell me I knew this.\u201d Courtney said in a shocked voice, \u201cI mean Alice is\u2026 <i>Alice!</i> I have a hard time believing she even <i>has</i> sexual thoughts\u2026 you know, that aren\u2019t about food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe logistics just weren\u2019t there. Everyone knew Alice\u2019s business\u2014not because Alice was a particurly open book (which she was, but not by her own merit) but because everyone loved to shove their noses into her business. If <i>Courtney</i> didn\u2019t know\u2026 then nobody knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why she\u2019s been getting so\u2026\u201d Courtney grimaced, \u201cFat lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, comfort weight is a thing\u2026\u201d Melissa shrugged her meaty shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but Mel, Alice is\u2026\u201d Courtney took a long sigh\u2014she was getting to be mighty huge these days too, and it felt pretty shitty to talk about Alice like this\u2014\u201c\u2026I mean, she can barely get out of her car anymore, Mel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s dating someone who\u2019s\u2026 <i>into</i> that?\u201d Mel suggested, \u201cYou remember when she was dating Dan, she started getting into sports?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd John, the pastry chef.\u201d Courtney counted on her stumpy sausage finger, \u201cThat\u2019s when she started to pack it on in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s naif, love-hungry attitude towards relationships had always spelled out disaster. It was one of the main reasons she could never keep down a relationship! The poor thing had no willpower either, and she was so easily impressionable. If she <i>really</i> liked someone, well\u2026 her friends had been her biggest encouragers and bad influences way back when, and helped \u201cpork up the new girl\u201d until she was a good ol\u2019 Gordge girl at heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Courtney couldn\u2019t convince themselves otherwise that Alice had gone and gotten so fat for a new boyfriend\u2014who could make her feel wanted in an entirely new and visceral way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna call in sick.\u201d Jenna panted hoarsely as she came up for air, \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna come back to work after lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice moaned in response as the vibrator went to town on her fat clit. Jenna kneaded and squeezed her biscuit dough body between plump nubby fingers, squeezing a finger in the space leftover in the nape of Alice\u2019s lips left under their special wand. She kissed her girlfriend\u2019s inner thigh, running her fat little potato feet up and down Alice\u2019s wobbling leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s apartment had been trashed in the span of their lunch together\u2014even after Jenna had started paying for a maid to help Alice out around the house, all it would take was one food and sex fueled frenzy to get her bedroom wrecked again. Fast food containers and jugs and bottles and wrappers and what have you were strewn about the room carelessly; their contents split (about 30:70) between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice struggled to breathe\u2014her throaty whale song was her bellowing in pain and pleasure as her stomach threatened to burst underneath the pressure that Jenna had loaded into it over the past three consecutive nights. Even Alice\u2019s digestive system couldn\u2019t keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuckfuckfuckokayokay\u201d Alice panted, her face squinched tight as she felt another orgasm coming, \u201cSofuckingfullbaby\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking full.\u201d Jenna marveled at Alice\u2019s mountainous middle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m <i>so</i> full.\u201d Alice parroted with a manic enthusiasm, wheezing, \u201cSo fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re <i>sooo</i> fat.\u201d Jenna purred as she ran a hand up Alice\u2019s taut stomach as its doming shape collapsed under the heavy weight of its surrounding fat, \u201cAnd after your little half day you\u2019re gonna eat <i>all</i> weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll weekend.\u201d Alice panted, \u201cJust eat and eat and eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s my fatty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I-I-I\u2019m your f-f-fatty</i>~\u201d Alice bit her fat pink tongue as lolled out during a particularly big bucking orgasm. Her beady blue eyes rolling into the back of her head as she climaxed, her whole body shivering and quivering in bovine bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna pushed her crotch against one of Alice\u2019s saddlebag thigh rolls, leaving it slick. She bit into one of Alice\u2019s saucer nipples and watched her the fattest woman in her office squirm underneath her own weight as it pinned her down to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a perfect world, they\u2019d all be like this\u2014Melissa, Courtney, Vicky, the lot of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo eager and willing to fatten themselves up. So eager to be touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had spend plenty of nights thinking about the possibilities. Not necessarily an \u201cinstead of Alice\u201d situation, but the What If\u2019s and the \u201ctoos\u201d tantalized her endlessly. On nights when she couldn\u2019t sleep, her own wand and these particular thoughts would put her right to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps\u2014the ever-powerful id that ruled her mind whispered\u2014these fantasies wouldn\u2019t be so idle, after a little while\u2026</span></div></div>",

Melissa just had to say yes - and she was paying the price. \"I might have to buy <i>another</i> fuckin' blouse,\" she said to Victoria. The tan Italiana had also packed a few pounds on, but ditzy as ever, she nodded and spoke, \"Honestly, yeah, you've been gettin' pretty fat again.\" She clicked her tongue - a mildly annoying habit of hers after she had \"spilled the tea.\"  They waddled out and sat in Melissa's rather large car that still managed to squeeze in the blubbery woman - the two were secluded after clocking out and could talk in peace. \"So, let's think about where we've gotten so far.\" Victoria nodded, \"Mm-hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tan woman took out a notebook and read out loud. \"So, she's put on like 100 pounds over this past year, and before this, she put on, like, 150 over the past 5-7.\" Melissa nodded. \"And she's gotten into a relationship. That's way too much for comfort weight. So something weird is going on - look, I found this.\" Melissa showed Victoria an Encyclopedia Brittanica entry on her phone. Victoria shook her head, \"Read it in english - I can't read that academic mumbo-jumbo.\" Melissa sighed and recited dryly - \"Feederism - The derivation of sexual pleasure from feeding a romantic partner large quantities of food. Can also be associated with a desire to see said partner gain weight. More extreme forms take the form of desiring the partner to become immobile, or suffer health problems as a result of their obesity.\" Victoria's mouth gaped open. \"Oh my gawwwwwd!

Must be nice.</i> \"So that's what's going on. She's in a relationship with a feeder - otherwise, I don't think she'd literally gorge herself to the point where she doesn't do any work.\" Victoria nodded and spoke up, \"And on that second part, that Maria chick - she showed up way too conveniently for that to be a coinkydink.

Her black laborador padded into the room and the blonde-haired, thin sister of Alice scratched behind its ears. \"Aww, yess, mama just got done working out.\" And such exercise was a necessity - if the fate of her sister was to be avoided. Alice had become a whispering-stock back home, and the talk of gossip among the circle of women who chose to stay in her hometown of Ginswood. The high school cheerleader blown up far past a slight padding that age often brought them into the realm of morbid obesity. \"I knew that she was gonna blow up like a house as soon as she was off the squad,\" Steph had said to an old classmate who she still hung with, \"She'd eat for supper on the weekend two whole calzones, while the rest of us would share off of one pizza.\" She suddenly got another call - Melissa, her phone told her. <i>Oh, that fat sow friend of Alice's,</i> she thought. She picked up the phone and put on her fake, friendly face. \"Heyyy, Melissa, is it?\" Melissa nodded and spoke up, \"Uh, yeah. Hi, How are you doing?\" Stephanie spoke, \"Oh, good, just got off the elliptical. How about you?\"  Melissa chuckled, \"Uh, not on an elliptical.\" Stephanie chuckled and spoke, \"Oh, yeah, yeah. You really should try it - it makes you so happy, and healthy-\" She went on, but Melissa pulled on a cigarette. She hated that she had to do this, but it was a step closer to getting her friend back. Eventually, Stephanie got back around to a topic she cared about - \"I don't know if Alice and her new girlfriend have even SEEN an elliptical.\" It was such a shocker that Melissa almost dropped the cigarette out of her mouth. Melissa spoke up, \"Yeah - has she told you who it is?\"  Stephanie shook her head and spoke through the phone, \"Uh-uh - not a piece. Whoever it is, they must be some degenerate. Making a woman fatten up like that, they must be some freak. It's unnatural, I've seen the facebook pictures that your company has tagged her in, and my GAWD, she's blowing up into a blimp! She must be eating everything in sight, I'd hate to have my lunch in that fridge of yours!\" Melissa took another pull on the cigarette, making it glow in the darkness and exhaling the smoke through her lips. As much as she wanted to, she tried not to hang up - Stephanie might let something slip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Melissa felt at home with this kind of toxic gossip - it is that dark part of a person that revels in something so perverse as ripping someone apart without the danger of confrontation that rests even within the saints of the world. She couldn't help but build a rapport. \"Yeah, you must know I'm a big woman myself, and seeing how bloated Alice has been getting recently, it's got ME cutting back - as much as I really can in this office, anyways.\" Stephanie hurmed, then spoke, \"Yeahh, the last time I saw her, she was pretty big, but I don't know if she'll bother to come home for thanksgiving this year - she'll probably have another meeting buffet that she tells me about. That's a bad influence, that is -  uncontrolled eating, whenever you want - it's not good for you.\" Melissa started to take another pull, but then she realized. The meeting had always had a LOT of snacks, sure, but NEVER a buffet. \"Huh - a buffet, you say? Must be some meeting, they usually just offer a few snacks at our meetings.\" Stephanie retorted, \"Oh, Alice has told me that she blames \"Those dang mandatory meetings and the catered buffets.\" So what, only she gets them?\" Melissa shrugged. \"Uh, must be - hey, I've got to go, I've got to get home - I've got friends waiting for me there.\" Click, the phone call ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell? So that makes a lot more sense - not only was someone in the higher command responsible for this, but they were able to fatten Alice specifically at work! It made so much sense now - the only issue was finding out who was scheduling these meetings. The girls would bounce back and forth sometimes - interdepartmental meetings, talking to region managers, holding their own meetings - she had to find an accomplice where it counted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Maria sat eating her third cream cheese croissant of the day, she couldn't help but think <i>God, this office rocks!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead had been putting on weight nearly every week at the office. Her diet barely lasted a day in Jenna's realm, where fattening foods seemed to rain from the sky. Her naturally piggish tendencies were not just encouraged, but especially recently, seemed to be given a jetpack and pointed skyward. As a case in point, Jenna appeared shortly after, speaking up, \"Hey, Mary, heads up!\" Maria looked up and just in time managed to clumsily catch a party-sized bag of chips, \"Aw, thanks, Jen!\" Maria, being a huge fan of any form of Carbohydrate, ripped the bag open, not minding the fact that she was already consuming a cream cheese croissant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combined feeding of Jenna and her own piggish desires had done considerable damage to Maria's waistline and hips, causing her to widen and her gut to grow outward. Her old white blouse had gone to the closet where all of Maria's clothes went that, in her own mind, <i>are gonna fit me fine after I just get done treating myself for a bit, I'll get back on my diet eventually.</i> Of course, Alice, Jenna, and Melissa all had such a closet - and none of them had lost any weight in a long time. In addition, she had effectively abandoned pants at work - none of them could button, but Maria was not panicking over these gains. Now she wore a teal blouse and a white skirt - a size up and designed to hide Maria's ever-fattening legs and hips. A few days ago this upsizing fit just fine, but Maria was conveniently ignoring the fact that it was starting to get fairly tight nearly any time she stuffed herself. It was not a coincidence that this described most of her time at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough encouraged to gluttony, Maria was still just as pleased to work both for her own workload and Alice's. The fattening blonde, at this point, had begun to abandon the pretense of working - she clocked in and out, and that was the extent of her exhausting workload - the rest of her \"work\" was nothing but eating nearly everything that Jenna brought her - in addition to going to Jenna's \"meetings.\" She breathlessly plodded over to Maria and spoke up, \"Hey, Maria, I'm going for another meeting.\" Maria scarcely had to know who the meeting was with - it was with Jenna, and Maria knew that these meetings were little more than disguises for Jenna feeding Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria continued on through her workday - log Alice's meeting with Jenna, log Alice getting back just before lunch,  network a bit - before she knew it, her stomach was growling for its lunch, not happy with its already substantial snack. Before Maria could get up, Melissa appeared in her office. Victoria wasn't the only one noticing Melissa's gains, and Maria couldn't help but think, <i>God, Mel is putting some on too. Good to know I'm not alone.</i> \"Hey, Mel, Whassup?\" Melissa spoke up, \"Oh, I was just grabbing some lunch to bring back - I figured you'd love some of this.\" She put down a container from Maggio's which smelled wonderfully of Alfredo. Maria moaned in delight, speaking, \"Awh, thank ya's, I was wantin' some! Thank ya's!\" Melissa continued this process - slowly feeding up Maria over the next few days, dropping goodwill gifts by. Maria began gaining massively as a result - in the span of that week, she had put four inches on her hips, and two inches on her gut - Melissa began to feel a pang of guilt for Maria's ballooning gains, but this was all for the good of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Maria could put up with the gains, and Melissa managed to get closer to her, she'd be able to save the office from immobility. If not, she'd sacrifice precious time - time that added pounds to Melissa's waist, time that made Alice more an increasingly obese, unhealthy blob. At the same time though, Jenna was eager to bring Maria to her own side, a topic she broached to Alice over a \"meeting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe, you been seeing that redhead balloon up?\" Alice nodded, \"Yeah, Maria's been a godsend for my gains - I've been getting fucking huge now.\" Alice was dead on the money - her mass had to be coming up towards 600, and her mass was becoming indescribably huge - her gut was overlapping her knees, something neither Courtney or Jenna had achieved yet, and Jenna rubbed her thighs at this fact. \"Yeah...She has, babe.. You're fatter than me now, for sure.\" Alice was ecstatic at this - \"You really think so?\" She was so happy to be larger than Jenna! Not that she had a gaining rivalry with her boss - but it had been a goal of hers for a while now to overtake the boss in size. \"Yeah,\" said Jenna, \"You've been a good piggy, a real good piggy.\" Alice certainly acted the part - she now was no longer content with thirds - going on to fourth plates at these in-house buffet lunches. Jenna fondled Alice's growing, multiplying rolls - the woman looked like an exploded silo of biscuit dough, her folds leaking out throughout her sides, her great gut like a mountainside of fat rolling down to her knees. Alice moaned erotically at Jenna's touch. The great, fat, blonde leaned back - her gut sloshed back and forth before settling over her vagina, and her fat thighs jiggled freely and spoke, \"Feed me, Jenny, Feed me and fuck me...\" Jenna obliged Alice of both requests - feeding the great baleen of a woman. Pleasuring the wall of fat that was Alice Gellar was beginning to be harder at this stage, especially if feeding was involved. \"Piggy,\" commanded Jenna, \"Hold up your fat gut so I can fuck you.\" Alice did as Jenna commanded, and Jenna discovered how immensely wet Alice was with her own fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that Alice was obviously larger than Jenna was becoming a do-or-die moment for Melissa. Time was of the essence, and the days had gone by - she determined to bring the subject up to Maria at her usual lunch delivery. The burgeoning redhead was happy to see Melissa's arrival, but Melissa held back the food. \"Well, c'mon, what's holdin' ya's,\" asked Maria. \"Uh, just this one thing. You've noticed Alice has been getting way too big recently, right?\" Maria nodded, \"Yeahhh, I've been gettin' kinda' uncomfortable with it - I must not be alone.\" Melissa nodded and spoke, \"Well, I've been doing some detective work, and we could help her if we know who she's meeting with. Do ya' happen to know who she meets with all the time, around lunch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria thought for a moment and spoke,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Lunchtime? Oh, that's her usual time with Jenna.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria thought little of telling Mel the truth - she didn't know about half of the things Melissa had uncovered. She just thought Alice was getting particularly big - uncomfortably big. She was the last woman to judge anyone else's weight - but she had limits, and the speed at which Alice was gaining put Maria off. She couldn't see why Melissa's face grew so shocked, so stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, for Melissa, it was the final piece in the puzzle that was Alice's skyrocketing weight. Of course it was Jenna! That added a completely different undertone to everything that had happened since her coming to power - that was why she increased their access to donuts, that was why she gave interns the job of hauling deliveries up to them, that explained why she had taken the culture of fattening up to eleven! It was to feed her own fetish! It was so she could have a first-hand view of her fetish objects - and she had gotten so close to Alice that she had turned her worktime into a time of fetishized hedonism! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a TON, Mary. Oh my god. That explains a lot.\" Mary quizzically took the bribe of food from Melissa. \"Explains what?\" Melissa sighed and spoke, realizing now what had been done to her friend. \"Jenna's into feeding - she likes fattening people up, she gets off on it. And the rumors have been floating around that Alice has gotten into a new relationship.\" Maria's eyes blew up in size - \"Nooo.. Nooo! What!?\" She was repulsed by the idea - fat was a happy little accident, but this fetishized it! She thought it was normal to get pretty fat, even Melissa's size, just by overeating - but purposeful stuffing crossed a line for her! \"That's crazy, Jenna can't do that!\" Melissa nodded her head. \"Yeah, she can't, it's literally against company policy basically anywhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\"  \"We submit a formal complaint to HR, get Jenna replaced, and try to get Al back. We get promoted for informing on her, and we get Alice back to a more normal size.\" Of course, Melissa didn't mean to make Alice <i>skinny</i> again - that was absurd, and would never hold. She meant to get Alice back in the ballpark of the 300's - back to herself, the Alice that seemed comparatively tiny by comparison, the Alice that Melissa needed to balance herself, the Alice that wasn't some suit's sex toy. The genuine and organic Al that she missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next act took some courage - Melissa walked over towards  HR, a difficult deviation to make from the path to her office. She had to go to the elevator, a trek for the blimp of a woman, then go down a floor - walk to the compliants desk,and take a form. All of this was done with her head over her shoulder. She was afraid what would happen to her if Jenna caught her here. The obese boss rarely, if ever, left her desk or the meeting room to feed herself or Alice, but Melissa had the paranoia only someone on this kind of a whistleblowing mission could have. She couldn't just go back to her desk with this, though - she needed a cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and Alice saw Melissa waddling back to her desk with a box smelling of peanut sauce. \"Mmm, Mel, ordering from Zheng's?\" The fat Brunette smiled and nodded, \"Yup!\" The blonde and the redhead were clueless about the paper Melissa had hidden behind the bag which she shuffled to the side. She filled it out while she stuffed her face with the order of shrimp noodles - a girl has to keep her figure, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey to deposit the form was just as fraught with peril. As if to make Melissa's paranoia worse, she saw the form of Jenna waddling towards her. Was she going to catch her? Was this going to be it for her? She thought of other places to work after Jenna fired her, which she had to after seeing her with the form -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the rest of the pack waddled out - save for Alice and Jenna, who waddled to the meeting room with everyone's backs turned, or so they thought. The bombshell that the report would unleash would set the office well and truly on fire.</span></div></div>",

She had figured that others were talking about her and Alice, but she thought that with how accommodating she had been, heads would be turned. Reprimands, notifications of inquiry, and worst of them all, the corporate investigators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese suits were about as fat as you'd expect one from Gordge to be, but they had the presence in a room of an inquisitor for a guilty woman like Jenna. The endless questions were painfully repetitive and each one went worse for her than the last. It didn't help that she lied through her teeth every time she gave an answer, \"No, I did not have sexual relations with Alice Gellar. I did not have private sexual encounters on corporate property.\" Every little thing she kept denying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they kept finding proof. Reciepts, booked meeting rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in her chair as the delegation of fat suit-wearing men and women wobbled in - a bald Asian man, as round as he was tall - a bearded and bespectacled White man with a thinning hairline who was just somewhat smaller, and a black woman who was somewhere 30 pounds south of Melissa. These three had been in and out of her office, and they sat down in a line in front of Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory, Tim, Masha. What can I help you with today,\" asked Jenna with barely masked contempt. The Asian man spoke up in a smooth baritone voice, raising his head as he did so and shaking his neck roll, \"We're here to get some answers.\" The bearded man pulled something from a briefcase. A folder. He opened it and began speaking in a mid-ranged voice with a southern twang, \"These images were recov'rd from Room 302,\" he said, pushing over an image. It was a chair under a blacklight. Some fluid stains were present, smudged - with a rag-pattern. \"Care to explain what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the fuck did they find that? Jenna cleaned that chair! She cleaned it rigorously! She was dumbfounded for a moment - \"Uh.. That's..\" The moment hung like death in the room - a silence she tried to break in her throat, but there was some wall stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind spoke out in thought, <i>They've got me and I can't bullshit my way out of this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's vaginal discharge,\" spoke Masha in a lawyerly tone, \"And it matches DNA samples from both you and miss Gellar.\" Jenna spoke up in fury and fire, \"Okay, I did it. I fed her and fucked her for a year or two, she was my employee, I was her boss. Enough of this shit, what's going to happen now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory withdrew from his jacket pocket a pink letter. \"You are hereby dismissed from Gordge Enterprises Incorporated, effective tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, the news exploded like a nuclear shockwave. Everyone talked, \"Holy shit, that's why she ordered the free donuts,\" was the general line. One fat mid-level worker held herself defensively in a break-room, \"She used us as sex objects... What the fuck, what kind of a sick bitch...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a whole event at five - everyone held back to watch Jenna waddle out. She huffed and puffed past a gauntlet of people, the normally proud strut she displayed that jiggled her massive legs was gone and replaced by a defeated waddle, her thighs glued together in their slow march out of Gordge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and looked at the glass tower. Gordge was now behind her, and her career here had ended in disgrace. Did she regret it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartly. She only regretted that she got caught. She didn't regret how fat she had made everyone, not one bit. Alice had blown up to gargantuan proportions - fatter than her by the end of their time together. But now she didn't know what would become of the blubbery whale of a woman, or herself.<br>\r\n****<br>\r\nAlice was shocked also - shocked and ashamed. She had finally discovered a new side of herself! She had gone beyond accepting her size and had gotten to loving its every growth, every expansion - but now the object of her love was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quite morose in the days following Jenna's firing - downcast, her eyes turned down. Melissa, to her credit, was always a shoulder for her to cry on. \"Girl, it'll be alright... Jenna was using you for her own kicks, she used all of us.\" Alice sobbed, catching her words in her throat for a moment - speaking up through a choked sob, \"Y-You think she was? She was using me? Was she?\" Alice wasn't sure that was true - was she being used?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she fucking up her body for someone who wasn't even that into her? No, there's no way that could be true. She loved getting fatter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she thought she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aftermath was quite obvious - the provided donuts began to dry up. \"What the fuck, there's like, no donuts in here,\" complained Alice that morning at the mere two boxes that were present. Melissa spoke up, \"Well, things change, I guess. Sometimes for the better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice powered through her workload as best as she could, but her stomach was used to such a constant stream of food! She needed it like a drug, she got up and waddled breathlessly to Melissa's office, and spoke through sweat and exhaustion, \"D'ya got anysnacks for m',\" she asked, Melissa shook her head, \"No, sorry, I don't have any to spare, girl.\" Alice grunted in frustration. Her stomach was growling at her, so much... As lunch rolled around, her thoughuts turned to Tommy's Pit, the local Barbecue Buffet with all the good southern food helpings - fried chicken, pulled pork, decadent desserts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she thought of the possibility that Jenna had just used her. Part of breaking with that was pulling back on her appetite - coming back to reality. She was becoming more conscious of just how huge she had gotten, and she was beginning to regain her shame in the days following. She could barely move, she could barely fit through many doors - she knew in her returning rational mind that she ought to pull back to her old eating habits, before Jenna got involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the latter only came to mind as she walked through the great, wide doors of the buffet. She chastised herself, <i>I'm so addicted to food! I can't stop eating!\"</i> She went up and sated her hunger. Fried chicken,  macaroni and cheese, fried potatoes, it was all so good! It all tasted so great!  But her mind couldn't stop chastising her, her mind was at war with itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got back to the office, she examined herself. She had gone far beyond letting herself go - where her old self was laid somewhere out of reach of her great, flabby hands - she couldn't reach it just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after, she came to the office with a bowl of chicken caesar salad. Vicky couldn't help but remark on it, \"Ooh, so healthy today, Al!\" Alice nodded proudly, \"Yep. I'm gonna do it - I'm gonna shed some weight. At least get back to 300.\" But as the workday rolled past, she couldn't shake the memory of tastes - tastes she had taken for granted. Chocolate. Creamy, sugary treats... pasta... all now forbidden and out of reach. She had resolved to cook more at home, and had done so for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut lunch was the hardest. The chicken wasn't even fried - it was bland, grilled chicken. It was certainly different from what had become so blase, and that made it bearable - but it was hard to forget how it compared to the fried chicken at the buffet. The fried chicken that Jenna used to bring in. It was so boring in comparison!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It didn't help that she was practically the only one on such a strict diet. A few of the other girls were dabbling in eating less - Maria had a bean fajita for lunch with a meager helping of tortilla chips. \"Yeah, Jenna was so bad for my waist. I'm gonna try to drop some of these pounds she gave me.\" Victoria commiserated with her over her hamburger steak with mashed potatoes, \"Mhm, same, girlfriend. Like, I can barely move, and it's so annoying.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Courtney made no such attempts to shed weight. They seemed to be not moving up into new weight classes like Jenna tried to push them to, but their gains were still coming, slowly but steadily. Melissa's clothes didn't require the constant tailoring they used to, but they weren't getting any looser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had plenty of the same issues - she had begun to barely fit in her car anymore. Had Jenna stayed for a few more months, it would have been inevitably that Alice would have been homebound. Some part of Alice's mind tried to paint her a rosy picture of it - being cosy at home instead of force-feeding herself the same chicken salad for lunch, every single day. It was hard to eject this thought, to remind herself that, in fact, she would have eaten herself to immobility at that point. Even if that part of her brain romanticized the act of getting fatter, it still shuddered at a complete loss of mobility. Alice was, after all, still a human being. Her rejection of raw sexual desire gave her some determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut God Almighty, that determination was fading in the face of how unimaginative she was with her diet-dishes. That friday, she stared resentfully into her half-full chicken salad. She could NOT finish it. Not for fullness, but for hate of this dish. She never wanted to touch a chicken salad again. She felt a padded, fatty hand on her shoulder. Looking up, it was Melissa. She asked with a donut in hand, \"Having issues with that diet, girl?\" Alice sighed and nodded, cradling her head in her hands. \"How the hell can people do this? I can't eat this monotonous shit day in, day out! It's literally always the same and I hate it. I hate it so much.\" Melissa rubbed her shoulder and bit into the donut. She handed one to Alice, and spoke up. \"You know, you CAN eat other shtuff beshides..\" She took a moment to gulp down her donut, \"chicken salad on a diet, right? As long as it fits in your budget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice scrambled for the donut, eating it ravenously. \"Mhm... Mh... Mh....\" she moaned while consuming it. Melissa rubbed her shoulder. The visceral touch while eating - it was too familiar of Jenna, and Alice hadn't completely bought into the idea that she was being maniuplated. It soothed her. She had to remind herself that it was, in fact, Melissa rubbing her shoulder and not Jenna, who was about to feed her another whole pizza. \"Thankyou...\" she said breathlessly to the woman. Melissa spoke up, \"No problem. Just don't be like this with food - because you know that if you restrict yourself like this, you'll go right back to eating everything in sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something of a relief, though how Alice would take this remained to be seen. Would this loosening of her strictures make her diet more sustainable, and lead to more long-term loss, or would this open the flood gates to her old habit of overeating?</span></div></div>",

Everyone was super nice and had done a great job of helping her get acquainted to what had at first been a daunting workload. They\u2019d introduced her to the best bars and restaurants in town, and everyone was always so nice about helping her out wherever they could. Victoria was always nice for office gossip, Melissa was so helpful with her \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d in clientele, and Maria had been blatantly transparent about sucking up to Courtney ever since she got put in charge of organizing the mid-morning donut runs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the two women who had been the most adamant about making sure that she\u2019d found her niche in her new workspace had been Ms. Jenna and Alice\u2014the best boss and cubicle mate a girl like Maria could ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Alice was lazy. Maria was no fool\u2014she had caught on some time ago that she was pulling Alice\u2019s weight around the office. But she was always so nice and so sweet, she couldn\u2019t help but do it anyway. And she always had the <i>best</i> snacks\u2014sharing an office with Alice alone was probably what was crossing X\u2019s onto Maria\u2019s pant sizes these days! And Jenna had not only let her skip the intern stage of employment, but was <i>also</i> very vocal about her performance around the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone around the office were Maria\u2019s gal pals, for sure\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something about tattling on two of her favorite co-workers kicking their feet up once or twice a day, every day, after everything that they\u2019d done for her seemed\u2026 <i>wrong</i> somehow. Like, it wouldn\u2019t have made her any better than that Christina girl that everyone bitched about. Lord knows what those women actually <i>did</i> in there for all those hours, but\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was her friend, for sure\u2014and Ms. Jenna had been the best boss she\u2019d ever had! Maria wasn\u2019t about to risk becoming the new Tina by spilling tea on the wrong blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mel\u2014m\u2019afraid I don\u2019t.\u201d She offered weakly, \u201cI, uh\u2026 wish I could be of more help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa\u2019s fat face frowned, creasing at the dimples as her round chin bunched at the collar of her blouse. Reeling her fattening bribe back in, Maria\u2019s regret compounded with a little extra immediate gratification literally drawing away from her, back into the nook of Melissa\u2019s fleshy arm fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh.\u201d she grumbled in defeat, rustling the bag of chips as she tore them open with three expertly trained sausage fingers, \u201cI mean\u2026 are you sure? Because I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out what Alice <i>does</i> around here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria squirmed in her seat as she watched Melissa snack in frustration. The barrel-built brunette shifted awkwardly on her feet as she stood in front of the comparatively svelte yankee, unable to truly appreciate what she had intended to be a bribe as her distress over Alice\u2019s increasing size percolated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026 you and me both.\u201d Maria laughed, little tummy wobbling a little as she stared at Melissa\u2019s chips, \u201cUm\u2026 do you mind if I\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh, sure.\u201d Melissa offered her a handful, \u201cDo you think you could ask around for me? Try and find out who she\u2019s meeting with all the time? I\u2019m just worried about her, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d Maria smiled, lips lightly dusted, \u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t be of more help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd watching her waddle away, Maria almost felt bad about lying to her friend. After all, Melissa was only worried about Alice. They all were, on some level. <i>Most</i> of the gossip around the office was about her these days\u2014just betting on how long she\u2019d be able to keep her job. If rumors were to be believed, she barely spent time with anyone outside of work anymore. Just this mysterious lover that everyone kept insisting that she had. But a woman <i>that</i> big certainly couldn\u2019t have many secrets, could she? If Alice had a boyfriend\u2026 Maria would know. After all, they told each other everything. They shared an office, for Christ\u2019s sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Maria had done the right thing. Maria had no business sharing her secrets\u2014after all, Alice was probably her best friend at Gordge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if all of the extra snacks Alice started sending her way after she\u2019d told her what happened were any indication, Alice felt the same way about her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With almost any morning, the routine, by necessity, must begin with the person getting out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is such a simple physical act to so many people - just turn over, pull themselves up, stand up. It's usually mentally that the act becomes a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo some, the act can be physically challenging due to missing limbs - unfortunate accidents whether congenital or the kind of raw tragedy that alters a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for Alice Gellar on April 22nd, it was because of the two years preceding that morning which were full of endless, hedonistic stuffing. The blonde attempted to roll over, but her first attempt was a failure - she could barely get part over part of one of her thighs - immense things that were as wide as an adult's forearm. She barely succeeded afterwards - an exertion which left her sweating. She barely stopped herself from laying back down because of her exhaustion - having to half-raise herself back up, a difficult task because of her withered abdominal muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Melissa's attempt to stop Alice Gellar's gain by uncovering her feeder, Alice had all the time, and all the resources in the world at her disposal. Nightly feasts that were deliberately aimed at fattening her to absurd and obscene proportions - desserts, greasy foods, junk food at what was technically her job but not her true \"work-\" her gut now was over 90 inches wide, not far away from 100. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it would be this same gut that would lead to the second part - the immense fat entity that was Alice attempted to stand. Her legs were entirely not close to the task. They were far from overtaxed from prior work - their overtaxing was almost absolutely due to her own greed, her own desire - the sheer mass of fat that hung on her huge frame. If it were merely her legs that were fat, however, she'd be able to stand - but the greatest mass of her mass was in her torso, and it kept her down. It was a surreal feeling to Alice - she commanded her body to stand up, to get up from the bed. She felt her body attempting the feat, but it bore no fruit - nothing was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sweated - her heart raced more than it normally did. She was getting this sweaty just from trying to <i>stand up!</i> She got barely a centimeter up - but her muscles could take no more. She collapsed backward onto her bed. She reached over for her phone - another immense effort, she was drenched in sweat and her heart begged for her to stop moving, as she spoke into the phone. Jenna picked up. \"Yeah, babe, what's up?\" \"Uh... Jen... I can't...\" She took a gasp of breath, necessary due to the weight of her fat on her lungs, \"get out of bed... Needy'rhelp....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna could almost orgasm right now. \"That is literally the sexiest thing I have ever heard. I'm on my way.\" Up, as fast as the also immense form of Jenna  would allow - out, to her car, to Alice's home. She used her key, walked in, and saw it. The sweating, breathless, obese form of Alice Gellar, the cheerleader who had officially eaten herself to immobility. \"Ya did it, sweetie,\" said Jenna, \"I knew you had it in you.\" Alice chuckled and jiggled her immense gut. \"Tell the truth, so did I... I just needed your help. But this feels like it's gonna be longer than a few days.. how the hell am I gonna work?\" Jenna giggled, \"Babe, you know I'm literally the boss of this branch, right? I can just give you Home-Work status. \" Alice's eyes grew like beachballs - \"Oh my god. That's incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the office, the rumor spread like wildfire. \"I kinda saw it comin',\" said Victoria, \"She was gettin' so big, I saw her get stuck in a door the other day! Honest ta' god! I had ta' shove 'er out!\" The consequences of Alice's greed for the wider office would make themselves clear within the month.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not long after the revelation that Alice had gotten too fat to come to work, Jenna had made a formal announcement on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had called a formal assembly of the staff, allegedly, so that they could discuss the matter with tact and professionalism. The Gordge crew were tightly knit, and tended to react poorly to being kept out of the loop. Alice had been one of them for so long now that it almost felt like a memorial service, as if she had died instead of being relegated to working from home. In practice, it was even more similar than a group of Alice's closest friends come to discuss her absence\u2014plenty of folks who had worked with her for years shared testimonials about how much they would miss her smiling face and bubbly optimism. In truth, they were already incorrectly remembering their now-homebound friend as who she had been some time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her secret relationship with Jenna urged her towards the darkest parts of herself, her positive attributes had become buried underneath hundreds of extra pounds and a consuming <i>need</i> for more with a matching disregard for others' opinions. She hadn't been the bright, chipper eager beaver of the office that Maria and Courtney had painted her as for quite some time; by the time she'd left and for quite a while before, Alice had been little more than a huffing and puffing fixture in the office with a pitiful workload. She was more like an office lamp that Jenna could feed, fondle, and fuck than the light that her friends had painted her as. In truth, if Jenna hadn't manipulated the paperwork so that half of Maria's workload went under Alice's belt, she would have been fired a long, <i>long</i> time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting was, for all intents and purposes, an excuse to gather everyone up together for an hour or two of the workday for a catered meal in Alice's honor. It wasn't often that Jenna got to see with her own two eyes just how much everyone was sizing up these days for comparison. Any excuse that she could have to get them all squeezed into one room, sagging guts brushing against as they splayed between squat stances and thick legs, her whole staff huffing in puffing as they shifted on their fattened feet...Jenna got the shivers just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo many of those who had been working with her closely, her absence would be felt the greatest. That was what Jenna was counting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn bringing up old memories, leaning hard into the past to drudge up some sympathy, Jenna was hoping to elicit some emotional reactions from her staff. Because when her staff got emotional, they ate. And when they ate, they ate to excess. Giving these fatties an excuse to stuff themselves was one thing, but to really play up the great loss that was having Alice in the workplace and get them all riled up and sentimental was the endgame here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing their wide bodies make the bench seating in the break room creak and groan as it faced maximum capacity, watching their fat bellies bay up to the tables like whales to she shore, it was easily the best Tuesday that Jenna could have ever asked for. She'd stocked the break room with all of Alice's favorite treats (there were still quite a lot in the backlog to get through anyway) and told everyone to eat up. She'd even broken company regulations and brought in some champagne as a show of what a good, personable boss she was, and passed everyone a glass. Placing a tiny, delicate glass between each and every set of chubby fingers that held themselves out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Alice was taking notes\u2014mentally shaping up who would be the \"new Alice\".</span></div></div>",

Teasing Alice about how fat she was getting, and how she'd have so much of an easier time if she just stayed with her, and how nobody would get in trouble if nobody else found out, had slowly whittled down Alice's already pathetic resistance. Somewhere deep inside, the Old Alice was just too much of a goody-two-shoes to shack up with her boss, despite everything <i>else</i> that they had been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was a deep, deep sense of resistance? Like she knew that, once she moved in with Jenna, that there would be no going back. Either in their relationship or everything <i>else</i> that had changed since they started hooking up. The outer Alice, greedy, lazy, and spoiled as she was, was still holding back in respect to the inner Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, once it dawned on her that she was too fat to even get up in the morning, much less take care of herself, Alice finally gave into Jenna's suggestion that they live together. She didn't have much of a choice\u2014there was no way that she could afford an attendant to help her do things like get dressed, keep the house clean, and feed the cat <i>and</i> her rent. Not to mention food, utilities... Alice ate up money almost as quickly as she ate up everything else at her size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with Jenna's salary <i>and</i> her own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, she'd had to give Prissy to Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back to the headboard of her new bed in Jenna's house (no apartment=less stairs), Alice took a moment to marvel at the sheer size that was just <i>all</i> of her. She took up the whole Queen sized bed, by herself! Fuck, she basically <i>was</i> a Queen sized bed. So soft and white\u2014\"and fun to bounce on\" as Jenna would have probably put it. She and Jenna were collectively too big to snuggle together anymore. All there was now was food and sex, food and sex, groping and kissing and...and <i>jiggling</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice used to, in her more lucid moments, have concerns about what her relationship with Jenna was doing to her. How much she was eating, how fat she was getting. How little of her life actually existed <i>outside</i> of her relationship with Jenna. She hadn't been out to the bar or to a restaurant with Mel or Courtney in months\u2014she'd been too fat to get there reliably, and Jenna had always come whistling anyway. She hadn't talked to her sister in... <i>years</i>. Was it <i>years</i> now? As in, plural?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice squeezed the top fold of her stomach, a nervous habit picked up at some point between massive and monolithic. A small, almost child-like expression flashed across her face as a pathetic little squirming sound eeked out from deep inside her. These four walls that she had been moved into were going to be her only... <i>everything</i> for... for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice dared not say it out loud, but the thought was there: \"the rest of my life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a brief moment, Alice managed to regret every bite that had taken her this far. She quickly tacked on \"or until they move me!\" to her monologue, but even still... now she was something so large as that she had to be <i>moved</i>. Like a piece of furniture, or a house. God, she felt like a house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maybe I-I should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, however, the swan song of Alice's inner sense of reason and consequence. As familiar smells of pizza and takeout piqued the interest of her nose, her thoughts of remorse quickly melted away. Her mouth began to water, and her soft pink lips began to smack as Jenna delivered\u2014<i>from her office</i>, the first of what were promised in the note line to be many courses to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as a deep, greedy sound overcame the softness of the Old Alice's whimpering, Alice began to knead her stomach with an unbridled lust for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Door's open!\" she commanded, \"Bring it to the back!\"</span></div></div>",

They might not have liked to think about it, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, Alice is still doing <i>just</i> fine.\" Jenna would laugh and joke, double chins jiggling as she sat behind her desk, \"She's just... hard at work! I get her reports all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that much was a half-truth. About half of Maria's workload still went into Alice's \"done\" pile so that Jenna could keep up the charade that her live-in landwhale actually did her job, but she was going to have to start filing the serial numbers off of someone else's assignments too if she wanted to keep up the charade that Alice was even more productive from home than she was at the office.

Fuck fuck fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout Alice around, Jenna had little to no sexual release anymore. She'd built up years of tolerance to her own sex drive, and all it had taken was getting a big fat sexpot for her to go under like a tin can underneath one of her butt cheeks. Jenna was a woman obsessed with growth, and Alice had been the growing-est girl that had ever waddled through those doors!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was a woman built around a strange mixture of immediate and delayed gratification\u2014she <i>needed</i> to have her special projects.

Maybe her long-dormant social media pages would turn something up, but - not even a block in reply to her messages. Her texts went unanswered. Nobody would collaborate with her digging, and it frustrated her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as a response of fate, Melissa looked up to a bag of fast food on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fat-cradled head turned upward to see the hovering, obese form of Jenna, looming over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you deserved a treat - Alice working from home and all, you guys have been putting in a lot of extra work.\"  Melissa began to shake her head and speak, \"Thanks, Jen, but I've already eaten l-\" Jenna interrupted, \"Consider it a big snack then! A gift from me.\" She took something out and brandished it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a double-double - two patties, with two helpings of bacon. While Alice had her sweet tooth, Melissa had a love for almost anything fattening and greasy - but these took the cake. \"Oh, that's like cheating,\" said Melissa. She broke her taboo and began diving into the meaty sandwich. \"You know I've been tryna avoid theshe.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJen chuckled and spoke up, \"Then all the better for a treat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as such she continued to focus on Melissa. Of course, this wasn't to the exclusion of Maria - she had gotten up to 45 inches on her waist easily, but her face had already begun forming a fold of fat below her chin as her double-chin began turning into a thick flap of fat. However, of course, she continued entertaining a modicum of restraint. She'd eat a bag of high-calorie fast food, but she wouldn't stack dessert on top of that. Usually. She'd grab two donuts, sometimes three, but she'd stop there. Usually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the difference was, Melissa might connect some dots. From what she had heard, she had gotten pretty close before - if she was allowed to exert her energy on things that weren't work or eating, she might uncover the steamy and unprofessional truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that <u>could not</u> happen. So she got moved up on the priority of hogs to fatten. It didn't hurt her case that Melissa was a nice, even gainer of weight. Alice was nice, but it was like any gainer knows at a buffet - you have to get variety. Belly gainers were nice, but Jen wanted a taste of the juicy form that was Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd deliciously glorious it was. Her gut was a good fifteen inches wider than Maria's, but that was far from her only benefit. Her thighs and hips, immense with fat, strained every bottom of every kind that Mel ever wore, but especially pants. Her breasts strained every top that she wore, alongside her belly, and her ankles had merged with her calves to form great, fat cankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was already a very fat woman, but Jenna was intent on turning her into an outright wad of lard, a la Alice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks on, as spring had given way to fall, Alice's new gains were truly becoming revealing. Jenna's old hand-me-downs, about fifty pounds ago rather loose, were now becoming snug. The buttons were still servicing their master, but the assault of the blubber below was not one they could stop. Her face was constantly coated in sweat from being outside at all, let alone walking outside - an old pleasure of hers that she still periodically did every other week, but it had become more and more difficult with her increasing weight that had now surpassed even Melissa and perhaps even Courtney - becoming definitively the second-fattest in the office, only not the fattest by the virtue that she occasionally took a walk and said no to the second box of donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, Alice was controlling herself well, though she still munched on donuts at a bit of a high rate, she was able to occasionally reign it in and eat medium-sized lunches. <i>At least I'm not double-fisting 'em.</i> That was genuinely tempting for Alice to do. But she had begun to feel the physical toll of her increasing weight. Her heart was constantly working overtime to furnish her ever-expanding body with blood. Her lungs were burning from even her simple waddles to and from the break room, and produced a pant from nearly every little action. Her legs were taxed with every movement. It was damned tempting to ignore their cries and eat on, to eat herself into immobility. She could have others take care of her - serve her while she just ate and ate. The voice that used to be so so small was now a constant bark, pleading for her to give into her growing sensual urge.  It sounded suspiciously like Jenna's sometimes - \"Come on - just a few more plates. Break your old record. You're a hot, fat, obese woman...Don't you love the feeling of each new pound?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Alice was not quite at the stage of eating with full abandon. She was still scared of getting to the stage where she'd need help with every little thing - she still treasured at least her partial remaining independence. Immobility was still scary to the half-ton woman, though she came closer to it with her gains. Additionally, having seen Jenna naked, she knew that she was beginning to come up on Jenna's weight level - and that scared her. The massive woman was barely 50 pounds heavier than her - held back mainly by her taxing strolls around to Alice's office to ogle the butterball blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was able to channel that voice into other things, however. That friday, the pair met at Jenna's house - watching some cheesy action movie or other. \"This is so dumb,\" remarked Jenna, \"If the dude's some CIA-trained operative, why the hell does he run around into the bad guy's guns and get hit like that?\" The main character wriggled around over-dramatically. Faintly from the television, his next line as he held his faux-wound - \"Shit... I'm wounded bad...\" triggered Alice - \"In what world do you start as many sentences with the word \"Shit\" as this guy? Not one person I know does that.\" Jenna chuckled. \"I do that - but only when it's around you.\" Alice winked and jiggled one of her multiple rolls at Jenna. \"I could say the same for you, babe. If we're going to do this, can we switch roles this time?\" Jenna raised a brow. \"Alright.\" She assumed the position, lounging on the burgundy sofa. This was one thing that Jenna did not want to break - it was a beautiful sofa, reinforced against Jenna's 550+ pound body. It struggled with a load of 1,000 pounds, but still worked better than anything that was not a concrete slab to hold such pressure as the weight of these two mounds of lard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice picked up the two slices of pizza - famously from Martelli's lesser known pizza place. The only reason the small shop stayed open was that it was next to a string of college dive bars, and sold cheap, massive slices of pizza from its 30 inch pies. And Alice had bought two. Even Jenna had to remark, \"Jesus al-mighty, it's like an alien space ship.\" The seemingly world-encompassing pizzas took up the entire rest of the living room when Alice brought them in. This was a taxing task to be sure, and Alice panted and wiped the sweat from her forehead. \"This ought to help you out, piggy. Now lay back and let mommy do her work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of massive Jenna laying back was one to behold. It was like a set of rolling mountains, bare of trees just as she began to de-clothe herself. She took up the whole of the width of the couch on her side, every inch of fat spreading out. Her gut lay bare and jiggling, a good platform for Alice to lean her fat arms on. Jenna's mouth let out a tiny amount of air from the pressure. \"Ooo... That feels good..\" Alice managed to take one massive slice, the length of her nearly 30 inch fatty forearm and  a fair bit wider, and fold it - feeding this folded slice tip-first into Jenna's waiting maw. Her face seemed far fatter when it was waiting for food - likely a picture of her future as she bit down into the folded slice. Alice relentlessly pushed forward as Jenna opened for another bite, barely chewing the first. \"Mmm..\" moaned Jenna at the ecstasy of the food. The slice was beautifully greasy and meat-laden. The rest of the slice went faster than a normal human being would think possible until they saw Jenna's massive, waiting, fat mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice reached for the next slice. \"Mm-hmm. And there's double that coming up here.\" She folded the next slice, only to grab a second slice! She was using black-magic sorcery's fat cousin and Jenna's mouth watered as her eyes hungrily tracked the food approaching her mouth. Alice drew it back at the last moment, as it approached Jenna's mouth. Jenna's brows furrowed, offended at the withdrawal of food. \"You bitch,\" she spoke with a joking tone. She was immediately assaulted with the double-slice, this evil mechanism of obesity. To any sane person, the sight of the two piles of poundage eating such greasy, fattening food would make them redouble their dieting efforts. But to Jenna, it was the sexiest feeling imaginable- the idea that once-innocent little Alice had now fattened herself to the degree that she was barely 50 pounds short of Jenna's weight. To Alice, too, this was a dangerous pushing of her boundaries. She loved both the act of feeding and being fed, and in this moment, as the pizza still lasted and Jenna finished the double-slice, she picked up four more slices, a feat of hand grip, and formed two double-slices, handing one to Jenna. \"Feed me this one.\" Jenna cackled. \"I knew you couldn't resist being fed.\" Alice smiled. \"Definitely not,\" as the double-slice slid into her mouth and she bit down.  She was already questioning whether she could keep up the feeding routine and still hold firm to her self-control. She had to find someone to channel this gluttony into - soon. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In her preoccupation with her perversions, Jenna had never made it difficult to gain weight in the Gordge offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the higher up she climbed up the precariously creaking corporate ladder the more she worked to undermine the waistlines of those around her, as well as the audacity of those who would attempt to contain them. As discussed at length before, Jenna <i>loved</i> watching people get fat. The only thing she loved more was having an active hand in sabotaging their diets, and watching their willpowers crumble into fleshy bloated piles of soft fat. She had been the undoing of plenty during her time as office manager, and no doubt her reign would only continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in all her time doing this\u2014she\u2019d never had someone help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she never would have dared to mention her doughy dalliances with anyone in the workspace. That was a mandatory phone call to HR, right there. The fact that she was dating one of her coworkers alone, much less one of her own staff, made this far more taboo than she was used to. It had just so happened that she happened to pick someone open to\u2026 <i>experimentation</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe months they\u2019d spent together had certainly helped pile pound after pound onto Alice\u2019s already ample frame as she discovered the joys of mixing food and sex. For years she had learned to substitute one hand for the other, and now here she was double-fisting them both at every opportunity! Good little Alice Gellar, getting hot and bothered as she quickly crept up the sliding bathroom scale\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hundred pounds had long passed. Four fifty, too. And as she teetered along four seventy-nine, inching ever close to her lover\u2019s weight at over five hundred pounds, it took everything within her power not to just eat and eat and eat\u2026 She still had a life to live, after all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA job to go to, dates to go on, friends to see. It wasn\u2019t like she could afford to be this immobile mass like Jenna wanted her to be (or the one that she had idly touched herself to at night) it simply wasn\u2019t practical!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her nights with Jenna, playing with their roles of feeder and feedee, Alice had thankfully discovered another outlet to her perverse sexual lust for food and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne that would certainly keep <i>her</i> slim\u2014at least for a little while longer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel, I\u2019m gonna take Maria out for lunch.\u201d Alice hollered out the open doorway, \u201cYou wanna come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor years now the two of them had worked together. Though Alice had started slim, Mel had always been a bit big and greedy. Until Alice had started dating their boss in secret, getting herself stuffed every other night with enough calories to stun a bear, they\u2019d remained around the same weight. It was almost hard to believe that Melissa used to weigh <i>more</i> than her these days. As Alice continued to expand outwards into an almost spherical ball with breasts and blonde hair, she\u2019d quickly come to outpace her greedier friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain?\u201d Melissa puffed, pushing hard against the office chair as she lumbered to a stand, \u201cJesus Al, if I didn\u2019t know any better I\u2019d think you were trying to fatten that girl up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice tapped the side of her nose playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou utter bitch.\u201d Melissa snorted, \u201cWhat the hell, Alice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking Melissa extended a hand for Alice to grab onto. She needed the extra support. Her muscles had atrophied underneath all that fat, leaving her weak as a kitten and as big as a boulder. Melissa might have been outweighed by Alice, and she was no body builder either, but she provided enough weight for the bigger blonde to work her way up clumsily to her fat-buried feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTottering on her feet, Alice struggled to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just though\u2026 phew\u2026\u201d Alice swiped a meaty forearm across her face to wipe away the damp, \u201cYou know\u2026 it\u2019s kind of a\u2026 <i>tradition</i> don\u2019t you\u2026 oof\u2026 don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking like this out loud was such a thrill for Alice\u2014she\u2019d buried it under a heaping helping of subtext, but to speak so plainly about her desires for the first time in her life was incredibly freeing. Melissa had no idea that she was being serious, either! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean I guess\u2014worked for you.\u201d Melissa laughed with a playful, friendly pat of Alice\u2019s globular gut as it sagged heavily over her crotch and towards her knees, \u201cI know you\u2019re just joking, but lunch sounds great. Where are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThought I\u2019d let you pick.\u201d Alice managed a smile as she steadied her insane amounts of bulk, \u201cYou know\u2026 all\u2026 the best places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof\u2014you <i>do</i> want to make her fat.\u201d Melissa laughed raucously at her own joke, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to that bakery shop downtown. Does that work for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds\u2026\u201d Alice took a deep breath as a sensual tingle shivered up her spine and down into her crotch, \u201c\u2026<i>great</i>, honestly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, wanna drive us up? I\u2019ll waddle on ahead and get the new girl. Prepare her for her official Gordge Welcome Feast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Melissa did as much\u2014the belly-heavy brunette toddled along tummy first through the aisles, popping her round head into a cubicle every so often to see if their newbie was there. All the while Alice stood there, catching her breath and clutching the top of her own belly bravely as she bit her bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d worked with Melissa for years now\u2014how had she only just now realized that she had such a beautiful, fat body? To see those cheeks shake behind her with every lumbering step, her barrel-built blobbiness bouncing against her upper thighs. She had such a big belly. Alice loved bellies. Jenna loved bellies. They both loved\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice bit her bottom lip, struggling to control her appetites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice couldn\u2019t exactly stuff herself like she wanted. But the thought of her coworkers growing fatter\u2026 of <i>Melissa</i> growing fatter\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Al, you coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Almost!\u201d the shy girl squeaked as she clutched her groaning stomach on both sides, \u201cI-I\u2019m a-almost\u2026 I\u2019m almost there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be the best new project <i>ever</i>.</span></div></div>",

How much was too much to part with without stepping in on her own appetite? She couldn\u2019t go without, no, that wouldn\u2019t do. But she couldn\u2019t be <i>greedy</i>, that wouldn\u2019t do at all. Not if she wanted to feel <i>okay</i> about this. But it was so hard! She just wanted to eat them all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese two boxes of donuts to Mel\u2019s office?\u201d Alice\u2019s girth lurched her forward in her seat as she handed Maria two bright pink boxes of a dozen donuts each, \u201cThey\u2019re her favorite and, um\u2026 I-I owe her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2019course Alice.\u201d The redheaded yank said with a smile, \u201cY\u2019think she\u2019ll taste these or just suck \u2018em down like she does at lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had a good laugh at that. Truth was, none of them had done much tasting in their semi-regular luncheons. At a table with Alice and Mel\u2014hell, just working in Gordge at general\u2014Maria was swiftly learning that she had to eat quickly or not at all. A lesson evidenced by her bunching belly as it pressed against her blouse. The seam on the legs of her khaki pants were prime to pop any moment now\u2014just one or two more donuts and then Alice would get to see her in all of her naked, ivory-skinned, <i>jiggly</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMffmf!!\u201d Alice stuffed a jelly-filled donut in her mouth and waved the newbie off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Maria left their shared office, Alice felt her libido yearn for satisfaction. Jenna had special-ordered a chair for Alice not unlike her own when they\u2019d started dating, but it was very time-consuming to make. It would be another few weeks at least before Alice could enjoy the sensation of a vibrating head massaging her clit day in and day out without anyone being the wiser. Until then, she was just going to have to use the wand that Jenna had got her. In several hours, after she got off work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Alice, who had grown so accustomed to immediate gratification that the thought of delaying anything made her teary-eyed with frustration, this was going to be a powerful undertaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone out like every night this week, Al.\u201d Melissa said with a tentative rub of her stomach as it pressed tightly against her button-up, \u201cThis girl ain\u2019t exactly cheap to feed\u2014are you feeling okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling great, Mel!\u201d Alice said in a voice much higher-pitched and conspicuous than her normal tone, though her friend didn\u2019t seem to catch on in her post-lunch state of dreariness, \u201cI just\u2026 you know\u2026 I feel bad about not hanging out with you lately so I guess I\u2019m making up for lost time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Mel burped into the back of her hand, her large swell of neck fat bunching into tiny chins, \u201cI\u2019m down with that. Just take it easy on me\u2014I don\u2019t think I can handle another All You Can Eat wing night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice shuffled away and squealed to herself when Melissa was out of earshot. It took a while, given her state of fullness. The big brunette had been gorging herself for years on end, and she was a glutton through and through before that anyway. Just putting food in front of her was enough to get her to start chowing down. Alice had known that for years, and it was only now that she\u2019d finally linked that primal desire between food, sex, and fat that she was getting the most out of that knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Melissa eat was a visceral, wonderful experience for the repressed former cheerleader. She loved her best friend dearly as just that, her best friend. But what she wouldn\u2019t give to just\u2026 <i>violate HR protocols</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than she already had, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDate nights with Jenna had to take something of a step back. Mostly because of Jenna\u2019s hectic work schedule, which nobody could really be at fault for. She was in charge of an entire branch of Gordge, after all. It just meant that Alice had to push her satisfaction back even further. Now that she was only mealing with Jenna every other day (Lunches but not dinners, or dinners but not lunches so as to better fit in her new pet project) she looked bigger almost every time they saw one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Alice incredibly hot to think about all the things that her boss would do all day. Snacking, feasting, gorging herself behind her desk. Not unlike she did, most days actually. But obviously to much better effect. Jenna was still steadily climbing in size, whereas Alice had mostly plateaued somewhere dangerously close to 480 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was far past that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we could change delivery companies?\u201d Alice asked, popping an apple-filled donut into Jenna\u2019s mouth, \u201cTo South Royal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrh?\u201d Jenna blinked stupidly, her bubble cheeks bulging with fried dough and good, \u201cAre you seriously asking me this right now, babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Alice looked away bashfully, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I had them the other day. They\u2019re <i>so</i> good, Jenna. I can barely control myself around them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice coquettishly placed both her hands on her growing, gurgling gut. Her fat fingers spread wide, allowing for her flesh to bulge through. Slowly, she worked her way down to the hem of her sweater, and pulled it up inch by inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think this part right here? This little bit of belly?\u201d Alice pinched her tummy playfully, grabbing a handful of her heft, \u201cI think that\u2019s all South Royal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna, half-naked already and already not quite thinking with her managerial side, was sufficiently convinced. It was a bit more money, but it wouldn\u2019t have been the first time that she\u2019d spent a little extra to keep her girls happy and well-fed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but you owe me one Gellar.\u201d Jenna purred, running her hand up and down Alice\u2019s stomach as it muffin-topped over her stretchpants, \u201cAnd it\u2019s been a <i>loooong</i> time since I got to pinch any of that for myself\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNights with Jenna made it hard for Alice to keep her creed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she thought about lately was food. Food and sex. Food and Fat and Sex. Food sex with fat people. She\u2019d never been attracted to any of this before\u2014she\u2019d spent so long just trying to diet and wish it all away! But things were different now, things were <i>so</i> different\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygod you <i>got them</i>~\u201d Melissa moaned as she hugged the South Royal box of donuts close to her heaving chest before ripping the top off, \u201cHow the fuck did you get Jenna to splurge on these?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know\u2026\u201d Alice flashed back to the night before and chuckled, \u201c\u2026I-I\u2019m in sales for a reason!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Melissa double-fist those pastries that she\u2019d picked up, knowing that there were literally boxes of them in the break room now that Alice had convinced their boss to go for broke and upgrade their already decadent snack budget? It made Alice feel so accomplished. So smart, and cunning. So <i>powerful</i> and <i>sexy</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she understood why Jenna had been fattening her up like this. It was a rush to have her own little project! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck.\u201d Melissa snorted, chocolate dolloped on the corner of her mouth, \u201cI gotta pay you back for this one, Al\u2014what about lunch today? My treat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, I like that\u2026\u201d Alice ran her hand up her stomach again as it sank down towards her knees, \u201cUm\u2026 how about that mexican place you won\u2019t stop talking about? I know it\u2019s your favorite\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking Mel massive was going to be a piece of cake\u2014that is, if she didn\u2019t eat it first!</span></div></div>",

What took effort was holding back her own greed to let Melissa's own greed do the work. Of course, Alice was not even close to restraining her food choices - she had, in fact, put on some five pounds by proxy. She couldn't avoid skimming <i>just a little</i> off the top - just a few handfuls of chips from the bag she was going to \"share\" with Mel, just a few handfuls of candy from the Halloween leftovers she was going to dump on the eating machine that was her perpetually engorged co-worker. This had the effect of gently shoving Alice over the plateau to somewhere just a smidge north of 480. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was chump change compared to Melissa. She was easily soaring past 500 by the end of the year, and if the coming year boded any better, she would be 50 pounds heavier by the end of the year - maybe even 100. Alice could appreciate her work as she examined the blubbery immensity of her friend - she appreciated it almost too much as she noticed how symmetrically Melissa was carrying her weight. Nearly every part of her body had grown, her gut, her thighs, her breasts - as if she had been perfectly evenly fattened across her body. Her shirt was packed to bursting - the bottom of her belly was peeking out nearly any time of the day, just as her leggings were on the brink of being overrun. Alice's belly was still larger than Melissa's - but her belly was larger than almost anybody's, even Courtney's belly these days was on par with Alice's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney's gluttony, however, was being far surpassed by Melissa's - to the point where even she began casting worried glances at the brunette. \"Mel, damn, can you slow it on the South Royals? I want some too.\" Melissa mumbled something through a mouthful of cream cheese and strawberry, likely defending her gluttony. At Courtney's size, it took the kind of dedicated feeding that Alice or Jenna could provide to shove one forward in weight, but it was certainly occurring for Melissa.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\nJenna and Alice were intertwined, a sphere of fat on top of a mound of adipose. \"Damn, girl, you're getting to be wider than you are tall...\" said Alice as she fed the powerful woman another slice of chocolate cake. \"Mmhmhmm,\" mumbled the whale-like form of Jenna, swallowing the slice in three bites, \"You're not far off, fatty...\" Alice rubbed at her belly. If only her responsibilities let her let go like she wanted to. She spoke up, \"Hopefully not... Maybe we could both just sit here, eating.. and eating.. and..\" She slid her tongnue down Jenna's throat, seeming to chase the cake with it. Jenna moaned in delight. She didn't care that her intent had flipped on her, if slightly - she was still so aroused by how <b>fat</b> she was getting - how her chair had to be industrial-strength to not fold under her fat, how she couldn't wear normal clothes - she had to special - order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enjoyed this, every moment of it, even the fact that she could barely move anymore. If it weren't for her guaranteed front-row park, she'd likely collapse just from the effort of waddling through the parking lot. Jenna fondled and gripped Alice's fat as the butterball used her tongue to gently probe Jenna's nethers. Her fat was so soft - like butter, like dough - so soft. \"Jesus... Ohh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it nibbled at the back of Jenna's mind. Alice should be fatter. She should keep getting fatter - was she using Jenna's own urge to gain and expand her own form to stave off her own obesity? Maybe - if so, a clever move on her part. But did Jenna care? Somewhere, she did - she wanted in some part of her to get Alice off of her plateau. But at her size, how could she act on it? And did she even want to? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the end of the day, all Jenna really wanted was satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been working at Gordge for years now, becoming increasingly enraptured by the idea of food and fat. A greedy glutton at heart, she\u2019d placated her impotent desires to stuff herself to bursting through her secondary fetish\u2014fattening up others. Once she\u2019d been put in charge of her very own branch, she\u2019d done everything to ensure that her people were surrounded by temptation and that their willpowers were kneecapped to do anything about it. It had taken her far, and it had helped blow up almost everyone who wound up working underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the woman on top of her that had changed things for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice Gellar had blown up to almost five hundred pounds of former cheerleader, blowing up like someone pulled the pin out of her even before she\u2019d started this tawdry affair with her boss. But once Jenna had gotten her claws into her, introduced her to this kink of hers that had been private for so long, it had become something else.<br>\r\nThey would feed each other. They would fuck each other. They would do both, for hours on end until either of them were so full they could barely see straight. Every night with her office sexpot was a blurry blissful haze of gratification that had made them both very, <i>very</i> fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had finally pushed past her plateau\u2014she was climbing the mountain again at five hundred and fifty pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive hundred and sixty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive hundred and seventy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was blowing up so fast and so quick that she was having trouble navigating even her own hyper-obesity friendly environment! Jenna would go hours without leaving her desk, binging on snacks from the break room and the vending machines. Waddling down the hallways, her enormous body brushing against this cubicle and that, puffing like a steam engine as she felt the weight of her own immensity hang and sag and bulge off of her body. The stares of her own employees as they sized her up, snorting to themselves that at least they weren\u2019t as big as their boss before diving back into their donuts. Jenna loved her job so so so fucking much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just one problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could call it a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t been trying to fatten up her employees for a while now. But it was plain to see that their expansion wasn\u2019t slowing down, even as Jenna took her feeder energy inward. Her eye for the super-sized meant that she was constantly looking out for added pounds and inches on literally everyone\u2019s frame to fuel her fat-filled fantasies, and she had not been wanting for any fetish fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney had been at a plateau for years now\u2014almost for as long as Jenna. But she was back on track to keeping a relative pace with her boss and longtime binging buddy. Her enormous T&amp;A were regaining their lead on what had become a blobby physique as she\u2019d petered out\u2014her breasts and hips were becoming ever more pronounced as her gains resumed where they left off. Vicky, her secretary and the woman with closest proximity to Jenna, had always been her special project. She\u2019d walked in through the doors as this young Italian bombshell, but now she couldn\u2019t even bend over to get the runs out of her leggings. She saw Vicky from behind and idly thought she was Courtney\u2014to which the ever-oblivious simply didn\u2019t respond. She was a Gordge girl now through and through, with Maria right behind her. That redheaded girl that she\u2019d stuck with Alice so she could keep her girlfriend getting fat was doing plenty good work on herself; a natural glutton with a penchant for snacking had slowly and steadily become a woman just as obsessed with food as any of the other pigs waddling around her office. The fact that she was smaller than them kept her in a healthy state of mild denial of her creeping weight problem, but she was such a cute little calorie sponge\u2026<br>\r\nAnd of course, there was Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was <i>her</i> that had tipped Jenna off to what was really happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Melissa had been friends for years\u2014back when Alice was the skinny one, it was Melissa who had helped act as the bad influence. But nowadays, you would have thought Alice was fattening her up for slaughter! She was always hanging out with her, and they <i>always</i> went to lunch together. Sometimes even dinner! Jenna wasn\u2019t one to come between two fatties and their food, but Alice had started to spend more time with her own little project than she had been with <i>her</i>\u2014her boss! And lover! And\u2026 maybe girlfriend, she wasn\u2019t sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, Mel was coming in hot on Jenna\u2019s title as \u201cthe biggest\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was something that she wasn\u2019t about to have.</span></div></div>",

She huffed, panted, red-faced and out of breath from the exertion of waddling down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her, past the obscuring, encroaching fattened facial features - her jowls and cheeks atop her  - she saw Jenna, sitting, almost spilling, out of her chair and over the desk. Pressed downward in a chair, her lover looked rather like one great muffin top. Her belly spilled over her mahogany desk which concealed much of the rest of her fat, save for her increasingly fat face - which was filled with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream-topped red-velvet delights, french fries, bacon cheeseburgers, fried chicken, anything that could scare a dietitian. Alice smiled and remarked after a gasping breath, \"You must'v' been hungry.\" Jenna giggled and shook her fat rolls at her lover. \"I always am.\" Alice advanced and sat down in one of the extra-wide chairs that were ubiquitous in these upper rungs of power, designed for the fatter bodies of the chain of command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice advanced towards her fattened lover, grasping in hand a red velvet cupcake. \"Let's get sweet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's form became clearer as she bit into the whipped-cream-topped confection. Her double-chin had long become a thick roll that hung down from her neck, but it seemed to grow thicker by the day now, by the hour. She moaned in ecstatic delight. The session went on - between cupcakes, she ate more of the fried, calorie-dense food. Alice occasionally stroked her great, blubbery thighs - virtual oceans of fat that drowned the chair beneath, she interjected, \"You like that?\" Jenna moaned an affirmative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stuffing was ecstasy, but the sex was better. Alice had become a pro over so many sessions of feeding and fucking, even if she was comparatively out of practice. Her nimble if hefty fingers teased Jenna's cunt - she was so on the edge, until she finally blew her load into her desk, all over Alice's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice wiped off her finger, the exhausted whale that was Jenna spoke with surprising energy, \"What are we, Al?\" Alice stood in place for a moment. She hadn't thought of that. Her boss was now officially asking her to take a stand on their romantic relationship. \"I mean, I don't know what we <i>can</i> be, darling. H.R. will fucking rage if they find out about it.\" Jenna dismissively shook her head as she relaxed from her orgasm, \"I'm... I'm important, and there's no way they can find out if I cover it well enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hard decision, a truly hard one. Alice wasn't sure she wanted to commit yet. But on another hand, she could make Jenna biblically huge - but she didn't want to give up her feeding time with Melissa. She had a feeling, a hunch, that was what this was about. She wanted to fatten Melissa.. And Maria, and Courtney, and so many others, but that kind of exclusivity would take Jenna to new highs - both in sexual appeal and in weight, twin concepts in the women's minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's answer came from her lips after a moment of consideration.</span></div></div>",

Her Christian upbringing had told her that she ought not to explore the sexual desires that ailed her, and that she should find a more wholesome solution. <i>That</i> had been what had made it so easy for her to get fat in the first place - the ready substitution of food for sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that the two were not only interchangable, but highly desired aspects of the pleasure centers of Alice's brain, the inner id of Alice's fat girl instincts started to scramble when forced to choose between More Jenna and More of Everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor so long she'd gone without feeling <i>in control</i> of her sex life. She'd been fed by Jenna, she'd been put through involuntary celibacy beforehand... Alice hadn't come as much in the past year as she had in her entire life, and it was all thanks to discovering that, yes, she had a double-barreled fetish for food and fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen given the option to chose between one potentially dangerous outcome and prolonging that outcome with several others, each getting juicier and fatter with every passing day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's greedy brain chose the latter - at the detriment to her relationship with Jenna, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the end of the day... Jenna was going to get fatter anyway, right? Melissa and Courtney and Vicky and Maria and everyone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have been stupid to pass this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa took up the entirety of the space behind her desk. She had always been too big for the cubicle, but Alice's intervention had meant that the big fat brunette's growth was outpacing even the office's obesity-friendly atmosphere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would spend hours a night planning her method of attack, ensuring that everyone got as much calories crammed into them as possible before she could sleep soundly. And even then, she'd work her way clumsily underneath her hanging gut until she managed to satisfy her fantasies of everyone so big and fat that they could barely move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa wasn't too far off from Alice's deepest desires - in that she was hopelessly depended on her big blonde bestie for her snacks throughout the day, if not quite as big as Alice's most hedonistic fantasies painted her. She was easily one of the larger members of the staff now, having officially overtaken Courtney's spot as the resident Fat Girl on the floor (Jenna was, of course, discounted due to sheer logistics).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Al?\" Melissa panted, \"Wanna go grab me a kruller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but...\" Melissa whined, her eyes growing moist with petulant desire and frustration, \"...hurry okay? I'm... <i>phew</i>... I'm really hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled widely as her favorite fatty in the office started to struggle mentally against not having anything to snack on. This place really knew how to turn a girl into a compulsive eater, but Alice liked to think that only she could turn someone into a fully fledged addict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd gotten hooked on the idea that one day Melissa would be as big as Jenna. And that day was coming soon, she just knew it. All Alice could think about some days was the idea of <i>all</i> of her coworkers so big that they could barely get around, relying on her for even the smallest things like snack breaks and helping them get in and out of chairs and doorways and cars...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice wiped the sweat that had accrued at her brow with one plump arm - she was getting overstimulated. Had to cool down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe some ice cream would help? She'd be at the vending machine anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice may have turned down a chance with Jenna, the biggest boss that anyone could have ever dreamed of, but she had big plans for this place. She wasn't going to stop until everyone was just as huge as she wanted them to be. Lest she eat herself into a similar state of super-sizedom... she wasn't sure what she wanted anymore! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Alice wanted was to make sure that <i>someone</i> was eating - starting with Melissa. Then Courtney. Then Maria, and Vicky... working her way down and down the roster until Gordge was full of big, fat fatties that she could ogle...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one really did much of anything really interesting over the weekend\u2014the gaggle of engorged and girthy gals opting instead to stay in their respective homes and pass the time as they saw fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo on Monday morning, when time passed at a snail\u2019s pace as per norm and no one gave a second thought to it. Jenna was locked in her office, Courtney was hard at work while Melissa and Alice gabbed across the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the Halloway account.\u201d Melissa began quietly as she turned to face her corpulent conspirator, \u201cThe client, George? He\u2019s <i>really</i> cute.\u201d She said with a little crinkle of her nose as a wicked smile crossed her lips and dimpled her cheeks, \u201cI talked to him on the phone since we picked him up and didn\u2019t think anything of it, but then I saw his picture\u2026 Mm! He is a <i>lot</i> prettier than his voice lets on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the aisle sat Alice, a positively rotund woman who squashed the chair beneath her with two pale slabs of meat and a colossal caboose. The bigness of her belly forced the two apart as it drooped heavily over the lip of the chair. Her fat arms still rested in typing position, she turned to provide her input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never really been into guys with mustaches.\u201d She added, her own smile a little more girlish than man-crazy Melissa\u2019s, \u201cPlus, I think he\u2019s married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa, the balloonish broad with thick brown hair psshaw\u2019ed at Alice\u2019s accusation. Being even heavier than her older friend, she sat in much the same stance that Alice did. Her burgeoning belly surged forward surely, but as she folded her arms she was forced to do so underneath her heaving hooters. She was so big in the belly though, that it was almost like she was hugging herself. Her fat form turned as the swivel chair allowed her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She said matter of factly, \u201cYou know he said my voice is sexy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, Melissa\u2019s using her sexy smoker siren call to seduce her clients! I wondered why your sales were up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shut up, Alice. I\u2019m only playing.\u201d She giggled as Alice egged her on, \u201cI think he\u2019d have to bulk up a bit to be with me though. Or I\u2019d have to slim down. Either way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could shave his upper lip and he\u2019d probably drop, like, twenty pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, his mustache is\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that a figure came between the two, if only for a moment. It had a distinct walk, a slow hobble that was signature to the tall high heels that only one woman in the office wore. Barely there for two blinks of an eye, it had been Victoria heading back to her desk. They had seen her go by about five minutes ago, apparently she was just now getting back. However, she was gone just like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014so hot, if he ever shaved I\u2019d buy him a new one at Party City until it grew back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as Alice seemed to watch Victoria walking away, all but hanging her short brown locks out her cubicle as she did so. She turned back to Melissa, seeming distraught, as she let her eyes linger to her right for just a moment longer before asking, as if greatly intrigued by the seemingly every-day action:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that Victoria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet, I heard her coming all the way from the break room.\u201d Melissa griped with an eye roll, \u201cThose loud high heels clacking on the floor\u2026 you\u2019d think she\u2019d just wear flats like the rest of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I mean, she had like, an armful of food!\u201d Alice stressed \u2018armful\u2019 by holding out her thick forearms like she were holding a football<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what, she\u2019s always eating.\u201d Melissa said, unaware of her hypocrisy, \u201cSeriously, half the time she answers the phone with pop-tart in her mouth. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I mean\u2026 look, you know how much food she gets in a day?\u201d Alice asked, leaning against her stomach slightly as she attempted to hone the conversation between the two, \u201cShe had, like, all of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Melissa asked with a raised eyebrow, \u201cYou\u2019d think little Miss Guido would at least pretend to look like she\u2019s working\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, far away from them by now, Vicky walked down the aisle with notable difficulty. On one hand (or, rather both), she precariously balanced the large amount of snack food she had garnered from her most recent trip to the vending machine. With her free hand, an open package of strawberry pop tarts was held by two fingers as she ravenously chomped on both tarts at a time. Her mouth opened wide, little brown flakes dotting the corners of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, two large cheeks bobbed awkwardly beneath her tight black skirt. She had put on some weight since joining the work force, this being the Italian girl\u2019s first internship and stepping stone into completing her business degree. She had gone from a somewhat thick girl with a bad spray tan to a downright porker, months of idle snacking at her desk had put at least fifty pounds on Victoria\u2019s supple shape\u2014a big belly stuck out behind her while her overpumped rump grazed the ends of the cubicles she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t stop to say hello to anybody, she was far too engrossed in stuffing her face. Her cheeks bulged outwards, filled with \u201cbreakfast\u201d as she passed row after row of coworker, eventually making it back to her front desk. She simply spread her goods across the surface and wriggled her way into her increasingly tight office chair before resuming her food fest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeeze, that\u2019s not like her at all\u2026\u201d Alice said, somewhat concerned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d Melissa asked arbitrarily, \u201cShe\u2019s always stuffing her face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, but\u2026\u201d Alice pursed her lips, \u201cStill, something might be wrong.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She preferred to sit back and gossip behind a person\u2019s back as opposed to \u201cactually caring about someone,\u201d as Alice often did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but she\u2019s a coworker, us girls look out for each other.\u201d Alice said. Melissa rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just ate a lot, do we have to do it now?\u201d Melissa whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, get up.\u201d Alice said. The two flabby friends slowly lifted their overfed bodies out of their overtaxed desk chairs. Melissa and Alice groaned and grunted as they struggled to get their bodies upright. Their large breakfasts made their heavy bloated bellies hard to shift around. They slowly waddled over to Victoria\u2019s desk. The two fatties were out of breath as they reached Victoria at the front of the office. Vicky\u2019s was sitting on her big butt, snacking on some twinkies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you gonna say to her?\u201d Melissa whispered to Alice. It was a good question. It would be rude for Alice to just ask her why she\u2019s getting so fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pretend it\u2019s a survey for everyone at the office.\u201d Alice said. She turned towards Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, what\u2019s up?\u201d Victoria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Vick, I\u2019ve got some questions for you for a survey. Everyone at the office has to do it.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, yeah sure. Ask away.\u201d Victoria said. She was pretty gullible so she didn\u2019t bat an eye at Alice\u2019s fake survey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst question: how often do you exercise?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026 never I guess. I hate getting sweaty, working out sucks.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, in what ways do you try to eat healthy?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry to eat healthy? I don\u2019t think about whether I\u2019m eating healthy or not. I just eat what I want when I want it.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you monitor what you eat at all?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m only like 23.\u201d Victoria said. Alice was a bit confused as how \u201cI\u2019m only 23\u201d was a valid reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, have you gained weight in the last year?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. I haven\u2019t weighed myself in so long.\u201d Victoria said. The answer was obviously yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo yes or no? What\u2019s your best guess?\u201d Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you just put \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019?\u201d Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, yeah sure.\u201d Alice said. \u201cThanks for taking the survey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem!\u201d Victoria said. Alice and Melissa walked back to their desks. Alice was flabbergasted by Vicky\u2019s na\u00efve attitude towards her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with her.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA doctor would disagree.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like mine or your answers would be any different.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I guess so.\u201d Alice said.</span></div></div>",

Jenna walked by Victoria\u2019s desk. Her whale of a boss was exhausted. She was rarely seen walking around the office due to her being so lazy and fat. She stopped to lean on Victoria\u2019s desk. Jen was breathing heavily and sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenna, are you alright?\u201d Victoria asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I *gasp* can\u2019t *pant* believe how large *wheeze* this office is.\u201d Jen said, complaining about the mere 20 yards she\u2019d walked. The reason she was making her trip around the office was to see how her changes to the office were going. Jenna wanted the office to cater perfectly to women like herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you like the office now?\u201d Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love it. I've got all the food I\u2019d want! Also the Milkshake machine is great.\u201d Victoria said. Jenna liked Victoria a lot so she made sure Vicky was treated well. That meant her desk was stocked with food. Jen looked Victoria up and down. She had a recently developed double chin. There was no doubt she had gained weight recently. Her shirt was missing several buttons and her big pudgy belly was pushing the remaining buttons to their limit. Even her arms looked packed in to her shirt sleeves. She really seems to have embraced the culture of the office. She\u2019s looking better than ever! Jen thought to herself. Victoria also looked Jenna up and down. She was the fattest person Vicky had ever seen! Her boobs were larger than Vicky\u2019s butt. I like Jenna but wow is she big! You\u2019ll never see me looking like that. Vicky thought. If only she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I need my secretary to be well fed. If you have any problems, let me know.\u201d Jenna said. She then reached her arm out at Victoria\u2019s desk. Victoria was a little confused. Jenna was trying to grab one of the several twinkies on Vicky\u2019s desk, but her three big fat rolls were preventing her from reaching the desk. A thick spare tire pushed away objects as her jiggling flabby fat oozed on to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, here.\u201d Victoria said, handing Jenna the twinkie. She was a little embarrassed for Jenna. Jenna couldn't care less though as she quickly shoved the twinkie passed her chubby cheeks. Jenna then walked back to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna saw some of herself in Victoria. This made her want to coddle Victoria as an employee. She wanted Victoria to be well fed and comfortable. She made her job as easy as possible. Victoria saw no problem with this. She liked making her boss happy, and all she had to do was eat and occasionally answer the phone. And if she ever had a problem Jenna would get it fixed. One side effect of all of this was a large increase in Victoria\u2019s weight. Victoria wasn\u2019t aware of just how fat she was getting, she was just thinking about Jenna\u2019s encouragement.</span></div></div>",

Her big squishy hips barely squeezed past the armrests. She reached down to the lowest drawer of her desk, which was labeled \u201cDevil Dogs.\u201d She opened the drawer and was shocked to see just three devil dogs left at the bottom of the drawer. Shifting her flabby bulk her chair made a loud groan. She extended her hand into the drawer. Bending her side she tried as hard as she could to grab a devil dog. Her big soft love handles and massive hip fat stopped her from reaching any farther than a few inches. Frustrated, She backed her chair and spun so that she was facing the open drawer. She spread her big round thighs as much as she could. This made her heavy overfed belly and big fat filled breasts sink several inches as it lay between her thighs. She then stuck her two chubby arms out and reached for the devil dogs. Victoria\u2019s massive middle blocked her from actually seeing the drawer at all. Slowly she bent over her seat, trying to reach the drawer. As she bended farther her bottom roll fat started to hang off the edge of the seat. Her face pressed up against her soft flabby boobs. Her fat chins squishing her cleavage. Having bent as far as her obese gut could she blindly moved her hands in search of the devil dogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed some help?\u201d said Alice, who standing in front of Victoria\u2019s desk. Victoria looked up, a little embarrassed by how she must\u2019ve looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, can\u2019t reach the drawer.\u201d She said. Alice came around to Vicky\u2019s side. Looking at the drawer she knew there was no way she could reach it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should tell Jen. I don\u2019t know who in the office could reach that.\u201d Alice said. Victoria took her advice and waddled to Jenna\u2019s office. She had blimped up recently. She was out of breath from the short walk to Jen. She waddled into the office and sat down across from Jen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Vicky. Hows it going?\u201d Jenna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s *pant* good.\u201d Victoria said. Jenna looked her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you eating a lot? I want you to be well fed.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019m always eating.\u201d Victoria said. She patted her belly with both hands causing it to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Oh looks like you lost some buttons.\u201d Jenna said. Victoria\u2019s shirt had several buttons missing. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to see from you. I need you big <br>\r\nand healthy. How much do you weigh anyway?\u201d Jenna asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clike 330\u2026 I think. I\u2019m getting pretty big actually.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great. But you should be bigger. Anyway what brought you here?\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well the bottom drawer is too low to the ground, so I cant grab the last devil dogs in the drawer.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh what a shame. I\u2019ll get it fixed by the end of the week.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great. I\u2019ll just eat from the other drawers until then.\u201d Victoria said.

Under their previous employer Hilda, a woman of almost equal girth to Jenna, everyone in the office had been afforded with an hour-long lunch break. However under Jenna, an extra thirty minutes had been added with the addition of lunch being moved back an hour, plus an extra thirty minutes at three \u2018o\u2019 clock in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first break, being the longest, was the one where everyone usually flocked to their cars to go grab lunch off-site. But the second break, being a measly thirty minutes, barely left anyone enough time to whet their appetites, let alone fill their bellies. So instead of leaving, the girls would all loiter around the office like whales wading through the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMellissa would usually go smoke while Alice waited on her to come back, where both women would join Courtney in the employee lounge while Christina made a coffee run. The only one who never seemed to indulge in this little commodity was, surprisingly enough, Victoria\u2014who opted to sit at the phone in solitude while she played Candy Crush Saga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after Christina had returned from her coffee run, everyone else already crowding the break room as she came through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got everyone\u2019s coffee here\u2026\u201d Christina squeaked as she handled the cups with care, delivering one to each corpulent cutie one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, hun.\u201d Mellissa said off-handedly before diving back into the topic at hand, \u201cSo anyway, she\u2019s totally getting fat, right? It\u2019s not just me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s you too.\u201d Courtney jabbed as her subordinate handed her a frappe, \u201cBut you\u2019re not wrong, Vicky\u2019s gonna get big really quick if she keeps all of\u2026 <i>that</i> up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the svelte girl  handed Alice the last cup, the supple sweetheart the only one to thank her sincerely, Christina sat at the table opposite Mellissa. One of the many un(?)fortunate things about being the designated punching bag around the office was that Christina often missed these little juicy bits. As much as she didn\u2019t like gossip, it was fun listening to other women be mean to other women behind their backs. Just like in high school\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d she inquired, \u201cAnd what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice clicked her tongue in a matronly manner, \u201cDon\u2019t encourage them, Christie.\u201d She chided, \u201cthey\u2019re just talking about Victoria behind her back again, even though they don\u2019t have any room to talk.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell excuse me for noticing!\u201d  Mellissa cried half-defensively from her seat adjacent to Alice, \u201cI\u2019m well aware of every extra pound on my body, but Vicky prances around here like she\u2019s Christina\u2019s size!\u201d the surly smoker gestured towards the intern for emphasis, \u201cIt\u2019s distracting is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big do you think she\u2019ll get before she wises up and stops stuffing her face?\u201d Courtney asked deviously from the other table, \u201cI\u2019m giving her another week before she, like, accidentally eats her hair or something and flips out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEats her hair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I meant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t think she can do this forever?\u201d Mellissa asked with a greedy gulp of iced coffee, \u201cShe\u2019ll pork up all the way \u2018til Christmas at least. Then she\u2019ll plateau. That\u2019s what happened to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, we shouldn\u2019t talk about Vicky like that.\u201d Alice scolded, still seated, \u201cI mean, we <i>all</i> have weight problems here.

Still, she knew that the three of them were right. They all knew they were right, in fact the <i>only</i> person who didn\u2019t seem to understand just how right they all were was Victoria herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was that Vicky was going to get <b>huge</b>, and very quickly if she kept at the pace she had been going for the past week or so\u2026</span></div></div>",

Every once in a while she answers the phone but she is just always eating.\u201d Courtney said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Alice, Her butt is even bigger than yours is!\u201d Melissa joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you no longer have the biggest rear in the office, Al\u201d Courtney said. It was true Alice had lost her spot atop the biggest butts in the office. Of course <br>\r\nJenna\u2019s was bigger than everyone\u2019s but she was excluded from such competitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, stop it. She\u2019s still smaller than both of you.\u201d Alice said. It was true. She had not surpassed Melissa and Courtney\u2019s level of obesity. However she definitely now outweighed Alice, which was quite an accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but still\u2026\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria had indeed undergone an incredible gain. She was at least 370 pounds. All day every day for a few months she was a nonstop glutton. There wasn\u2019t a minute at work where her mouth was empty, and boy did it show. She had reached a level of fatness that was rarely seen outside of the office (It\u2019s actually the norm in the office). It was only a few months ago that she was just a young 23 year old, at a measly 250 pounds. Now she\u2019s already a heavy hitter. No one in the office had come close to being her size at just 23. What used to be just a chubby belly was now three big rolls of fat stacked like the Michelin man. Instead of just some chubby cheeks, she now had a huge double chin and a big fat neck. Her arms, once covered in a small layer of fat, now had big bags of fat that jiggled and hung off her bones. Her butt, which used to be two big round balls of chubbiness was now two MASSIVE slabs of wobbling flesh. Her breasts and thighs, which used to be just thick and juicy, were now so large that they were constantly in an embrace. If her Bra were like an actual cup of liquid, it would be filled to the brim. Anywhere that was once plump and covered in a simple layer of flesh now had creases and rolls and bags of hanging blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossibly the craziest thing about Victoria\u2019s gain was that it wasn\u2019t even over.</span></div></div>",

Most of the office either chuckled at her sight or was horrified that she might break some furniture. Alice was starting to shift from one of the gossipers to one of the worried coworkers. Victoria was putting on weight at such a fast pace and it didn't seem like it was slowing down. Alice was sure she'd plateau at some point, but in came a 380 pound Victoria the other day and broke her belt after eating one too many snacks. Of course Victoria blamed it on shoddy craftsmanship and continued to plow through her bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice wanted to help Victoria without calling out her weight gain. Since Victoria still lived in a state of delusion in regards to her weight, Alice needed to be a bit more subtle. Alice got her inspiration after watching Victoria hit up the milkshake machine a few times during the work day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Alice said to herself aloud. \"I'll buy her some diet shake powder. The ones that suppress your appetite. That way she won't eat nearly as much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice ran off to the vitamin store after work to get her plan in motion. She walked the aisles until she found large tubs of powder. She did her research, looking carefully for the right powder to cut down on Victoria's ravenous hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Alice could make her choice, she got a call from her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie! What's up? We haven't talked in awhile\" said Alice over the phone. \"WHAT? NOOO WAY? NOOO! WAY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice became preoccupied by Marie's story and in the process accidentally grabbed the weight gain powder instead. She didn't even double check at the counter as the clerk gave her a funny look. On the way out, Alice removed the label so as not to make it obvious to Victoria what she was doing. If she just paid enough attention to what she was doing and less on Marie she could have avoided a big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" said Victoria staring at an unlabeled black plastic container on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a gift!\" said Alice. \"I recently tried some new milkshake mix and thought of you. Really thought you would enjoy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Alice! You didn't have to do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing. Now remember. Don't share that with anyone. That is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah it's a really big....and...heavy tub! That's a lot of powder. I better watch out or I'll get fat off this stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that you have to worry about your weight, but it's actually really low in calories. It's like some kind of magic elixir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria tried her first shake and loved it. In fact she immediately went back for a second helping after her first. Alice felt accomplished, but little did she know what was to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on pants! You...fit...earlier this week! I just bought you!\" said Victoria to herself as she struggled to button her dress pants. On Monday this week, Victoria bought a new pair of dress pants that actually were kind of swimming on her. But by Friday, she struggled to get her rear end into those pants. Victoria blamed it on her dryer shrinking her clothes (which was happening a lot lately she noted). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was painfully obvious that the weight gain shakes had impacted Victoria in a serious way. She walked into work that day with an unbuttoned pair of dress pants and a tight sweater to cover up her wardrobe mishap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quickly shrinking clothes didn't slow down Victoria. With the weight gain shakes a part of her daily regimen, the weight didn't just creep on, it leapt on. The added pounds getting entirely absorbed by her oversized lower half. Pants were \"shrinking\" at an alarming rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe this Alice?\" asked Victoria<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" replied Alice. Alice was kind of in a daze trying to take in the even bigger Victoria. She assumed that weight suppressant would have really helped curb her weight, but Victoria was bigger than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These pants! What shoddy stitching! It tore right down the inner thigh when I sat down at my desk today! This is why you don't order from Europe. They have weird sizes from there and I don't think these fit me just right. Apparently a size 34 pant in Europe is like a size 2 in America, but it certainly doesn't feel that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What store did you order from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some place called Torrid. They only have European sizes, it's so confusing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had suddenly hit Alice that Victoria didn't realize she had been buying from a plus sized clothing store. Alice had a slight shock after it set in. Victoria was a size 34, that's easily bigger than Alice and probably everyone outside of Jenna. Victoria certainly had the biggest butt of the group. The bulbous booty was now famous for knocking over paperwork on desks and spilling coworkers coffee all over the floor. And if it wasn't her butt that was causing trouble, it was her expansive hips. Victoria's wide frame demanded that she take up the entire walkway in the cubicle farm. She also was now fond of bruised hips as she was bumping into all sorts of edges and corners. The bouncy intern only took it as a sign of her clumsiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n380...382...386...391...399...402...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Victoria surged past 400 pounds, she was really starting to struggle with her body. Her ankles grew so thick that she could no longer fit into her stylish boots she loved so much. Bending down to get things was a journey and often led to a pair of ripped pants. Even the largest sized clothes were not meant to contain such a large butt. Walking was even becoming a hassle. Chub rub was in full effect. Her thighs were constantly in pain from them rubbing together so much. She felt that her bed was super tiny, just barely able to fit her body on it. This led to a lot of restless nights and a few late night binge sessions. The mirrors couldn't fit her entire frame, so she threw them out thinking they were broken. If that wasn't bad enough, today was the first day that Victoria couldn't squeeze herself fully into the stand up shower. Her butt cheek kept the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n402...406...409...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Victoria was completely oblivious that it was her that was getting bigger. What was getting smaller though was her wallet. She spent so much money on clothing, that she was struggling paying her rent. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Victoria thumbed over the screen of her smartphone while the other hand fed a donut into her mouth. She had just arrived at her desk and had grabbed a few 'get her day started right' donuts. On her phone though she was checking her bank account. Her rent was due in a few days and she was just barely going to able to afford it. \"But how am I going to buy new clothes over the weekend? The dryer just destroyed my last decent work skirt.\" She said to herself as no one else was around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her thoughts turned inward she continued her donut conquest, but now with both hands as she had freed the other one up. 'Maybe I can get a second job, a little gig to do after work. You know, just for a little shopping money.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lunch time Victoria had secured a great after work job, and shared the good news with her co-worker Alice. Victoria had poured a thick milkshake and was adding in a generous amount of he weight gain powder Alice had supplied her with. \"Well since I have a shopping addiction I thought a second job would be great. So tonight I'm starting as a cashier at the Heavenly Sweet Bake shop next to here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Alice said with a very hesitant tone. Working at a bakery could only do worse things for Victoria's waistline, and she hadn't been getting any smaller like Alice had hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it will be great. People are always buying stuff there for the office anyway, I could probably get them a discount. And it will be so close I won't even have to walk very far.\" Alice was very nervous about this idea, but let it slide, she couldn't tell Victoria what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that night came and Victoria had her first shift at the bakery. It went smoothly and she learned a lot. Thankfully the job wasn't too hard because she had become quite lazy since starting her cushy office job. At the end of the night her trainer, a chubby girl who was probably still in high school, turned to Victoria and asked, \"You wanna take any of these left overs home?\" Victoria looked at the semi-full case of sweets and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I can have any of this stuff that's here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" The young girl said. \"We trash it all at the end of the night so it's made fresh the next day, feel free to eat all you want to take anything that is left home.\" Victoria didn't have to be told twice. She ate several sweets, and carried home as many as she could, including a three layer cake covered in chocolate that someone had ordered but never picked up. Victoria ate it all, and continued this routine every time she worked. She always asked for extra closing shifts so she could eat all the baked goods she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this snacking along with her full time snacking at her desk job only did more to inflate her waistline and the readout on the scale. </span></div></div>",

Now pushing almost 420 pounds, Victoria was racing to be the biggest girl in the office. The chuckles and jokes around the office started to dwindle. Victoria's explosive gain was now a general concern to most in the office (except for Jenna of course). Not even Jenna put on weight this fast. While most people felt true concern for the girl, nobody stood to do anything. They all were innocent bystanders of Victoria's weight explosion. Except for Alice. She felt like she could still save Victoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince curbing her appetite wasn't helping, Alice opted for exercise. She invited Victoria out for a gym date after work, to which Victoria accepted. Victoria was really just doing this for Alice. She thought Alice could lose a few pounds and she wanted to help out a friend. And so the duo went to work at the gym. At first Alice tried to get Victoria on a treadmill. She set it to the slowest speed, which was way to fast for Victoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*huff* \"Jeez, Alice you didn't have to get me started on expert level here.\" gasped Victoria. \"I haven't ran in a long while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Victoria's delight though the treadmill had stopped after only a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHEW! That was brutal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle to Victoria's knowledge but her weight exceeded what the treadmill could handle and it broke under her slow walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can try weight lifting\" said Alice. She thought at the very least she can lift some weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll seemed to be going well when Victoria attempted to do a bench press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I haven't done these since my cheerleading days! I wonder how many I can still do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with one quick jerk, the barbell went up....and right down onto her chest. Alice ran to get the weight off Victoria. Turns out Victoria doesn't have the muscle tone she once had in high school.  Rolling in pain, Victoria was rushed to the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww. They said it was bruised ribs\" winced Victoria \"The doctor doesn't want me to do any exercising for awhile. What good that did. Well Alice, I still think you could stand to lose a few pounds, so don't feel like you can't go to the gym without me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could stand to lose a few pounds!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Victoria's injury certainly didn't hurt her appetite. Instead it only gave her more reason to laze about and eat. Moving and breathing was painful, but eating food was bliss. The real trouble came at a shift at the bakery. It was all but apparent that Victoria was taking more night shifts so she could bring back the unsold baked goods. But she was also eating all the defect pastries in the store. If there was a mistake or if something didn't turn out just right, it ended up in Victoria's stomach. After awhile, that proved to not be enough for her. On shifts where she worked alone, she would sneak a pasty or three that would normally be sold to customers. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nNobody will notice a missing doughnut</i> thought Victoria. That is until that turned in to a dozen doughnuts. Victoria's ability to restrain herself around food was hitting a new low. It was this downward spiral that made for a memorable night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow pushing 442 pounds, Victoria was pushing the limits of the bakery's uniform. The manager mentioned to Victoria that they were \"out of options\" and that she would need to bring in her own clothes. Because of the messy nature of the job (and one of the last things that still fit), Victoria decided to go with a pair of grey sweatpants. These pants didn't leave much to the imagination. Gone was the draw string, Victoria's hips pinned those pants tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat started as a casual night alone at the bakery slowly started to ramp up after Victoria polished off the defects from earlier in the day. First a few doughnuts got started to disappear, but Victoria figured she hasn't been caught so far, why not try out the cheesecake. One slice led to two slices and that led to popping cupcakes into her mouth. Before she realized, the entire tray of cupcakes were gone. It certainly wasn't her plan to eat all those cupcakes, but that didn't seem to stop her. She began to shove handfuls of cookies into her mouth. The taste of baked goods was hypnotic. It was almost like she was under the spell of the baked goods. She was really picking up the pace. She almost choked because she wasn't chewing fast enough. <i>MORE!</i> her stomach declared. She emptied whole cookie trays until her stomach could hold no more...until she caught sight of the double fudge cake that was untouched all day. She was filled to the brim, but the cake still called to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really shouldn't</i> Victoria thought to herself. <i>I'm so full I can barely move.</i> And yet she was already pulling the cake out of the glass case before she could finish her thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Clink!* Victoria's not so steady hands caused the cake to fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!!\" screamed Victoria. The cake now laid on the floor, mostly intact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well...it did fall but most of it still looks good...no! I can't eat anymore. I'm sooo full. Well...I don't want this to go to waste.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she bent down, her sweatpants met their untimely doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RIIIIIIIP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already tight sweatpants couldn't contain both a full stomach and her ass. A rip right down the center of her ass, bright pink underwear visible for all to see. Yet this didn't distract Victoria who was already on the floor eating cake off the ground. For most this would be a low point, but it didn't even seem to phase Victoria. By now this was a familiar feeling. In fact it helped loosen some of the tightness which gave her some more room for food. Plus now she had a good excuse to go out shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a customer came into the shop. Having not heard the customer, Victoria was working through the cake still. The customer, however, got a great view of Victoria ass up, ripped pants, eating cake off the floor. The customer had a frightened look and immediately turned and left. Victoria, in a moment of embarrassment, struggled to get up off the floor. As she struggled, the rip in her sweatpants just kept getting bigger. Sweating just from getting up, Victoria \"ran\" to the door to try and save the sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Wait! It's not what you think is happening!\" Victoria began to yell before she was stopped by the door frame. Her hips were too wide for the front door.</span></div></div>",

Heck she even instinctively started turning sideways to avoid hitting her hips against the door frame. At no point did she take notice, but she did catch the eyes of her coworkers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria's meteoric rise in weight was the obsession of the office. Especially in the last few weeks. Mostly this chatter was amongst the group of employees that worked for Jenna. Jenna, however, was never included in the gossip. Typically she was the gossip. While most of the women weren't thin, Jenna was the standout amongst them all and typically was the butt of jokes. Despite not being in the gossip circles, Jenna knew that she was the talk of the office most of the time. It's hard not to when your boss is pushing 500 pounds. But as the months rolled on and a Victoria's weight shot up, talk about Jenna shifted over to Victoria and slowly but surely, nobody talked about Jenna's weight. In fact, Jenna was even being included in the gossip circles. Jenna realized that in order to stay out of the limelight, Victoria had to continue to be the center of the office gossip. Jenna did not want to go back to being teased and talked about in such a bad way. She knew the only way out was to help Victoria gain weight (if she really even needed that). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Victoria's woes about money, Jenna started to take Victoria out to lunch every day. Jenna would purposely order way too much food and insist Victoria finish it all. Victoria, feeling like she couldn't turn down her boss buying her all this food, opted to eat as much as she could, but even the mighty Victoria struggled to put down all the plates of food presented in front of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, I don't know if I can eat anymore Jenna. This is all too much!\" said Victoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have to eat it, I bought this for you. Are you turning down a free lunch from your boss? It sounds like you're turning down free lunch.\" replied Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! I'm incredibly thankful, I'll uhh try and finish what's left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria stuffed herself more than she ever had in a meal. She was no longer hungry and her stomach was far beyond its capacity, but she powered through. Jenna just watched as Victoria's clothes grew tight. She knew if she kept this up, Victoria was going to surpass her in no time. </span></div></div>",

Victoria had reached the kind of staggering weight were walking for more than a few minutes was out of the question. The last time she had had to stand for that amount of time was when she stood on her scales last night, only to be told *ERR*. Had she not have exceeded the scales limits she would have known she weighed something in the vicinity of seven hundred pounds. Give or take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney shuffled her corpulent form closer to take her massiveness all in. Victoria's ass took the brunt of her gains, its massive size caused her to require a bench-like seat, which her inflated behind seemed to take as a challenge and had nearly buried it with her overhanging fat, Courtney wondered how long before her ass touched the floor from her seated position. Her gargantuan gut had not been spared either, its size causing her to sit at an odd diagonal to her desk with her head turned to face her computer screen, it had folded itself into three separate rolls now, the latest addition just tucked neatly under her breasts. Speaking of which Victoria's bust had started to get to the kind of size where it not so much was a blockade when peering down, but something that was evidently trying to jam Victoria's thickened double chin up into her face. Even her feet had been consumed to her tremendous obesity, they looked like one large sausage and five tiny ones stuffed into a pastry, a pasty that had splitting sides and un-done laces. The backspace on her keyboard had started to see more frequent use as her hands and digits morphed into a state ill-equipped for hitting small keys. Lastly Victoria's face, looked hit harder by her weight gain than it was due to her breasts cries for attention squeezing her fat cheeks causing her expression to pucker, this did give her the added effect of nearly constant smiling, making her seem more welcoming to visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating back to Alice and Melissa's safe spot, Courtney still had her mouth agape. \"How much bigger can she GET? She is already twice the size you were when she arrived\" jamming her finger into Alice's fluffy flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... Well I guess we do not have long to find out. They don't make uniforms for anyone bigger than her\" Alice nodded back.</span></div></div>",

Every single item from the fridge would disappear a few days a week, then everyday of the week and eventually all employees were advised to keep lunches and food items at their desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to add a 2nd, then 3rd Milkshake Machine in the break room since the machines were always on empty. There were a handful of people who enjoyed the milkshake machine which had been a popular addition with the corpulent staff since being introduced by Alice when she became manager, But when asked, it seemed no really drank the milkshakes since they were always on empty even with the 2nd and 3rd additions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria surprisingly was a good employee according to corporate which used an algorithm, HR representative and the manager notes to do all employee evaluations. She started doing well especially after the corporate Ergonomics team came and got Victoria a wireless headset (due to the fact her constant snacking kept knocking her headset off), a larger keyboard for her sausage like fingers and a reinforced bench wide \"office chair\". Even with all the snacking and weight gain it seemed that at least in corporate eyes Victoria was doing a good job as Alice's secretary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria herself was the definition of massive. Her arms were as large around of average sized people's waist, her tree trunk thighs were literally as thick as most tree trunks and at this rate would soon be the actual size of Redwood Tree trunks. Her booty was incomprehensible, when she sat down on her new reinforced office chair which could literally hold a basketball team worth of bench warmers it nearly reached the end of both sides and at the rate she was going she would catch up to the ends soon enough. Her ass itself looked like 2 medicine balls were stuffed into a tight skirt and tights. Her breast were massive and pushed up against her chins at all time but didn't seem that big due to her belly. In reality one breast was easily 2-3 handfuls worth and then some but her belly was just that big. She had a triple belly, that stuck out a few feet in front of her and hung down mid thigh. It was impossible to hug her without getting completely surrounded by belly fat and even then you couldn't reach your arms completely around her. Her belly was so obscene that usually you couldn't even hug that completely let along her whole body. It goes to say she was eating near 24/7 while at work and her belly and whole body were showing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long upgraded from gas station snacks to finishing off Costco amounts of various chips/candies/chocolates at her desk throughout the day and bringing even more goods in the next day to keep up with her expanding appetite. Her constant snacking, employee break room food, along with Alice's meals (which were getting more and more costly to provide) meant Victoria was becoming bigger at an even faster rate! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Victoria still as oblivious as ever and didn't consider herself a BIG woman. She still considered herself a beautiful woman so when she discovered the bbw/feedism scene she dove head 1st into it, filming her feasts and body on clipsforsale, doing cam-girl work of her eating, going on feeder/bbw websites and blogs, and making wishlists that supplemented her massive diet. At this rate she passed massive and was in the Gargantuan phase but seemed completely indifferent to her size never acknowledging that she was fat... or critically obese in this case. She was argubably the biggest web model out there.. literally in weight and number of growing fans. Of course kept this on the DL but for the amount her belly could hold every day, she needed the extra money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone was talking to Alice and gossiping on a REGULAR basis making her feel a part of the office like never before thanks to her Secretary's growing size. A few pounds had rubbed off on her, she was 50.... 100 pounds heavier herself since taking Victoria out every day to lunch for \"mentoring\" sessions but Victoria in comparison had surpassed her by so much no one seemed to notice that Alice or the office as a whole was substantially bigger since Victoria's gain. Everyone in the office noticed Victoria's gain of course though. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course, the office swelled with gossip and behind-the-back jokes about Victoria. Nobody wanted to say anything to her, however. Nobody wanted to despoil the star pupil of Alice. It was almost like spoiling the \"joke\" that was her weight. Even though the rest of the office, even the thinner moderates who usually didn't partake in the blubber politics of the office, were gaining, victoria's weight was skyrocketing at a rapid pace, a violent, sudden increase in her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, of course, someone had to tell her. Of course, it wouldn't be an office member. You don't just tell someone they're fat, especially at Gordge, unless you wanted them taken down a notch. Fatness was power. If you weren't fat, then promotions were like rain in the desert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if that was true, then Stephanie Links was the Sahara. She had been a sorority girl, the typical thin blonde. She had managed to get through freshman year without a single pound gained, and even after college, she managed to avoid any weight gain. She was a brand new hire, and even with all the temptations that Gordge offered, she gained barely a single pound. For the longest time, stephanie had wondered how this place worked, how its machinations functioned, until she saw Victoria huffing and puffing at the milkshake machine. <i>So THAT'S how this place works.</i> She saw a golden opportunity, an elevator to success. All she would have to do would be eat like a whale, and she could practically be corporate. Her plan had solidified like instant concrete, so she picked out a soda, and a bag of cheetos, and went back to her desk to begin her highway to obesity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Victoria sat down at her desk, her uniform, which was quite snug recently, gave off a loud <i>Shhhhhkt!</i> Victoria looked about and she saw: At the cusp of her expansive stomach, there was a tear, through which her stomach hung out as if her shirt were open. Buttons lie on her desk and the floor, and black material lay about as if her clothes exploded off. This meant she would have to go see the Company-hired tailor. With the aid of the desk, she stood up and waddled to his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm.\" spoke the tailor as his measuring tape fit to the last portion of Victoria, her expansive stomach. His \"measuring tape\" had to be cobbled together out of two normal tapes, her stomach coming out to about 80 inches. \"Well, miss Victoria, I don't exactly know how to tell you this, but, our company doesn't make uniforms to fit someone of your size. She stared on in disbelief. \"Well, can't you tailor one?\" The pencil-moustached tailor shook his head. \"Well, no. There are certain regulations about how the company logo should be displayed, and if your uniform would be made to that size, the logo would have to be distorted. Simply put, you'd have to lose some weight to fit into the uniform. You'll be given 5 months paid leave,and if you're not down to a tailorable size before those 5 months are up, then the company will have to let you loose.\" </span></div></div>",

She was trying her hardest to sit in her office chair but couldn't squeeze her big cheeks with the armrests on. \"This is the 3rd time I've asked our HR team to fix this problem. I've had enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. It was HR's problem for sure. Victoria had no idea that her bulbous bottom was responsible for each time the \"armrests were too narrow\". Once again the company janitorial staff came over to remove yet another sets of arms from her chair. Feeling victorious, Victoria plopped down on her chair. More ass off the wide chair than on it. The chair made a groaning noise. It knew it's time in this world was nearing its end. It squeezed and creaked, begging for Victoria to lift her titanic ass. However, Victoria is not one to be self-aware. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Creeeeek!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in an instant, Victoria was on the floor. Chair in pieces.

She figured she'd have some clothes to grow into, but this is now the third size she's outgrown from Jenna's old wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first few weeks Victoria struggled to eat the lunch provided by Jenna. Victoria was eating well beyond her comfort level day after day. But the last few weeks were different. Not only did Victoria eat everything that was ordered for her, she started ordering seconds. The 450 pound beauty was really starting to put on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n450...454...462...469...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria became so accustomed to filling herself until she was painfully full. And at first she was just doing it at lunch, but it started to spread. She's eat beyond her limit at home, work, and at the bakery. And every meal she completed, it took just that much more for her to feel full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n472...479...482...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria couldn't stop. She liked the feeling of being full and her lack of self-control constantly got the best of her. She continued to ignore the obvious signs. A new wider office chair, her thighs rubbing together, the waddling, the belt breaking, the pants splitting, the tightening door frames (even though she was already sliding sideways through them). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n489...493...499...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that Jenna was providing larger and larger clothing. Victoria found herself eating more when her clothes weren't as snug. But that was the problem...her clothes were becoming a little too snug too fast. A pair of pants one week would be impossible to pull up over her ass by the end of the next week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n502...507...509...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was actually shocked that her plan worked so well...actually a bit too well. Victoria was blowing up faster than she ever had while working at Gorge. A worried Jenna stopped the free lunches, but that didn't stop Victoria.

Her spine curved against the white walls, despite her best attempts at adjacency, and her head turned ever so slightly into the doorway. She could hear every word that the other women had said about her\u2014and it was quite shocking to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t exactly close or anything, she never really hung out with anyone outside of work. Mellissa and Alice were pretty tight, Courtney wasn\u2019t really into the bar scene, and Christina was too uptight. But even still, she never would have expected for them to make such rude remarks about her weight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne chubby brown hand traced the outline of her swollen side, inwardly measuring what felt like a mile-long stretch of taught tanned skin. She was aware that she had gained some weight working at Gordge, especially in the past few months, but\u2026 well it wasn\u2019t like any of them had any room to talk! They were all easily some of the fattest women Vicky had ever seen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Except for Christina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whatever! Either way, women who weigh at least three-hundred pounds apiece should have no room to talk crap about someone like her\u2014who, at best was just a little\u2026 thick! Thicker than usual! It was after the holidays, everyone picks up a few extra pounds and inches after the holidays passed right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even as she coached herself into her comfort zone, one hand slowly came to rest on her bulging pot-belly. With two fingers, she pinched her meaty lovehandle and found that it had actually joined into her waistline\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plump lower lip stuck out and formed a pout, the growling in her stomach completely ignored in favor of some well-earned wallowing in self-depreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wouldn\u2019t be laughing when they all put on another fifty pounds by Easter! And Vicky knew they would\u2014there wasn\u2019t an ounce of self-control between any of them! She\u2019d show them, one way or the other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething of a strange coincidence occurred the very next day, if you can believe that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Alice, the only woman fluent in German and not interested in counting Vicky\u2019s calories for her, had been selected by Jessica\u2014their CEO\u2014to visit the Munich branch of Gordge. For some reason or another, Alice nor Jenna could really remember why, the bottom-heavy brunette was to be relocated for six months so as to monitor their company\u2019s German sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like she was too terribly important around the office, really just handling some clients and doing the billing, but apparently those Rosetta Stone discs had really paid off in the long run after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving always wanted to travel abroad, the swollen sweetheart accepted the offer eagerly and with little deliberation. Christina was to be hired officially to take her place (much to Courtney\u2019s dismay as she had grown quite attached to the idea of having her own personal errand-girl) and Mellissa promised to take care of her apartment while her friend was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising that, in the mess of things, Alice ultimately forgot all about voracious Victoria and her ballooning belt line. That conversation in the break-room evaporated by bed that night, she\u2019d hardly remembered it by the next morning before all this started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was impossible for her to predict the great change in store for Victoria, as well as the rest of the office that would take place in her long absence\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Victoria had many tricks up her sleeve for her revenge on her coworkers. But perhaps the biggest factor in Victoria\u2019s revenge wasn\u2019t even her own doing. Alice who was supposed to be out of the office on a business trip had to back out at the last moment due to passport issues. In order to save the company from taking a big hit, Jenna went on the trip instead. This left the office with no one in charge. Technically Courtney was supposed to take over in a situation like this but while she was a good worker, she was no leader and so the office was without authority. This caused productivity to drop tremendously. Without Jenna able to sign off on decisions very little work was done. The office became like in grade school class when a clueless substitute showed up. This gave Victoria plenty of time to exact revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria\u2019s first move was to leave tons of food in the office kitchen and break room. She entered the office early in the morning and left cakes and cookies and pasta all over the break room. The kitchen was already full of food anyway but it tended to get emptied before the first lunch break due to the tremendous appetites of the employees. Victoria made it so that food was always available. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother trick up Victorias sleeve was that she was in charge of distributing mail around the office. She started giving her coworkers food with their packages and mail saying the food was from a client of the company that was a food vendor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also brought in large quantities of food saying that they were for Jenna but that the rest of the office could have them in Jenna\u2019s absence. It wasn\u2019t that hard to believe since Jenna definitely had friends in the food business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother of Victorias strategies was to give some of her own food to the rest of the office. Jenna had Vicky\u2019s desk stocked full of snacks (as were everyone elses). Since Victoria was also trying to lose weight she would ask if other people wanted her food instead. She would say \u201cOh Melissa, do you want these doughnuts? I don\u2019t like jelly filling.\u201d She always came up with some thing else other than that she was trying to lose weight so that they wouldn\u2019t get suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria also had tried to hang out with her co workers more. Taking them out to lunch, talking with them during breaks, even having dinner with them after work. This allowed her to influence their eating habits more. Bringing them to all you can eat buffets, bringing them food to eat during breaks (which were a lot longer without Jenna around). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even verbally encouraged them to eat more, often saying \u201cthat\u2019s all your ordering?\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m still hungry. Why don\u2019t we have one more course?\u201d She also gave them compliments on how good they looked. She would say \u201cHave you lost weight recently?\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re looking better than ever!\u201d This gave them a false sense of security about their weight. Making them think that they weren\u2019t gaining that much weight at all. It stopped them from noticing the effects of Victorias revenge, while also making them much more likely to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were even more one time things that Victoria did for her revenge, but they were too specific to explain. Either way you looked at it Melissa, Courtney, Alice, and Christina were in for a surprise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Through the use of a helpful web page she\u2019d found on the internet during her countless hours of inactivity (at work, no less) Vicky was finding more and more ways to influence the eating habits of those around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trick was, Vicky had found, to look up weight <i>loss</i> guides that dealt with psychology and do the opposite. One guide told her that you could trick your brain into feeling fuller if you ate your meal on a larger plate, so the very next day the bottom-heavy secretary went out and replaced all the paper plates in the break room with ones that were the same color, but noticeably smaller. Another said that if a dieter thought about eating unhealthy food while eating better, the hacked outcome would result in weight loss. So, as a precaution, every time she ate with her co-workers, she would talk about diets she had researched that involved leafy greens and healthy foods. Just to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lots of others, while she was at it. No soft lighting because it affected the sensors in the brain somehow. When Vicky invited them out, she would only take them to restaurants with fluorescent bulbs flickering overhead. When bringing food from home, she would pile bigger portions on the smaller plates. Vicky had even gone so far as to stay up late some nights and home-make complicated recipes from her Nana\u2019s cookbook (the overconsumption of such cookery a major source of self-esteem issues for her in childhood!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results were\u2026 predictable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Thursday morning at the office, just past nine \u2018o\u2019 clock, everyone sans Jenna was working as diligently as their overstuffed little fingers would allow them to. Courtney in the back was teaching Jenna\u2019s temporary replacement how to sign into the company account for the fifteenth time, Christie was working herself ragged to do Courtney\u2019s work while she was otherwise occupied, and Alice was handling the Zimmerman account\u2014rather than enjoying a nice trip across the pond due to an expired passport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at her computer screen, wide eyes reflecting yet another complaint from her ficklest of customers, while she idly lifted a chip to her mouth. She took a half-bite, little crumbs dotting the corners of her mouth, while she worked diligently. With every keystroke, Alice\u2019s doughy upperarms quivered wildly. At every movement she made, in fact, her body shook like soft ivory gelatin. However the quaking and quivering reverberating in her stomach and spreading slowly throughout her rippling mass was not her doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy footsteps shook the floor beneath her as Melissa returned from her trek to the company break room. As per usual, her friend\u2019s mighty bobbing belly was the first thing that peered past the opening of her tiny office. In her flabby arms were an absolute armful of snacks and treats, at least one of every variety that the black box in the break room could provide. Alice pursed her lips and raised her eyebrows as she heard Melissa struggle to sit, no doubt her friend\u2019s overconsumption over the past few days was beginning to catch up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Melissa wheezed, Alice could hear her struggling to open up her own bag of chips, \u201cAl, you gotta go check out the break room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice pushed herself away from the desk and swiveled around, her girth swaying ever so slightly with the force of the action. She looked to Melissa, who had two cans of Dr. Pepper nestled snugly between her heaving hooters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs <i>that</i> where you got all that from?\u201d Alice asked incredulously as she scoped the magnificence of Melissa\u2019s meal, \u201cMel, I thought you were saving up for that treadmill?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa pssh\u2019awwed at the notion, little yellow crumbs spewing slightly in Alice\u2019s direction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I\u2019d actually pay for all of this!\u201d Melissa said in a half-whisper, \u201cThe vending machine\u2019s open, like <i>wide</i> open! I think when that guy in the little brown shorts came to refill it (Mm! those brown shorts!) he forgot to close it or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa\u2026\u201d Alice chastised, putting her hands on her lovehandles sternly, \u201cThat\u2019s stealing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky is what I call it.\u201d Melissa said greedily before tipping the bag over her head and allowing several chips to cascade down onto her tongue, \u201cSh\u2019the besht thing thatsh happened to me all week!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sighed, shaking her head for the sake of her gluttonous friend. She was heavy, very heavy mind you, but at least she tried to do something about it (once in a while\u2026 every now and then\u2026maybe\u2026). She had talked with Melissa just yesterday about dieting over lunch, even <i>Vicky</i> had gotten really into the discussion! But as soon as someone presented unlimited free access to the vending machine, Melissa\u2019s mind went right to how much she could grab before anyone else could\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s worse was that things seemed to be falling apart around here left and right with Jenna gone to Germany. First the soda machine broke, then the freezer shorted out and everyone had to eat everything in there before it went bad, and now the vending machine was just open for everyone to stick their greedy little fingers in. Jenna should never have left\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a loud BANG! Caught her attention, causing the bottom-heavy brunette to duck instinctively towards the computer. It seemed everyone did, the collective groan of overloaded office chairs could be heard all around the office. After a moment of silence, everyone regained their senses. Alice looked behind her, towards her cubicle wall, to find a little button wedged tightly around a crack\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice turned around to see Melissa, grinning abashedly. One of the gaps on her blouse had widened exponentially, allowing a big circle of her belly to be seen by all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d she giggled nervously, \u201cS-Sorry Al\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Due to Jenna\u2019s absence Christina was officially hired and made Courtney\u2019s unofficial apprentice/secretary. A more appropriate term would be that she was Courtney\u2019s bitch. Courtney promptly dumped all her work on Christina. This made Christina, who was already a very high strung person, incredibly stressed. All that stress caused Christina to eat. Usually a very healthy eater, she had found comfort in eating sugary, fatty, and greasy food.  This was bad news for Christina since her mentor, Courtney always had food nearby (she also always had food in her mouth, on her shirt, in her pocket, in her stomach, in her car, on her desk, in her desk, under her desk, in her bag, in her purse, in her dreams, and on her mind). Victoria, who was clearly smarter than anyone had estimated, caught on to this development in Christina\u2019s psyche. Victoria figured out that as long as she brought up work in conversation with Christina, she would start to eat. Victoria just needed to have food available close by. Just a \u201cso how\u2019s that assignment coming?\u201d would set Christina off on a binge. Victoria watched with delight as each time Christina started to eat more and more. The first stress induced binge involved only 2 doughnuts. As Victoria exploited Christina\u2019s weakness over and over again her appetite increased as well. 2 doughnuts became three, and then three doughnuts became 2 doughnuts and 2 twinkies, etc. needless to say the results of such binges started to show.</span></div></div>",

She sat down on two chairs now that her butt required it. Then Melissa came along with a box of doughnuts. Next came Alice who\u2019s gut was completely exposed by her shirt which was missing several buttons. She plopped herself down on the chair with a heavy thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Alice. Gained weight much?\u201d Melissa said with a smirk on her fat face. Alice spread her legs apart to give space for her tremendous naked double belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have too.\u201d Alice said. Melissa had definitely also gained. The two friends were absolutely exploding out of their clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know who\u2019s gained weight? Christy!\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know she-\u201c just then Victoria entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you guys want something from the fridge?\u201d Victoria asked.

You probably just forgot about them.\u201d Victoria said. She handed the box to Alice. She sat down next to Courtney. Vicky <br>\r\nwatched the three bloated women stuff themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019re you guys talking about,\u201d Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrishty getting fat.\u201d Melissa said with a doughnut in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah she definitely gained some.\u201d Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a total blimp.\u201d Courtney added. Adjusting her huge bottom on the two chairs she used to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I don\u2019t know how she let herself go like that.\u201d Melissa said. Just then a button flew off her shirt and her gut pushed forward. \u201cOops,\u201d she said, shoving another doughnut into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa I think that\u2019s a sign that your in no position to *burp* criticize anyone\u2019s weight,\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she has definitely started eating more.\u201d Victoria added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Alice even you can admit she\u2019s gained a lot.\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 She does seem a lot *CRASH*\u201d Mid-sentence Alice fell to the ground as her chair gave way under her tremendous bottom and gut.

I told you, you gained weight!\u201d Melissa cackled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did too!\u201d Alice said, angry and embarrassed. She flopped around on the floor like a beached whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least I didn\u2019t break a *CRASH*\u201d Melissa\u2019s chair crumpled under her heavy gut.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the days became weeks, and the weeks became months, Jenna\u2019s much-anticipated return Stateside was rapidly approaching. According to the company newsletter, Jenna\u2019s style of employee motivation had done wonders for Gordge overseas. Gordge\u2019s German sister branch had increased productivity, so much so that they were receiving a well-visit from the owner herself as a reward for their miraculous turn in productivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe American branch, however, was not faring quite so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jenna gone and her laughably incompetent replacement barely able to pluck the strings on what was once a fine corporate machine, productivity had certainly gone down Stateside. Though, truthfully, only so much of it was the fault of incompetent leadership. The blame had to settle on some unwillingness to work lower on the totem pole, just as those who were unwilling had settled into a life of ease and halfassery. And pawning their work onto Christie and Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it was true, Melissa and Courtney weren\u2019t very good at their jobs if someone wasn\u2019t hovering over their shoulders. They would take breaks, extend their normal breaks, sometimes take little naps at their desks after a long day of not doing much of anything. Fortunately for them, Alice was too much of a goody-two-shoes to let the whole company suffer for her friends\u2019 lethargy, and Christie was a real pushover who was eager to prove herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Melissa would spend her whole day at her desk idly twiddling her thumbs while she attempted to make conversation with Alice. When she wasn\u2019t goofing off, Melissa could usually be found in the break room. It was practically her office now, and it showed in her rapidly expanding figure as well as her sharp decrease in wearable attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhmumum\u2026\u201d Melissa managed through a mouthful of spicy Doritos, her new office chair already on its absolute last legs of support<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Alice asked, not looking from her computer screen as she balanced (Melissa\u2019s) books on one of their more important accounts, \u201cYou know I can\u2019t hear you when you\u2026 Melissa, are you still eating those Doritos?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette beluga took a big swig of Coke before her response, her mouth ill-equipped to deal with the subtle spiciness of her latest in a long line of snacks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this is a new bag.\u201d She said smarmily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa, you know that I\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, ease off.\u201d Melissa answered somewhat testily, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about how much I eat today, I\u2019ve had a rough morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeeze, sorry\u2026\u201d Alice almost whispered, turning back to her computer screen. She paused before continuing, \u201cYou wanna talk about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoh\u2026\u201d she said huskily though another mouthful of orange chips, readjusting her belly beneath her blouse and leaving little orange fingerprints on the taut surface of her tent-like attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Melissa didn\u2019t want to talk about was the fact that her planetary paunch was finally too big for her to drive to work anymore. For weeks now, and indeed since she\u2019d started working at Gordge all those years ago, she\u2019d been scooting the seat back farther and farther. And even last week she had been able to deal with the rough steering wheel brushing against her belly. But finally it had happened\u2014she was actually too big to make any necessary turns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another pause, filled only with the sound of Alice\u2019s deceptively swift fingers typing away at the keyboard. Melissa looked up, a pout on her porcine face, and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go car shopping later today\u2026 you wanna come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Alice said apologetically, \u201cI promised Courtney I\u2019d stay after and handle the Wallaby account.\u201d At Melissa\u2019s utter dismay, Alice began to backpedal, \u201cB-But I\u2019m sure you could take Vicky! I don\u2019t think she\u2019s doing anything later today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess\u2026\u201d Melissa said sadly, \u201cYou wanna meet up with us later for dinner if we go out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou <i>always</i> go out.\u201d Alice smiled, \u201cSure, if I\u2019m not too busy we\u2019ll all go eat together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was true. Every time Vicky was around the office girls, they always seemed to be eating. More than usual. Usual being relative to the last time that they had eaten, actually. The bottom-heavy secretary had done a wonderful job rewiring her employees so that they were constantly snacking. They could, and often did, get back from one of their great gorges in the food court at the mall and go right to the break room for a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd their appetites were only getting more and more intense as the office failed to accommodate such unabashed gluttony and lack of restraint. Swivel chairs snapped in two if ladies weren\u2019t careful with how they sat, and Courtney had personally requested that the vendor company for their snack machines come twice a week instead of every Monday. Alice and Mel could no longer enter the double doors simultaneously, as they were wont to do, and Courtney could barely squeeze through the doorway to the break room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Vicky, it was karmatic justice at its finest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she entered the office she walked by Victoria. She hadn\u2019t seemed to change much other than maybe a few more extra pounds. She then waddled to her office and sat at her desk. She heard someone enter her office. She looked up to see it was Christina. At least she thought it was Christina. This person had a belly and D cups. Her thighs touched and even jiggled a bit! <br>\r\n\u201cHey Jenna just wanted to say welcome back!\u201d Christina said. She then went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later loud footsteps were heard approaching Jenna\u2019s office. Alice stood in the entrance to Jenna\u2019s office as she struggled to fit through the doorway. Alice\u2019s 420 pound body just barely made it into the office. Alice\u2019s big fleshy hips were as wide as Jen\u2019s desk and the two wobbling pillows of blubber she called a butt were the size of some sofa cushions. Literally the world\u2019s biggest sweetheart, Alice finally had the belly of a morbidly obese person. Once just a chubby persons belly, Alice\u2019s flabby gut had grown into a trio of mighty blubber rolls. Another shocking development in Alice\u2019s overfed appearance was her massive boobs. Alice always had great boobs (through thin and thick) but WOW were they bigger than ever. Her chest was a perfect slab of jiggling soft flesh, divided by the incredibly long crease that was her cleavage. Her massive breasts bounced and rippled, resting on her large belly like a flabby throne. Jenna wasn\u2019t even sure what she actually said she just stared at her body. Alice then left and went back to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time went by and then Courtney walked into Jenna\u2019s office. Or at least she tried to. She tried to enter through the door sideways. But her thick middle was too big. Eventually after a lot of work she slid through the entrance. Jenna was again taken aback by the appearance of her employee. Courtney was absolutely enormous at about 480 pounds. Courtney was nearing Jenna\u2019s level of fatness. A level of fatness where folds just appeared everywhere. Bone and joint had been buried in many layers of fat. Looking at Courtney you couldn\u2019t even tell where her spine ended and her legs began. There were just large slabs of fat rubbing against other bags of fat. Her organs were protected by an almost cartoonishly thick casing of gelatinous blubber. Even If you dug your hands into Courtney\u2019s many creases and folds you\u2019d never find any evidence of a rib cage. Courtney left, barely, and went back to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last person to enter Jenna\u2019s office that day was Melissa. After seeing the other employees of the office already Jenna was a bit more prepared for Melissa\u2019s appearance than with the other girls. However when Jenna looked up to the figure standing before her desk, her jaw dropped. Everything about Melissa\u2019s appearance was piggish. She couldn\u2019t of been less than 500 hundred pound. Melissa was literally pouring out of her clothes. All the gelatinous fat she had once been able to cram in her pants had now overflowed. Her enormous middle spilled over the front of her pants. Her bottom belly roll hung like a doughy curtain over her private parts. The top half of her body was simply swollen. The top of her overfed gut looked puffy and bloated as it was crushed by her two completely swollen blobs of fat that were her breasts. They could barely be classified as boobs since they had become so smothered in fat. Melissa wasn\u2019t so much wearing her shirt as much as the shirt was barely hanging on her bulges of fat. The shirt looked like open curtains at a theater. And if her shirt was the curtains than her belly was the stage. Almost every inch of Melissa\u2019s creamy white belly flesh was on display. As Melissa turned around to exit Jen\u2019s office, Jenna caught a glimpse of Melissa\u2019s bulging backside. Her two inflated cheeks completely filled out the back of her pants. A good 4 inches of her deep crack showed over the top of her pants. Her butt had managed to have something like a muffin top effect as her pants dug into the enormous blob of fat that was her backside. As Melissa went back to her desk Jenna\u2019s mouth agape at the sight of the new Melissa.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Aahhh\" Vicky let out a loud sigh as she unbuttoned her work slacks. She leaned back in her extra-wide-yet-undersized swivel chair and smiled, drumming one hand on her free belly and the other reaching for a chocolate and peanut butter smoothie, her fourth of the morning so far. Victoria rationalized that she was going to need the energy for the grueling day ahead of her. In the past couple months of scheming, Victoria had been taking a much more active role in fattening her co-workers. Courtney and Melissa were always game for a good meal but Alice and Christina often needed a little encouragement or just a little push to convince them to get that next serving at the buffet. Vicky had become exceptionally skilled at sweet-talking Alice into not feeling guilty for not stopping at three desserts or at coaxing Christina into making her next cheeseburger a triple instead of a double. Of course, Vicky was eating pretty much the same portions as everyone else when they went out to eat or binged in the break room, but she had to keep everything looking natural, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem started to develop when the girls all stopped eating at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome days, Alice and Melissa would take their lunch break together followed by Courtney then Christina, other days Christina would bring a big lunch then still want to go out to eat after Courtney had already gotten back from the buffet, other days Melissa would order out for the office without realizing Alice and Christina had already brought leftovers from First Lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Victoria bore witness to all of it. The girls were already so used to seeing Victoria gorge right alongside them with every meal, always making sure it seemed like the obscene amount of food they put away each sitting wasn't the slightest bit unnatural, so it made sense to ask her if she was free. After all, the supersized secretary was actually just a little overqualified for her job, so she rarely had much left to actually do except eat to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vicky!\" Courtney would say from across the office. \"I'm going to Juan Gringo's for Second Lunch. You coming this time?\" Naturally, if Courtney hadn't been so overwhelmingly distracted by the rumbling from her belly, she would notice Victoria already elbow deep in homemade lasagna and macaroni salad with Christina, numerous scattered chicken bones and crumbled sandwich wrappers serving as the only remaining testament to the first half of the sizeable meal that left poor Christina cradling her pooching stomach in a mixture of discomfort and satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go ahead,\" Christina would try to say, \"I'm so stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way girl! You're barely eating anything today,\" Vicky would coo softly, serving the two of them another portion of lasagna and macaroni. \"And Mommy just loves that you're in love with her cooking!\" Christina would groan deeply, adjust her work slacks and resolutely pick her fork back up. At this point, Christie didn't even bother arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes or no, babe?\" Victoria would hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, let me finish up with Tina and then we can go pick up Alice. I think she said she wanted to go out too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that slowly became the new office routine. Vicky would be sure to breeze through her morning work routine as quickly as possible to hunker down and get ready for what she was now inwardly calling the \"lunch gauntlet\", three or four hours of almost back to back meals where Vicky \"supervised\" the individual girls' portion sizes and gave them dieting advice or hot tips on new restaurants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Victoria would be concerned about eating three or four super heavy lunches a day, but she knew she had to play the part to avoid any suspicion. And she had to eat just as much as they did at each separate outing so as to not make the girls feel self-conscious about their portion sizes, especially Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, Alice,\" she sneered. The quiet blonde hadn't been nearly as harsh in her criticisms of her increasingly corpulent colleague, but Victoria was hardly one to discriminate. Vicky <i>loved</i> seeing what all the extra weight was doing to Alice's already overblown hourglass. \"Biggest ass in the office?\" Vicky smirked to no one in particular, remembering that rude comment but not who said it. \"Not for long, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Alice's ample ass that made her a particular target for the porcine plotter. Already extremely top-heavy, with a sizeable belly to boot, it seemed like Alice's recent surge in size had predominantly gone southward. Alice's hips absolutely poured out of any chair she sat on, armrests being completely out of the question. Hips so wide Alice might soon get stuck if she tried to waddled into the break room without turning sideways. Yes, Alice waddled now. With thighs so fat forcing her to widen the arcs of her footsteps, the former fit cheerleader could only shuffle along as fast as she could swing one jiggling, chafing thigh past another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was ballooning in size, having even surpassed Melissa in weight, no small feat indeed, and teetering somewhere in the high 400s meant she was inching closer in size to Courtney or even Jenna before she left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria couldn't have been happier, and it might have been that happiness that led to her being distracted. See, Victoria herself had needed the armrests removed from her swivel chair too even though it was one of Jenna's extras. But on the day that that happened, Vicky had gotten so frustrated that she took Melissa to an all-you-can-eat burger buffet and hadn't left until Melissa had put away enough beef to leave herself in a food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the day months prior where Vicky <i>herself</i> had gotten stuck in the break room door frame, she had decided to drown her sorrows by drowning Alice in cake and ice cream, then quickly put the event out of her mind and simply grew accustomed to turning sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria herself was already quite familiar with the sensation of chafing on her thighs, and had far slower and more plodding waddle than Alice. Melissa might have needed to buy a new car to accommodate her gigantic, rippling middle, but Victoria had finally needed to splurge for one with a strong suspension and plenty of room for her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky finished the rest of her smoothie then began the arduous task of standing up from her chair. It sure had been getting rather difficult lately, she noted. It was about time to round up a couple of the girls for first lunch. With a quick rock back and forth, she heaved herself upright with an unladylike grunt and braced her desk for support. Then she glacially navigated herself from behind the front desk and set off at her uneasy slow pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking was getting <i>exhausting</i> lately. Vicky trudged along at the pace of a snail, wobbling past unoccupied cubicles towards the break room. Reaching the door and finding the room empty, she momentarily leaned against the frame to catch her breath. Then, she turned sideways and began her teetering, awkward unbalanced shuffle. Only to find herself stuck. That was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky looked down with surprise. Her fat, fluffy belly was pressed tight against one end of the door frame and her massive, bulging left butt cheek oozed over the other. Vicky frowned and pushed herself harder with a grunt. Damnit, she thought, I thought Courtney had gotten the stupid doorframe widened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Courtney had. It was the same day Vicky and Alice had gone out shopping for looser work pants. The same pants she had left unbuttoned now. Vicky had humorously remarked that the shade of her pants were the same as the office chair she had been using at the time. The same office chair that had snapped under Victoria's weight weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky? Uh oh, Honey. You okay there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil, Vicky thought, her mood officially less than pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney!\" she angled her head toward her friend and huffed, \" I thought you said you were getting the door to the break room widened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I did, babe, was the belly-heavy belle's reply. \"Remember? We talked about how cute some of the construction guys were..\" Courtney rubbed the top of her stomach absentmindedly. Vicky being stuck in the doorway was an immediate obstruction to her casserole and that meant heaving her out was the morbidly obese manager's immediate priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do I have like, no space? Omigosh how does anybody else fit through here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all fit fine ever since,\" Courtney mused, calmly scratching her second chin. \"Well, Alice's hips still brush the sides a little bit, but at least she doesn't have to turn sidew-\" Courtney quickly looked her beleaguered coworker up and down. \"Well, at least she fits,\" she quickly concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone else still fits? Even Alice?\" Vicky said, more to herself than to her colleague. Now it was time for Vicky to look Courtney up and down. The woman was massive, anyone could see that. She was the reason the doors had even originally been widened in the first place, and, since then, she certainly hadn't stopped widening herself. But Courtney and everyone could squeeze through just fine? That didn't make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the realization hit Victoria with all the force of a massively obese woman crashing to the ground after settling down on an overburdened swivel chair. The reason why Courtney, Alice and even Melissa always made sure to remember to invite Vicky to lunch or bring her back something if they went without her. The reason why Alice simply politely smiled, nodded and kept her head down any time Vicky slipped her some \"pro\" diet advice. The reason why Christina always felt okay with having another slice if Vicky was having two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause all of them, even Courtney, felt figuratively and literally overshadowed by Victoria's increasing mass. Completely consumed with watching the other girls fatten up themselves, Vicky had become the fattest girl in the office.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Victoria gave up shortly after that. With just a few months left before Jenna's return the irate Italian had given up on fattening up anyone else in the office and resigned herself to listlessly munching the majority of her time between meals away, silently fuming about her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's their fault I'm so huge!\" she had said to herself. \"First those hypocrites tease me about getting fat, then I completely fuck up my diet trying to get <i>them</i> to fatten up some more,\" she thought, deflecting blame like only a millennial could. \"And now I'm like, super super fat and they're probably just going to be even bigger assholes about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, time showed that Victoria was wrong. As the next few months lulled on by, no mean or hateful comments surfaced behind Vicky's back. The girls still all invited Vicky to lunch or ate together when they could, they all gossiped together about how big Jenna might be when she got back from Germany, they all shared their diet and weight struggles together when chatting in the break room. It seemed that what had honestly started as manipulation on Victoria's part had actually blossomed into friendships simply from the amount of time the girls spent hanging and gorging together. Now that she was off of her fattening kick, Victoria was spending the same amount of time with her co-workers but actually beginning to <i>enjoy</i> herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the mean comments never came. Victoria was still the biggest girl in the office, but it was more fun to include her in talking about Jenna than it was to talk about her behind her back; nobody wanted to hurt her feelings. In a shocking display of inner maturity, Victoria began to think that her co-workers' cattiness towards her in the past might have had a lot more to do with how distant and sometimes outright cold she was toward them. With Victoria finally becoming fast friends with her employees, they'd never dream of upsetting their increasingly corpulent secretary. And as a result, Victoria almost felt bad for trying to fatten up her coworkers in the first place. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like Vicky hadn't payed the price. After submitting a request to have the break room door widened again, she'd lumbered off at the end of the day to see about her sartorial problems and had, as usual, put the whole event of getting stuck behind her. This continued to be the routine for Victoria. Having hypercharged the appetites of the other girls in the office, Vicky was paying the consequences now as she found herself constantly being surrounded by food, constantly being asked out to eat, constantly being brought extra helpings and leftovers from concerned colleagues. She wasn't quite aware of this herself, but she ate quite a bit more than anyone in the office, and that was certainly saying something. Vicky may have thrown in the towel with getting her new girlfriends to gain weight, but they hardly needed the help anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last half year or so, each office girl had undergone a rather shocking horizontal growth spurt. Christina had kissed the 200s goodbye some time ago and was poised to start knocking on 400's door any day now. She now cradled a quite considerable belly, particularly whenever she had eaten a large meal. Said belly may have been large, constantly jiggling and protruding wherever she went, but it still had absolutely nothing on Melissa's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbly brunette had only gotten more bubble-shaped as time passed. Her great, wobbly orb of a stomach filled out the entirety of her lap and was finally beginning to overtake her knees when she sat down. It stuck out obscenely far in front of her, sagging down heavily when she stood and jiggling constantly as it slapped against her thighs when she walked. The thighs in question didn't hold a candle to Alice's or Vicky's, not yet, but there was more than enough girth to cause Melissa to have trouble with pants even when she left her enormous belly untucked and the zipper undone. That was hardly an issue for Mel, though. Always one to prioritize comfort over anything else, Melissa was content to sit back and let her massive midsection dominate her appearance. Nobody could blame the girl whenever she popped a button on a recently purchased blouse since few people could fathom how she even buttoned her blouses anymore; Melissa was clearly starting to have difficulty reaching past her belly. Being one of the shorter girls in the office meant that, even though she was a few dozen pounds lighter than Courtney, she had the widest waist in the office. Not that the other belly-heavy babe  wasn't giving her some serious competition, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney was becoming so shockingly obese that even Jenna pre-Germany paled to her in size. Her heavy, two-tiered tummy absorbed so many of the bovine brunette's caloric intake that it actually managed to distract from the enormous, fantastically heavy breasts that rested on top of the upper roll. Courtney had to be close to 600 pounds now. However, bottom-heavy hourglass Alice had surpassed \"close to\" some time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Vicky had shown any particular fervency towards thickening Alice, it certainly showed. Alice had left the 600 pound mark in the dust recently, and didn't seem to be slowing down one bit. She had continued to bottom out with her weight gain, leading to stupendously wide hips and an ass that jutted so far away from her that she was actually taller than Courtney when the two of them sat down. Fatter than she had ever been in her life, Alice's hips cleared a wide, wide berth for her wherever she went, whether it be the Fatburger counter for another discount family meal or the food court at the mall after a wardrobe adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, those hips completely and utterly paled in comparison to Victoria's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody else in the office had grown like Victoria had in the past several months. Being both fatter than anyone else in the office and more proportionally bottom-heavy than even Alice was, The ultrasized Italian bombshell took up a LOT of space whenever she needed to sit down, which was often. Dainty, plump feet and thick, meaty calves exploded into impractically thick thighs that had no hope of separating from each other no matter how wide a stance Vicky took. Each leg must have had a greater circumference than a beer keg at their thickest point and the ass that they supported was simply breathtaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike oversized twin yoga balls, Vicky's giant, unbelievably fat ass extended so far behind her that, even when turned sideways she was still wider than Melissa or Courtney at the hips. Victoria had no hope of fitting into any slacks that weren't custom made, and had just as much luck with attempting to wear dresses. Dresses rode up her titanic thighs, hugging her absurdly wide hips and leaving Victoria's monumental bubble butt free to jiggle as much as it pleased as she waddled from her desk to the break room or to the vending machine and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, G cups were certainly nothing to scoff at, and Victoria's double belly may have been looking more and more like Courtney's each day, particularly after a very \"fulfilling\" lunch break, but nothing compared Victoria's incredible ass and, with the rate it was growing, few things probably ever would. Not even Alice's mighty, jutting rear needed as sturdy and wide a sitting space as the supersized secretary. Victoria's outstanding, bench-bending butt had no hope fitting through any standard doorway, sideways or not, and her ridiculously wide hips stuck out just a little bit farther than her thick love handles with every passing day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Vicky was closing in on 700 pounds, and if the strain her hips were putting on her outfit were any indication of things to come, she didn't seem to show much sign of stopping.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was only a matter of time until these subtle psychoactive modifications began to take their toll on the well-fed ladies of Gordge Incorporated even in the absence f their scheming secretary. The hardships of picking up the slack where Jenna had left off was hard enough (moreso on some than others). Jenna\u2019s absence had certainly caused a vacuum effect in the workload around the office, as her replacement was hardly up to par with what everyone had become accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you believe her?\u201d Courtney guffawed audibly as she leaned onto the counter, her backfat spilling onto the clean countertop, \u201cActually suggesting that I work <i>through</i> my three \u2018o\u2019 clock break so I can get some assignment done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina, always seated nearby, hung her head low between her hands at her mentor\u2019s mentioning of the assignment in question. She could only grumble under her breath as the whopping woman easily snacked on a jelly-filled donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peculiar way with which the colossal Courtney tended to half-sit on the countertop in the breakroom was somewhat understandable for a woman of her size. She was big, and being so big naturally meant that she was quite heavy. Her feet often got tired with her standing for any period of time, so it was only natural for her to seek solace from actually supporting her own great girth. However today, as it had for the past few days or so, Courtney\u2019s gut seemed to hang just a little bit lower. Her second chin just a bit fuller, and her cheeks a bit rounder. Her blouses, well-tailored for a woman of her size as always, seemed to be fitting snugger across her general expanse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was no wonder, this had been her fourth donut in fifteen minutes. On top of lunch, where she and the girls had gone to the food court. And then there was before that, where she\u2019d come in to acquire her usual breakfast of no less than seven items from the vending machine. To say nothing of how quickly her stash of junk was diminishing from her desk\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t like her either.\u201d Melissa added as she scarfed down a honeybun, \u201cShe said that I shouldn\u2019t eat when I have customers on the line. I mean, I <i>know</i> that, it was like a one time thing! Seriously, get off my ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice idly reached into the box of donuts, claiming at least one before Melissa and Courtney managed to go through them all (again\u2026) She grabbed two, an apple-filled one, her personal favorite, and then a cr\u00e8me filled one that was particularly plump. She eyed it for a second, squeezing it a little before determining its contents. As she herself was not a big fan of cr\u00e8me-filled donuts, and she\u2019d rather have someone other than Courtney eat one, she quietly turned to Christie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Christie, do you like cr\u00e8me-filled donuts?\u201d she asked kindly as the scrawny ex-intern picked lifelessly at her salad, \u201cI mean, they\u2019re almost gone and I know how you\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>God yes</i>\u201d Christie answered emphatically, snatching the donut from Alice\u2019s chubby hands and stuffing nearly half the whole thing in her mouth, \u201cSho shtreshed out lately.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice watched as the mousey mentee tore her meal apart with an intensity she hadn\u2019t seen since Melissa or Courtney after losing an important client. After she finished the first one, which wasn\u2019t long, Christie actually reached into the box and pulled out two more for herself and put them on top of her salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d she apologized genuinely, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 God, I didn\u2019t know working here was going to be so tough on my nerves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not.\u201d Alice answered with a smile, \u201cat least, not for everyone. We all know Courtney works you too hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie rolled her eyes, \u201c<i>Way</i> too hard\u2026\u201d she said with a huff, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why we don\u2019t put Vicky on duty with us. I mean, we hardly ever get phone calls, everything\u2019s done by e-mail. You\u2019d think that Jenna would have put her on computers with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice exhaled grievously, \u201cI know, I know, but that\u2019s just how it works in the real world hun.\u201d She said softly, \u201cTell you what, why don\u2019t you come out to eat with me and the girls tonight? Vicky actually showed us a really great buffet\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one on Main?\u201d Christie half-answered, \u201cI know that one. We went there last week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I <i>loved</i> it.\u201d She answered with a smile, \u201cMaybe once Ms. Jenna gets back we can all go together. Something tells me she\u2019d like it there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething tells <i>me</i> she\u2019s already been there and cleaned the place out.\u201d Alice answered wryly, \u201cShe\u2019s actually not allowed to eat lunch at some of the restaurants around here anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d Christie said with a little whistle, \u201cBut I believe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I believe\u2014\u201c Melissa chimed in, having heard bits and pieces between her conversation with Courtney, \u201cIs that while she\u2019s off in Germany, everyone over here suddenly loses their minds.\u201d She said with a huff, \u201cI say we stick her with all the work she pawned off on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be happy, considering how much you like to flirt with our clients.\u201d Courtney said with a slurp of her coffee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-Shut up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, all I can say is\u2026\u201d Courtney stifled a burp, one hand going to stroke her bloated midsection as its many many contents churned violently inside, \u201cJenna can\u2019t come back soon enough\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

She managed to eat 4 snickers bars before the boarding of the plane started. She walked up to the airline employees near the plane entrance and handed over her ticket. The three workers stared wide eyed at Jenna\u2019s 500+ pound body. One of them even let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne moment ma\u2019am.\u201d The airline worker said, still holding Jenna\u2019s ticket.

She was hopeful that this would be a good flight for her because she got the company to get her into business class. As she walked to her seat her wide hips rubbed against the two rows of aisle seats. She finally made it to her seat. She was exhausted as she put he bags down. She couldn\u2019t believe how small the seats were in business class. She sat down with a heavy thud. after everyone had been seated The flight attendants checked for seat belts. As Jenna fidgeted with her seat belt, which barely got around her hips, a flight attendant asked her \u201cdo you need any help, miss?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I err\u2026 need an extender for my seat belt.\u201d Jenna said.

She attached the extender to one side. She pulled it around Jennas doughy middle. The extender barely got past her belly button. \u201cActually, miss. You\u2019re gonna need another extender.\u201d The flight attendant said. She fetched another extender. She came back and attached the other extender to the other side of the seat belt.

Not that she knew at that point and not that she knew at this point yet still despite her currently oblivious self and despite the naive and oblivious-tendency-wise individual she was and is she still would not have cared about it. That being said, the position she had here required her to answer a few phone calls and leave her signature on a few pages of paperwork. Other than that, despite the fact that it paid well she had nothing else to do. Eventually those things themselves would already be attended to. Other than that, she had nothing to do but wait for instructions on those things if and when they occurred which for this point did not happen further. Other than that, she had nothing to do. So, she just went and made more and more trips to vending machines and snack and other such food areas to add more foods to her stashes and stocks and supplies and piles laying on her desk table in her office desktable cubicle office cubicle office room. She did this for at least the next four morning hours. After that, she did nothing but eat, eat, eat and eat and she proceeded to eat it all. Surprisingly enough none of her clothes bursted yet despite the bulging belly she was getting. Eventually lunch time came and she ate lots more for lunch in the break room area among lunch and snack and dessert foods. Eventually it was back to work and it was only a few paperwork and phone call related stuff which did not take long. After that she just went and made the same food-related trips but increased her piles eighty eight fold all the while for the next four hours. She once again set piles and stocks etc of food and sat back down and then she proceeded to chow down and dig in with the food being enough for all of this to last until this very work day was over for Victoria. All the while as she did so, she sent food amount after food amount with one hand, the other rubbing her distended belly that despite the stretchable material it was was made of in turn was really starting to be ending up straining on the fabric of her clothes despite the stretchable material they were made out of as said. Eventually this work day was over for Victoria and all of her food she was eating was gone surprisingly enough within the described amount of time. She cleaned her fingers of any food, wiped them clean with some napkins and then had managed to see to it that she took a little moment to place both of the palms of the both of her hands on her belly.</span></div></div>",

From its founding, Gordge enterprises has had fat female employees. This was mostly due to Gordge\u2019s first employees being housewives who had to find a job while their husbands were at war. For some reason in those early years of the company the employees always seemed to gain weight. This was probably due to the sedentary lifestyle of the office worker as well as Stephanie Gordge\u2019s (The founder of Gordge Enterprises) insistence on having fresh doughnuts at every meeting (she was quite the landwhale herself). At first this unusual trend of weight gain in their employees was just considered an unimportant coincidence but eventually it became ingrained in the company\u2019s identity. There became an unwritten rule in the company that \u201ca Gordge Employee should be fat\u201d and \u201ca fat employee is a good employee.\u201d Rarely are these traditions discussed openly, in fact only the higher ups at Gordge are fully aware that they exist. However, despite the majority of Gordge employees being completely oblivious to Gordge\u2019s weird tradition of fat employees, The higher ups at Gordge made sure to keep the tradition going. This leads us to Lauren Gordge, the current CEO of Gordge Enterprises. Being an actual member of Gordge family she saw nothing wrong with the \u201cgorging at Gordge\u201d and considered it a vital part of the company. Despite the rather conspiring and dubious nature of this tradition, Lauren was the farthest thing from an evil conspirer. Lauren just wants what\u2019s best for the company and for some reason (mostly cause it was what her parents always told her) that meant employees needed to gain weight. Lauren herself wasn\u2019t even that fat for a Gordge Employee, let alone a CEO. It was only 18 months ago that she had inherited the position of CEO from her mother. Lauren has a lot to prove as CEO. Her mother was 57 and over 650 pounds when she retired after 25 years as CEO. Now Lauren is just 24 and a measly 250 pounds in her first year and a half as a CEO. She had a long way to go to fill her mother\u2019s shoes. But Lauren was eager and ambitious, she wasn\u2019t going to live in her mother\u2019s shadow.</span></div></div>",

Soon though she was done with all the work she'd had to do that day.

She had really put on weight ever since getting promoted to the corporate branch, now easily 420lbs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the hefty brunette thought to go to the break room for some relaxation and company, so she heaved her incredibly bulky frame from her chair, and waddled into the employee lounge, a bit out of breath.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a year in corporate so far, Jess had finally learned just how big she'd gotten, and (somewhat begrudgingly at first) accepted it.

She was putting on even more weight than usual in her new workplace. This new self-awareness caused Jessica to have some concern over how fat she was. At her latest check up with her doctor she was a little startled to hear her say 423 pounds. Jessica figured it was about time she did something about her weight problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to get back under 400 pounds, then who knows, maybe I could get back to 250! I\u2019m sure it will be easy. It\u2019s just 24 pounds, I could put that much on in a month, how hard should it be to lose that much? I\u2019ll just cut down on my eating and then hit the gym. I got this.\u201d Jessica thought to herself. She waddled into the tall skyscraper where her office was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact here\u2019s my first step to losing weight. I\u2019m gonna take the stairs.\u201d Jessica thought to herself. Her office was on the fifth floor. Five flights of stairs would\u2019ve been a hard climb for Jessica a whole 150 pounds ago, but she was feeling a rush of confidence this morning and was ready to take on a challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed the last of her doughnut and sucked down her coffee as she approached the stairs. She was already sweating a bit from the short walk into the building. The doughy blimp put her hand the rail as she stood at the bottom of the staircase. She lifted her hefty leg up onto the first stair. Her massive belly oozed on top of her bloated thigh as her fat rolls sloshed and oozed around her crotch and waist. She slowly heaved her other plump juicy leg up. Her numerous layers and folds of doughy flesh rubbed and squished against each other awkwardly. The helpless, obese Jessica exhaled heavily as she reached the second stair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat *pant* wasn\u2019t so *gasp* hard.\u201d Jessica said. She continued to slowly lug her overfed frame up the stairs. She exerted all her force as the panting butterball hauled herself step by step. Her enormous hips took up one whole side of stairway forcing people to only use the left side of the stairs. Jessica hadn\u2019t physically tried so hard in years. The lazy whale had gone out of her way to avoid any unnecessary exertion for far too long and she was feeling it. Jess was glistening with sweat as she made her way slowly. She stopped and leaned over as she was gasping for breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey are you okay, miss?\u201d A man said as he walked by the bloated breathless blimp that was Jessica. She could barely spit any words out but she waved her hand to signal for him to go on his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d The guy said as he continued his walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow this is some workout, I haven\u2019t sweated this hard since high school.\u201d Jessica thought to herself. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just stop on this floor and use the elevator.\u201d Jessica finally composed herself. She turned around to realize she had only made it halfway up the first flight of stairs. What felt like Jessica\u2019s greatest physical feat in years was climbing up just 8 stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a good start, might as well just go back down though.\u201d She waddled back down the half flight of stairs and used the first floor elevator.</span></div></div>",

Jessica needed to stop going for every opportunity she had to eat in the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to her desk in the morning she looked at the numerous snacks on her desk. Everyone in corporate had snacks placed on their desk at the beginning of the day. Jessica picked up a pastry. <br>\r\n\u201cWell I did get all that exercise taking the stairs today. That was exhausting. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t hurt to eat some.\u201d Jessica said. She ate all the food on her desk. She took every opportunity to eat that she could find. She would say she deserves it because she took the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day she decided that it would be better to start her diet next week instead of starting it in the middle of this week. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll can really pig out this week since it\u2019s the last week before my diet.\u201d She said to herself. She ate more food than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the next Monday she decided to start her diet. <br>\r\n\u201cOh man. I\u2019m just so busy today I\u2019ll start my diet tomorrow.\u201d Jess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day she said that she should just start her diet next week since she\u2019s so busy.

Gonna have to start the diet tomorrow. Or next week actually so I have some time to fully recover.\u201d Jess told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo another week passed. Jess decided she was too busy though so again, a week passed by. But next week was a holiday so another week passed. The week after she felt like she needed to do some more research on dieting. So she waited another week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after 6 weeks she decided to start her diet. Unfortunately in those six weeks she had gained 40 pounds. She had gotten all the way up to 460 pounds. Her blubbery belly rolls had gotten even bigger and her thick gelatinous legs moved even slower. So how did her diet even go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jess loosened her belt some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they\u2019re peanut M&amp;M\u2019s so it\u2019s much healthier than just candy.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is your diet going anyway?\u201d Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah how much weight have you lost?\u201d Holly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026 I haven\u2019t really weighed myself yet. So I don\u2019t really know.\u201d Jessica said. She really had no idea whether she was losing weight at all. She was having too much fun with her diet to really care about the actual results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you should find out and tell us.\u201d Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d Jess said. She then went to get something out of the fridge. She struggled as her body remained seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay Jess?\u201d Holly asked. Jess pushed even harder as slowly her enormous saddlebags rose only to fall back down. She had eaten so much she could barely lift her fattened body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah *pant* can you *wheeze* give me a hand.\u201d Jess said. Holly and Emily slowly shuffled their way to Jess. The two obese porkers started to pull Jess up. It took a few tries as Jessica\u2019s weak muscles provided little help. Finally though her bulging bulk became upright. The three women were exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said you lost weight?\u201d Holly joked. Jess laughed a bit before realizing that maybe she wasn\u2019t just being funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Jess arrived back to her apartment after work. She slowly waddled down the hallway until she reached her room. She was exhausted and dripping with sweat. As Jess opened the door she shuffled sideways through the doorway. Her enormous belly brushed against the door frame as her two jiggling cheeks did as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah this doorway is getting seriously too small. How could that be happening?\u201d Jessica asked herself. She waddled into the apartment. She walked over to the pantry and pulled out a box of Oreo\u2019s. She had bought these for her diet because they were only single stuff Oreo\u2019s and not her usual double stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really *pant* deserve these after *wheeze* all that walking.\u201d Jess said.<br>\r\nShe sat down on the sofa and started stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy am I tired. I thought it would be easier to get around with the diet.\u201d Jess thought. Her enormous gut started to fill up even more as she emptied the container of Oreo\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUghh\u2026 this shirt feels so tight. This totally fit me a few weeks ago, how\u2019s that possible?\u201d just then two buttons flew off her shirt and landed on the ground. Her doughy fat rolls oozed over the edge of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great.\u201d Jess said. She bent over to grab the buttons off the ground only to hear her pants rip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave I gotten fatter somehow? This makes no sense. Maybe I should go weigh myself.\u201d She thought. She tried to lift herself off the couch. Her big bottom remained on the sofa. The bloated cute blob struggled as her immense overfed body only sunk deeper into the strained sofa cushions. She started to breath heavily as sweat dripped. Jess was such a butterball she had beached herself on the sofa. Her immense gut sat on her lap like an anchor. Jessica that her favorite show was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll weigh myself tomorrow.\u201d The gasping whale said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day after work, Jessica waddled her way from her car, wheezing and gasping for breath as she reached her house, having to sidle her huge frame sideways to get into the narrow doorway. She leaned against a nearby wall, her melon-sized breasts heaving, her belly getting ready to burst out of her confining blouse with each breath.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"whew...i-is it really *gasp* true that...*wheeze* I've gained...w-weight...?!\" *wheeze* G-gotta weigh myself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the gluttonous woman's grand, protruding, flabby gut grumbled with hunger. She kneaded her belly gently, then made her way ponderously towards the kitchen.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure...*pant* it can...*gasp* w-wait until after a little...*pant* snack.\" she reasoned as she reached into the pantry and brought out a large bag of cookies, then pulling a liter of orange soda from the fridge.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica took her 'snack' and plopped down on the couch, her body jiggling violently from the motion. She quickly undid her blouse, leaving her in nothing but her t-shirt and work pants. She leaned back, allowing her gigantic gut and breasts to fill the majority of her vision as she started stuffing herself with \u00a0banana creme cookies. Then, halfway through she reached a chubby hand over and took large gulps of the fizzy orange beverage. She tried to heave her bulbous, heavy bulk from her position on the couch once she finished.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff* Well, i think my *puff* little snack might throw off the scale...p-probably better if I sleep it off and wait *pant* until it's digested...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the massive flabby woman did just that, sleeping for a good few hours, her couch creaking as she shifted her weight. Jessica's gut protruding in the air as she lay on her fat covered back.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her nap, Jess managed to slowly get up from the couch, \u00a0sweating a bit from the effort. She then remembered her resolve to weigh herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess wobbled her obese body down the hallway, hips brushing against the walls as she made it to the bathroom, barely able to squeeze inside. It had been a rather spacious room before she'd joined corporate and put on so much weight; now her thick wobbling ass cheeks would brush into the counter along with her belly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heaved her jiggling frame up onto the scale, her belly squashed heavily against it's metallic neck and the wall behind it. She then fiddled with the settings until it was balanced...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whaaatt?!\" she exclaimed in shock as she double and triple-checked the read out.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't be that huge c-can I!? Four...hundred...eighty-eight...pounds...Oh my god I'm as big as Holly!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe abruptly backed up off the scale, plopping down on the toilet seat behind her. A few seconds afterward, she heard a extremely loud *CRACK* and felt it break from underneath her.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh dear...\"\u00a0</span></div></div>",

Seems like we bought somebody out!\" Jess asked her friend, giggling. Holly was busy typing with one hand, while idly eating with the other.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh *gulp* well Jess, we've recently made an agreement with a local treats place; we sponsor them, they send us a bunch of their products for free. Isn't it great?!\" Holly replied jubilantly, waving her thick, flabby arm around, indicating the ridiculous amount of the product's packaging laying about.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's pretty cool!\" said Jess excitedly, taking a couple boxes for herself, \"Think I'll go try these.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then toddered her way over to her desk, sitting down heavily in her chair. Jessica then opened the box, pulling out a pre-packaged snack cake.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hm, 'Porky Pastries' huh?\" she read the label aloud, which was adorned with a cartoonish plump pig. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess then took a tentative bite from the morsel, then another bite, followed by another, and another, and yet another until she'd managed to eat it all.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph...tat wush...*gulp* actually pretty good! I think I'll have a-*urp!* another...\" she said as she dug around in the box greedily claiming another of the sticky, sweet, plastic wrapped wonders.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she had managed to finish both boxes, which was quite a feat considering that each individual pastry was very rich. Jessica now felt like a lead weight was placed inside her stomach, weighing her down and making her feel especially bloated; her belly had become tight, having absolutely no more space within its capacity. She soothingly rubbed and massaged her overindulged stomach through the several inches of fat she now called her belly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooogh...s-*URRRRRPPP!* soooo full...*urrrrrrp!* oh gosh, my belly...*urp!* I feel so heavy, much heavier than normal...ugh I guess thats what happens when you eat *uuurrrrrp!* two whole boxes of rich pastry.

They were very out of breath as they squeezed into the Caf\u00e9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each ordered large sugary Frappuccino\u2019s that were more like milkshakes than actual coffee.

It was actually time for her break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica removed the keyboard she was balancing on her belly. She leaned forward and pushed mightily on her desk. Her arms trembled as she slowly lifted out of her seat. She then wiped the crumbs of her shirt and waddled her way to the breakroom. When she got there she saw Holly and Emily sitting at a table with a box on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey gals, what\u2019s in the box?\u201d Jessica said lowering her bulk into a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently it\u2019s the new Porky\u2019s Pastries.\u201d Holly said. Opening the cardboard box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSupposedly they are introducing some new kinds of snacks!\u201d Emily said excitedly. The cardboard box was full of smaller boxes and packages, each one carrying around 12 pastries. On top of them was a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does this say?\u201d Jessica said picking up the paper. \u201cDear customer, we at Porky\u2019s Pastries would like to introduce our brand new mascot, Porky Paige! To celebrate we are releasing an all new line of delicious Porky\u2019s products for you to enjoy!\u201d Jessica read out loud. There was a cartoonish image at the bottom of a very obese woman with a little pig snout nose, pulling a pastry out of a box of Porky\u2019s. \u201cI guess that\u2019s her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three blubbery whales each grabbed the boxes of snacks from the cardboard package. The women looked at the front packaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, Butterball\u2019s.\u201d Emily said looking at the box in her hands. \u201cTasty round cream puff\u2019s stuffed with a smooth, sweet, and buttery filling.\u201d Emily said. Right on the front of the box was a picture of Porky Paige leaning back with her big belly bursting out of her shirt. A little word bubble said \u201cI\u2019m stuffed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looked at another box. \u201cThese are called Muffin Tops. A sweet and soft chocolate chip muffin with an icing covered top.\u201d She read. On this box was a picture of Paige with her tight jeans giving her a big soft muffin top. She was holding her pinched flab with each hand. \u201cWhat does that one say, Holly?\u201d Jess asked. Holly picked up a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSugar Fingers. Long cr\u00e8me filled sponge cakes with one end dipped in powdered sugar.\u201d The box showed a bloated Paige licking one of her chubby, sugar coated fingers while holding an empty porky\u2019s box in her other hand. \u201cThey look like Twinkies.\u201d Holly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just eat them already!\u201d Jess said impatiently. Holly and Emily agreed. They tore open the packaging and started to stuff their faces. Their faces lit up with joy at the first bite. All three had been regularly snacking on Porky\u2019s for a few days already but these new pastries tasted extra good. The first bite was immediately followed by a second and a third, then a fourth. Each bite came quicker than the last. They could only moan and hum in satisfaction as they stuffed their cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica opened up a second box her pace slowed. Her belly was finally starting fill up. Looking at Holly and Emily they were feeling the same. They started to chat a little bit between snacks until they eventually filled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can ugh\u2026 eat one more.\u201d Jess said rubbing her giant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah *huff* I think I lost a button.\u201d Emily said trying to look past her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy stomach is packed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica and Holly were in Jessica\u2019s car on their way back from the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I just stocked up at the grocery store. My kitchen is packed!\u201d Jessica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be for long. I hope you didn\u2019t fill up too much at the food court.\u201d Holly joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry I\u2019ve got plenty of room. I always have room.\u201d Jessica giggled. She playfully slapped her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly and Jessica had started to do this every Saturday. Meet up around 1 and stuff themselves for the afternoon. It was their favorite time of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled over in front of Jess\u2019s house and heaved themselves to the front door. They squeezed through the front door and waddled to Jess\u2019s kitchen. Holly\u2019s face lit up. Jessica had really outdone herself with the groceries. The counters had piles of snacks and junk food. She opened the pantry revealing shelves stuffed with packages and bags of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s dig in!\u201d Holly said with giddy. Jess and Holly felt a rush of excitement and energy as they grabbed armfuls of food and went into the living room. Across from the large tv were two love seats next to each other. They had both gotten to a size where a love seat provided the most comfort (they were not going to fit on the same sofa). There were loud groans and grunts as +900 pounds of fat dropped onto the two loveseats. Jess flipped the tv on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both dropped their goodies on the coffee table and started to dig in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n40 minutes later they were still chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSho *gulp* how about those new kind of porky\u2019s?\u201d Jessica asked. Her tank top was starting to ride up her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d never stop *burp* eating them if they weren\u2019t so filling.\u201d Holly stuffed a whole twinkie in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I can\u2019t get through more than two boxes at a time\u2026 probably a good thing or else we\u2019d both be Porky Paige\u2019s!\u201d Jessica laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pretty much did look like Porky Paige. Especially as their feasting continued. They already went back to the kitchen for more. They stuffed themselves more and more. Another hour passed with no sign of the two gluttons slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly tossed an empty carton of ice cream on the overflowing trash can and leaned back. She rubbed her belly which gave an ominous growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m ready for more.\u201d Holly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Jessica and Holly both struggled to lift their bulging bodies. Jess\u2019s jeans ripped as she stood up. \u201cHrrr\u2026 whoops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waddled into the kitchen, or at least partially. Holly\u2019s wide hips jammed between the kitchen counters. Her bloated belly jiggled as her waddling mass jerked to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh.\u201d Jessica said as she looked back at Holly. Jess was already in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, push me back out and I\u2019ll come in sideways.\u201d Holly said. Jess sunk her hands deep into Holly\u2019s flabby rolls as she attempted to unjam her enormous friend. Their soft overfed bellies squished together as Jess leaned into Holly. Finally Holly popped free and slid sideways into the kitchen. They grabbed as much food as they could and waddled back to the living room in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry *huff* about that.\u201d Holly said. She immediately started shoving food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt happens\u2026 boy I think I need to make some room.\u201d Jess said. Her jeans (which were as tight as spandex) were pinching into her doughy belly fat. Jessica reached around herself to undo her belt. She struggled to get her arms around her bulging midsection. She grunted heavily as she barely managed to undo her belt, releasing the enormous pressure on her gut. Her pants button immediately popped off and her fly unzipped as her jeans struggled to contain her overflowing flab. Jess than decided to let her belly free. She pulled the front of her pants down the bottom roll. Her belly surged forward in her lap. Jessica let out a sigh of comfort. She continued to stuff her already swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d make this house big enough for someone like us to use.\u201d Holly said. She was feeding herself cookies with one hand and rubbing her belly with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah why don\u2019t they make every door and chair big enough for us? I mean why can\u2019t people accommodate for us?\u201d Jess said. Holly felt her sweatpants rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to stuff themselves all afternoon. Sandwiches, pies, cakes, chips, Holly and Jess filled their extremely obese bodies full of junk. Every trip back to the kitchen became harder and harder. Every lift off of the love seats left the two in a huff. Their clothing ripped and stretched revealing more of their pampered blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later they were still going. The living room looked like a war zone. The coffee table was covered in empty cookie trays and twinkie wrappers. Jess and Holly kept stuffing their mouths. They looked different then when they first got to Jessica\u2019s. Their cheeks were covered in sauces and frosting. Their ballooning bellies were oozing over the edge of their seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet they hadn\u2019t stopped eating. Holly ate the last oreo and tossed the empty package aside. She eyed a box of hostess cupcakes on the table in front of her. She extended her arm towards it but couldn\u2019t reach past her swollen middle. She tried to lean forward more but was still unable to reach it. She groaned as she tried to get closer to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chrrn\u2026 er got it!\u201d She huffed, snagging the cupcakes off the table. She leaned her enormous upper body back and stuffed the sugary treats in her mouth with delight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Written by firechar, edited by clutch)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Jess and Holly were both panting and gasping for breath as their poor, stretched, overtaxed bellies struggled to digest all the junk they crammed into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-think I have r-room for *huff* a bit more...\" Holly said with a grunt as she struggled to lift herself from the loveseat. She wiggled and squirmed, trying to heave her great, rotund, overfed body but to no avail. This just left her even more breathless as the whale of a woman couldn\u2019t budge an inch off her seat as her underused muscles fought to lift her 500+lbs of blubber. Finally, Holly lay back, panting and sweating from the effort, and gasping her breath from both her brief physical exertion, and her round, stuffed gut. \u201cW-well *pant* I-I guess *huff* *pant* I\u2019m staying *wheeze* here,,,*pant* ooof,\u201d Holly gasped as she held her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m *pant* not even gonna *pant* try to get\u2026 up.\u201d Jessica replied, turning her multi-chinned, flabby neck towards her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that was *pant* g-reat...Jess *pant*...d-don't think *huff* I could eat\u2026 anoth\u2026 another *huff* bite...\" Holly wheezed as she tried to soothe her tight, mammoth-sized gut with a massage (though quite ineffective cause at this point since she couldn't ever hope to reach the front of her belly in her presently stuffed-to-bursting position) she leaned back heavily in the loveseat, her plump face red and sweating slightly as her great heaving breasts bobbed up and down in time with her breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof...y-you said *uuurrrrrrp!* it, Huh\u2026 Holly...*urrp!* ugh, so stuffed...*pant* f-feels like I'm g-gonna *wheeze* pop...*urp* oooogh...\" Jess breathed, she herself faring little better than her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir soft, flabby, multi-rolled tummies had lost any give they had contained in their previous state, and now resembled huge, tightly packed beachballs as they crushed their owners\u2019 doughy laps and hung over the edges of their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grabbed the remote and flipped on the tv. There was a new diet commercial apparently sponsored by a thin celebrity who used to be over 350lbs. The two gluttonous cohorts looked at each other and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wonder *urrrrp* how long it\u2019ll be until she\u2019s *pant* gained all that weight back and *urrrp* then some, eh?\u201d Holly said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! It won\u2019t be too *urrrrp* long! I\u2019d give it about a *urrp* few months or *huff* so.\u201d Jess replied. \u201cThen *huff* someone else will hand her a million dollars and *pant* she\u2019ll lose it all again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad we\u2026 *wheeze* don\u2019t have to eat that crap diet food *urrrrp* that stuffs *huff* the worst!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh *urrrp* isn\u2019t it though? That stuff\u2019s *pant* for suckers. I\u2019m glad we eat wh-whatever we want *huff*.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm yes, and every minute of it is *hic* delicious!\u201d Holly rubbed her swollen, tight stomach, which had a slight sheen of sweat on it from her earlier attempt at standing. Both women\u2019s half naked bodies sat like massive mountains of bulging and bloated flab. Their over bellies and bottoms were surrounded by a collection of empty boxes, wrappers, and pie tins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I wish I could do this like *pant* every day.\u201d Jess\u2019s round, plump cheeks flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeeessss.\u201d Her hefty friend replied with a grin and a pleasant, guttural moan. Just the thought of filling herself to capacity and then some gave Holly butterflies in her stomach, and the good kind at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great to just relax and have someone feed you all day? Like, a butler or a servant or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha I could probably use that right now\u2026 Or even better, imagine having like\u2026 a whole candy shop all to yourself.\u201d Holly purred as she pictured her fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, that sounds lovely.\u201d Jessica smiled and rubbed her enormous, round, filled belly hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes glazed over and their mouths watered as Holly and Jessica daydreamed about fantasies of extreme gluttony and indulgence, humming contently as they relaxed their bloated bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to watch TV and chat until their enormous bellies had finally digested enough for them to move comfortably off of the sofas.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since Porky\u2019s Pastries started their sponsorship with Gordge, enormous amounts of pastries were regularly delivered to the corporate offices. At first the pastries were slowly gone through by the Gordge employees as they gave the relatively new snacks a try. Soon though there became high demand at the Gordge offices for the delicious and free treats. Eventually the employees were practically addicted to the filling sweets. Jess couldn\u2019t get enough of them. The same was true for Holly and Emily as well. Something about these damn pastries gave everyone such wild cravings for more. They were all too busy stuffing their faces for them to notice their uncontrollable hunger for the treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was sitting in the break room with Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy hasn't it gotten here yet?\u201d Emily whined while rubbing her growling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost 9:30 so it should be here any minute.\u201d Jess said. Just then a custodian entered rolling in a very large cardboard box. He moved the box off of the rolling cart and immediately every employee in the break room swiveled their head to stare at the large package. The custodian paused as he looked around at the deep gazes around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just leave the box open for y\u2019all.\u201d He said. He took out a box cutter and started to open the top. All the while he heard a chorus of grunts, creaks, and groans as the 15 or so incredibly obese employees stood up and surrounded the box. He paused nervously and slowly cut open the last of the tape. He started to pull open the box and was met with dozens of chubby arms grabbing furiously at the stacks of Porky\u2019s pastries. In a minute or so the box was completely empty and the employees started tearing open the packages of pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess and Emily walked back to their desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw I only got some butterballs, jelly rolls, aaand\u2026 and a box of honey buns.\u201d Jess said, examining what Porky\u2019s Pastry\u2019s she managed to get her hands on for the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019ll give you my doughy folds and muffin tops for your butterballs.\u201d Emily offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello ladies.\u201d Holly said as Jess and Emily waddled by her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Holly\u2026 Hey where\u2019d you get those?\u201d Jess asked. Holly was holding a box of half eaten Porky\u2019s and shoving pastries in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah we didn\u2019t see you in the break room just now.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrought these babies from home. I actually have a little stockpile under my desk.\u201d Holly moved her enormous bulk to reveal a stack of boxes under her desk. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell anyone. Can\u2019t have anyone stealing them hehe.\u201d Holly laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think of that. Although I can never find these in grocery store.\u201d Jess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Holly, where did you find them outside of the office?\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah I\u2019m not telling you guys, or anyone in this office for that matter. They would be out of stock by the end of the day!\u201d Holly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo, you suck. Although you\u2019re probably right. These things never seem to last long around here.\u201d Jess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019d like to get to my desk so I can stop holding these and start eating them. C\u2019mon Jess, we can just stalk her after work to find where she\u2019s getting them.\u201d Emily said as they walked back to their desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I heard that!\u201d Holly said. Em and Jess giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jess lowered her blubbery body in to her seat she started tearing open the boxes of pastries. With one hand slowly tapping away at her keyboard she started voraciously stuffing herself with the rich pastries. They were so delicious, Jess started to moan and purr as they slid down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a half an hour all three boxes were empty. Jess felt very full. Something about these pastries filled her up so much. That\u2019s not to say she regretted eating all three boxes. They tasted so good that it was totally worth it. The only thing she regretted was eating them so fast. She was going to have to wait until 12 for more. She did this every time. She told herself she would take her time so that she could enjoy them more and not have to wait forever for more, but after the first pastry it was almost impossible to stop herself. She devoured them without hesitation. She was left rubbing her giant stuffed gut. Despite feeling so full she still craved more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe always seemed to run out of pastries just before she satiated her desires. She licked her lips making sure there wasn\u2019t a single drop of icing left. She looked down at the crumbs that were left on soft chest. She pinched at one or two and dropped them in her mouth. She could barely taste the miniscule remnants. She instinctively picked up her two enormous flabby breasts and brought them to her face so she could lick up the remaining crumbs. Mmm they tasted good as they dissolved on her tongue. She then snapped out of her hunger trance. Oh god, she hoped no one saw her do that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lauren was making her way to her office early one morning only to find that the majority of her employees who were already there were gorging on Porky's snacks. Now normally this wouln't be cause for concern, since every heavyset gal would multitask with eating and doing work. Right then though, it seemed they were all completely and intensely focused on cramming the filling sweets into their bulging bellies. Lauren took note of this, but quickly put it out of her head as she took the elevator up to her office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like these new pastries have gotten everyone into a gorging tizzy\" she said as she sat down. The chubby young CEO of Gordge began filling out documents and signing off on company requests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, she heard a loud knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment afterwards, Lauren's secretary came waddling in. Amy, Her 300+ pound secretary entered her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got *munch* Rebecca\u2019s weekly *burp* report. It\u2019sh not sho good *gulp*.\u201d Amy said. She handed over the thick packet, and quickly dove her hand back into the box of pastries she had under her left arm, for another treat. Lauren quickly scanned the document. She didn\u2019t need to fully read it know it was bad. Productivity had really taken a dive the last three weeks and it seemed to only be getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 this is crazy. You would\u2019ve thought everyone went on vacation, judging on these charts. How is this happening?\u201d Lauren asked in frustration. She rubbed her temples and had a strenuous look on her face. Amy continued stuffing her face and pretended to rack her brain for an answer. Being just a secretary she didn\u2019t really know or care about it. Lauren wasn\u2019t really expecting a good answer anyway. She liked Amy, but she knew her secretary\u2019s only real skills were handing over documents, answering phone calls, and eating, which was all that her job required. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 I *burp*, hehe shcushe me, I don\u2019t *gulp* know.\u201d Amy said, shoveling another pastry in her mouth. Lauren just stared as she pigged out in front of her boss. Amy probably should have left by now, but she was too caught up in gorging herself to realize it. <i>Boy she looks bigger than usual.</i> Lauren thought. Amy had recently ballooned up to 350 pounds. Her belly apron hung over the front of her skirt and her small sweater exposed most of her bottom belly roll. Her skirt pinched around her flabby middle forming a thick muffintop. Her doughy love handles (also peeking out from under her sweater) sat atop her wide and round hips. Amy wiped her pudgy fingers on her clothed belly. A dark chocolate stain appeared right near the apex of her blubbery gut. Right above the smudge was a clear outline of where her two thick spare tires met and formed her billowing double belly. Her pink bra could be seen through the straining fabric of her top. <i>This was the person you saw before entering my office?</i> Lauren rolled her eyes. She liked Amy but it was a wonder what she would be doing if she couldn\u2019t answer phones or use a printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArgh\u2026 do you know when the next order of Porky\u2019s comes in?\u201d Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 Now that\u2019s not my job really.\u201d Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell could you like make whoever\u2019s it is order a more?\u201d Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it really that big of a deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeaah! This stuff is more valuable than gold around here.\u201d Amy pointed to the empty pastry box. That\u2019s when it hit Lauren. It had to be Porky\u2019s causing this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(written by Clutch and Firechar)</span></div></div>",

She carried it well though, primarily in her belly and bottom. Pretty much all over she had a thick layer of flab. Except for her face which looked rather pretty and slim comparatively, though she still had a soft neck and jawline. She looked to be a bit experienced with her size, judging by the way she dressed. She was very well groomed and was very smartly dressed in proper fitting clothes. Jess wish she could dress like that but her waistline was expanding so much she was constantly playing catch up. But Julia managed to look downright beautiful despite her fat. Jess probably would\u2019ve been intimidated by Julia if she weren\u2019t so damn bubbly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If the Porky's orders were what was causing the slowdown, then the would need to be stopped; simple as that.  Lauren couldn't  have her company collapsing into insolvency because the staff was too busy stuffing butter and sugar into their faces to get any work done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got on the phone immediately.  The first thing to do was to figure out who arranged the deal in the first place.  It hadn't been her, but that wasn't unusual. Lauren's  HR and Finance departments occasionally undertook initiatives to boost the morale of the employees. Amy might not know who set the Gordge deal up, but somebody must have.  She sighed and called her finance chief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, it's Lauren.  How are you?  Look, I'm wondering about this partnership with Porky's.\"<br>\r\n\"Aren't they just the greatest?  I just finished a box of butterballs.  Oh my god, you have got to order more.\"  Lauren wasn't sure, but she thought she heard a stifled burp on the end of the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Sam, I just wanted to ask you to send me the file on our partnership with them. Did you set the deal up, or was it someone in your office? <br>\r\n\"Ummm... I'll have to check on that.  I didn't set it up.  I thought HR did.  Let me get back to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe accountant was nothing if not efficient.  Within five minutes, an email had arrived with info on their contact at Porky Paige's, who happened to be the owner of the company, a one Ms. O'Connor.  She also sent a spreadsheet documenting the history of the deal, a scan of the contract between the two firms, and a postscript requesting Lauren ask for some extra butterballs in future shipments.  Must have been Sam's favourite.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren frowned.  If neither her HR people, nor her finance people had made the deal with Porky Paige, who had?  Glancing at her calendar, she was reminded of her packed schedule for the day.  She didn't have time to run in circles through the company bureaucracy figuring out who had stamped the contract.  And siccing Amy on it - Amy, who was now blind to nearly any information that didn't directly relate to something she could put in her mouth - well, that would be as good as useless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd figure out the deal's origin afterward.  For now, the priority was cancelling it, recouping Gordge's money if possible - she'd have to look t the contract language on that - but at least freeing her employees from this pernicious, bloating, fattening influence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted as she got up. Standing seemed to get harder every day, despite her only being 34 years old.  Her belly, once just a slight bulge but now more of a gut, was tightly constrained in her size 20 skirt.  Her entire body shifted as she walked, a fluid, shimmying shake that most of her employees also exhibited.  Back in her college years, when she was under 105 pounds soaking wet, she couldn't have imagined that nearly every part of her body, from her calves to her double chin, would one day jiggle at her slightest movement  On the other hand, she also could not have imagined she'd run a major firm before 40; life was full of surprises.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary at Porky Paige's was, if anything, fatter than Lauren's secretary Amy.   She was seated between a desk and the wall, and Lauren was frankly quite surprised she had managed to squeeze her round hips back there.  Lauren couldn't be sure, but she guessed the woman to be nearing the four hundred pound mark, most of it concentrated in her lower half.  Even from above the desk, she could see the sides corpulent hips rolling out over the edges of the armless chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman stopped slurping on a cup of something covered in whipped cream and said, cheerfully, \"Welcome to Porky Paige's! Where the only thing better than the first bite... is the second one.\" How many times had she spoken that lame slogan, and yet she still managed to chirp it as if there was nothing she'd rather say.  Paige, if there was a Paige, clearly knew how to hire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter confirming her appointment, the secretary heaved herself out of the chair. Sliding out of her little spot involved turning her body sideways and squeezing between the chair and wall.  It looked just as tough as Lauren had imagined, though it didn't seem to phase the secretary.  She just shrugged, gave a dimpled smile, and said \"hazards of working for the best baked goods company in the city!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led Lauren through a door, back into the Porky Paige offices.  Her butt cheeks churned against each other, too big for her enormous black skirt, as she waddled back through the office corridor.  It looked like it was nearly time to upgrade her wardrobe, at least the lower half.  20 feet later, a noticeable sheen of sweat on the girl's face and a slight gasp in her voice, she opened the door to a small meeting room and promised that Ms. O'Connor would be right in.  \"If you want anything to eat,\" she added, \"help yourself to some of the treats!  They're fresh.\"  She grabbed three donuts herself, stacking them one atop the other, turned, and began her arduous hike back down the hall.  Lauren could hear her breathing heavily the entire way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting room had a standard wooden conference table with a standard black phone and a standard office whiteboard on the standard beige walls.  What was decidedly not standard were the boxes - maybe ten in all - each packed with sweet-smelling treats.  Lauren sat down in one of the four chairs, noticing that it was the same large armless model the secretary sat on.  It was very comfortable. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been five hours since Lauren had eaten a modest 3-bagel breakfast.  At the time, she had congratulated herself on not following it up with 3 donuts, as she did more and more often these days but now she wished she hadn't been so reserved.  Ms. O'Connor came in at that moment, her hand extended.  They shook, and Lauren sized the woman up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in her early forties, or maybe a bit younger.  It was, Lauren thought, hard to tell with someone so fat.  The woman was enormous, 500 pounds if she was an ounce.  She was dressed in a red sweater big enough to be a tent and in slacks that would have been loose on Gordge's fattest employee.   When she sat down, she groaned quietly and the chair groaned loudly.  Far too fat to fold her legs, with a belly that prevented her from leaning forward, she just sat back and rested her hands on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir introductions were interrupted by Lauren's own stomach, which grumbled loudly to announce its irritation with what seemed to be famine conditions.  Ms. Connor smiled warmly and slid one of the boxes closer to the hungry CEO. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know how it is.  You're busy running a company, and you never have time to get a proper meal.  Before you know it, you're half-starved.\"  She patted her stomach, which sloshed and jiggled in response.  Ms. O'Connor lowered her voice and smiled conspiratorially \"I just polished off a box of these myself - honey buns, we call them on the labels, but I just call them delicious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked at the array of golden-brown treats in the box before her, chose a particularly appealing specimen, and took a large bite.  The flakey pastry yielded easily to her teeth, and was somehow both airy and incredibly rich. \"Wow,\" she said after wolfing the rest of the little cake down, \"they really are good. Is everything you make so good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, absolutely,\" Ms. O'Connor nodded, then ran her hands lightly along the parts of her fat body she could reach.  \"I sample every batch myself, as you can probably see from my generous figure.\"  Lauren couldn't tell whether that was  joke, so decided to get right to the subject at hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you're well aware, you have been supplying Gordge with baked goods for the last months.  I came here today in the hopes... in the hopes... that...\" she was suddenly, and uncharacteristically, losing her train of thought.  Normally, she was a hard-driving, no-nonsense negotiator.  That's how she had climbed to the top of Gordge's chubby corporate ladder.  Yet now, in front of this rotund, smiling baker, she couldn't seem to put together a sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rescued from her stumbling by a beep from the previously unobtrusive phone on the conference room desk.  \"Ms. O'Connor?\"  It was the secretary she'd met on the way in.  \"Sorry to disturb you while you're in your meeting, but there's a matter that requires your immediate attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. O'Connor apologized profusely, swore that this would never happened again, especially while meeting with the CEO of their valued partner firm, that it must be an emergency, and then stepped out, her lumbering footfalls thudding down the hall.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door clicked shut, and before she consciously realized what she was doing, Lauren had another honeybun in her hand and smile on her face.  Five minutes passed, or 7 honeybuns, depending on how you wanted to measure the time.  Lauren's belly, well acquainted with snacking, was nonetheless beginning to groan under the load of surprisingly heavy snacks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry again,\" Ms. O'Connor said as she came back in.  \"School called about my son... fight on the playground.  You know how boys are.\"  Lauren didn't but she nodded, gulping down the rest of her honeybun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. O'Connor sat back down, much to the conference chair's disappointment, and tented her fingers on her belly.  \"Look, i know why you came down here today.  I get it.  I know we haven't been providing you as much product as you want... your girls talk the delivery guy's ear off with requests every time he is over there.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. O'Connor paused, then looked Lauren right in the eye very seriously.  \"Please understand that no relationship is more important to us than our relationship with Gordge.  Your snack contract funded us through our difficult startup phase.  It's so hard to get a business off the ground.  But now that we're underway... well, heck, how about we double our daily deliveries to you.  Just as a way to say \"thank you\" from one partner to another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was torn.  Part of her wanted to laugh in the woman's face; she had misinterpreted the point of this meeting so badly.  The problem was definitely not that the pastry deliveries to Gordge were too small, whatever her hungry employees might say.  It was that the pastries were coming at all, turning her staff into bloated parodies of young women who couldn't work ten minutes without a snack break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other part of her... the part connected to her sugar-coated tongue and her round, warm, very full tummy, was already imagining overflowing honeybun boxes stacked between her desk phone and her computer.  To come in every morning and find that waiting for her... it was too appealing to ignore.  Perhaps, if she thought about it, she could come up with a way to get her staff back on track, while keeping the food.  Use it as an incentive, maybe?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two parts of her fought, very briefly.  It was barely a contest.  She licked her lips, and extended her hand.  \"Ms. O'Connor, you got yourself a deal.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy blabbed almost immediately after receiving the documents confirming the new snack delivery arrangements.  Twice the normal deliveries!  The entire office was abuzz and salivating, dreaming of truckloads of treats being delivered to them personally, possibly by very handsome delivery men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her girls could short circuit their keyboards with drool, Lauren announced her new incentive program. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Memorandum</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo: All Gordge Office Staff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom: CEO Lauren Smitt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you may be aware, our company has recently renegotiated the snack concession with Porky's Pastries. Gordge will now be receiving twice as much in our daily shipments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the office-wide popularity of these snacks, our senior leadership has determined that this is an ideal opportunity for a performance-based reward for our most productive associates.  The supplementary Porky's pastries that we will receive in the new agreement will be allotted based on employees' productivity ratings at their weekly performance review with their direct supervisors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, thank you all for your continued hard work on behalf of Gordge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe this?\" Emily said with as much indignation as someone with a mouthful of Porky's muffintops could muster.  She was standing next to Jess's desk, having just read the CEO's memo.  She was the lightest of the three friends, but had by this point sunk so far into a morass of hedonism that she was just as gluttonous as her larger sisters.  Even with a box of muffintops in her hand, she was already thinking about how to get her hands on more pastries in the future.   \"They're going to rank us and use that to decide who gets the Porky's pastries!  Isn't there some kind of clause in our contract about them not being to withhold employee snacks?\"  Her 3 chins quivered, though it was unclear whether that was from agitation or from vigorous chewing.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looked up from her computer lazily, the only way she seemed to do anything these days.  Since rounding the five hundred pound mark, she had found herself slowing down in almost all aspects of her life as every task became a monumental challenge.  It was harder to walk, harder to bend, even harder to motivate herself to roll her massive body out of bed in the morning.  \"I don't really think,\" she said gently, \"that the hiring managers paid much attention to the snacks and treats subsection of our contract when we signed on.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly, listening from two desks over, waved her hand dismissively.  \"I don't know about you girls, but I already know I'll be getting plenty of those pastries.  Hell, I'm the best worker this place has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair,\" Emily squeaked, \"you've been working here longer than we have!  And you already have Porky's you buy yourself on some kind of secret black market. You don't get to take these, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Emily.  When they give all the pastries to me, I won't forget the little people like you and Jess.  I'll be sure to let you watch me eat them,\" Holly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\"  Emily seemed genuinely angry for a moment, but it faded quickly and by the next sentence, she was giggling cutely.  \"You wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.  I'll lean my ass back and just drop them into my mouth, like a queen being fed grapes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo demonstrate, she leaned back in her chair and kicked her feet up onto the desk, or she tried to, anyway.  The last fifty pounds had completely eliminated any remaining physical fitness from the obese Holly.  Her anatomy was no longer something most physiologists would recognize.  What little muscle she had was completely buried under a thick layer of rolling fat, soft and supple.  Even her toes, little sausages packed into pink pumps, had outgrown the toe ring she wore for years.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had taken the most damage in the last growth spurt, though.  When sitting, it formed three main rolls, the biggest being the bottom one, which covered her lap entirely in soft flesh.  It was now so big that, when she thought nobody was looking, she untucked it from her work pants to leave it hanging over her belt.  That was so much more comfortable than keeping it cooped up inside pants that were, more often than not, a few sizes too small.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween her fat belly resting on top of her thighs and the weak flabbiness of her short legs themselves, she didn't have a prayer of lifting her feet onto the desk.  It was nearly 3 feet off the ground!  She was able to lean back in her chair, but when she tried to put her legs up on the desk, all she accomplished was setting her body to jiggling and releasing an involuntary girlish grunt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrked by the snafu in her little performance, she tried again.  This attempt started out more successfully; by shifting her cumbersome weight to the left, she was able to free her right leg from under her belly.  She fought against the sloshing indolence of a body totally unaccustomed to movement, and managed to hoist her right leg nearly onto the desk, hooking the toe of her shoe onto the edge of the desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there a moment, looking ridiculous, feeling her exhausted leg shake. Neither Emily nore Jess could tell whether she would actually have the will to force the rest of her foot up, but before her will could give out, her pants did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven high quality, custom-tailored slacks have a limit, and her chic black pants had found theirs.  Seams, stretched by a cargo well beyond their capacity, then strained by her sudden movement, surrendered, and tore loudly.  The pants split up the back of her right leg, all the way to her ass.  Cellulite-covered ivory skin wobbled into the open and quickly developed goosebumps in the air-conditioned office.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence followed, then Emily and Jess burst out laughing at their friend.  Holly didn't laugh, but she didn't cry, either.  This was not the first time she'd busted her pants, and she knew it wouldn't be the last.  Especially once she got her hands on her share of the new Porky's deliveries.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a weekend of extreme gorging and laziness, Jessica found herself in some trouble. Having recently embraced her enormous size and incredibly piggish attitude, Jess had turned off every notion of restraint in her food craving brain. Jessica had eaten nonstop all weekend. It was one of the best weekend\u2019s she\u2019d had in a long time. Unfortunately she had some regrets the following Monday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer work attire was already pretty small on her to begin with but this past week had pushed her over the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew, that was close.\u201d Jess said. She had managed to make it to her desk with her clothing still intact. She looked over her strained outfit. Her shirt buttons had enormous gaps between them as her bloated belly and breasts pushed against the fabric. There was still a ring of flesh that was revealed between her shirt and skirt. Jessica really struggled to look over her massive body. She had gotten so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a friendly face walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey Emily.\u201d Jess said. Emily waddled over to Jessica\u2019s cubicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jess how\u2019s life going post diet?\u201d Emily asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great. Although my clothes are hanging on for dear life.\u201d Jess said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too. I think I\u2019ve put on a few, these buttons have been getting pretty tight.\u201d Emily said. She definitely looked bigger. She had gained 40+ pounds since working at corporate. Pretty soon she would reach 400 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve put on some weight but I\u2019m not complaining. And as long as I stay in this seat my clothes will live to die another day.\u201d Jess said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell unfortunately we have a meeting in a few minutes. Sorry to burst you bubble.\u201d Emily said. Jess had totally forgot about the weekly Monday meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well, I think I can make it through one meeting.\u201d Jess said with a tinge of doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s in a few minutes, you need a hand?\u201d Emily asked. She extended a hand towards Jess. Jessica leaned her heavy gut forward. Grabbing Emily\u2019s hands she pulled herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful.\u201d Jessica said. Her clothes groaned and tiny rips could be heard as her extra wide butt lifted out of her seat. A button popped off as her great bottom belly roll fell over her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy she wasn\u2019t joking about her clothes.\u201d Emily thought to herself. Finally Jess\u2019s morbidly obese body was upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way through the rather expansive corporate office to one of the many conference rooms. Jess and Emily were out of breath as they waddled through the cubicles. Jessica\u2019s skirt started to ride down her hefty plump butt. All over her stitching started to become undone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they made it to the meeting. They weren\u2019t late but most of the people were already in their seats at the large meeting table. As big as Jess had become she hardly stuck out among the high ranking corporate employees at the meeting. Jessica was even dwarfed by some of the massive mounds of blubber in the room. Everywhere enormous overfed women gorged themselves on doughnuts as they lowered their obese hefty bulks into strained seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting went on as usual. Jess didn\u2019t say much. However she did treat herself to a few doughnuts. There were tons all over the table for the gluttonous employees. Jessica swallowed doughnut after doughnut. All of a sudden another button popped off. Jessica froze. She got a few glances but the meeting never stopped. Buttons popping were a pretty common occurrence around the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should probably stop eating. I don\u2019t want to burst another one.\u201d She told herself. But then her piggish desires overtook her. She continued to wolf down doughnuts at a startling rate. No one paid much attention though. Jess emptied a whole platter. Her already bulging belly bloated bigger and bigger. She didn\u2019t notice the dangerously tight feeling of her shirt as she was caught up in her epic doughnut feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she was asked a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess what do you think of that?\u201d Lauren, the CEO, asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Jess looked up from her doughnuts to see everyone waiting for her response. She swallowed the doughnut in her mouth. PING! PING! PING! PING! Every last button flew off her shirt. Jess\u2019s enormous doughnut filled gut surged over the edge of her chair. Some people gasped, and some giggled. A few of the larger veterans smiled seeing the younger overfed employee taking such a liking to the Gordge philosophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Jessica\u2019s bloated stacks of belly fat and huge flabby breasts (at least she wore a bra) were exposed to everyone at the meeting. Jessica turned red with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh I\u2019m going to excuse myself.\u201d Jessica said. She lifted her overstuffed body. An enormous tear was made down her skirt as she stood up. Everyone catching a glimpse of her exposed bottom as she waddled out of the room. Jessica ended up getting the rest of the day off. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Day after day she would constantly be cramming her gut with as much food as she could get her hands on. Her co-workers were happy to aid and abet their massively obese friend fully adapt to her new lifestyle and went out of their way to ease Jessica\u2019s workload and keep her as glutted and sedentary as possible. As such, Jess absolutely exploded in size, gaining over 60 pounds in a single month, becoming so incredibly massive that any shirt became nearly an unbearable burden. Her home attire thus devolved into solely a bra-and-sweatpants getup that left her truly gargantuan belly bare for the entire world to see. Though all of Jess was getting permanently too much to handle, her big bulging belly was the particularly lucky recipient of the new pounds of blubber, and its massive, warm, permanently overgorged mass was something that Jess took growing pride in. Jess had found an amazing talent in overeating, and she cultivated it assiduously with constant practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery weekend was an especially rich time for Jess and her stupendous stomach, as she would make a point to constantly gorge, glut and stuff herself into stupefaction for as long as she could keep her eyes open. Distinct mealtimes were unnecessary, as Jess would just feast for hours upon end until she was too dopey and food-drunk to do anything but giggle and rub her overfilled stomach in congratulations at yet another job well done. On a certain sunday evening, we find Jess in just such a lethargic and drowsy position. Hiccupping gently, Jess giggled and softly patted the mountain of soft blubber and listened to her stomach\u2019s struggling digestion of yet another massive feast: \u201cSigh...HIC...what a good day of eating...HIC...I feel so relaxed now! I guess this...HIC...constant eating is really my thing...HIC!! I can fit so much food into my stomHIC, hehehe it makes me happy...HIC.\u201d She idly crammed her umpteenth donut into her mouth and sighed contentedly. This was the life. Now all she needed was to wait for the pizza delivery guy to arrive with her order. MMM, 10 pizzas all for me she thought greedily, rubbing her stuffed stomach. This was going to be rich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jessica was an utter slave to her massive appetite and lust for gorging, glutting and cramming her cavernous stomach with as much food as she possibly could reach. Her capacity for feasting seemed endless, and there seemed to be no such thing as enough food to completely fill her mammoth gut. Understandably, Jessica grew at a steady clip, clocking in at just over 570 pounds by the beginning of week six of her unhinged gluttony. Her huge single belly exploded from her frame and was beginning to pour over her knees when Jess sat in a chair. It was Jess\u2019s favorite part of her massively fat body, and she was beginning to enjoy watching it grow larger and larger with each passing food-filled day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis particular monday morning Jess had just managed to make her way to her office cubicle, and completely out of breath, collapsed on the floor with a muffled slosh. She had really outdone herself on Sunday and was still rather gorged from all her eating. Panting heavily, she gently rubbed the top shelf of her gut with one hand while the other was rummaging through an drawer, pulling out twinkies, ho-hos, candy bars, and whatever else Jess had stashed in there. Happily eating, Jess futilely pulled her tank-top over her giant glob of blubbery belly. No button-down shirts could hope to fit across her impossibly wide middle, but Gordge made exceptions for their larger employees, but even so, Jessica\u2019s mighty belly proved impossible to decently cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Emily waddled into Jess\u2019s office, bearing a large pound cake. She blinked a few times at seeing Jess and her enormous gut sprawled out on the floor, but swiftly regained composure: \u201cHey Jess! How you doing? How was your weekend?\u201d<br>\r\nJess swallowed a huge mouthful of food and smiled happily: \u201c*pant* Hey Emily! I had a great weekend! *URP* Lots and lots and LOTS of food! Hehehe, oh gosh I ate SO MUCH yesterday I even surprised myself!\u201d Jess smiled and crammed her mouth with more sweets after patting her giant gut contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shook her head knowingly: \u201cYou\u2019ve really taken to this whole eating whatever you want thing, huh? Well I brought you some cake, and don\u2019t forget the breakfast spread in the breakroom today.\u201d Jess looked up, surprised, and patted the top of her bulbous belly eagerly. \u201cURRP, Thanks, Em, that\u2019ll be wonderful. I can\u2019t wait *URP*\u201d With that, she all but inhaled the rest of her food and practically crammed the pound cake into her mouth whole, and slowly but surely rocked herself upwards and made her jiggly way to the breakroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later she barely stumbled back into her cubicle, closed the door, and collapsed with a shattering thud and *GLOP* The spread was meant for an office 3 times the size of Gordge, and Jessica had easily glutted herself on half of it. Moaning in pleasure and difficulty, Jess patted her gigantically swollen stomach happily, a dazed and content smile plastered across her fat face: <br>\r\n\u201cHIC...HIC...ohhh mann what a feast...I\u2019m...HICC HICC...getting so hugeee...heheheheHICC..I wonder what\u2019s for lunch...URRPPP\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My old place was kind of a dump anyways.\" They exchanged details, and Jessica drove back to her place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica untangled her massive body from the seatbelt and her car, and walked inside her apartment building. Jessica fumbled with her keys in her sausage fingers as she breathily huffed from the exertion of merely walking from her car to her first-story apartment. Since Jessica was never a slim girl, she had made this calculation ahead of time, but as she'd gotten more obese, it mattered less and less, because her exhaustion always became more and more with each passing pound. She eventually keyed her lock and got in. She trudged in, having to slide her lardy frame in sideways due to her extending fat, and shut the door behind her, and pulled herself to a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later, a knock came to the door. She rose with a struggle and opened the door to see Jennifer standing in the doorway. \"Hey, Jessica!\" she said in her higher-toned voice. Jessica extended her hand and shook Jennifer's hand. \"Heyy, Jennifer!\" Jennifer walked into the apartment and looked around. \"Wow, you've got some good taste!\" spoke Jennifer, as she paused, looking at a fairly tasteful mirror. She nodded in approval. \"Thaanks!\" replied Jessica, \"I bought a lot of this stuff. When I'm not spending money on food, I can buy some pretty good furniture.\" Jennifer nodded. \"Mmm. Speaking of food, uh, mind if I take a look at what you've got?\" Jessica nodded. \"Sure.\" <i>Here it comes.</i> thought Jessica. A moment of dread washed over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer opened the fridge. <i>Oh my god.</i> was her first thought. Jessica's fridge nearly gave her a heart attack by proxy. All she saw was cholesterol after cholesterol, salt upon salt. Jessica's nutrition was out of wack in several kinds of ways and it nearly made Jennifer have a fit. \"Wow, this is, uh..\" She withdrew an econo-size tub of vanilla bean ice cream. \"...not good.\" Jessica's face flushed red. Jennifer eventually finished taking out eighty percent of Jessica's foodstuffs. \"Alright, roomie, let me just set my stuff down and I'll run out and grab you some nice, wholesome food.\" Jennifer set down her bags in the corner and ran out, shutting the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemptation rushed across Jessica's face.

She mostly ate out but her apartment was full of junk food, and she wasted no time in ripping apart the bags of chips and crackers. She shoved piles of food down her gullet. Her mind ceased rational thought and turned to pure gluttony and ravenous consumption. She consumed so rapidly that at one point she could not use her hands to eat fast enough, simply up-ending the family-sized bags of potato chips and entire cartons of crackers into her waiting, hungry maw. Any unfortunate casualties that fell to the floor were grazed upon by Jessica, like an actual cow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salty snacks had finished, but Jessica saw the sweets. The exertion of consuming the salty food had given her a glistening of \"fat sweats,\" but she could power through this for the bon-bons and cookies on the counter. She opened up the cookies first, double-fisting cookies down her throat. The sweets especially began to hit the spot. Jessica always had a fierce sweet tooth. She eventually got through the chocolate chip, leaving large smears of chocolate on the corners of her mouth, and she munched through the candy-crusted cookies. These were always Jessica's favorites among cookies in particular, and her face showed it, almost orgasmic as she consumed the boxes. The very large boxes took longer to eat, but Jessica's hunger could not be stopped by such petty things as food volume. She eventually finished these and she took another trip to the counter. She was getting annoyed by the fact of having to move, so she simply took the remaining food stocks in a great stack in her arms and waddled breathily back to her chair. She pulled to a stop and spread the treats on her lap. The first victims of her hunger were the bon-bons, glazed with bright white cream. Jessica shoved them in by twos and threes, and she was able to drive through these in minutes. The remainder were many, many assortments of sweets, cakes of many kinds, cinnamon buns, and she consumed the remainder of these within the hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Jessica had finished the last box and cast down the last box, and leaned back, panting from the exhaustion of the feast she had just consumed and sweating profusely, the light glisten of her forehead having gone to a drenching of sweat across her face, wetting the collar of her shirt, just as Jennifer returned. Her arms were laden with bags, as she paused amidst a greeting. She was dazzled, she had only been out for an hour and maybe a little more, and the countertop was empty, all its contents now emptied before Jessica. The morbidly obese woman had sunk into a sofa seat and leaned back, her head craning over towards Jennifer. The room was silent as Jessica's face flushed. Jennifer could only utter a \"What?\" Her brain was absolutely fried. The rest of her words slowly began to trail out. \"I... don't understand... I thought you wanted to lose weight...\" Jessica had no words, only breathless panting, her maw hanging open and her taut, full stomach hanging out in front of her and dangerously close to the knees of her lardy legs. \"I come back here, and you're stuffing your face...This is not good.\" She took a deep breath, and sighed as she let it out as Jessica's face reflected a recognization of what she'd just done. The only words she could mutter were \"Sorry...\" Jennifer replied, \"It'll be alright, we'll work on it. At least you got rid of all of the junk!\" Jennifer began to chuckle. She put up the groceries and took out a piece of paper, showing it to the guilty glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so for breakfast we have a selection of any of this...\" Jennifer motioned to what appeared to be a diet plan she'd held before Jessica. \"Granola, toast, turkey sausage, egg whites....\" She went on. The plan called for Jessica to cut out any of the sinful snacks at work, and take meal-preps made by Jennifer at home, and Jennifer would prepare something for dinner. Jessica submissively nodded. The guilt of being caught red-handed had subdued her. The rest of the day went by, and Jennifer prepared a healthy, very light salad-based supper. Jessica poked and prodded at first, but slowly began to eat. She did eventually finish the salad, which actually had some nice blueberries and other additions by Jennifer that made it not simply a bowl of leaves.  </span></div></div>",

It had been a week since her roomie took her new place and Jessica had tried to resist the pressures at the office to gorge with her friends, but that lasted exactly one day. It was Wednesday, and she was now back into the fold, gorging on par with the rest. As Jess chomped through one donut, Emily spoke. \"So, Jess. How's the whole new roomie thing going?\" Jessica swallowed the remainder of the donut and spoke up. \"It's okay. Jennifer really stays on my back, but I think she'll be good for me.\" Holly rolled her eyes as she sipped her coffee, nearly pale with creamer and milk. \"You know all those so-called \"nutritionists\" are full of shit, right?

Lunch came about and Jessica pulled out her tupperware full of salad. She took out her fork and ate. No matter what the food was, Jessica could eat it mechanically. She hadn't gotten anywhere close to full, though. She leaned back and sighed in mixed sadness and dissapointment. <i>Man,</i> she thought, <i>I wish I had some pizza.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as an answering call from heaven, Emily and Holly walked in with three boxes of pizza. \"Hey, Jess! I know you didn't forget it was pizza day!\" Jessica smiled broadly. \"Oh, you know I remembered!\" She did as close as she could to leap up from her seat and take a box and set it down in front of her. She opened it. By this point the motivation that had driven her to half-heartedly diet was absolutely diminished before Jessica's endless appetite, and she piledrove through the pizza, stopping only occasionally to join in on the gossip of the coven. \"I heard Alice is getting promoted.\" spoke Holly. Jessica's eyes lit up. Alice was always a bit tame for her taste. Emily's eyes turned to a mixture of disgust and dissapointment. \"Ugh. <i>Her.</i> She always rubbed me the wrong way, always so, \"Oooh, I can't eat thaat, I'm trying to lose weiiight...\" She shook her head. \"Friggin' goody-two shoes.\" Jessica furrowed her eyebrows and spoke up. \"She's a good girl. Better girl than me. I heard she's been doing good and lost a lot of weight.\" Holly nodded. \"Yeah. Don't be mad at Alice just cause she's got some willpower, Emily.\" Emily chuckled. \"Whatever. I think people should enjoy themselves.\" By the end of lunchtime, all three had finished off their pizzas and polished off a good half of a family-sized bag of chips and a few cans of soda. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica waddled back into the door. It was Friday, and Emily had brought in burgers. She entered the apartment in her Button-up blouse and black pants that were ripped at her thighs in many places and the flesh poked through the holes, jiggling with each step. Sitting inside was Jennifer, on the sofa-seat. Jessica walked in and waved. \"Hey, Jen.\" Jennifer waved back and stood. \"Hey, Jess. So, uhm, if it's alright, I'd like to talk to you about something.\" Jessica nodded. \"Sure, go ahead.\" Jennifer spoke on in a solemn tone. \"So, it's been about two weeks, and I haven't noticed any real progress. Of course, I might be wrong, which is why I'd like to just check.\" Jessica gave off a sigh. \"Uh, sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer went into the bathroom and took out the scale and set it down. Jessica stepped on it, her heart became filled with dread. The scale gave off a few beeps. Jennifer bent over to read them. She sighed in turn. \"512 pounds.\" Jessica sighed and pulled herself to a seat. Jennifer spoke up. \"You put on six pounds in two weeks. I gave you a diet program, and by now you should be six <i>less.</i> Jessica cradled her head by her chins in her hands. \"Like, I try. I eat the meals you pack! I don't get it.\" Jennifer spoke up. \"I know why. It's because you're eating more. You're still eating those snacks.\" Jessica grunted. She wanted to deny it, but the extra pounds spoke louder. Jennifer continued, \"Now, I can't follow you to work. I can't eat better -for you-. You've got to do this for yourself. For now, I can think of only one way to try to motivate you.\" Jessica picked up her head with a sense of dread and fear. Jennifer clapped from the bedroom. As she flicked the lights on in that room, a treadmill became visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was clutching the handrails for dear life. She was on four-speed, but for her, it felt like the machine was about to rip her legs off. Jennifer barked from behind her. \"You've only burned one large fry off, and you've had two.\" It had been thirty minutes and Jessica's skin-tight tank top was absolutely drenched. It felt like her lungs were on fire. It felt like the worst form of torture. \"You can't outrun a bad diet. Do you get that now?\" Jessica mumbled something to the affirmative. Jennifer lowered the speed to two. \"Good. Now do another ten minutes.\" Jessica nearly tumbled to the track had it not been for the handrails which she gripped for dear life. She panted and took the massive water bottle gifted to her by Jennifer as a move-in gift, and nearly upended the entire container into her thirsty throat. Ten minutes later she was off the treadmill. She swayed back and forth and each step felt like it were on rubber legs. Jennifer sighed. \"I didn't mean to torture you, but you understand? You can't just burn off everything you eat. If you just eat what I put down, you won't need to burn off a single meal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weekend, Jessica was whipped into line with Jennifer's program. Surprisingly enough, Jennifer had salads and granola on demand for snacks, and these somehow managed to keep Jessica full. She even got on the treadmill and she felt like she didn't hate it. But her mind as she laid down kept going back to work. In the night, away from Jennifer's judging gaze, Jessica thought of work and the treats it brought. But the next morning she awoke to the sound of sizzling meat. She smelled it and she recognized it right away as she heard the tick of a stove shutting off. Jennifer had plates set out with bacon, pancakes, and eggs. \"Morning, Jess! I made breakfast.\" Jessica was shocked. \"Uh-Morning.\" Jennifer set a cup of coffee up for Jessica and handed it to her as the blubbery woman sipped. \"I realized I'd been a little harsh, so I figured I'd reward you for your good work this weekend.\" Jessica looked with wonder. \"Well..thanks! I appreciate it!\" The two eat and it was almost like a barrier broke. They spoke like actual human beings rather than patient to doctor. Eventually the two finished and Jessica pulled on her work clothes. \"I'll be back. I'll try to be good.\" Jennifer waved. \"Bye! Have a good day!\" Jessica walked out and got in her car, and drove to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica took her usual park in the front row. It was an unspoken tradition that corporate workers and the fatter members of the office parked there, and interns who didn't observe it quickly found themselves on the recieving end of a yelling by one of the hog-like higher-ups, and out of the office. Jessica entered the lobby and the first thing she noticed in the ritzy lobby of the corporate building was the massive line stretching around the corner for the elevator. She stood in the line for a few seconds before something popped in from the back of her mind. <i>Shit, the meeting!</i> A meeting had been scheduled for that day, and it was only in an hour. The elevator was notoriously slow, in no small part due to the weight it carried. She knew there was only one option, and she tried to avoid it when possible. She stepped out of line, and headed up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess found herself with a throng of the thin, young interns who were obviously new arrivals and a few of the unfortunate fat souls like her who were forced to trudge up. She trudged up past a woman of gentler face who seemed to be having no trouble. Jess had passed her off as an intern until a voice emerged. \"Hey, Jessica!\" Jessica turned to the voice. \"Huh?\" She looked into the face of the woman, and it took her a second until she recognized the basic features. It was Alice. \"Alice!\" spoke Jessica, as she struggled up the stairs. \"Holy shit, you've lost a lot of weight!\" Alice chuckled. \"I could tell, when you hardly recognized me!\" Jessica huffed out a reply, \"Yeah. How did you ever manage it? 'Specially around....\" She took a moment to gasp in some breath as she passed the first floor. \"...Mel and the rest..\" Alice nodded, keeping up effortlessly. \"It was hard at first, but I found that the trick was mostly to keep my own mouth full all the time with healthier stuff. Plus, Mel's a natural pig.\" Jessica chuckled. \"You got that right. She'd fit right into corporate..\" She cast a glance down to her stomach, and put a hand on it as she trudged up. Alice patted Jessica on the back. \"Aww, it's alright! Heck, if I'm not careful, I might be right up there with you.\" Jessica raised her brows. \"Huh?\" Alice followed up rapidly. \"Didn't you hear? I got promoted!\" As they reached the next inter-floor level, Jess stopped and bear-hugged Alice. \"No way! Congratulations!\" Alice hugged back, but she patted Jess on the back. \"Thanks, babe, but you're kinda...\" Jessica looked and noticed that she had accidentally buried Alice in her blubbery stomach. \"Whoops, sorry.\" Alice chuckled. \"It's alright!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived at the corporate floor. Emily and Holly stood about sipping coffee and eating assorted candies and sweets. They turned about to Alice and Jessica, Jessica absolutely knackered and sweating profusely. \"Heyyy! You must be Alice!\" The chunky Emily shook Alice's hand first, then the absolutely blubbery Holly shook it next. Alice spoke. \"Yup! And you guys are?\" Emily spoke up. \"I'm Emily.\" \"Hi, I'm Holly.\" \"Nice to meet you two!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually the blubbery trio entered the meeting room. As they entered, Alice drew many stares. There were even hushed whispers into others' ears. Alice pulled herself into a seat beside Jessica, whose buttons strained as she pulled herself to a seat, and her white shirt pulled as tight as the skin of a drum, every fold and fat roll exposed through the fabric, including her extensive belly which would have rubbed against the arms of her seat, but in the vastness of the Corporate meeting room, the armchairs were different, more accomodating for the variety of blubbery individuals, some of whom were real veterans, and barely fit in the chairs. Jessica's eyes searched the table as her chubby compadres took their seats. There was a spread of food, with everything from pizza and donuts to bowls of chips and candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and in walked the CEO, Lauren. It was almost anti-climatic for her to walk in, as she was hardly fat for an employee, let alone for a corporate. She didn't even look above 300 pounds. \"Sorry I'm late,\" she spoke. \"Caught up in the elevator line.\" She pulled herself briskly to her seat and  rolled up. She sat down the binder and spoke up. \"So, before we get started, I'd like to welcome our new addition. Everyone welcome Alice!\" The room gave a round of applause, and then Lauren turned to her. \"Just as a little cursory, uh, piece of custom, don't worry about taking anything from the spread here, we can always get more.\" Alice nodded. \"Thank you, ma'am.\" Then the business began, long words about business figures, marketing campaigns. Jessica shifted uneasily in her seat. The presence of the snacks, everything that Jessica could desire and more. It was a cruel form of torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's capacious stomach rumbled. Her stomach hadn't yet fully adapted to the diet program, and she was unsure if it ever would. Jessica tried to shift her focus away, sipping on her mug of coffee. It helped keep her awake and her stomach stopped rumbling for a second and also helped keep her awake through Lauren and the higher-ups' quicker conversation. But it could only do so much for her blubbery stomach. She rubbed her blubbery thighs which gripped tight against her khaki dress pants in an attempt to distract herself from her hunger, but no matter what she did, the hunger always came back. She leaned on the table and tried to pay closer attention to what Lauren was saying. \"...So what you're saying is, our quarterly earnings aren't growing fast as expected?\" Nope, nothing interesting. But it was something to do. She listened in to the conversation, all about quarterly earnings, and rates, and marketshares. She'd learned all of this in school, but she couldn't care at the moment. The pizza's siren call became strong. In this moment of crisis, she had to rely on Alice. She looked, and Alice was steady. She wasn't eating, but she was obviously just as tempted as Jess. Jessica was slightly comforted, but she had to keep finding tactics. She grabbed her coffee mug and drank a long draught, then put it back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody else, your thoughts?\" Jessica had just finished and put down her mug. She'd caught enough of what Lauren had said throughout the meeting to know that she'd been talking about to understand that Lauren was talking about the market share, and how to improve its growth. She pieced together in a moment what ought to be done. \"Well, personally, I'd just say, we've been doing enough marketing. We have to do a closer look at the actual products on the ground. If we do some surveys and reward people who do them with, like, vouchers, we'll get a lot of good publicity,and we'll get honest feedback so we can make ground improvements. Generate our own hype from the bottom-up.\" Jessica might have been a glutton, but she was certainly nobody's fool. Lauren raised a brow and nodded. \"Sounds solid. Any alternatives?\" No voices were raised in opposition. \"Thank you, Jessica. I'll take that as consideration. And with that I think we're going for lunch. Thank you, everyone, for your input.\" Everyone got up and Jessica hurried to her planned lunch and stuffed her face with the brown rice, chicken, and beans with some peppers thrown in. It was a big container. Jessica had resisted temptation, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week went on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the next few weeks went on, Jessica was able to contain, at least temporarily, her ravenous hunger for fatty food. She found other things to do, or excuses. \"Oh, sorry, I'd love some donuts, but I'm full from lunch.\" Additionally, she got some extra steps in at the office by volunteering to carry any necessary paperwork. She still labored through this effort, but she was showing almost uncharacteristic self-restraint and endurance, if only because she changed what she stuffed herself with. This was the linchpin of her diet strategy; lettuce. Whenever another meeting came about, or her co-workers were about to come in with lunch, second lunch, or one of the many snack runs they went on,  she'd be busy munching on a bowl of random greens. In fact, Jessica began to show signs of improvement with normal movement, something she avoided like the plague and that pained her greatly. She huffed slightly more quiet as she became used to the movement. Of course, the blubbery mammoth was still exhausted by anything beyond slow plodding through the hallways of the offices, but she made movements. One could even swear her usually strained sleeves which contained her lardy arms, and the cloth around her buttons on the crest of her great singular stomach began to lax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the snacks that used to go to Jessica were not simply being abandoned or being consumed by Holly and Emily. They turned their efforts toward Alice. By this point, unfortunately for Alice's waistline, she had let her guard down. First it began with an occasional donut or two at coffee. Then it carried on to accepting a few of the snacks that used to go to Jessica. She hadn't quite gotten back to the days that had gotten her to 350 pounds, and she kept active. But the pounds began to show. Her re-slendered physique began to soften. It started as a bulge re-emerging at the very bottom of her shirt, her arms softening and coming closer to the edges of the sleeves. One button became tighter. Alice didn't notice. But this complacency in her diet built as Alice focused less on losing weight, and more on fitting into the new environment. This wasn't lost on Holly and Emily, as they sat at coffee with Jessica as Alice was in Lauren's office upstairs. \"Alice is starting to look like a Gordge girl again.\" spoke Holly as she munched through a mouthful of jelly donut. \"Mhm.\" spoke Jessica. Emily spoke after a sip of coffee. \"Yeah. It's probably just as well that you're passing up on our snacks. Alice needs some meat on her bones.\" Jessica chuckled. \"It's funny to even think that she got this small. She'd play so innocent downstairs but hog out right up there with me and Mel.\"  Holly nodded. \"It's always the nice ones. They turn into such pigs when they drop the whole 'shame' act.\" Alice entered and gave a groan as she trudged to the Coffee machine. \"Sometimes I hate dealing with Lauren. She's SUUUCH a killjoy.\" Emily nodded. \"Yah, she's eternally on everyone's nerves. You try to give her the time of day, she assumes you're there to tell her somebody's trying to elbow in on our marketing.\" Alice nodded as she put a long stream of creamer into her coffee and stirred it. \"Tell me about it.\" There was a pause of silence as she finished and turned around and pulled up a seat next to Jessica, rubbing the beginning of her reborn spare tire against one of Jessica's great fat rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sipped her Coffee. \"You're looking nice, Jess, you've been doing good on that weight loss program.\"  Jessica's face brightened. \"Aww! You mean it?\" Alice gave a muffled \"Mm-Hmm.\" through a donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, Jessica re-entered the apartment. \"Heyy, Jen!\" she happily chirped at Jennifer. Jennifer smiled back at her from her position on the couch. \"Heyy, Jess!\" She got up and hugged as far around Jessica's great stomach as she could. \"How did work go?\" Jessica put up her things and began to change into a tee-shirt and sweatpants. \"It went good! I've been avoiding the snacks.\" \"Yaass! You've been doing super good. I think I can actually see you getting smaller.\" Jessica spoke up. \"Thanks! Everyone's been saying that.\" Jennifer spoke up. \"In fact, maybe step on the scale! I think you've made some progress!\" Jessica nodded. \"Alright.\" She waddled into the bathroom and stood on the Electronic scale. It took a few moments and Jennifer bent down. \"Four-ninety-nine! You've lost twelve pounds!\" Jessica could have jumped for joy. \"Oh my gosh! Yesss!\" Jennifer raised her hand, and gave Jessica a High-Five. \"Now let's go slay this workout!\" The two went off to the gym. Jessica did better than she normally did on the elliptical that night, and even lifted a bit. But in the back of her head, a dangerous thought reared itself. \"I think I deserve a reward.\" </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"One more, you got this, Jess!\" Jessica eked out one final rep on the squat rack. She only squatted 50 for the moment, but it was a lot for Jess. Her legs burned from all the exertion but she pushed with one final grunt. She let the bar fall onto a notch in the rack and high-fived Jen. \"Yess, girl! You killed it!\" The muscled, thin woman walked next to the shorter blimp of a woman to the Lockers. Jessica's mind had made an as-of-yet unspoken decision, she <i>did</i> deserve a reward. And she knew just how she'd get it. She pulled off her clothes to reveal her true, naked, jiggling and blubbery form, covered with rolls at her side covered with sweat as she prepared to shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she put her lounging clothes back on, and walked out with her gym bag, she walked to her car. \"I'll be a little late getting back, by the way. I'm gonna stop for ciggies.\" Jennifer raised a brow. \"Okay... I didn't know you smoked.\" Jess put her gym bag into her car. \"I do it at work.\" Jennifer shrugged. She herself put a few cigs back whenever she went to the bar. \"Alright. See you back at the apartment.\" Jessica stepped into her car and labored to pull her seatbelt across her stomach. It was only slightly easier than before; she was still nearly 500 pounds. She drove herself to a local gas station and after filling up her car she walked up to the counter. \"Two packs of Billy Jack Menthols.\" The mid-aged woman turned about and fetched them. She scanned them in and also scanned in the multitudes of snack foods this whale was checking out, and a two liter of soda. <i>Damn, she really don't need all that. She's big enough as she is, </i> thought the cashier. \"Thanks!\" waved the blubbery woman as she walked out and sat down into the seat of her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out her lighter and attempted to spark it. She hadn't used it in a while, and her sausage-like thumb gave her trouble. Finally she produced a flame and lit a cigarette. She decided she'd have to be somewhat convincing that she was getting cigarettes. She took a long drag and coughed a long cough before then put the lit cigarette into the ashtray to smolder for a moment as she opened up a cheese pastry. She shoved it into her mouth and munched. She moaned orgasmically, she had almost forgotten the glories of this fatty food. In a moment she'd munched through her pastry, and took a drag from her cig again. She was able to hold in her cough as she took a second drag opening her other pastry packet. She continued this cycle, putting her cigarette back when she went to bite into her \"little\" reward. She blew through this fairly quickly and ripped open a bag of chips. She munched ravenously in handfuls, and only occasionally stopped to drink from her two-liter, straight from the bottle. She continued on, smoking and eating. An alarm began to sound in the back of her mind. <i>What if I'm out too long, and she comes looking for me?</i> That alarmed Jess. She didn't want to be on the receiving end of another lecture. She hurriedly huffed down the rest of this bag, until she realized she'd bought too many snacks to simply blow through in one go. It was a shame to waste all of it. So instead, she hid the bag in the foot of the passenger, and continued smoking her cig. Her apartment complex had a smoking ban, and she had to finish it before she got back, which she did, and stubbed out in her ashtray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she returned and discovered Jennifer was not yet home, she hurried back out and grabbed her snacks. She huffed as she speed-walked back in, and hid the bag under her bed. Jennifer was none the wiser the rest of the night while Jessica munched on her chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's weight loss began to slow, slowing from her major loss of several pounds in a few weeks to about a pound a week at most. She still did her walking and activity at the office, and still stayed away from the many snacks of her coworkers while at the office. But when at home, and when Jennifer was asleep, Jessica began having more  \"rewards.\" And conveniently, whenever she ran out of cigarettes, for Jessica began smoking just enough to keep up the ruse that she was a smoker,  her junk stash would replenish, and in fact, grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Alice in these next three weeks continued growing. Her other buttons began tightening. Her breasts began straining hard against her shirt, and her arms became flabbier as she indulged more and more in her co-workers' habits. She'd stopped packing pre-planned lunches, and joined Holly and Emmy for lunch, joining them with their greasy, fatty foods. And as they themselves steadily grew, Holly having reached the 500 mark just that third week, so did Alice grow. Her small spare tire was joined by a larger belly in general, thicker thighs, and a slowly more fattened face, her cheeks growing in size, not quite sprouting a double-chin yet, but the beginnings of it formed in the shape of some flab below the jaw and on the neck. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica sat taking coffee with Holly, Alice, and Emily. Alice had grown even more, but still had not gotten a new shirt. Her buttons were under near-constant strain, and she wore a Jacket. She munched mindlessly into her fifth donut of the break as she turned her head to Jessica, who was joining her. \"Hey, Jess, I thought you weren't allowed to eat those?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had figured her incremental weight loss was a good sign, and she figured she could relax a bit. She had good habits now, so she could afford to join back in on her co-workers activities. \"I've been doing good. I deserve a little break.\" She munched through a donut, her sixth, and reached for another one. \"Besides, I thought -you- weren't allowed to eat those?\" Alice replied quickly in a defensive tone. \"Whaddaya mean? I'm fine.\" She took a bite of her donut, and spoke through a mouthful. \"I'm the healthiesht pershon in thish offish.\" She swallowed. Her double chin had begun to return in the few weeks following, and her ever-extending belly began to show through gaps in the buttons, and her belly began to leave its prior perch, no longer content to curtail itself, growing once again into a pot belly, and growing thicker every week, second-fastest being her breasts. Jessica's buttons had begun to strain again in their old fashion, and her shirt had actually seemed to grow tighter than before she began this program with Jennifer. Her relationships at the office, however, had been less cold and isolated due to her resumption of the favored social activity: eating. She had, in fact, joined the office lunches again, eating her packed lunch on top of whatever everyone else brought in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blew through a few more donuts and spoke up. \"I'm gonna go smoke.\" She left for the smoking room on the floor, installed for the comfort of the hefty smokers of the office. And, of course, with her went several bags of snacks and sweets. She stuck a cigarette in her mouth, lit up, sucked and then blew out some smoke as she set aside the lit tobacco and bit deeply into a long cheese pastry. For Jessica, the ever-more-frequent smoking breaks were all paired with snacks. Thus, as she deepened her ruse and growing addiction of smoking, she reversed her losses of late. She blew through the cigarette over the course of a few pastries, and eventually finished it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blubbery woman smoked and ate, Alice and the co-workers gossiped at coffee. \"I don't like how much she's been smoking recently.\" spoke Alice. Holly nodded. \"Seriously. She smells like shit now. Reminds me of my dad. Did nothing but smoke all damn day.\" Emily leaned forward after a gulp of coffee and a donut. \"Like, plus she's been <i>blimping</i> up recently.\" Holly nodded heartily. \"Oh, yeah. Like, just a few weeks ago she was looking thinner. Now she looks like she's actually getting bigger than before.\" Alice leant forward, joining the gang. \"Plus she's getting so tired now. She can hardly walk down the hall now. She has to stop every few seconds.\" The conversation was cut short as Alice walked back in, brushing crumbs off of her overstrained button-up and smelling deeply of tobacco smoke. They sat about and drank a bit more coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they got back to their desks. Jessica squeezed into her chair. This had become more difficult of recently. <i>Damn chairs, acting up again.</i> She tip-typed on her keyboard as she worked, powered by the coffee she had consumed on her break. She was not one to shift her work, Jessica, though she might be an unhealthy smoking glutton, was not one to slack off at work. Part of this, however, was due to the fact that she kept focused at work through food. As she'd gotten addicted to smoking, all her runs on the gas station resulted in more cigarettes, as well as more food. She munched through several large bags of chips a day at her workstation, and numerous varieties of sweets. As she glutted herself and worked through uncounted time, her shirt-buttons grew tighter and tighter, to the point where her blouse became almost drum-tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, a cigarette craving struck her and she attempted to get up. The tight arms of the chair did not budge. \"Damn it, something is WRONG with these arms.\" Jessica attempted to shove the arms back with her massive, meaty, ham-like arms, only causing these fat arms to jiggle, and her thick brown pony-tail to shake back and forth. A loud 'CRACK!' resounded, and her steel chair snapped like a twig. She collapsed with a massive 'THUD!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and brushed herself off. \"Man, these chairs suck.\" she muttered to herself as she retrieved a cigarette and breathily plodded towards the smoking room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice listened as Jessica breathily plodded past her office. She shook her head as she bit into a chocolate eclair. <i>Man, Jess has gotten pretty big. Someone's got to say something,</i> she thought as she crammed the chocolate pastry into her flabby cheeks. The irony was absolutely lost on her as she completely finished the eclair and rested her flabby arms on her desk again and continued typing away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scratched at an itch in her side, her cherry red fingernails scratching across her grey flowery-patterned button-up blouse which screamed at every inch of fabric. Deep grooves cut into Alice's flabbier side. She became acutely aware that this shirt had fit her better once upon a time, but she was aloof of the cause. <i>The washer really has shrunk this shirt. I gotta get it fixed,</i> thought Alice. She idle-mindedly reached for a family-sized bag of chips and ripped it open and munched handfuls as she tip-typed at her keyboard. At every handful, the buttons that rode her swelling breast and her ever-growing belly which now teased just above her crotch strained and protested. Alice hardly felt this disturbance, only thinking of the report she was typing on. She rested her head on her elbow, accentuating her growing flab below her chin which grew carefully into a reborn double-chin as she sipped her coffee and thought of how to continue from her current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She reached into the bag ever deeper and grabbed a fistful of chips and shoved it into her mouth, munching the crisps, causing the exposed gaps of flesh between her buttons to grow more obvious. Alice rolled her head as she resumed her typing. Alice reached deeper inside, finding that her mindless grazing was depleting the chips at a rapid rate. She took the bag and up-ended it into her mouth, and finished her mug of coffee. She reached almost instinctively into her mini-fridge for a can of cola, which she popped open and began drinking.  Before this, her blouse had been near the breaking point, but as she drank more cola and finished the large bag of chips, her buttons finally gave way with loud snaps combined with the ripping of the fabric attached to the shanks of the buttons which flew right before Alice, onto her keyboard. She gasped and inspected the damage. \"Oh, my god!\" she spoke to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had shirts shrink in the wash before, but this made her suspect that there was more than laundry tricks at play. She planted her face in her hands at the possibility that she was getting fatter again. She'd worked very hard to lose the weight, and here it was, coming back. As the sound of Jessica plodding down the hallway, her panting audible even from Alice's office, Alice held her shirt together as Jessica rested in Alice's doorway and looked. \"Damn, Alice..\" she spoke, taking a breather between this and her next statement, \" You alright?\" Alice flushed red as she spoke. \"I don't know... Some buttons popped off... You don't got any spares, do ya?\" Jessica scratched her head. \"Uh, no. I can lend you my suit jacket...if you'll give it back.\" Jessica spoke, ending her sentence with a pant. Alice nodded. \"That'll work.\" Jessica thudded off and reappeared a moment later with a suit jacket which she wrapped around Alice, who put it on and buttoned it with ease. It was very baggy, and Alice could button all of them with absolute ease. \"Thanks, Jess! You're a life saver!\" Alice hugged Jessica, being impacted with the smell of cigarettes. Jessica hugged back. \"Don't worry about it!\"  Alice walked out and drove home. She had some damage control to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica sweatily plodded into the spacious apartment, which had gotten a bit more comfortable with Jessica's corporate pay. Jen turned her slender form from its seated position on the couch toward Jessica as she entered. \"Jessi!\" She sprung up and kissed Jess on her blubbery cheek. Jessica hugged back. \"Heyy, Jen! How's things been?\" Jessica asked through her panting demeanor. \"Pretty good, saw a client that had a lot of progress today.\" Jessica nodded in return. Jen turned her eyes to Jess's fat rolls that lined her back. <i>Something's not right,</i> thought Jen. Jessica was obviously gaining weight, but she couldn't make the connection. Where were these new pounds coming from? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer walked over to the stove and began cooking some rice and chicken. \"I'll make some dinner while you relax. Work was alright?\" The possibility entered Jennifer's mind that Jessica was likely back to eating the fattening office snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Alice is gaining her weight back. Had to lend her my dress jacket.\" Jen gave a \"Hm,\" as she brought the rice to a boil and set the chicken to bake. \"Doesn't sound good. Maybe you might tell her to give me a call.\" Jessica walked into her bedroom and began changing out of her tight work shirt. \"I'll give it a thought. She ought have it under control. She always was good at losing weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer gave the statement some space. <i>I can't avoid it.</i> thought Jen. She spoke up as Jess entered the room again in some sweats and a tee shirt, oversized about fifty pounds ago but tighter now. \"By the way, not trying to be a bitch, but you look like you're getting bigger again. Be honest, have you been eating the snacks again?\" Jessica sighed. She thought this question was coming. \"Yeah...I know that I oughta stay away but the temptation is hard.\" Jennifer spoke up more reassuringly. \"Well, don't worry about it, I know you can overpower them. Just remind yourself to pack your own healthier ones!\" Jessica nodded. \"Ooh, that's a good idea. I'll do it.\" Jennifer followed up with a reproachive tone, \"And try to stop smoking. It's worse than if you kept getting bigger.\" Jessica sighed. \"I guess.\" The two ate. Jessica smiled as they ate. \"This is good, thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two polished off dinner and Jennifer took Jessica to the gym afterward. Jessica's blubbery form jiggled as she pulled and pushed the sticks of the elliptical back and forth, but she seemed to struggle. \"C'mon, Jess, you got this,\" said Jen from the elliptical beside. It was only ten minutes in, and Jessica seemed to be doing worse than before. She was only ten minutes in but her skin-tight tank top which exposed her several rolls and clung to her massive, bouncing stomach and breasts was soaking in sweat. She climbed off five minutes later. \"You can finish this, Jess, c'mon, get back up!\" exclaimed Jen, but Jess plodded off. Jen sighed and left with her. Over the car ride back, Jen lectured. \"You can't get better if you give up when it's hard.\" She went on, but Jessica was despondent the whole way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Jess had left for Work. Jennifer was on the couch answering a call, and became slightly restless as she spoke. As an active woman, she was never accustomed to being an absolute couch potato. She found herself sitting a bit more than she'd liked recently, but she stayed on her feet enough to keep her well-sculpted physique. She paced towards Jessica's bedroom as she spoke. \"Oh, no no no, that's fine. I wouldn't mind coming back to the office tomorrow. New client?\" She allowed her fellow practitioner to speak as she paced further. As she walked about and stood, she realized she wasn't going to walk much further. She began to step towards the Treadmill so she could walk infinitely as she spoke. The conversation continued for quite some time as Jennifer continued discussing events with her co-practitioner at her office until the talk inevitably ended. She stepped off the treadmill, just to see a wrapper protruding from under Jessica's bed. Jennifer's brain ticked, <i>Is that what I think it is?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it was a wrapper for a snack cake. And she caught a glimpse of something larger beneath the bed. The something turned out to be many somethings, Jessica's junk food cache. Jennifer sighed. \"Oh my GOD,\" she spoke. \"I can not BELIEVE this cow.\" She tried not to speak like that about her clients, but frankly, Jennifer's brain was at its breaking point with Jessica. She'd tried everything with her, she'd balanced tough love with nurture, but neither could fix Jessica. Jennifer continued yanking the fattening junk food out. No wonder Jessica's progress seemed to leap backward since she started smoking, she'd used it as a cover to get these snacks! \"This dumb fat cow! I'm done with this, I'm done, I'm done.\" Jennifer literally threw up her hands and gathered her things, save for the Treadmill. That was Jessica's, only it was in storage before, where it would likely go again. Jennifer scrabbled a note, planted it on the coffee table, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica returned to the Apartment complex. The day had been a productive one, if slightly draining. She was sure she'd made some good progress on the deadline coming up and on top of that the co-workers had bought pizza. Alice in particular had partaken, and she showed that she was well on her way to surpassing her old appetite. At that moment, an oddity was noticed by Jessica-Jen's car wasn't there, at an hour when she was almost guaranteed to be. Jessica parked her car. The worst possibility began to form in her mind. <i>Oh, no, please.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica entered her apartment, and it was exactly as she feared. All of Jennifer's things, her laptop, her health magazines, her gym bag, all were gone, and all that remained in her place was a note on the coffee table in front of Jessica's comfortable beige couch. Jessica breathily picked up the note, the act of bending down strained her over-stressed white button-up blouse which exposed gaps between the buttons, and was perfectly skin-tight, exposing every one of her rolls and her rolling single gut which rose and fell with her rapid breaths. The note read, \"Jessica; I give up. I discovered your stash of snacks under your bed. I only help people that want help.\" Jessica turned to her bedroom, and all of her stashed snacks sat on her bed. She wailed as she ran to them, her hope of salvation from her weight had gone. The motivation faded away as the tears rolled down her face. She munched into the pile of snacks, ripping the packaging with her teeth and raking food into her mouth straight from the bed. As the pile shrunk, her kneeling position became uncomfortable on her taxed knees which had to bear every pound of her blubbery body. She brought herself to a laying position on her bed facing the pile of snacks, as she dug her face in and ate like a hog from a trough. She hardly heard her buttons pop off and rattle against the floor, she hardly felt her shirt dangle freely towards the bed. She didn't consciously bring herself to sleep, but instead found her exhahusted, sweaty head inside the pile of wrappers with no power left in her immensely obese, whale-like body to withdraw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica awoke, she found herself buried in a pile of snacks. Her first gasping breath brought a piece of plastic from the wrapping into her throat, which she violently coughed out, shaking her flabby body and her second chin which jiggled violently at the assault by the foreign object. She looked at her blouse, which was torn and shredded by her binge. Enough food which would have lasted anyone a month had lasted a night. Jessica groggily brought herself up and searched for anything which would fit. She searched for  her pants. Nothing would fit, no button would button. She gave up on the dress pants and tried to pull on one of her dress skirts, a black one. It went smoothly up her cankles and her blubbery leg rolls until it hit her larded thighs, thick with fat. Jessica yanked and yanked, the last pull of her strength barely getting the skirt past her thighs which released it with a violent ripple of flesh, already jiggling from the exertion Jessica gave to try to pull them up. Jessica sat and panted, sweating intensely just from this minor stress. She realized the skirt was not even all the way up onto her stomach as it was supposed to be and attempted to pull it up further. This was too much for the skirt as it ripped. Jessica screamed and pounded her bed. She violently shook her own stomach. \"Why the fuck did I ever have to listen to you!?? WHY!??\" She violently tried to run on the treadmill, she felt she had to punish her stomach for the ruin it had inflicted on her, jiggling it intensely. Her lungs already taxed from her new smoking habit and the bout with her clothes were having none of it, and she barely went a breathy, panting minute before she collapsed on the treadmill. The treadmill lacked the power to drag her off of it on her supine position on the tread, as she simply lay on the treadmill. She groaned and pulled herself up. She  wiped her tears, pulled on a looser, non-button blouse which still exposed the bottom portion of her stomach and some elastic waistband pants, and plodded on her way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was lunch-time at the corporate lunch-room of Gordge. Alice wore her new shirt which was still slightly loose as she munched on a bacon cheeseburger from a local fast food joint. They heard the thud of feet plodding towards the room and in walked Jessica with three boxes of pizza. The rest looked at her. \"Well, seems like someone's hungry!\" piped up Alice. Jessica sighed. \"Yeah...\" Holly's face, plumper as of late, frowned at Jessica's voice. \"Aww, what's wrong pumpkin?\" Jessica sat down and ripped open a box of pizza. \"My dietician gave up on me, so I guess I've given up.\" She stacked two slices of meat lover's pizza and ate them as one slice, half of them gone in one bite. Emily patted Jess on her meaty back, sending a jiggle across her blubbery upper back. \"Aww. Well, don't get so down about it! She was a bitch anyway. Dieticians generally are.\" Holly hummed in confirmation. \"Plus, now you can eat whatever you want!\" Jessica powered through two more slices, then replied. \"Yeah, you guys are right... Food always has helped calm me down..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jessica munched through the remainder of the pizza as the rest continued their own lunch, and then without a second thought, she opened the second box and continued munching. Emily reached her blubbery arm for the box of donuts habitually on the table. \"Here, have some donuts, darling! I got some new ones today, Jelly, and Boston Creme..\" Jessica nodded as she blew through two more slices and grabbed two donuts and bit through them in two bites. She nodded. \"Thanks for the support, guys..\" Before lunch had ended, she'd ploughed through all three boxes and half of the box of donuts, with room left for a cheese danish, and as habit a cigarette, but with all the constant eating she barely had the breath to take a pull, but it was a habit, and she had to finish it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica had left for her cheese danish and cigarette, Emily spoke up quickly. \"Jess is kinda scaring me, like, seriously. I can understand comfort eating, it's how I got to where I am today, but <i>three</i> pizzas?\" Alice nodded. \"Seriously, it can't be good for her. Think we should say something?\" Holly shook her head. \"This'll die down in about a week. And if it doesn't, who cares? We're all pigs here anyways.\" Emily sipped some coffee. \"Well, maybe you are, Holls.\" She sent a sausage-like finger into Holly's blubbery double- stomach which strained her button-less shirt. Holly had been expanding quite significantly, and she looked to be at least 580 if not in the 600's. Holly rubbed the stinging jab. \"Hey, fatass, you're not any skinnier.\" She sent a vicious elbow into Emily's also capacious gut, taking the wind out of the about 500-pound blimp. Alice stood up. \"Now, now, calm down, this is a break room not a fight club! What's wrong with you guys?\" Emily took her breaths back in while Holly aggressively munched a donut. After another, she sighed and spoke. \"Sorry. I just... don't like when people get like that about my weight.\" Emily grunted and finished the box of dounts just before the group adjourned to go back to work. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica sat munching breathily through a family-sized pack of chips as though it were a small snack bag while she tick-typed. Her new heights in hoggish eating had slowed her work-pace, and this had come into consideration as Jessica had a knock on the door. She looked up to see the fat, red-haired form of Lauren Gordge. She was more plump than her past appearance at the meeting, some 30 or 40 pounds more than before, just short of the 300 pound mark if possibly just on it. \"Heyy, Jessica\" she spoke, \"How's your day been?\" Jessica turned to Lauren, just in time to see her slide a snack cake onto her desk. Jessica smiled. \"Hey, Miss Gordge, it's been pretty good, gotten those reports done and some correspondences sent to those guys in Seattle, Dynamo?\" Lauren nodded, accentuating her smooth double-chin. \"Yeah, Dynamo Inc. Funny you mention them, we need someone to go there and sit in on a board meeting, and I was thinking you.\" Jessica smiled and replied \"That sounds great, when's the meeting?\" as she unwrapped the snack cake and nearly inhaled it at the speed she consumed it. \"Uh, it's on the twenty-third, so about three days. We're covering your ticket, so after work today, your ticket will be ready for tomorrow at nine in the morning.\" Jessica nodded, \"Sounds good, thank you!\" Jessica turned back. She heard a rustling. As Lauren left, she'd left another snack cake on Jessica's desk, which she finished about as quickly as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day dawned. Jessica had a light breakfast of four bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits, with two large orders of hash browns, which she scarfed down as she drove in her increasingly tight blouse. It had been about two weeks since Jennifer had left, and Jessica had bought a new shirt in a larger size the day after her first day back. It was fairly loose when she bought it, but now more of it had become taut. The sides still billowed out as they tucked into Jessica's ever-tightening pants, from which her thighs made the seams strain at their vastness, especially when she sat down. Her stomach expanded and bulged as she rabidly chomped her biscuits, guzzled her coffee and munched her hash browns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she'd parked in the airport lot, finished her food and her coffee, her buttons began to show some strain. Thankfully for the longevity of her shirt, when she stood up, the fabric relaxed some, but the evidence of her \"light\" breakfast was still evident through her white blouse neatly tucked into her pants, and her expanding stomach protruding from her tight white shirt made her look like a white blob. She focused on breathily plodding towards the terminal. She began to notice a great deal of stares directed her way. She tried to ignore them, but eventually she began to wish she had stayed with Jennifer's program. <i>Jesus, I'm a whale.</i> she thought to herself as she glanced at the center of attention: Her bloated stomach and her breasts. Jessica sighed as she entered the terminal and went through security. She paused after passing the tall scanner. \"Ma'am, you've been selected for a more extensive search.\" spoke the female agent. She was thin and blonde, and reminded her of Alice before she started re-gaining her weight. She consented, she didn't want to miss her flight. She bore as the hand of the agent patted across her body, creating ripples across her fat. She felt more eyes on her as she regretted doing the search in public, but eventually nothing was found. As Jess walked away, the Agent bit her lip as she looked. <i>Damn, she's cute.</i> the agent thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Jessica found herself waddling onto her flight. She squeezed, quite literally into her window seat in First Class past an old man who looked ready to hop onto the golf course. The old man glanced at her stomach. He leaned over. \"Y'know, that ain't good for ya. You ought lose some weight.\" Jessica nervously chuckled. \"Y-Yeah, I ought to.\" \"Yeah, what with all the heart disease an' joint probl'ms y'have with that while you're young, y'ought to save some of that for later.\" He chuckled after that. Jessica leaned onto her seat and set her bag under the seat in front of her. Eventually the usual talk came over the intercoms about buckling the seatbelt, and Jessica attempted to stretch the belt across her stomach. She got to just above and to the left of her belly button. She tugged and tugged but there was no more fabric to the belt. She sighed. She would need more help. She would need the belt extender, the clear bell to the plane that an obese person was on the plane and so much of a whale that they couldn't fit the belt around their massive stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the rest of today's parade of humiliation wasn't enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stretched up a lardy arm and waved. A flight attendant stopped by and leaned in. \"Yes, what seems to be the problem, ma'am?\" a fairly chunky female flight attendant spoke. \"Uh, yes, I need help putting the belt in.\" Jessica demonstrated, trying to pull the belt around her mountainous belly in vain. The chubby attendant nodded, \"Yes ma'am, I've got you.\" She leaned down, straining her already tight blue uniform, and grabbed a belt extender. The seats around her directed their eyes to Jessica, then away. The attendant fastened in the extender and then pulled the belt down, buckling it in, though she had to give the extender a bit of slack to meet the buckle. She stood up and then walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the plane was taxiing down the runway to the final strip. Jessica gripped the armrests. She had never been one for flights, but driving from the east coast to the west was an arduous task for even the most seasoned driver that there was no time for. One reason for this dislike was the very occurrance that came upon Jess, as the plane sped forward like a galloping stallion. Jessica's already overtaxed heart raced as she gritted her teeth and trembled, giving a jiggle across her body. Then there came the lifting sensation as the plane's wings gathered air beneath them, and lifted from the ground. Jessica's heart slowed as the plane climbed and eventually reached cruising altitude. Jessica waited for the snack cart to come by. She bought a bag of M&amp;M's and a coke to gnosh on, without criticism from the old man who was fast asleep. Jessica had a reprieve at this juncture at least. After munching and finishing her coke, she fell asleep on the comfort of her blubbery shoulder and bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica awoke, the plane had pulled into the terminal, and the old man had already left. She waddled off the plane and out into the terminal. First things first, she waddled to a burger joint inside the terminal, grabbed a large combo and an extra order of fries, and consumed it with voracity. That power nap took a lot out of her. Afterwards, she took a rental car to her hotel, got up to her room, and watched some TV. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica awoke bleary-eyed to her alarm. She groaned and pulled herself up from the bed. She rubbed some sleep from her eyes as she dismissed her phone alarm, reading the time. It read \"6:44\". Jessica hurried to her suitcase and pulled out a better-looking suit, but one that was from the last time she bought clothes, back when Jennifer was still in her apartment. Just by looking at her shirt she knew it was going to be an uphill battle. She sighed, pulled the sleeves on, and buttoned the wrist-buttons. A bit hard due to her lardier forearms, but doable. She focused to the next challenge, and sucked in her massive, rolling gut as much as she could. She pulled her buttons together, but one by one the task became more difficult, from hard, to ridiculous. Hard were the buttons in the valley below her breasts and above her belly, and even harder was her collar-button. She held her breath and pulled hard, and her collar finally buttoned. Breathing became a bit more difficult, but possible. Then came the next challenge. There was no sucking in  to be done for her breast button, and it proved difficult. She pulled three seperate times, each time drawing more breath, inducing more sweat, and creating more difficulty, but with one surge of effort, the button slid into the hole and held its position against much resistance. Then came the greatest challenge, the one button she had not tackled; the button on the crest of her belly. She sucked in, she pulled, but nearly nothing would bring the button to within more than an inch of the hole. Her blubbery arms strained. Jessica knew she didn't have much time, city traffic was rough, and it was a long drive to Dynamo. She determined one last time to pull the button into the hole in spite of her lard. She had to do it, so she pulled one last time. She pulled, there were only centimeters between the button and the hole. She stretched the hole. There was a bit of a rip then from the fabric below the hole itself, but with that last sweat-filled, panting effort, the button met the hole, with only the loss of a few centimeters of fabric. After this she pulled on the skirt with a great struggle at her thighs, and by some miracle, fit the skirt around her spare tire, covering the bottom of her strained shirt. Every item of her clothing seemed like it begged to be let loose, and Jessica became very aware of her recent decadence due to the tight, digging nature of these clothes. To attempt to cover this up, she pulled on her dress jacket, and gave up on buttoning the jacket, it would only make her seem more like the fat cow that she knew she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica went downstairs and grabbed a plate of food and a cup of coffee. This would have to suffice, the meeting was at eleven, and if this city was anything like Gordge's home offices, this would be a pain to drive in. She scarfed down her food like a wolf, unbeknownst to her, to the amusement of several in the breakfast area. A few women whispered to each other a ways behind her about the whale in front of them in one of the worst-fitting suits they had ever seen. Whenever Jessica got up, they could see every fat roll, every centimeter of her blubber, every inch of strained fabric which screamed desperately to escape. Jess focused on none of this. She focused on inhaling the food and coffee in front of her. She would have to let this be her breakfast, as her schedule had her leaving the hotel a few minutes from now. She got up and threw away her empty plate and refilled her cup with some coffee, put a lid on it,and waddled out to her rental car with the files within. She then pulled out and headed to the roads. Her GPS led her through the streets, and the traffic wasn't the worst she'd seen, actually bringing her to the tall 10 story glass office building labeled 'DYNAMO INVESTMENT' and its accompanying subterranean parking garage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she pulled her car into a spot and waddled towards the elevator, she recognized a sign on the elevator: \"NOTICE: FOR USE OF DISABLED INDIVIDUALS ONLY.\" There was some smaller text, which read, \"Attention! Keeping in mind those less able and conveniencing them, Dynamo Inc requires that employees and individuals utilizing Dynamo facilities with no motor impairments use the stairs.\" A green label stood below, with a white turbine, the symbol of Dynamo, against a green apple, with the words in bold: \"DYNAMO HEALTHY LIVING INITIATIVES.\" Jessica groaned and trudged up the stairs. She trudged up the stairs, she was on sublevel 4, and the ground floor was 4 flights up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica steeled herself. She was truly about to pay the price for her fat lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes blurred with sweat and her breath grew hard. She had done only two flights, but it felt like two hundred. Her legs burned as she powered on. She wasn't about to commit a faux-pas in the presence of a potential contract partner, however. She would sooner deal with Jennifer's regime again than come back home with nothing in hand. So she powered on, committed to doing what she came here to do. Eventually, she finally hit the ground floor. She was dazed and exhausted, and her lungs burned with exhaustion. Her feet had gone numb, but she got out of the garage. She took a moment and gathered her appearance. Her hair was set by her hairspray, and only a few rogue agents needed setting in place. She entered the lobby, looking like an absurdly fat penguin in her waddling gait and her full-to-bursting suit. She attracted some looks that were more than an acknowledgement of her existence, including the Receptionist. Jessica waddled up, took a deep breath on her approach and spoke. \"Hii, I'm here from Gordge, Jessica.\" The receptionist nodded. \"Alright, lemme see.. Jessica... Ooh, here you are!\" she spoke up after thumbing a page or two through the page of persons. She looked up at Jessica. \"Here you are. Third floor meeting room, thirty minutes.\" Jessica nodded. \"Thank you.\" The receptionist watched Jessica waddle on her way. Whispers were had in the lobby, even some quiet snickers. Jessica paused before trying to get up the stairs. She took some deep breaths. This would be the last great exertion. She looked up and saw some inspiration. Maybe it was the thought of Lauren giving her that twenty-five percent comission from the deal. Maybe it was the thought of having no more stairs to deal with today. But she powered up after her lungs ceased burning, and pushed on. For a moment after completing the first floor, it was almost like she was back into her exercise routine days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, until she got onto the next set. Then it was back to hating every second of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica finally got up to the third floor. The top of her collar was wet with sweat, but she pulled out a napkin, and dabbed it off, along with the rest of the sweat on her face. She wasn't about to screw this up by looking like a slob. To that end she also struggled to pull her suit buttons into place. It was hard, but accomplishable. However, it came with a price; A few of the suits around the tall, brown-haired man that Jessica recognized from an email from Lauren as being James MacDowsen, the CEO of Dynamo. He turned to her. \"Ah, so you must be the representative from Gordge. Miss Rhodes?\" Jessica extended her hand to the suave brown-haired man. \"Yes, Jessica Rhodes. Pleasure to meet you, mister MacDowsen.\" The man shook her hand, and the two sides entered the meeting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoffee was served and Jessica opened. \"As has been stated prior in correspondence, we are in agreement that both of us would benefit from mutual contracts, but we were informed that you wanted to, so to say, work some kinks out.\" A thin, raven-haired woman  who seemed like a much thinner version of Holly in her 40's spoke up. \"Yes, it's mostly in terms of public relations.\" Jessica couldn't help but feel as though the woman was looking at her with a judging stare. \"You know our reputation as a company that puts health first. We've instituted policies that encourage a healthy environment, thus why we have our employees take the stairs, we also prohibit them from bringing in food from unhealthy establishments, including some 'red light' foods that are not tolerated in our breakrooms. Your company has a certain reputation which seems to be the polar opposite, and although we do not want to force policy change on you, we would like a promise of some kind of action about the situation.\" The woman sat. Jessica noticed her looking directly at one of her suit buttons which barely held in place. Jessica thought quickly on her feet. \"We understand your concerns, but do understand, Gordge's policies are longstanding, and if we take such measures, you'd understand that wouldn't be feasable without some corresponding action freeing up your employees. These kinds of partnerships are built off of parity, not dominance.\" turned to her at the end of the sentence. \"This is absolutely true, but still, do understand that we aren't going to change our hard policy and we aren't sacrificing our image. This parity you speak of, it's gotta come in a compromise. So how's this for a compromise; we ditch the red light food policy, if once a year physicals are brought in for Gordge, first one up front.\" Jessica figured this was the closest she could come without driving Dynamo off. \"Sounds good to me. I'll communicate this to Miss Gordge.\" The two sides stood up, and the blimpish Jess shook MacDowsen's hand. The deal was sealed, with only some minor negotiations to be had.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica sat triumphant in the break room with the gang surrounding her, back pats going all around and a new indulgence in the donut box: Chocolate-filled chocolate donuts. Alice picked one out and spoke before cramming it into her mouth. \"Congratulations on that commission, Jess. Everyone's saying nothing but good things about you!\" The whole corporate sphere was in a jubilant mood. Alice's cheeks puffed up as she munched the donut. She seemed as if she were just short of being back to her 300 pound self, but Jessica was too excited to care. \"Thanksh!\" she said through a full mouth, \"But I gotta tell ya.\" She took a pause to swallow her chocolate mouthful, wiping some residue off the corner of her mouth. \"This place I had to go to, hell. No elevators open for use unless you were in a wheelchair or a walker. All. Stairs.\" A groan came up from the group. \"Oh my god. That sounds horrible.\" said Holly. She was sitting a ways away from Emily, further than usual by about two spaces.  Emily nearly spoke up afterwards, but something stayed her tongue. She took out her phone as Alice spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and Lauren says she's planning a big party wednesday next week.\" Both Jess and Holly joined in an 'Ooooh.' Emily gasped and groaned. \"Oh, my GOOOOOOOOD.\" Holly briskly replied in an annoyed and sharp tone. \"What?\" Emily's brows furrowed as her head turned towards Holly, but then swung onward to the rest of the group. \"We've got a physical on Thursday after. Office-wide, mandatory.\" Everyone joined in a collective groan of annoyance. \"Wait, it gets worse. There's a caveat to this too. Anyone who meets, like, some criteria or whatever is going to get sent on five month paid administrative leave, and if they don't improve by the time they get back, they're out!\" Jessica spoke up in outrage. \"What!? That's bullshit! I can't believe this, they're threatening to fire us!?\" Alice's face turned to despair. \"I don't understand, what the hell? This is out of nowhere, I can't remember the last time we had a physical!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stress mounted and the gang dispersed to go back to work. The sound of stress eating echoed down the hall, wrappers opening and cans of soda cracking open. The last physical came when someone had been rushed to the hospital for passing out going up the steps, and it had been a long time ago. The office was in a period when many of the old guard had begun to reach their peak weights, and were still in. This scared especially Holly, who opened packets at a rapid rate. This scared the ever-loving hell out of her. Nobody knew what criteria would be looked for to threaten their positions here. All they knew was that tomorrow, blubbery heads would roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lobby was filled with the sweating, anxious, blubbery forms of the workers of Gordge. These types of crackdowns very rarely came, and many not involved in corporate were anxious. Some rumored that Gordge was going to start bringing in treadmill desks. Some said that these were going to be mandatory. A lot of rumor got thrown around. But eventually the line stretched around to a group of impromptu cubicles set up with medical personnel going back and forth, names being called to come forth and enter the cubicles and exit 30 minutes later, reactions varied, some were ecstatic, some were terrified, some were apathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon came Jessica's turn. She entered and was met by an old stone-faced man, wrinkled and worn with a bald spot at the top of his head. His voice was low, full of bass, but rose and fell. \"Alright, take a seat there.\" Jessica hated doctors. She was obviously very anxious. She bit her lip, as the thought of a cigarette came to her. Soon the Doctor came with a barrage of questions as he ambled about and set up a scale, got out a blood pressure sleeve, and arranged his pen and paper to write, pausing his tasks after Jessica's reply. \"Do you smoke?\" the old man asked. Jessica sighed. \"Yes.\" She couldn't lie. She had a cigarette beforehand, and smelled obviously of it. \"Do you have a family history of Heart Disease, Diabetes, or High Blood Pressure?\" Jessica thought back. She had an aunt who died when Jessica came out of college of heart disease, but beyond that not much. \"No.\" The doctor continued scribbling. \"Do you get thirty or more minutes of exercise a day, or one hundred and fifty a week?\" Jessica sighed. \"No.\" The doctor scribbled and then moved to fit the sleeve around Jessica's arm. \"Hold your arm still.\" Jessica murmured an affirmative. This proved to her always to be a difficulty, suspending her blubbery arm which barely fit the sleeve in mid air as the arm fat on the underside of her arms jiggled and protested against the constricting sleeve. Soon the doctor began squeezing the ball attached. The sleeve seemed to choke Jessica's arm, and eventually the Doctor checked the number. He sighed and scribbled something on his paper. Jessica couldn't see the number, but the Doctor's expression became more morose than before, which was somehow possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up and step onto the scale.\" Jessica did so and stood on the scale. The number dialed back and forth and soon announced robotically, \"Five hundred and forty six point six pounds.\" Jessica emitted a \"Damn.\" aloud. The doctor scribbled again and then spoke. \"Sit back down and take deep breaths.\" He withdrew his stethoscope and listened in. Jessica's heart beat hard as the doctor listened, but Jessica thought nothing of her heart rate. The doctor scribbled it and checked for a vein to draw blood from. He grunted in annoyance as he searched hard to find a vein, palpitating. Eventually he had to resort to using a tourniquet to make a thin blue vein make itself apparent. Jessica turned her head. She could deal with the prick of needles, but she hated seeing them go in. After a moment, the doctor withdrew the needle and band-aided Jessica's needle mark, and removed the tourniquet. He spoke up as Jessica stood. \"I'm going to tell you, even before your blood work comes back, I think I can say just by your heart rate and your blood pressure, you're already far below what's required in those slots. If your cholesterol is any higher than average, you'll have to go on that five month paid leave. I'd advise losing weight and stopping smoking, because both of those things are ruining your health, just looking at your heart rate, blood pressure, and weight alone. For weight loss, may I suggest my good compatriot Jennifer Lasdowne? She's had great success even in this same office.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica waddled out with a copy of her physical. She had been on the disregarding side of the spectrum in terms of caring for her weight and health, but looking at the numbers compared to the scale provided on the paper, she became deeply worried. She was unsure about trying Jennifer again, but also unsure about trying to quit her cigarette habit. As expected, her bloodwork came in and her cholesterol was far above average. Jessica was on the way out when Lauren Gordge's form passed her office, and stopped. \"So, Jess, I heard that you've got to go on that five month leave. I gotta say, I love the work you do for this company, but you've got to be around to do more. We need you, Jess. You don't need to turn into Jillian Michaels or anything, just get healthy. Your numbers scare me.\" Jessica sighed and nodded. Lauren patted Jessica on her meaty torso. \"Hell, I ought to get healthier myself. You might come back to a thinner me, in fact.\" Jessica left. She would not see the office again for another five months, and as she arrived home, her mind pondered her options.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica took a deep breath after she had gotten home. She really didn't want to have to deal with Jennifer again, but she also really didn't know how she was going to make it without her cushy corporate position. She picked up the phone and called the number. A feeling of apprehension and slight dread came into her head as the phone dialed. Soon, a voice came up. \"Hello, offices of Lasdowne and Mazowitz, Weight Management Specialists, how can I help?\" Jessica spoke up. \"Hey, this is Jessica Rhodes, I'd like to speak to Jennifer Lasdowne about a weight loss program.\" The receptionist spoke up. \"Sure thing, please hold.\" Jessica spent a few moments on hold, some generic digitized version of a pop song playing over the phone. Soon, Jennifer's voice came over the phone. \"Hello, this is Jennifer Lasdowne. How can I help you?\" Jessica spoke up. \"Hi, Jen, it's me, Jess. I'd like to ask about resuming that weight loss program.\" Jennifer spoke up. \"Oh, sure, sure. I'd be okay with that. Same thing as before, the live-in or do you want a more hands-off approach?\" Jessica spoke up. \"The live-in, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer had arrived at the parking lot and strolled briskly towards Jessica's apartment. It had been a while since she'd done the live-in. She still remembered the debacle that was Jessica's prior attempt, but she'd forgiven her for that long ago. She approached Jessica's door and knocked. Jessica opened up. It became blatantly obvious that Jessica not only had not tried to continue on without her, but had gone nearly in the opposite direction, her blubbery body looked even fatter. \"Heyy, Jessica.\" Jennifer spoke. Jessica nodded in reply and spoke up, \"Hi, Jen.\" Jessica stood aside. The thin, brown-haired form of Jennifer passed Jessica's hulking fat form and entered. She checked about. Things looked like they had before she had come the first time. There were pizza boxes in one corner and bags of junk food in the trash can. \"So, what's happened since I left?\" Jessica spoke up, taking a deep breath beforehand. \"Uh, I sealed an agreement with another company, part of it was physicals, once a year every year with the caveat that anyone who had particularly bad health had to be sent out for five months to fix it. If I don't fix my health issues in five months, by the time I get back, I'm fired.\" Jennifer nodded. \"Oh. Well, don't worry, now you don't have to worry about the office snacks! But really, I'm sorry about the health issues. I -am- also a certified medical doctor besides just specializing in diet. I can help you keep track of that stuff.\" Jessica sighed. Jennifer stood up and looked in the pantry. Jessica spoke up as Jennifer peeked. \"Oh, I figured I'd do the shopping before you got here. Just check up behind me.\" And Jen did. Jessica had done fairly well. Her pantry was stocked with some good choices. Jennifer nodded. \"This is great! You did a good job. Heck, if you just keep shopping like this and ignore the snacks at the office, you can do pretty well at losing weight!\" Jessica smiled. Jennifer turned to her and spoke up. \"So, first things first, let's see how you do at working out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no, here we go again,</i> Jessica thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica panted and groaned as she trudged on legs of lard. She was only walking but she had gotten worse, much worse since the gym-going days of Jennifer's first time. To her credit, she'd been walking for fifteen minutes but her lungs were burning by this point and her legs were wobbling as she walked and her massive belly which covered the tops of her thighs jiggled and bounced in the constricting nylon tank top. Jennifer turned the Treadmill down to one, and let Jessica trudge for a minute before Jessica put her legs on the sides as the treadmill slid to a stop on her own. \"Alright, so you've got a way to go, but you've got this.\" Jessica was just thankful she wasn't being chewed out, and thankful that her burning lungs could breathe again. She took a long gulp of water to relieve her burning innards and to calm her racing, pounding heart which concerned her more after the physical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the first month, Jessica was doing swimmingly. Jennifer's diet plan didn't starve her, nor did it gorge her. She ate when she was hungry, just on things that were healthier. Her exercise capacity improved, but she watched her heart rate. With the dangers she was alerted to, she didn't want to overdo it, and neither did Jen. But this didn't mean Jen let her drag her feet. Jessica was pushed as far as she could be pushed within reason. Within the first month, at its end, she had lost about twenty pounds, but Jennifer told her that this was not a permanent loss and that she had to continue pushing herself. She had some distance to go.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The receptionist at gordge had been checking in many of the five month-ers who had health bad enough to be sent out for five months. Miss Holly from Corporate, a massive blob of a woman who could got out of breath waddling past had to be thrown out after being told that she hadn't improved enough, and that she was fired. A familiar brunette walked into the lobby. The receptionist took a second, but recognized it as Jessica. \"Jessica! Good to see you! You look so skinny!\" Jessica smiled broadly. When she last weighed in, she was down to 477. \"Thanks! My dietician has done WONDERS for me.\" The receptionist flipped through a book and spoke to Jessica. \"Well, hook me up with her. I'm getting sick of getting winded getting back to my car.\"  Jess passed the receptionist. She'd enjoyed this new part of herself being discovered and wondered if it might be worth it to just keep going, to get back to her old 350 when she first started, or to get even smaller than that. She went for the stairs, she figured she was really going to put herself through her paces. She trudged up the stairwell. While she was certainly more fit, climbing those stairs still took a lot out of her, her still considerable belly jiggling in its shirt as it hung just over her crotch, close to being perky again. Her rolls and her still quite fat arms jiggled as she went up. Eventually she had to switch to the handrail and slow down before she hit the fifth floor. She was quite winded, but before, she would have been unable to do this at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walked through the hallway, passing Alice's office. She peeked in and waved at Alice. \"Hey, Al!\" Alice got up and charged Jess, hugging her hard. \"Jess! Oh my god, you've lost a lot of weight! Did you start talking to Jennifer again?\" Jessica nodded hard. \"Uh-huh! She's worked miracles with me, I swear it's this office and especially Holly.\" Alice shook her head. \"Oh, did you hear? Holly's out. She couldn't get any better over the break.\" Jess shook her head. \"Damn, that's a big shame. She was fun to have around. Who's gonna replace her?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica took in Alice's figure as she replied. Alice was roughly the same size as she was before, maybe a little smaller. \"So, how did you go? Did they have to send you off?\" Alice shook her head. \"Nope. I got the good genes. I tried my hand at losing weight while I was still working, but it's so hard with all the snacks around here!\" Jessica nodded. \"For real.\" Alice perked up. \"Ooh, you wanna work out after work?\" Jess perked up similarly. \"Sure! That'd be great!\" The two parted and went about their workday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was filled with congratulations around the office, but Emily seemed fairly content with things. She was larger than when Jessica was last at the office. She seemed to be around the 530's. Jessica stayed away from the excess of snacks, but was unable to stay away completely. She had a few donuts here and there. And her cigarette habit had not gone away, she still took breaks, she only refrained from her usual debaucherous gorging while smoking. Lauren poked her head into Jessica's office as closing time came about. \"Hey, Jess! Thought I'd pop by!\" She entered the doorway in full. She had certainly not lost weight, she had gained most certainly. It became obvious that the meetings took a toll on Lauren's waistline and she seemed to be ballooning towards what Jessica started at the office at, 350 pounds. Her suit was strained especially around the hips, as Lauren's thighs and hips were her gaining areas. This gave her a lot of problems with doorways as Jessica soon discovered. \"Hey, Miss Gordge!\" Lauren spoke up. \"So, uh, I'd just like to say, you're staying, miss Lasdowne let me know about your progress and you're in the clear. Keep it up! Oh, uh, I might need you to stay around overtime tomorrow. Big meeting, I need you to stay behind and write up on it to some subsidiaries in Texas.\" Jessica nodded. \"Can do.\" Lauren waved good-bye and shimmied sideways through the door and trudged down the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, Jennifer and Alice all pulled and pushed the sticks of the Elliptical trainers. Alice was behind a bit, and Jessica slowed herself to keep pace. Alice wheezed at Jess. \"Oh, Don't... Worry... Don't slow down be...because of me..\" She chugged some water and tried to labor on, but it became obvious Alice was quite out of it. Jessica was feeling the burn too, but she'd been working at it for five months. Jen worked between them and turned to Alice. \"You got this, don't try to burn yourself out. Listen to your body.\" Alice nodded and kept at a steady pace. Jessica's stomach was significantly larger, but she had learned how to navigate it. It was difficult but possible, she had learned. The two porkers and the trainer kept pace. After about thirty minutes, all three got off. Alice had pushed herself to her limits, and Jessica wasn't far behind. Both of them were still fairly large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer led them towards the squat racks. \"Aight, Jess, let's see if you bust that big behind tonight.\" Jess finger-gunned at Jen. \"You bet your little ass I will.\" She gripped the bar and set her feet apart. She checked the weight: She was lifting some 100-odd pounds on her tightening but still blubbery rear-quarters. The folds that used to threaten to merge with Jessica's cankles had begun to shrink back into the back of the thigh with her loss. She lifted the bar off the rack, and the two watched. Jessica's flesh jiggled involuntarily as she placed the bar on the back of her neck and brought her massive, fat torso downwards between her knees. She pushed herself back up, then back down. The first few were no sweat, but as she got towards 10 her size began to show. Her belly and thighs intensified in their jiggling, clearly due to Jessica beginning to reach the edge of her endurance. Jennifer found the motion somewhat hypnotizing, that it was almost like watching the jiggling of jello, and somewhat satisfying. She pushed through it, and finished the set out strong. She stepped away and guzzled her water as smaller Alice stepped towards the bar. She lowered the weight to 50 and pushed through a set herself. She herself jiggled through, and towards the last few reps, she found herself pushing hard breaths through her lips. \"Come on! You got this! Finish the set!\" encouraged Jen as she spotted Alice. Alice was able to bring the bar up to the rack and stepped away. Jennifer couldn't resist. She patted Alice on the lower back. This sent her side-rolls and her rolling potbelly jiggling. Jen felt almost aroused by this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica's ever-slimming form entered the lobby on a cold November day in her thick woolen suit jacket from her heavier 546 pound days. She was certainly thinner even than she had been a few months before when she had returned from her five-month hiatus, but not quite in the 300's, just about where she'd started her second year at Corporate. She trudged up the steps after giving a curt wave to the receptionist and got up to the fifth floor, her still large if smaller stomach jiggling as she went up. The sheer movement of her blubber still took some extra breath out of Jessica, but her improvements in Cardio had given her a hand. In fact, by the time she'd gotten to her fifth-floor office, she'd had only a sheen of sweat across her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica peeked into Alice's office, giving a wave to the blonde co-worker in her white button-up which had grown a little looser with each passing month. She'd stayed with Jen and Jessica's workout programs, and was obviously making some changes in diet, but her losses weren't as rapid as Jessica's, and the reason was present in the donut in her hand that she idle-mindedly munched as she worked. Alice turned her eyes to Jessica and waved. \"Morning, Jess!\" Jess waved back. \"Morning, Al. Know what Lauren's got planned?\" Alice shrugged. \"I heard something about a bonus, the usual big Christmas party and maybe a week off for Thanksgiving, and that's about it.\" Jess nodded, \"Hope the thanksgiving thing's right. That's right around the corner.\" Jessica and Alice both weren't quite dreading Thanksgiving. They figured that these few occasions of indulgence couldn't hurt as long as they kept themselves straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pack worked until it was time for their usual coffee break at about 10. Jessica, Alice, and Emily's blubbered form grabbed mugs, filled them, and sat. Jessica simply sipped her coffee while Alice daintily munched at a donut, and Emily unabashedly inhaled donuts nearly by the handful. Her weight gain had seemed to speed up if anything, and she'd become quieter around the office in general. Her blouse was exploding at the seams, each roll making itself apparent as she sped upward in terms of scale. She seemed to be on the higher end of the 500's, if not already 600, which was in fact quite possible by looking at the dark-brown haired increasingly fat creature. Emily was becoming the slightly lighter-haired equivalent of Holly. Jessica turned to Emily. \"You know, Alice and I are eating better and working out. You don't have to wait until the new year to try to try to get thinner.\" Emily grunted as she replied by eating another donut, then spoke after swallowing. \"I'm too fat for that shit, girl.\" Alice shook her head. \"No, really, you're not. You never are.\" Emily gave no reply, only continuing to eat. \"Why not this week, come to the Gym with Alice and I after work.\" Silence resumed its dominance over the break room. Jessica shrugged and grabbed a donut and joined Alice in munching on a donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, a new head popped in. One fresh and unrecognized. The soft-faced bleach blonde walked nervously in. \"Hiii, my name's Kaitlyn. This is Corporate, right?\" The group turned their eyes to the relatively svelte 250 pounder, only a little smaller than Alice. Alice turned to her. \"Uh, yeah, this is Corporate. I'm Alice.\" spoke the still hefty blonde as she stood and shook the newcomer's hand. She turned to the comparatively massive brown-haired compatriot. \"This is Jessica.\" Jessica performed the same maneuver, and as she did this, Alice motioned to the elephant in the room, the much larger and more hoggish dark-brown haired woman with her double-belly and multiple rolls, who seemed to explode out of her blouse. Emily nodded. \"And this is Emily.\" Kaitlyn nodded at her. \"Well, it's nice to meet all of you!\" She grabbed a mug of coffee and sat down with the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week rolled on towards its conclusion, Gordge's employees brought in more food than ever, and Kaitlyn joined this tradition, not having been part of Jessica and Alice's attempts to slim down. Sugar cookies, pastries, and some of the first candy canes of the season. Alice and Jessica figured they'd partake, but only a little. They wouldn't exactly hog out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot yet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica's drive was long and hard as she pushed her relatively ritzy red car down a road dotted on either side by strip malls and fast food joints towards her relative's house. She avoided long drives when she could, but her relatives were just close enough to not justify the expense of a plane ticket. Jessica's relatives lived in mid-Virginia, a decent drive from Gordge HQ that would be much more expensive. While her grandparents were much deeper in the south, her parents did some work loosely related to the government and were closer to the Mason-Dixon line, but still with a few of those southern traditions. Especially large portions of high-calorie food, one of the tenets of life with her mother. However, she had plenty of relatives she knew that would be there that would not nearly be as far gone as Jess in terms of weight. Even with the high-calorie lifestyle, most of her other relatives had not been nearly as fat as Jessica had been on many of the past Thanksgivings. The last time, she'd had so many lectures. She'd welcomed the fact that she would likely FINALLY receive praise as opposed to censure for what she'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, she hoped. In reality, she was more jubilant about what she was guaranteed: partaking in the time-honored American tradition of gorging herself insane for a day and disregarding the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Jessica arrived at the little burb between the various in-fill of northern Virginia that contained the house of the Rhodes family. She could spot it a mile away as she drove down familiar streets with old high-school dramas that played out as she drove by. There was the bus stop where Shelly, one of the popular girls on her bus threw a twinkie at her. She tried to shut the memories out. There was a reason that she moved much further up north and into a more anonymous environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment she pulled to a park on the curb in front of the two-story light orange house that belonged to her Parents. She unbuckled her seatbelt and pulled it all the way around her mound of a stomach. She proceeded to wiggle her way out of her car towards the house. There were several other cars pulled in, but the one she recognized was the faded blue sedan belonging to her parents. She rang the doorbell and waited, remembering the good memories attached to the house. She had to admit, there was some longing for the halcyon days attached to the house, hot home-cooked food made fresh from the kitchen and fun days out to the beaches a ways out east. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, a gray-haired woman opened the door and looked up at her with an opening smile. \"Heyy, baby!\" It was Jessica's mother. \"Hey~, Mom!\" Jessica hugged her arms around her mother's slightly large form, but her mother struggled to reach all the way around Jessica. Her hands ended up on her love handles, she patted as she hugged. Jessica's fat jiggled beneath the baby blue blouse that she wore. The older woman stepped aside. \"Come on in, come on in!\" Jessica's mother's hair was long, down to her shoulders, and not yet entirely gray, still some vibrant veins of red beneath the greying mantle. She shuffled on towards the table where multitudes of Jessica's relatives were. Especially dreaded, however, was the gaze from her cousin, Melinda, from Tampa. Melinda had become insuffrable in the past years, making a long preachy speech about how Jessica ought to lose weight. And that gaze fell upon Jessica, but not with the usual fire it carried. It still had some of the judgement there, but it carried surprise in the raising of brows. Jessica wasn't dumb, and could nearly hear her thinking <i>Damn, she's actually lost weight.</i> Jessica wanted to smirk, but she couldn't reveal her hand just yet. The proverbial flop was yet to come with the hogging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she would not be alone. Even trim and slim Melinda couldn't resist hogging out with the best of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the turkey came out, as did the fresh, fragrant rolls and the many, many other servings. A collective sigh of relief came from the table. It was as though the angels of heaven had descended in the form of an old lady with great gifts of food. The family paused only for Jessica's mother to stop and say a short grace, and then the eating began. Jessica reached in and stabbed off a few slices of turkey, a few rolls from the great pan of rolls, dished a mound of mashed potatoes as large as her stomach onto her plate and enough gravy to bury them. No space in the kitchen was wanting, and there was food on all fronts to be sampled, tasted, and partaken of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica dove in with her fork and brought some mashed potatoes to her mouth, munching. She hummed in delight as conversation ensued about work-related issues. Jessica's plate had quite a pile to go through with turkey, rolls, butter beans and corn, but Jessica ate on. She paused only to speak briefly in a conversation about work issues, speaking after swallowing a mound of mashed potatoes, but focused always on the food. Her cheeks still knew the motion of puffing up from their already blubbery state to accept a mouthful of food, complementing her double-chin to make her seem much fatter than she truly was. Her stomach began to extend from its normal position behind the rather flowy dress  and just above the midpoint of her thighs to just forward of that, growing ever toward her knees. Her blouse that flowed at the beginning of this meal began to greet and rest on the stomach that came out to greet it and demand more fabric, reducing the flowiness of the fabric as the mega-plate began to diminish. Melinda spoke up in a lull of conversation. \"Hey, Jessica, I noticed that you've shrunk a LOT from last Thanksgiving, what's your secret?\" Jessica swallowed her mouthful of food. \"Oh. I've got a live-in dietician, Jennifer Lasdowne. She helps me with a lot, eating better, working out. Sometimes you really do need that extra push.\" Melinda nodded. \"Well, it sounds good. I can't wait to see how little you get next year, you'll be so tiny!\" Jessica chuckled. \"Yep, just wait, I'll be right up there with you next time I come down to Florida. I might finally get back into a two-piece!\" Jessica dug into her plate further, with one of the last chunks of corn and some turkey on her fork, her mother spoke up. \"Now, now, honey, you know you can always wear whatever you want. You're always beautiful.\" Jessica smiled as she swallowed. \"Aww, thanks, Mom. If only I could find a man that thought the same!\" The rest of the table gave a chuckle as Jessica dove back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plates kept coming and the flowiness of the blouse became less and less. Seconds. Thirds. Jessica began to truly show the reason why her mother cooked so much for these meals. The rest were on desserts and coffee now, but Jessica kept plowing through. Melinda chuckled as Jessica returned with her third plate. \"Well, we might see you get right back to last thanksgiving at this rate!\" Jessica's mother lightly slapped her on her elbow. \"Hush up! She can eat as much as she wants.\" Melinda rubbed her elbow and muttered a sorry, but gave a glance to Jessica's blouse. As Jessica finished her fourth plate and went back for dessert, the blouse that was outright flowy was packed to the brim, and began to ride up to show a bloated stomach and curtail to Jessica's rolls. Jessica pulled to a seat with her pie a la mode and polished it off slowly. Even this weighty woman only had so much room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation carried on as the late afternoon menaced, as more family members began to leave. Melinda had Jessica off to one corner and spoke to her quietly. \"Now, I know that you've done well. But don't let the holiday season get to your head, girl. I don't wanna see you like last thanksgiving back here next year, big as a blimp like you were.\" Jessica shrugged, exposing one of her belly rolls as her blouse struggled to cover anything near Jessica's belly button. \"I'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica had got back to the apartment, she was alone. Jennifer had left, she had to keep up with the influx of patients associated with holiday weight at the office. Jessica slacked with Gym appointments and Alice began to do the same, replacing appointments at the Gym with appointments with Christmas treats at the bakeries and high-calorie holiday coffee drinks. The progress that Jessica had begun to make over October began to fade under a wave of holiday food and drinks, and the pounds previously shed began to return.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Gordge employees arrived at the grand meeting hall where they usually held company-wide lectures, meetings, or orientation for new interns or employees. The forms of the office workers had softened and expanded over the holiday break, and Christmas was always an opportunity for gorging, feasting, and showing the capacity of these blubberier forms. Corporate, rank and file, all were able to mingle in common piggish glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in conversation near the finger foods and snack table were Alice and Kaitlyn. \"So, where did you go to school?\" asked the hefty blonde form of Alice. Her button-up had become quite strained as the holidays rolled on, and the greatest trap for Alice were the holiday milkshakes at her favored fast food joints, along with the usual high-calorie holiday coffee drinks. She stuffed herself with a bear claw pastry from the baked goods. Kaitlyn shrugged and spoke, \"UCLA. I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't the best student. I was more interested in the bars.\" Alice gave a hearty chuckle. \"Girl, same. I passed because I was sweet on my chubby-chaser professor.\" Kaitlyn chuckled. \"Really? All mine only ever gave me were funny looks when I would bring a snack to class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened to reveal the true star of the night: Jessica. Gossip had been spreading around the office about how badly the holidays were hitting Jessica's weight loss, she looked at least ten to fifteen pounds heavier already made quite apparent in the new snugness of her dress. This dress was one she wore at a formal function in October, and it fit very well. By this point, Jessica's stomach attempted to escape from its skintight confines as it began to sag back down towards Jessica's crotch with the telltale thickness at the very base of the stomach. Additionally, the sleeves of the dress fought to hold the line against Jessica's bulging arm fat that pushed hard to be free and jiggled with each step due to the pressure of the smooth linens of the dress. Additionally, the previously conservative neckline was now showing the top of Jessica's cleavage due to the expansion of Jessica's breasts with her new poundage. Kaitlyn spoke. \"Ooh, here comes Jess.\" Jess waddled by and waved at Alice and Kaitlyn. \"Hey, Al! Hey, Kait!\" The fat trio hugged in a mass of fat that quivered in a common impact, but none of them could reach around the other due to each others' size. The trio released each other with a chuckle that was partially of the joy of meeting friends at the holiday and the joyous atmosphere generated by the office party. The other part was to help them regain their breath after the impact on their stomachs. Alice patted Jessica as the group parted from each other. \"Jess, how ya been?\" Jessica smiled, accentuating her chubby cheeks and nodded. \"Pretty damn good, been enjoying myself this Christmas! Speaking of which, we gotta hit Diego's on New Years'.\" Alice gave a point at Jessica and spoke. \"Already got you beat, they've been running their BOGO this holiday.\" Kaitlyn's eyes lit up. \"Shit, they've got a BOGO on beer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group grew silent as the main courses of the night came out. It was glorious, great platters of fried turkey, burgers, fries, sweets, pizza, and so many more treats. The horde of blubbery beasts that cluttered the floor swarmed, but first among them was Jessica, who nearly bowled over poor Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn rubbed her arm which was unfortunate enough to have been caught in the whale-like creature's onslaught, \"Damn, that girl loves her food.\" The rest followed suit. The commendable staffers who carried the food never slacked under the endless barrage of fat creatures, but Jessica was prolific, up and down the line stacking a plate higher and higher with food. She got two, in fact, chock full with pizza, fries and turkey. The pizza took up a deal of room and if she'd tried to fit a burger on the pile, she would have toppled her piles. She waddled back to the table and immediately dug into the food. The restraint that existed in the months prior, if it had ever truly existed, had died. Jessica ignored any speech and drowned everyone out as she attacked her food with a voracity that made it seem as though she hadn't eaten today, or even in weeks. In fact, it was simply a portion of Jessica's brain that had lain dormant since the doctor's visit that re-awoke, and possibly something beyond that. The rest of the table was about shocked as Jessica absolutely demolished the plates of food while the rest of them spoke. It was a gluttony that even most gordge employees didn't display. Of course, the rest were indulging, but Jessica had nearly turned it into an art form. The table spoke on family issues, as Alice spoke up with a remark, \"Oh, and of course I got the talk again back home. Mom never leaves me alone about it. \"You've gotten even bigger! You were doing so good!\" It really drives me up the wall.\" Kaitlyn spoke up through the unmistakable sound of Jessica mindlessly pigging out. \"Girl, I know, I know.\" The sound of panting and near-choking came out. Alice turned to Jessica and patted her on her quite meaty back. \"Breathe, girl, breathe!\" Jessica raised her head up from the primal binge and panted. She was nearly out of breath and sweating profusely from the sheer power-eating she was doing. Jessica then wiped her brow and dove back into the food. Alice dismissively waved at Jessica. There was something driving her to eat and Alice wasn't challenging that power. She simply got up and got herself a second plate, where in a moment, Jess got up and got thirds and forths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica continued powering through the food, even as the rest began to settle down and talk, and some of the early leavers began to depart for the holidays. Jessica even kept eating until Alice and Kaitlyn left, Kaitlyn had sorely overdone it and Alice's stomach was so packed that she had to lean on much lardier Emily to even waddle. But Jessica kept powering through. Her dress had every inch full to bursting, her stomach hanging out and protruding far in front of her, rubbing against the table. She turned back, panting and covered in sweat, and tried to pull herself up. Her dress had enough. The stomach gave way first, creating a great tear which exposed Jessica's navel and her jiggling, quivering mound of fat beneath her dress. She continued waddling as though in a trance to the last dregs. The worried attendants called in Security as Jessica literally shoveled the last bits of food present into her mouth. This was the very last straw for her dress, which ripped wide, exposing her panties and bra. The security men, buff as such men had to be in an environment of heavyweights, dragged Jessica off to an office, put a robe on her, and escorted her to her car so she could drive home. It was no use, and she was in a food coma. She had to be taken home in a squad car and her car towed back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the christmas season came, Jessica didn't slow down, but only sped up. Her appetite soared as she passed christmas dinner and went onwards, and with no sign of Jennifer to be found, Jessica re-stocked her fridge with her old favorites, frozen pizza and soda, but she took a special loving to eating takeout over the holidays.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica pulled her blouse back below the bottom of her ever-expanding stomach as she munched on a pastry and sipped at a chocolate mocha. While it was late January and many of the office workers had gotten back into their routines, Jessica's appetite seemed to have not understood that the holiday binging was over. Jessica continued to tell herself that she'd get back on track any day now, and this was just a bit of a holiday reward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Coffee break rolled around, Jessica came into the room. Emily had rolled on accumulating her poundage. Her gluttony had merely increased from the Holidays, and her constantly-stuffed stomach seemed to be expanding exponentially by the week. It had been three weeks since the new year, and her button-up blouse rode up far above her belly button, and the bottom of her seemingly endless stomach jiggled as Emily gave it a solid pat after downing three donuts. \"Good girl.\" Jessica turned to Emily. \"The donuts have been really good recently, haven't they?\" Emily nodded. \"Mhm. I think it's a new contract. Some new bakery in town.\" Jessica nodded. \"I'll have to make a run myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Alice, who was picking at some oatmeal-raisin cookies. \"Have some donuts, Al!\" Alice shook her head. \"Uh-uh. I'm trying to lose those holiday pounds. Like I thought you said you would be doing by now?\" Jessica dismissively waved. \"It's just some holiday fun. I'll get around to it.\" Alice gave a quizzical glance at the bottom of Jessica's great mound of a stomach which stopped just above her knees again, as it began to peek out from its ill-fitting home in Jessica's blouse. Alice distinctly remembered that before the Holidays, said stomach stopped several inches shorter than it did now. It was a moot point, Alice sighed and returned to her cookies. Jessica spoke up through a donut as she tracked Alice's eyes. \"What?\" Alice turned to Jessica and spoke up. \"Uh, your shirt's riding up.\" Jessica grunted. \"Again? Damnit. This thing sucks.\" Alice shrugged. She never was one to nag people about their weight endlessly. Such activities were for people like her mother who never let up on her, especially when holiday meals came about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the coffee break came to an end and Jessica returned to her office for an endless round of snacking mixed in with working. Jessica's indulgence and \"reward\" extended to her lunch break. She figured she'd treat herself a bit further and leaned into the office break room. \"I'll be back, going on lunch break to that Italian place, Dennito's.\" Massively fat Emily waved a jiggling arm. \"See ya!\" she said through a mouthful of fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica pulled into the parking lot and waddled in, greeted by a fairly chubby young hostess, about college-aged. \"Hi, table for one.\" she spoke. The young hostess nodded. \"Gotcha.\" She couldn't help but glance at Jessica's girth, which did not even fully fit into her bursting button-up. She turned about and quickly walked to a booth. The young thing, though hefty herself, wanted to see this mass of blubber fit into it, or if she even could. She set down a menu. \"Your waitress will be with you shortly.\"  Jessica nodded and spoke. \"Thank you.\" She began squeezing into the booth, a very tight fit as her great stomach began flowing anywhere it could to try to find space. Jessica's breathing became difficult with the great obstacle of wood blocking her stomach's expansion for breathing. She found herself reducing herself to a pant, as anything else was impossible, and this constant in and out breathing motion of short breaths caused her stomach to rise and fall endlessly and rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby young hostess couldn't help but stare from a darker corner of the restaurant. It was amusing to watch, like slapping jello. This elephant of a woman was struggling to breathe in the enclosed space. Soon the waitress, a mid-aged woman with dull blonde hair came by. \"Hii, my name's Amanda, I'll be your server. What would you like to drink?\" Jessica turned to her and spoke through labored breaths. \"Pinot Noir, please..\" The woman nodded. \"And do you know what you want to eat yet?\" Jessica looked through her menu. \"Give me a second.\" The woman nodded and went about to the wine shelf. <i>Holy shit, why did Dana try to fit this blob into a booth?</i> thought the server. The hostess, to Amanda seemed to have some kind of turn-on for seeing fat women squeeze themselves into tight spaces. Or she was a sadist. Either would seem to fit Dana, who loved watching the Gordge employees from nearby stuff themselves silly, then come to their rescue with some lubricant to pop them out. The pleasure never seemed overtly sexual,  but more the pleasure of a student working dedicatedly on a project, the pleasure of building a bench from scratch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amanda had returned and set the glass of wine before the panting blob of mass that was Jessica, she spoke. \"Are we ready to order?\" Jessica nodded. \"Yeah, think I'll have your....French Chicken on Linguine...Oh, and some Tiramisu and Espresso...\" The waitress nodded. \"Gotcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostess watched Jessica stuff herself silly. Dennito's portions were large, especially large, but this hog seemed to not be able to get enough. She stuffed herself with three baskets of bread and soaked them in the olive oil. It seemed to the hostess as if this woman was deliberately trying to stuff herself, and each morsel brought her breaths quicker. Finally the bowl of pasta with chicken, all in a creamy white sauce came out, along with the coffee and tiramisu. Jessica's mind raced. <i>Oh shit, can I finish all this?</i> \"Enjoy your meal, Ma'am.\" spoke Amanda with a bit of a judging glare. This woman really didn't need all this food. Jessica determined that this food was simply too delicious, at least in appearance, to not try to finish it all. Besides, she'd been training her stomach for the past while to fit more food, if subconciously through her indulgence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gave it her all. She slurped long noodles from the bowl and stuffed her cheeks with the bits of delicious, juicy chicken. The food was all so delicious. Her stomach ceased its protestations and allowed itself to expand with each bite. The only issue came when Jessica got about halfway through, eating the food through panting breath. Her stomach had continued to physically expand to make room for the food, but began to run out of places to go. Her diaphragm had to expand somewhere, and its pathways began to be blocked. Jessica kept eating, though her breaths came faster and harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panting, sweating hog gobbling down her food, her blouse becoming harder pressed to contain -any- of her blubber became such an amusing and pleasing sight to Dana. Amanda walked by her as the Restaurant began to empty, the calm before the dinner rush in two hours. \"I don't think the olive oil or butter is going to work with that one.\" Dana grinned wide and spoke. \"I know. I think she might need the Fire Department.\" The hoggish brunette plowed through her oily, buttery pasta and visibly enjoyed every inhaled bite. She leaned back, as a quick 'Snap' sounded itself from the booth. Amanda and Dana covered their mouths. \"Oop!\" emitted from Jessica's mouth. The waiting continued. Would she try to even retrieve the lost button? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to ignore the departed button and dove right into her Tiramisu and espresso. So it was true. This woman was an absolute hog! Dana schemed and plotted. Mayhaps she ought to look into getting to know her better, getting this hog even fatter? She had never had a pet project like this before. The closest she had was her roommate a semester back, a young athletic soccer player who she fattened up until she had lost her scholarship. A bit cold-hearted, true, but the fattest she ever got the soccer player was barely into the 190's from her slender 130. This would be a whole other ballgame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica struggled to squeeze out, but she found she was stuck. Her cheeks flushed red hot with embarassment. Dana came by. \"Is there anything I can get you today, Ma'am?\" Jessica shook her head. \"Uh.. If it's not too much trouble, can you help me out of here?\" Dana smiled broadly. \"Sure!\" She reached and tried to pull Jessica out. No good, the butterball was jammed in tight. She fetched some olive oil. \"I think we'll have to try lubrication.\" Jessica waved her hand rapidly. \"Yes, yes, just get me out of here, please.\" A feisty fatty. Dana took the oil and dabbed it on Jessica's exposed stomach through her nearly open shirt, and tried to slide Jessica out. Jessica made it nearly all the way out, but snagged on the very edge. Jessica gave a heave and a shove through her sweat and with that last exertion, she finally got out of the booth. Her great, massive stomach rolled out for the wait staff to see. \"Do you need anything to cover up with, Ma'am?\" politely asked Dana. Jessica nodded. \"Yeah, uh, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica offered her debit card to the chubby young hostess. \"Thank you so much for helping me with that issue.\" Dana waved her hand. \"Oh, it's nothing.\" She hastily scribbled her number on the back of the customer's copy of the reciept as she swiped Jessica's card. She hoped to get a call soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sweltering, fat form of Jessica waddled into her office covered in sweat from the summer heat. She'd spent the past five months continuing her \"temporary\" indulgences, only bemoaning the fact that the delightful holiday treats were gone, and she had to make due with other treats that were just as calorie-filled and bad for her waistline. This last portion was made blatantly obvious by the fact that she had to get her shirt tailored no less than three times over the past five months. Her button-up blouse had made her reconsider even wearing any more of them, as every single one of them was skin-tight, the buttons constantly popped off, and her stomach was practically visible through the gaps between her buttons and her twin rolls on her flanks jiggled with every movement, as her mammoth stomach rose and fall. The gossipers reckoned Jessica was right back where she'd started before she took six months off to lose weight, at around the 546 she'd started off at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs coffee time rolled about in the office, Jessica panted at the exertion of shoving herself up. Something felt off recently but she couldn't put a finger on it as she breathily waddled into the break room, greeted by the slimmed form of Alice, and the fattened forms of Emily and Kaitlyn. Emily was very large before the break, but now she took up about half the table with her pure girth. She was just 600 pounds as the new year rang in, but at this halfway mark of the year, it seemed as if the wad of fat had shot far past the 600 mark. She had brought in masses of snacks of her own, and it seemed as if there were not a moment she was not eating. If it were up to guessing, she seemed to be about in the 650's to the 660's. She hardly moved these days except for to the break room, to her office, and to the elevator which creaked more and more with every passing day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlyn's gains had not been nearly as drastic. She still ate plenty, but her appetite still seemed to be dwarfed by her colleagues. She had managed a mere 30 pounds since Christmas, but she was making her way up. Her mere spare tire met by a small slope had thickened to a full pot belly, but especially visible in her gains were her hips and her thighs, growing into a pear-shaped woman as she crept towards 300. She sipped away at a calorie-rich coffee drink and spoke up. \"Did you hear? Lauren stopped the physical exams.\" Emily cooed. \"Yess! I don't have to see that creepy old bastard again.\" Jessica gave a \"Woohoo!\" at this pronouncement, and followed it, \"Yes! That's awesome!\" Alice shrugged. She had gotten ever smaller since new years'. It seemed as though the blonde had lost 40 pounds, and she was right back to her old conscious self. Her shirt at first seemed to fit better, and \"Ooh, that's good. I gotta admit, there was something really creepy about that dude. Like, his voice maybe?\" In the back of her mind, she wanted to tell them that maybe they needed that physical, but she figured it was a moot point. She'd adopted a live-and-let-live approach to the weight of her co-workers. If they wanted to lose weight, they'd come with her to the gym after work. She thought of this, and turned to Jessica's blubbery form. \"Hey, Jess, want to come to the Gym with me after work?\" Jessica mulled it over and nodded. \"Sure. I'll give it a go, want me to grab Jen?\" Alice nodded. \"Uh-huh, she was super helpful last time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at her companions as they worked at the Treadmill. Alice's thick but slimming form seemed to be performing far better than Jessica, who panted and struggled to simply walk along the belt. Jennifer would occasionally turn to her and speak up. \"Turn it up, Jess, you can handle it!\"  Jessica would handle it, but Jennifer caught herself staring at Jessica's stomach as it jiggled and bounced in its vast, fat form. It was like hypnosis, and there was something more there, an arousal that Jennifer recognized, if only slightly. She loved how the vast stomach and the twin, vast rolls in Jessica's form rose and fell rapidly and shook mightily as Jessica jogged along. She had to get a feel, but be subtle about it. She reached across and turned the speed down just in time to catch one of Jessica's rolls, barely held back in its mightly fleshy nature in Jessica's skintight tank top. Jessica was too exhausted to remove herself immediately, and plenty of sweat accumulated on Jennifer's hand. \"Oop, sorry, saw you struggling a bit too much.\" Jessica nodded. \"Thanks, Jen, you always know what's best.\" Jennifer turned to Alice. \"You know, Jess has been doing good financially, and both of us have saved up enough for a down payment for a House. I think you'd be a good influence, wanna come?\"  Alice nodded eagerly. \"Sure! My apartment's rent's been kinda high, haven't been able to save much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally. She'd be able to fatten this one. Jennifer began to come to terms with what she was. She loved doing this, she loved seeing these women's forms expand and fatten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cardio wound down and the fat women took time to drink water. Now came a part Jen had been waiting for, she would get them to deadlift. The belts had this tendancy to make obese women's stomachs poof up beautifully, and she could only imagine the wonders it would do for Jessica's stomach. Jessica put on the belt, and had to bind it at the very last hole for it to fit, and at that it was very snug, her massive stomach was smashed against the belt and stuck out every which way. Jessica grabbed the bar, and Jen assumed the spotting position, supporting Jessica's grip on the bar with her left hand and putting her right hand on Jessica's fat lower back, giving it a solid pat. The fat jiggled on her lower back, and it pleased Jennifer mightily. Jessica struggled and groaned to lift the heavy bar up, but she managed to do it, picking it up, then lowering it with a clatter. Jennifer patted Jessica's fat lower back again. \"Great job!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica scratched an itch beneath one of her rolls, somewhat hidden behind a flowy Mumu garment which draped over her ever-expanding belly. She'd accrued a few weeks of Vacation time, and booked a two-week cruise on the <i>Merigold Maiden</i> ship, a favorite among Gordge workers. Beside her strode her slimmer companions, making her the \"fat friend' on several levels. While Alice was still fat, her drop to the 240's had her within range of return to her old self, when she'd just reached corporate. Her stomach was only comparatively a mild pot belly, a gentle but still fairly thick and still fairly flabby slope down to her sweatpants. Alice spoke up. \"Oooh, I can't wait. This is that Carribean cruise?\" Jessica eagerly nodded her head. \"Yes, and more importantly, it has a <b>buffet!</b>\" Jennifer and Alice both cooed. While Jennifer was a slim girl, she could still appreciate a splurge now and then \"Yessss! It's been so long since I've seen a buffet.\" Jessica chuckled, and spoke up. \"Well, you'll be around one all the time here!\" She sent a finger into Jennifer's flat stomach, which gave a very slight wiggle. \"Might help you put some meat on your bones.\" Jennifer chuckled. \"It probably will. Maybe you could donate some of yours.\" She nudged Jessica's great, hefty mound of a rolling, fat stomach, giving a massive jiggle. Jessica smiled. \"Wish I could, that'd be nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alice said nothing, though she thought <i>Yeah, it would.</i> She still worried about her ever-fattening friend and how oblivious she was to the fact that she was supposed to be on a diet. Her mind stopped just short of the question of why Jennifer wasn't intervening in Jessica's obvious weight gain when they came upon the Buffet. The trio stared in awe. It was a glorious sight. There was pizza, fried food of many varieties, a salad bar laden with rich sauces, and an absolutely beautiful dessert bar. It was heaven.\"Oh my GAWD!\" spoke Jessica. The three got drinks, put them at a table, and wandered off to the buffet bar. By the time they'd come back, Jennifer had come back with a salad dripping with ranch, far more than she'd ever recommend as a nutritionist. But this was a vacation, a buffet. She was supposed to go crazy. So that's just what she did. Jessica had gotten what could be very loosely referred to as a salad if salad included fried chicken, cold cuts, and perhaps a bed of lettuce, all buried in creamy italian sauce. Alice had gotten something similar with many nuts floating on the ocean of sauce on top. Jennifer's eyes went wide. Jessica spotted and spoke. \"Yep. Welcome to fat girl salads.\"  Alice laughed loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio eventually waddled back to their rooms. They were absolutely packed to bursting with food, and even Jessica's mumu became challenged at the task of holding Jessica's massive tight stomach as she collapsed onto the couch, which amazingly did not collapse under her weight due to the fact that it was bolted to the floor. \"Oooooh, who let us eat that much?\" groaned Alice, as she rubbed her painfully distended stomach which was about double the size it normally was. Jennifer's stomach was attempting to break free of its constraints within her jean shorts, straining the button. \"Oh, god... Oh, god...\" she mumbled. \"You guys... Really bad influence...\" The group had absolutely broken the bank, even by Jessica's standards. Jennifer tried her best to keep pace, but she was trying to maintain herself while Jessica and Alice were on thirds, and then fourths. Alice gave up just before fifths, and Jessica had only then felt she was ready for a dedicated plate for dessert.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerely a few hours later, they grazed on bags of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later they'd pulled into Jamaica. A young snack-shack worker swabbing the counter of his desk looked up to see two fat american women with a thinner female. The blonde one seemed absolutely skinny compared to the brown-haired Jessica, her stomach was attempting to explode out of her shorts, rolling over the waistband and covering her crotch. He had to turn his eyes to the woman's very, very fat face, with thick flabby jowls and a double-chin that nearly turned into a triple chin near the bottom. \"Hiii. I'll have a chocolate milkshake and, a, uhm..Chocolate chip cookie.\" It was so stereotypically american that the boy nearly broke out laughing but he simply said \"Right, that it?\" Blonde, fat Alice spoke up. \"I'll have a cherry coke and a bag of chips.\"  The thin one spoke up. \"I'll have a chocolate milkshake and... Do you have hershey's?\" The teen nodded. \"Then I'll take that.\" He handed them their food and spoke in his light Jamaican accent. \"Your shakes will be up shortly.\" He turned about and began blending the shakes while the blubbery trio waddled to their spot a ways away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Alice's foreheads were thick with sweat in the sweltering heat of the Carribean sun, a heat that even the ocean breeze couldn't cool. Eventually, the teen had prepared their milkshakes, and called for them.  Jessica struggled and attempted to pull her vast, fat body up, but she simply turned to Jennifer. \"Babe, can you get it for me?\" Jennifer chuckled and spoke. \"Sure thing.\" She jogged over to the shack and picked up the shakes, paid the teen with a twenty, and jogged back over to the towels with the milkshakes. She slid to her towel and handed the chocolate milkshake over to the blubbery, obese form of Jessica. \"Here y'go.\" She then sipped on her own and bit on her chocolate bar. The trio lay in silence in the presence of the tropical glory they were in. Jennifer leaned back and caressed her stomach. It occurred to her that her normally firm stomach had grown slightly larger and flabbier but she had simply accepted it. She was on vacation. It was almost expected. It felt nice to just let go for a while. Alice and Jessica turned to each other and smiled. It was the beauty of being with a friend in a wonderous place. Jessica sipped her chocolate shake and spoke. \"This is just...\" Alice nodded. \"Wow, yeah. It's perfect.\" They drank in the moment like they drank in their calorie-packed shakes. It was a beautiful scene for the three. Time seemed to drift away as they made small talk and spent time staring into the distance. Eventually, however, it was time to leave and they got back on the boat after spending some time swimming about. Jessica struggled in the water due to her sheer weight, and she attracted many, many ogles, especially from Jennifer when her back was turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the ship eventually pulled back into port, the three had certainly come back with extra pounds. They spent every single meal at the buffet, and snacked inbetween on calorie-laden snacks. Even Jennifer had come back with a protruding stomach and thicker breasts, and Alice's well-fitting shirts now began to become more snug again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The brown-haired mass of fat that was Emily sat at her chair, half-typing, half jamming cookies into her mouth. Her workday was a blur of constant food, and anyone trying to keep track of it all would quickly give up if anyone was insane to attempt such a thing. She heard footsteps down the hall as she brushed some cookie crumbs off of her massive stomach which fought for its freedom from the constraining shirt that on nearly anyone else, even in this office, would be very loose. Soon passing her door were the forms of Jessica, Emily and Kaitlyn, all clearly more plump from their cruise vacation. Emily took a breath and spoke. \"Heyy, guys!\" Jessica turned around and smiled, causing her great double-chin to fold forward. \"Heyyy, Em!\" Emily continued typing. \"How was the cruise?\" Jessica took a glance at Emily. The two weeks away had seemed to only inflate Emily's gain, there being nobody else to take her precious doughnuts. She gained quickly normally by her sheer intake of food, but she had to have gained nearly thirty pounds in only two weeks. It was shocking even for Jessica. \"It was good, it was good! You would have loved it, they had a full buffet and everything!\" Emily moaned in ecstasy at the thought. \"Ooooh, girl you know I'm on board for that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica dissapeared from view, Emily returned to consuming food. She felt a bit betrayed that she would have no more exclusive access to the donut box. She would need some boxes of her own, or need them only as much as a woman of her sheer girth would. It was more ravenous, exponential greed that grew with the size of her stomach. Emily glanced back at her screen, she did remember sometimes that this was not an all-you-can eat buffet of donuts but in fact a workplace. Her report on quarterly earnings since their partnership with Dynamo was about done, but unsureness touched her mind as she glanced at it. If she just sent it to Lauren like this, would it be presentable? Was it the correct format? Only one way to check, go nextdoor to Kaitlyn or Jess. Probably Jess, she was the workaholic of this gluttonous part of the office. Emily prepared for the endeavour. She only did it about twice a day now but she tried to get herself out of her chair, but no results were forthcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was confused. Her legs and arms seemed as if they had just glitched. She tried again. Her fat-covered legs refused the second attempt, and the joke that was Emily's upper body strength wasn't so funny when she tried to use it to get up. She took a deep breath and tried again, this time leaning on the table, a difficult feat to perform, especially with her massive stomach in the equation, but by the time she'd exerted herself to simply lean, she tried to push herself up, but her arms were only about strong enough to open a door and bring food to her ever-fattening jowls, and she was huffing just from mounting her own stomach with her upper body. She leaned back and groaned. She couldn't understand the simple logic that the whale of a woman had eaten herself to the point that she couldn't even get out of a chair. She wondered why, not seeing the problem that was directly in front of her. She surrendered for a moment and went to her donuts. The report could wait, but the krollers waiting in the box couldn't, at least while her legs were being weird. She brought the spiraling circles of sweetness to her mouth, her jowls inflating as she crammed two into her waiting maw at a time. Her overfed cheeks puffed up as she munched. She felt a pang of sadness coming that she was simply coping with her gluttony by eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quieted this issue by simply eating more krollers, every forward and backward lean bringing her chair closer to collapse. Her naescent woes were buried in sugary confections, soon she found the entire box to be empty. She remembered her mini-fridge was full of cokes, she reached back to retrieve one. This proved to be the last straw for her ever-abused chair, which gave a 'Crack' as she leant back. She gave a wail as she fell backwards, and the weight of a rapidly-falling 700 pound woman made the column below the chair seat crack in half, as her seat and the rolling support separated in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud 'Crash' resounded, a crash that every employee in the building heard, and an unfortunate intern on the fourth floor, directly below Emily's office felt drywall sprinkle her hair as she ran from behind the copier she was trying to retrieve a set of memoranda from. Jessica sprung up and hurried with amazing speed, making her stomach sway from side to side, to Emily's office. The bloated woman could be seen even behind her desk, flat on her back, her sheer mass visible just over the desk. She groaned as Jessica came around. \"Em? Em!?\" Jessica's eyes were met by the sight of Emily, her shirt ripped to pieces from a mixture of being overpressed by an overly full stomach and the sudden strain of the fall. Emily groaned in pain. Jessica shouted. \"Can we get some help here? Emily just fell!\" Jessica leant down and spoke. \"Emily? You okay? Em?\" Emily looked at Jessica, in a daze. Was she awake? Yes, yes she was. \"I...Dunno..\" She could barely speak, the fall had knocked the wind from her lungs, an already pressed department as every movement became more difficult with Emily's exponentially increasing size. Jessica tried to help up Emily. It was impossible for her alone. She was still fairly strong from her training with Jen, but she couldn't lift a 700 pound woman on her own. Alice came rushing in and began helping. \"Emily, you okay girlie?\" Jessica turned to her. \"I don't know, have Kait get the medics. She might be hurt.\" The two fat women assisting the mass of blubber up were, thankfully for Emily, fairly strong. Jessica and Alice had to sweat like they had not done in a month or two but Emily was just on her feet. The two huffed and puffed at the exertion of getting the fat woman on her feet. Emily steadied herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the medics came in and helped Emily to the doctor's office. As the morbidly obese woman was carted off, Jessica and Alice saw apparent a crack in the concrete floor, apparent through a tear in the fabric caused by the friction of the fat woman's fall. \"Jesus almighty...\" muttered Jessica. Alice turned to her. \"Emily cracked the floor?\" Jessica nodded. The two women didn't need to follow up the statement. The conclusion was obvious. The building had been designed with obese women in mind, and if Em was able to injure even this, then she was getting far too fat indeed. \"Call maintenance too. I don't trust that crack.\" By the end of the week, Emily had been diagnosed with a concussion and given a permanent dispensation to work from home. Emily would not be seen at the office again, and it was general knowledge that she had become bed-bound by her gluttony. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica's eyes peeled open at the curtains. She turned her head toward her clock. It read in digital red numbers that had a glow \"6:00\" as it blared an alarm out. Jessica groaned and shifted to smack the 'snooze button with her lardy arm. She stared into the darkness and pondered whether it was worth getting up this morning. She shrugged, she knew if she didn't at least try she'd just fall back asleep. She rolled over and gave a groan at the exertion, pulled on some pajamas and turned on her light, waddling ponderously into the kitchen to grab a cup of Coffee. She encountered the slightly plump form of Jennifer, who had gained some weight since the trio had moved to the house. She smiled over her mug. \"Hey, morning Jess!\" Jessica smiled. \"Morning, Jen.\" Jessica took in her coffee as she shuffled towards the table. It had been nearly constant that Jennifer already had a massive breakfast ready whenever Alice and Jess had awoken, whole platters of bacon, pancakes, sausage, eggs, oatmeal-or grits, if they were feeling country-ish. Jessica pulled herself to a seat and began to hurl bacon and sausage down her throat and sawing away at pancakes. She tilted her head up to look at Jennifer while she sipped her coffee. Jennifer's once-toned stomach had given way to a paunch that made her shirt ride up just so much--it was clear she was gaining some weight, that she wasn't immune to what she was doing to Jessica and Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she was doing, however, was amazingly effective. In the two months Jessica had been with Jennifer, she had to have gained at least fifty pounds, maybe sixty or seventy. Her stomach had gained inch after inch and Jessica had noticed, but she had given up. Jennifer had become more than just another tool for weight loss, she was a fixture of Jessica's home. She was a friend. Especially effective in transforming Jessica's waistline was swapping out the normally healthy meals of rice and chicken for frozen pizzas, massive amounts of home deep-fried food, and sweets. It played into Jessica's key weaknesses and it made her inflate out of control. She was about the size Emily had been just 8 months ago, an apple-shaped blob of fat, which made her look even fatter than Emily with her sheer gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice came downstairs and hurried to the table. \"Oooh, breakfast, why didn't you call me?\" she spoke. She was almost unrecognizable compared to how she had been two months ago. While Jessica's gains were somewhat slowed owing to her higher metabolism due to her sheer size, Alice had no such issues. Her stomach, breasts, and thighs had ballooned massively for such a short period, and she had to have gained 100 pounds at least. She was back to where she had been and quickly climbing past. \"Hey, Al!\" called both Jen and Jess. Jen was munching on some bacon and a few links of sausage. She enjoyed watching her piggies eat every morsel she put down, and balloon. She loved seeing every pound come on. It was like building a house, a steady progress that came from her sheer efforts. She also enjoyed letting herself go to some degree. She liked not caring about what she ate, and she'd made enough money that she could afford to take a break from her practice for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jennifer's piggies had to go to work. \"Take care, girls! Food'll be waiting!\" Jessica and Alice waved. \"Can't wait! See ya!\" Jennifer smirked as she watched her human balloons of fat jiggle off, especially Jessica's new back fat on her torso, and her additional third roll which especially jiggled just above her ass-crack. It was so pleasing to see her creations jiggle to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two at the office consumed exponentially more donuts than before. Emily might be gone, but her deliveries were still arriving, and the two lardy ladies were not ones to let perfectly good donuts go to waste. While Jennifer was great to blame for many of their new pounds, the sheer volume of donuts they were consuming was a great part. Kaitlyn had joined in and started getting her own box delivered while the other two plowed through two boxes at least. Kaitlyn looked with wide eyes. \"Darn, you guys are on a whole other level!\" Jessica simply nodded as she casually inhaled a donut into her lardening jowls. Her face seemed significantly fatter than Emily's ever was, and that combining with her physically blimp-like appearance made her seem like a literal whale. Kaitlyn had put on a good thirty pounds and she was easily approaching the 400-pound mark, her weight gain shifting a bit to her breasts and giving her just that much of an hourglass appearance. Her stomach was still fairly generous but not nearly as massive as Alice's, let alone the mammoth gut that belonged to Jessica. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lauren Gordge sat at her office, tip-typing at her keyboard. It was one of the few moments in the day when she wasn't moving. She had in fact slimmed greatly over the past few months, not out of choice, but out of the sheer fact that she moved so much and ate so little due to the fact that was her work schedule. In fact, her pot belly had begun to shrink to the point where her once great stomach was flattening, and if she kept up these habits, she'd be legitimately thin by anyone's standards. The form of one of the board members, Dana Massaglio, a fairly chubby woman with black hair hung in the doorway. \"Heyy, Lauren.\" She slyly slid a coffee cake onto the CEO's desk as the red-headed, thick woman turned her head. \"Hmm? Oh, hey, Dana. Thanks.\" The redhead unwrapped the cake and munched into it as Dana spoke. \"So, Jessica's been absolutely blowing up recently.\" Lauren hummed through a full mouth before she swallowed and spoke, \"Yeah, she has. I've heard she hardly moves, she's getting to be like Emily used to be before she had her accident and had to work from home full-time.\" Dana nodded. \"Yeah. Emily never did much, but Jessica has real potential, she sealed the deal with Dynamo last year, and she can pull some real moves around here. I don't know if we can just have her hog her way into immobility like we let Emily do.\" Lauren nodded. \"Mmm. Yeah, I do see your point. I think I'll have a sit-down with 'er, chat, get her to try to slow it down or at least keep where she is.\" Dana nodded and spoke. \"Gotcha. And take care of yourself, girl! You're wasting away!\" Lauren chuckled. \"I'll try, but I just stay so busy, what with the Dynamo stuff and the new contract negotiations with those guys outta Charlotte.\" Dana gave a wave and turned about. Lauren sighed. She never liked doing this but she only had to do this in serious cases where an employee had real potential and was wasting their potential as businesspeople.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was in a mixture of inhaling food and typing at her desk. She hadn't gotten up all day, even for break she had elected to stay in her office because as of late, she simply got too winded waddling across the hall. Suddenly, her phone began to ring. She reached to pick it up. \"Hello?\" Lauren's voice came over the phone. \"Yeaah, Hey Jess, this is Lauren. Could you come up here? I've got to talk to you about something.\" \"Sure thing.\" Jessica hung up and groaned. She'd have to walk all the way to the elevator again. She pulled herself up with a great effort. her mammoth stomach scraping past the arms of her chair that grew ever tighter with each day as the bulk of woman jiggled her way towards the elevator. She panted as she continued down the hallway. This walk didn't use to take as long, and Jessica was questioning why she felt so tired. She figured it was because she didn't get up to get her extra cup of coffee like she usually did. She made a mental note to get a coffee machine for her own office. She finally made it to the elevator, and she was absolutely knackered. Her heart was pounding at an alarming rate and she was gasping for breath. She slammed the \"10\" that was for the 10th floor, the Executive office. She took a breather before she trudged down the hall, being extraordinarily loud as she pounded her way towards the end of the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slender, red-headed form of Lauren walked up towards Jessica. She could hear her wheezing from her office and thought to her herself, <i>Jesus, Jessica's actually gotten that fat?</i> \"I gotcha,\" she spoke, giving her arm to Jessica as she leaned on it. \"Thanksboss..\" Jessica mumbled out as she stumbled along with Lauren's help. Lauren sat Jessica down in two chairs put together. \"Have a seat, Jess.\" Jessica sat down and panted for breath. Lauren leaned on her desk and spoke up. \"Now, Jess, you've been a great asset to this company. Your star's been rising and when Amanda retires, I have half a mind to appoint you as Head of Public Relations.\" Jessica's weary mind picked up at this. Head of PR was as good as heir to VP, third-in-line to the entire company. \"But, there's a problem.\" Lauren's eyes stared directly into Jessica's. \"You've been gaining at an alarming rate, and normally we don't say anything about this, but it's impacting your work and especially your potential to go and do business abroad for us. It's a problem, and if you want that position, and if you want to stay in corporate, I'd advise halting your gains, and cutting back about a hundred pounds. If you continue gaining and cannot get around, we'll have no option but to cut you back from corporate and make you work from home.\" Jessica nodded. \"Understood perfectly.\" She really, really wanted that Head PR position, but it would be hard to cut back on the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Alice had gotten back home and entered to a table full of food with Jennifer standing in front. \"Hey, guys! Welcome back! Have a seat, I made fried chicken!\" And had she ever. There had to have been two, three trays of it, french fries, mozzarella sticks, macaroni and cheese, rolls and everything.  \"Oooh!\" peeked up Alice, who rushed over to the food. Jessica had a moment of awakening. Hadn't she gotten Jennifer to help her <b>lose</b> weight in the first place? It seemed as though recently she'd done nothing but gain weight. Of course, her misgivings weren't enough to suppress her rampant hunger. Half in a trance she waddled to the table next to Alice. There was a mental disconnect as she absolutely demolished half a tray of chicken by herself. Her mind seemed to be telling her, \"No, no, stop, you have to lose weight to get that position, you can't do that while eating all this food!\" But her stomach seemed to be demanding it, she kept eating through her misgivings. Her shirt grew drum-tight as the meal came close to a conclusion, just before Jennifer brought out food. Jessica's face involuntarily turned to elation. The sheer sight of dessert temporarily placated her misgivings. Okay, she could have this indulgence before she got started. As she dug through a third of the cake, another third going to Alice and the last third going to Jen herself, Jessica's shirt gave way, ripping right down the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner had finished, she waddled up to Jennifer and explained the situation to her. Jennifer responded...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer sighed. It seemed her little piggy was going back on her. \"That sounds absurd. Why do you need to lose weight to get the position?\" \"Well, I've been having trouble getting around, and Lauren says I've got to be able to move around to be a head of PR.\" Jennifer sighed. She really wanted to see Jessica swell up to absurd proportions, but she understood that work came first. Plus, Jessica would be able to move around less if she got Vice President. \"Well, I'll help you out.\" Alice groaned. \"Girl, you do realize this means I'm going to be the size of a house if you stop eating all this food?\" Jennifer turned her head to Alice. \"Only if you want to be.\" Alice raised a brow, and chuckled. \"I guess I could keep eating like this while we have the food to do it. But next grocery run, please get less food. Unless you plan to join the obese girl club.\" Jessica semi-whispered so that Alice could also hear. \"Doo iiiit...\" All three chuckled at it. It was a good joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's forehead choked with sweat as she stretched sideways. \"Hooold that pose. Hoold it. Feel the burn.\" Jessica's entire lower stomach was exposed by the move. \"Why is this... so hard...\" Jennifer poked at her belly. \"That's why, girlie. Don't worry, keep at it. I know you can lose some of this.\" Jessica nodded. \"True, I guess..\" Jennifer was still unable to really contain herself in terms of fondling Jessica's flab, but she was always able to hide it well. Such an opportunity opened up as Jessica performed warrior pose, but her thick coating of sweat entering her eyes had her leg a bit shorter than it should be, and her arms were a bit too low. Jennifer turned and spoke up. \"No, no, no..\" she bent over and gripped Jessica's tree-trunk thigh and cankle on her right leg. She couldn't help but give it a bit of a jiggle as she nudged it forward, and she did the same with the underarm fat of her arms. \"Thanks.\" spoke Jessica. \"No problem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffice work had more movement involved, and at the same time, Jessica was able to build more of a rapport, because more of her walking was to Lauren's office. As the month went on, she couldn't help but notice Lauren had been re-gaining weight, and moving less. The talk around the break room was that Lauren was finally starting to look like a Gordge girl again. In the break room, Jessica had gone back to stuffing herself with lettuce, with a donut here and there, but it was more than made up for by her constant walking and stretches with Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the month, Alice had absorbed close to every pound Jessica had lost. That food supply was lasting a bit longer than everyone had thought, but Alice seemed not to notice the nearly 40 extra pounds. Kaitlyn, too, at the office seemed to be hovering towards the 400 mark, her massive rear-end, thighs, and belly absorbing a great deal of the fat entering. She was turning into a real ball of blubber, an orb reminescent of Jessica when she'd joined corporate, save with a smaller stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the month, Jessica had the Head of PR. She'd entered the corporate section only to find a massive chocolate cake, pizza, and great deals of donuts. \"Surprise!\" shouted Kaitlyn and Alice. Jess grabbed her chest, the surprise was a shock. \"You guyys!\" she spoke. \"I appreciate the food, but don't scare me like that! You nearly gave me a heart attack!\" \"Sorry, girlie, we just thought we'd give you a good 'ole treat for your going away!\"  Jessica had some apprehensions, but her inherent fat girl spoke up; \"It's a treat. Treat yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jess did what she loved, she treated herself. The three munched on pizza, but Jess chomped on the chocolate cake. It was rich, sweet to the taste. \"Mmmm! This is better than sex.\" Kaitlyn bubbled as she swallowed some pizza. \"Thaanks! I made it.\" Jess spoke up. \"For real? Probably for the best that I don't live with you, I'd balloon up faster than I did when Jen was feeding me.\" Alice chuckled. \"So girlie, what do you think it's gonna be like up there?\" Jessica shrugged. \"I've heard they have a legit buffet up there. If that's true, I hope Lauren doesn't expect me to stay mobile.\" Kaitlyn cackled. Alice spoke up. \"Girl, sneak me up there one day. I gotta get at that if it's true.\" By the time the gorge was true, Kaitlyn's stomach was full to bursting, but Alice and Jessica needed some more to fill up. \"How do you guys have so much room?\" Alice and Jessica gave a response as both smacked their immense guts, making both stomachs quake.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica paced into the hallway of the top suits. These were the hallways of power, full of clout and the might of inter-company politics, and the weight of it was in the air. Towards the end of the hallway was Lauren Gordge, the ever-expanding CEO. She had been gaining hard in the month Jessica had been losing, and her once svelte figure was now thick with fat. \"Hey, Lauren!\" spoke Jessica, who extended her arms. Lauren accepted the hug and hugged back as far as she could reach around Jessica's nigh-endless stomach. Though she was back down to 650 pounds, that didn't mean Jessica was suddenly a twig. \"Jessi! Welcome to the big-time!\" Jessica looked about in awe. \"Over here, lemme show you your office.\" Lauren led the obese woman to her office. A bronze name-plate was at the doorway. \"Ooh, it's got my name on it n' everything!\" Lauren chuckled, \"I know, it's so cool, isn't it?\" She stepped into the room as Jessica's eyes scanned it, save for the fat, red-headed form of Lauren Gordge and her thick thighs and breasts, with a supple stomach to support them. It was a massive room compared to her old office. There were book-cases, an end-table with an expensive-looking coffee machine on it, besides a basket of creamer, and at the center, a great mahogany desk, shining in the fluorescent light. Jessica's jaw hung open, and Lauren chuckled. \"For real, it's a shock, isn't it?\" Jessica choked out something to the affirmative, but she was simply stunned. \"Ooh, lemme show you the best perk. Over here.\" Jessica followed the plump form of Lauren to what seemed to be a closet. The door opened, betraying its true thickness as it slowly swung open and lit up from within. Within, as Jessica stood in the wide doorframe, were shelves and shelves of snacks, food, drinks, with cubby-holes for miscellaneous items below. It dawned on Jessica; it was a walk-in refrigerator. A breathy \"Holy Shit\" parted from Jessica's lips. \"For real. These are the perks here. And you can enjoy them, too. That weight loss stuff was just to see if you were dedicated enough to the company, and your dedication is here.\" Jessica took a moment to process everything, then replied. \"Well, that's... That's good! Is there -any- limit, or...\" Lauren spoke up. \"Just try to be mobile.\" Jessica nodded. \"Understood.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour came to the luxurious break-room. There was a whole kitchen, a bar, and a table with several swine-like women sitting at it, chewing away at donuts. \"Ladies, meet the new head of PR!\" The group stood up. From left to right, there was a blonde with a hawk-like nose on an immensely fat face, with a second and nascent third chin, and jowls to match, her largest compartment being her breasts and belly, her legs being comparative twigs. \"Jess, meet Dana, HR department.\" The immensely fat woman nodded. Next were a pair of brunettes, but while one was a great pear, with fat hips wide enough to seem like challenges to even the wide doorframes of these upper echelons, the other was an all-around gainer, fat on every part of her body, with green eyes that shone from her fattened face that still seemed svelte compared to Dana. \"Anne and Mary, Purchasing and Finance.\" The two spoke up. \"Pleased to meet you.\" While pear-like Anne had a melodious voice, Mary's voice was low and gravelly.  The final woman was a strawberry blonde that was willow-thin by Gordge standards. \"And this is Shannon, Production and my VP. She doesn't play by our rules.\" Shannon chuckled and in her happy but slow voice spoke, \"No, not necessarily.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day seemed to end quickly, as the move took up most of Jessica's day. There wasn't much to do that day either way, but she was able to get some snacking with the board done. Shannon, true to character, snacked on a salad and towards the end of the day peeked into Jessica's office. \"Hey, Jess, I'm headed to the Gym after work. Wanna join in?\" Jess chuckled. \"Not today, but maybe sometime.\" Shannon giggled. \"That's more committment than the rest have given me!\" Jessica drove her way home, feeling powerful, arriving with Alice at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two entered the dining room to find several spreads of pizza. \"Oooh!\" cooed Alice. Jennifer was smiling at the end of the table. \"I thought I'd make some treats, to celebrate Jess' promotion!\" Jess chuckled. \"Thank you, Jen!\" She felt like saying \"It's not necessary,\" but it was moot. She felt like celebrating and pizza was just in today's lexicon. Jennifer gave her usual stare at Alice and Jessica as they stuffed themselves. It was especially pleasing, and there was something in Jessica's celebratory stuffing that told Jennifer that she was coming back to her hoggish ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was certainly way to test. Jennifer had made a double-chocolate cake with chocolate chips crowining it, and she was keeping it concealed for a time after supper. It certainly would have to wait today, because both Alice and Jessica were rubbing their stuffed stomachs and groaning. \"Ooooh...those months of dieting must have gotten me soft... I don't know how I ate it all..\" Alice mumbled something, but couldn't be heard over her panting. Both of them were wracked with the fat sweats, and Alice proceeded to pass out in her chair, resting her head on her double-chin, and Jessica stumbled to her room, gripping the walls for dear life. It was the kind of fullness that only came along once in a while for Jessica, even in this den of gluttony. She sat in her room and rubbed her stomach, when she heard a few taps at her door. She rolled herself right-side up and trudged to the door and opened it. It was a chocolate cake, an absurdly rich one. She picked it up without a second thought, and sat it on her bed. She figured that she wasn't concerned with losing weight anymore, her \"diet\" was over, and she could relax again. It was a slow process of picking at it, letting the food digest, then going back at it. When Jen peeked in next, Jessica had passed out on top of the plate where the cake formerly was, her face and chins covered in chocolate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica rubbed at her stomach as she made her way down the street in her large SUV. She'd come to terms with her ever-expanding waistline, and had upgraded to a larger car. And expand her waistline indeed did. In the 3 months from promotion to turkey-time in November, Jessica had ballooned up to 720. Her stomach was rubbing against the steering wheel even with the seat all the way back, as far as it could go. Eventually she saw the house she recognized as home, and pulled in. She groaned. She remembered her cousin would likely be here, and she was giving Jessica grief when she was 100 pounds smaller last year. She could only imagine the torment she would go through this year, even from her other relatives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted and groaned, but eventually managed to jiggle her way out of the car. She waddled towards the door, huffing as she hefted her lardy, fat legs towards the doorframe. The porch-boards creaked tenuously under her mass, but she rang the doorbell. Her mother's graying form answered the door. \"Jessieee!\" She answered and wrapped her arms around Jessica, or more accurately, her massive stomach. \"Hey, mom!\" Jessica huffed out as she hugged her mother's also enlarged form. \"Come iiin!\" Her mother spoke, but she couldn't hide her surprise at Jessica's massive gain. Jessica noticed, and she noticed similar looks on the face of every family member in the large living room. There were hushed whispers on the fringes, and Jessica knew the topic; her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the heavenly smell wafted in from the kitchen. Jessica wandered towards the table as her mother beckoned, giving two loud claps and bellowing, \"Alright, y'all! Come get your plates!\" Jessica was at the head of the line, she seemed to forget about the blatant ogling that occurred by every member. She even heard a male voice, a distant uncle of hers, she thought she could pick out, \"Damn, that girl was way smaller last year. What the hell happened?\" followed by a harsh \"Hush, Doug.\" Jessica had packed her plate, proceeding over every tray until she could fit no more, and waddled back. There was only a minor problem: her girth was too wide to pass alongside the throng of relatives. They waited for a moment as Jessica tried to squeeze past, with a few \"'Scuse me's\" and \"Pardons\" but the family members packed to the walls. Jessica was a sight to behold in her shirt of indeterminate size that was still tight as a balloon, with a bit of stomach still sticking out at the bottom. Her sheer mass defied understanding and space, and her sheer girth became apparent as she dominated the entrance to the dining room. Her nephew Lynne was pressed directly against the other side of the doorframe by her sheer width, which was in fact wider than most furniture in the house, even the old grand armoire that Mama Donna swore was from their great ancestor so-and-so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jessica had made it to her seat. She pulled it out and pulled in, but her stomach spilled over onto the table, just short of her plate, and into the laps of those beside her. They scooched left and right, making Jessica stand out. And by Jessica's sheer bad luck, she was seated directly across from Cousin Melinda. \"Before y'all dig in,\" interrupted Mama Donna's voice, \"we need to say grace, who's got it?\" A young buck of a man, some distant cousin with brown hair spoke up. \"I got it.\" The table clasped their hands, and some bowed their heads. Jessica clasped her hands out of respect but the office life hadn't kept her in touch with the christian faith of her mother. Her eyes were open, and they looked down at first, at the table. Her stomach roared in eagerness as the brown-haired man spoke about \"blessing the food to their bodies and their bodies to thy service.\" Almost perfectly timed, Jessica looked up, and met the baleful amber-eyed gaze of Melinda, with the furor of olden days before last thanksgiving. The message was exact and unmistakable. 'You got fat,' and it came about just as the 'Amen' washed over the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica dug into her food, a bit unnerved and slowed by the death-stare of Melinda. It didn't take Melinda long until a lull in conversation over Politics to speak up. \"Dang, Jess, you been practicing?\" Lynne spoke up. \"Yeah, I didn't want to say anything, but I nearly didn't recognize you. You really ought to watch what you eat.\" Jessica chuckled. \"It's hard, with all the food at the office. They try to fatten me up, I swear,\" she spoke before digging into a heap of peas and mashed potatoes. \"I don't think it's just from work, darling.\" spoke Melinda. \"You were doing real good. What happened that made you quit?\" Jessica shrugged. Melinda pressed, \"Well, I agree with Lynne. You ought to get back on that diet, get back in touch with that Dietician. I got half a mind to move up there with you and kick you into shape, try the South Beach diet. It's really good. Helped me drop last year's winter weight.\" Jessica was about to politely refuse, when her Aunt Mary spoke up next to her, a thin, brown-haired woman. \"Yeah, darling. Plus all that extra weight is really bad for your heart, you know. It'll kill ya, darling. You should listen to Linda.\" Jessica mumbled a half-hearted \"I'll think about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feast carried on for a bit, and she had gone back for her usual fourths, then fifths. It was the sixth plate that reignited the conversation about dieting. \"Hon, do you need all that food?\" spoke up Mary. Jessica grunted in response and dug in. Jessica felt a sharp jab in her hefty side, causing a jiggle to ripple through her stomach. \"Honey, I wasn't kidding about what I said earlier. You need to stop eating all that, it's killing you. Hand your plate to Ally.\" Jessica shook her head. \"I got my sixth plate, I'm eating it.\" Melinda chuckled. \"Yeah, but it's totally just the workplace, right, Jess?\" Jess groaned. \"Please, Linda, stop talking about it.\" Jessica was sweating not only from the exertion of eating, but also from the heat of the argument. \"I know I'm fat, I don't need you reminding me.\" Melinda spoke up promptly. \"Well obviously you don't! You eat like you're starving to death, but it's just the opposite, you're eating yourself to death, honey. You gotta drop that weight, darling.\" Jessica shot a look of fire. \"Shut UP!\" Mamma Donna spoke up. \"Now, that's enough! Quit that yelling, both of you! We're at the table!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica groaned. This was the reason why she dreaded going home for thanksgiving. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dana the Waitress was sweating from exertion, wiping her brow and scarfing down some leftover pizza from a table who had walked out at lunch. She couldn't understand what kind of human beings would walk out on a perfectly good pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was times like these when Dana wished that whale from last year would come back, the absolutely massive woman who had to be at least five hundred pounds.  It was a rare kind of rush that Dana felt once in a while, because very often she'd see that type come in once at a peak weight, ordering all the right things, then come back ordering salads, and health foods, drinking water instead of soda, cutting down on that beautiful stomach. It was enough to make a heifer hunter like Dana cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the clock had hit six, it was a bit faster but still fairly slow. It was a Wednesday, and pretty slow even for the dinner rush. Dana hardly had to move her lofty rear-end as customers came in and left. But towards ten-past, the door opened and the huffing of Gordge employees came in. These fatsos were usually the haunts of the buffets, but the floor actually shook as the brunette Jessica came in, leaning on the pack of obese women, nearly forming a human blob of sweat and blubber. Dana's nipples hardened. <i>Holy SHIT, is that the one?</i> she thought. She saw the eyes through fattened jowls, so immense and fat and slick with sweat from the mere act of slow waddling, but by her eyes and the set of her fat face, it truly was the one she had remembered with a pack of other horridly obese women. The others would make a dietician faint, but Jessica's absolutely stunning stomach would make a fitness instructor keel over. It dumbstruck Dana as she was on desk duty, her jaw literally came open for a moment. It was perfect, so massive and spherical. It was so large it was covering Jessica's knees, and her waddle was so slow a snail would seem like a sprinter, the rest of the pack except the one anomaly, the slim and trim caboose, weren't much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jessica attempted to speak. \"Hey...W'veg't....\" She took a moment to pant. She seemed like she was about to pass out. Dana let the blob huff. It was so arousing that it was absurd. Jessica swatted a bead of sweat that began to fall from her hair, and wiped her forehead. \"Uh..Six..\" Dana nodded, and spoke up. \"A'right, follow me please!\" She grabbed six menus and walked over to an area between the booths and tables. She knew especially the brunette wouldn't be able to get in, but she wanted to see if she would go for it. \"Table or booth?\" Jessica spoke up. \"Definitely a table.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pang of dissapointment. Dana wanted to see the orb of fat try to squeeze in, but she laid the menus on a six-seater table. \"Here you go! Your waiter will be right with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana spent the slow evening staring at the table. It was like seeing a ballet of constant food. Appetizers of fried cheese sticks and clams by the tray-fulls, what could generously be called salads were it not for the masses of bacon, ranch, and cheese on top of what was hopefully lettuce, and entire pitchers of soda, as mere starters. It was the sexiest thing Dana had seen in her life. The strawberry blonde was the least fun out of the bunch: her salad was genuine enough and she only got a water, but the rest of the herd ate and ate. Great globs of ranch rolling down their vast double-chins, melted cheese lining their lips, the constantly expanding jowls that stretched ever more to recieve massive mouthfuls of food. This was only the appetizer, but this was enough to feed an apartment block. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis paled in comparison to the main course. Double-servings of the infamously massive bowls of carbonara, chicken parmesan, dishes of lasagna as \"sides,\" and the most sinfully creamy bowls of alfredo pasta that had ever been made. Jessica's clothing was more like a hospital gown nowadays, due to her sheer size, but around her stomach it was eternally stretched thin. There may have been double-digits, dana surmised there had to be, in front of that XL, and it was still absolutely mind-bogglingly tight. It, like the clothing of the others, soon began stretching with the vast stomachs and spare tires of the gang. Jessica's massively fat face, beaded with sweat from the exertion of moving her arms to eat, jjiggled as she talked and joked with her corporate friends. It was a good night out for her, but better for Dana. Jessica's face became dotted by the cream of the pasta, the red sauce of the lasagna. Shannon perked up. \"Jess, you've got sauce on your face. Jessica raised her napkin to her face, dotting off sauce and sweat. \"Thanks, Shannon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening eventually came to a close. As the hoggish six dined on coffee and dessert, one of the waitresses came up to Dana and whispered. \"Will these fat bitches leave? It's nearly nine, we should be closing soon.\" Dana smiled. \"Aw, come on, Amanda, you know how I feel about babes like this.\" The woman shook her head and walked out. \"I'm going for my fucking smoke break.\" Dana chuckled. \"Go and have your ciggy. I'm having enough fun right here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pack began waddling out talking and laughing as the clock ticked on past nine. Dana walked up to Jessica as she was taking a second longer than the pack. \"Hey, uh, didn't you come in her a while back?\" Jessica took a second to breathe from the exertion of pulling on her coat. \"Huh? Oh, yeah... I did. I think I remember you...Dana, isn't it?\" She nodded. \"And you're...Jessica, right?\" Jessica nodded. \"Uh-huh.\" Dana spoke. \"Well, uh, I-I don't know if you swing this way, but I think you're just stunning, and I'd love to take you out to eat sometime.\" </span></div></div>",

Her vast-bellied form waddled beside the short but thick form of Dana the Waitress. They had met at the restaurant, and it was a strange feeling. Jessica didn't feel like there was anything here except a curiosity. She hadn't really messed around with women, but things were going downhill in regards to her prospects with men. The only looks she got were shocked and puzzled stares. She felt as though she should take what she could get. Her mind was racing so rapidly. What did any of this mean? Was this a relationship? Was this just the testing of the waters? Her mind raced so fast she barely noticed she was so horridly out of breath and sweaty that she nearly stumbled. Dana's firm hold on her arm kept her grounded. She came to in earnest, doubled over and panting hard. \"Damn, babe, I'll give you a second. Sorry, you okay?\" Jessica spoke breathily through pants. \"M'good...jus'....tired.\" The sight was absolutely perfect to Dana. This absolute whale who was such a fat ass that her stomach blocked her legs' full range of motions was doubled over panting from a simple walk, with every roll on her side on perfect display through the skin-tight top that would be a tent on anyone smaller, and the collar of it was already soaked in sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jessica it was not attractive. Her heart was pounding from the taxing walk across the parking lot with her stomach blocking her legs from moving properly plus the fact that she looked like an unfit whale to her date, the only one she'd had in a few years. She felt like an idiot. \"Sorry, sorry, sorry..\" she spoke as she brought herself upright and wiped the sweat. Dana chuckled and patted her lardy back, \"It's okay! It's okay! Don't worry about it!\" Dana let her hand rest on Jessica's back fat. It was sweaty under the cloth, and for that moment, Dana wished Jessica were topless, so that she could properly fondle the roll. However, they were in public, and Dana wasn't that much of a perv that she'd pull a stunt like that in public. The two proceeded into the buffet, and she was greeted by a thin asian-looking woman. The woman seemed quite obviously shocked by Jessica's massive stomach and horrifyingly fat body. \"Helloo! Two?\" the woman said in a thick accent. Her eyes jerked away, trying to lock on to Dana. \"Yep!\" spoke Dana. \"Greaaaat. Follow me please.\" the woman replied, and she showed them to a table. Dana couldn't help but be pleased. She didn't even ask, she knew. The smirk was present on her face, and she pulled out Jessica's chair for her. \"Thanks, hon.\" mumbled Jessica as she took Dana's arm and sat down with the support Dana provided. Dana sat down opposite her. The hostess spoke. \"Your waitress will be right with you.\" She walked away and into a small nave with drink machines and utensil holders. Dana could faintly hear some foreign language being spoken. Chinese, Korean, Japanese, these distinctions weren't there for her. She was no linguist, but she could tell that the two were talking about something absurd, something shocking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe connected the dots, but she didn't care their opinion on her favored little pig. She was just interested in seeing how much this fat babe could eat. She turned around and grinned. \"You want me to get your plate for you?\" Jessica smiled. \"Sure thing. You want a coke, right?\" Dana nodded. \"If you please.\" Dana walked off and filled Jessica's plate to bursting. She figured by Jessica's sheer size that she could handle the sheer amount of food on this plate. By the time she had gotten back with four plates, two plates for Jessica and two for herself, balancing two plates per hand, the drinks had arrived. Jessica was stunned. \"How are you doing that?\" Dana chuckled. \"You learn a lot of stuff as a waitress. How to put up with bullshit, how to hold boiling-hot plates, and how to balance four of them on two hands. I did this with double the number of plates once, ya know!\" Jessica chuckled. \"And apparently you learn how to fill every part of a plate. I thought I was good at stacking buffet plates. You sure you aren't secretly two-hundred pounds heavier?\" Both of them giggled. Dana spoke up as she watched Jessica stuff her face, smearing peanut oil and teriyaki sauce on her immensely fat face. \"If I eat like you, I just might be, babe.\" Jessica looked over at Dana. She usually recieved these comments in derision. She decided, though, that Dana wasn't here to get her into Weight Watchers, judging by the fact that she'd packed her plate with so many calorie-laden treats, carbs, and fried meats that it was clear of her intentions. Jessica decided to play along a bit, and winked at Dana. Dana giggled semi-flirtingly. Jessica felt comfortable. Maybe this was going to be a good evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly a fulfilling evening. Jessica'd eaten beyond Dana's expectations. Dana had expected Jessica to make it five plates before quitting. However, Jessica made it seven, seven plates of General Tso's, Lo Mein and more than a few Chinese Donuts hidden inside. Her top had rolled up to reveal an absolutely full to bursting gut. The staff were openly staring and quipping to one another. It was absurd to all inside, there were even a few phones that came out. Jessica's forehead was absolutely swamped with sweat from the exhaustion and her taut, massive stomach stood as tall as a balloon, the top barely covering her breasts. Dana finally paid the bill while speaking to her. \"Damn, hon! I thought I was full. You good?\" Jessica mumbled \"No, no..Need...help...\" Dana got up and tried to pull Jessica up by her flabby arms. No dice, even with Jessica shoving upwards onto the table. Jessica couldn't move by the virtue of how much she had eaten. The staff rarely had to resort to this measure, but they wheeled out a mechanized wheelchair, and a team of waiters and waitresses hauled the horridly obese woman into the chair, and tucked her endless rolling gut under the steering wheel. Jessica was in such a daze by the sheer volume of food processing in her gut she could barely steer. Dana had to steer the cart for her. By the time Dana had gotten Jessica to her car and loaded her in with the grunts of the staff, with more than one muffled groans. One said out loud, \"Why does she have to be so big?\"  Jessica's seat-belt couldn't buckle normally, and even with the seatbelt extender, the belt could barely fit around Jessica's mammoth gut, which heaved and fell as Jessica's eyes were nearly rolling back into her head, and her top was getting soaked with sweat. The staff waved goodbye as Dana drove away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had gotten down the road. Jessica had finally recovered her breath, until finally she said. \"Would you mind...taking me back to...your house?\" Dana smirked. \"Sure thing!\" The two arrived at Dana's place. It was a small, one-story place, in a cheaper neighborhood, but it seemed like it would do. Dana unbuckled Jessica's seatbelt and opened her door for her, giving her an arm to let her out. \"Thanks, babe..\" Dana gave the blimp a crutch to move on, hearing every shaky, heavy breath Jessica uttered with every step. It seemed painfully slow, but for Dana it was sexual in every second. The fat, bloated babe was struggling with the basic task of walking, and the only thing that could be more attractive was what followed after Dana helped Jessica across the threshold of the porch and her door. Jessica was drenched in sweat and giving off quiet \"Ow's\" and \"So fulll...\" Dana brought Jessica to her bedroom and helped her on. Jessica took her time, and the bed, used to the lighter weight of Dana, screeched in protest and pain as the ball of lard was laid on it. Dana pulled to a seat next to Jess on the bed, in the little room left. Jessica regained her breath and pulled off her top. \"Is this... good for you?\" Dana chuckled. \"Sure!\" This was oddly forward, but Dana was fine with this. \"I'll get your pants. Dana worked on pulling down Jessica's straining sweatpants, especially past her thighs. Dana got close and personal, giving the immense flab on Jessica's thighs a jiggle and a few strokes. Jessica's legs began quivering and the sweatpants finally came down Jessica's thick, immense legs, then her massive underpants, revealing her wet vulva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Dana could try to get to work Jessica tried to roll up to kiss Dana. Dana gave a chuckle and watched. The blimp tried to struggle upwards to no avail, as Dana began the process of fingering her. Jessica's mouth opened wide in ecstasy. It was bliss, bliss Jessica had experienced few other times. Dana shoved her tongue down Jessica's mouth as she maneuvered about to be able to finger Jess and kiss her at the same time. Jessica reciprocated and kissed back. Jess couldn't remember when, but Dana had also disrobed, and her breasts were perky and large, her thighs thick and her rear-end luscious. Jessica couldn't help but to grab, Dana used her other arm to pleasure Jessica's nipples on her round, blubbery right breast. Soon, Dana changed position. Jessica began licking her, as Dana returned the favor, using her fingers to jiggle Jessica's thighs, then grip and fondle her juicy, jiggly back fat. Soon, though, the vibrant licking ceased and Jessica ceased moving. Dana looked back in terror and spoke up. \"Jess? Jess!?\" She listened to Jessica's heart. It was fine, but belaboured, and she was breathing. Jessica had simply passed out. It made sense when Dana had checked how sweaty and tired the unconscious Jessica's face appeared, sitting high on a pillow. Dana pulled over and slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Jessica and Dana had a pleasant breakfast. \"Thanks for last night,\" spoke Jessica. \"I'll be sure to come back again sometime.\" Dana smiled. \"Oh, be sure you do. And not just because you're great with that tongue!\" Jessica gave a chuckle, and spoke. \"I will, and not just because you feed me a lot.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica munched on a snack cake as she tip-typed her way through work. Her cut in mobility as of recently had allowed her to focus on work, and it had showed. She was active in responding to and sending e-mails, at least, and this was noticed by the upper echelons. Shannon leaned in at one particular conversation over break, speaking up. \"Jess might be bigger than all of us, but that girl can certainly work. Did you know she's already secured Lauren three new commitments as contractors?\" Dana and Mary cooed. \"Really?\" Spoke Mary. \"That's astounding, we oughta treat her!\" Shannon rolled her eyes. Like Jessica needed any treats. \"Nah, though Lauren's certainly keeping her eyes open.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holidays had brought the gift of poundage. Dana's belly had expanded even further, and her middle button had popped off a day back, and at this point, she'd ignored it and hoped the shirt would hold a bit longer. Mary's thighs and stomach had taken the brunt of the holiday pounds and she had rubbed at her tightening blouse. \"I do wish she'd come and hang with us at breaks. That's the only downside to her working so damn hard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was, of course, enmeshed in work. Memos, e-mails, following up, and of course, working on her snack cake and coffee supply. She had obtained a bit more of a sweet tooth as of recently, and her family-sized bags of chips had atrophied from unuse. Of course, this doesn't mean Jessica was watching her weight-though her concerns had grown as her mobility had shrunk. As she prepared to heed nature's call, she reached for her perscribed cane- doctor's orders for her lack of mobility- with diet and exercise. She pushed up, and the cane obliged, helping her up with the additional aid of the table. She waddled down the hall, thunking. Her eyes looked at her stomach as she huffed and puffed and strained at the effort of moving. <i>Damn, this is just a walk down the hall. This is ridiculous.</i> she thought. Maybe some time with Shannon would do her some good. Of course, she wasn't going to go whole-hog weight loss.. maybe just a few sessions of yoga a week or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind turned to Dana, the waitress. She'd called her last night and talked a bit. The waitress was shaping out to be very amiable, and companion-like. She was growing fond of her, and felt a longing for another night like Tuesday. The weekend was coming up, she might spend a bit of time with Dana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, things were proceeding as usual. Alice had hit a plateau at 500, as she was far too active to become a blob like Jess. But she was still a large woman, with a massive stomach, larger than Jessica's in former days. Jennifer was truly feeling the effects of her own poison, though- she had reached nearly 250 pounds,the once svelte dietician now a fat woman like her old clients. Her spare tire was especially conspicuous, below her thickening stomach, and her thighs and breasts were fattening as well at a secondary but still admirable weight. Jessica's weight was climbing slower these days, approaching the mere 730's, compared to her metoric gains of earlier. </span></div></div>",

Dana spoke up. \"I know, but it's so hard because he treats me so nice otherwise. Besides, it's just a stupid little comment.\" Mary spoke up. \"He told you to order a salad! That's basically calling you fat!\" Dana shrugged, as a thunderous sound emerged from the room beside. It was the sound of the slow-shuffling of thunderous feet. It was the sound of Jessica performing a rare and arduous task: moving. The group raised their brows as Jessica walked in. \"Hey, girls!\" she spoke, followed by a gasp for breath as she grabbed a mug and filled it with coffee. \"Jessica!\" spoke Shannon. \"What're you doing in here?\" Jessica turned to her. \"Thought I'd shuffle on in here just to talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica filled her mug with coffee. Though her weight was starting to plateau, she was still massive. She was wider from side to side than the refrigerator she was grabbing creamer from, and her great gut made it so she had to stand nearly two feet back from the door as she opened it, and her shirt was still very, very tight, skin-tight. It was one of her very last wearable shirts before she broke into what were more or less hospital gowns. Jessica's two-foot standing range had to grow to three when sitting as she pulled up with her mug of coffee, sipping at it. \"I had to get away from the computer for a second, these idiots at Dynamo are making me want to tear my hair out.\"  Shannon hummed in agreement, \"I feel you. They're ridiculous, it's like they don't understand corporate etiquette, let alone basic manners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat for a while, jawing away until Jessica rubbed at her stomach. \"Hey, Shannon, mind if I join you at the gym today?\" Shannon lit up. \"Sure!\" Dana chuckled. \"Damn, are you even the real Jessica anymore?\" Jessica chuckled. \"No, I'm a Russian spy.\" The group joined her in a good giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica entered the Gym with Shannon's willow-thin form. She felt like everyone was watching her, and she noticed a few eyes dip from the machines. A muscular man on the treadmill glanced before focusing on his run afterwards, a girl who was about Jennifer's size gazed from the ellipticals for a moment before focusing back on her machine. \"So, like, what are we gonna do?\" Shannon looked about. \"Not trying to be a bitch, but I think you're too big for the machines. We could do some stretches, though!\" Jessica spoke up. \"Sure thing, hated those damn machines anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was dressed in one of her only remaining workout outfits, and it was chokingly tight. Every breath was apparent through the 5XL top that looked like it would rip any second from the strain.  Her five back-fat rolls jiggled with each step and her arms, which were like butterball turkeys at the bicep shook with each movement as Jessica followed Shannon to an aerobics section. A contraption was before her next to a great open space of mats, with various kettlebells and step-boxes around. The contraption consisted of several long nylon ropes draping down from a frame with attached chin-up bars, and on either end were punching bags and great, thick lengths of rope. Shannon led Jessica to the punching bags. \"This is always fun.\" Shannon took up position next to Jessica. \"You know how to punch, right?\" Jessica grinned. \"Girl, I went through High School. Fat bitches like me gotta learn how to fight. Hell yes, I do!\" Shannon nodded, and the two got to punching. Jessica found her old reliable hook, jab-jab easy at first, but this was far more belabored than the hard-fought task of walking. The extreme amounts of fat on her arms slowed her punches, and while Shannon kept up a quick patter of jabs and a few hard hooks, Jessica quickly slowed. Sweat flooded her sight, after barely a few seconds of punching. After barely a minute, her punching had devolved into soft pats of the bag with her knuckles. \"Ohmgod...\" muttered Jess. She hung onto the bag, panting and covered in sweat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You good girl?\" asked Shannon. \"Nobreath...\" mumbled Jessica. \"Cantbreathe..\" she mumbled. \"Sit down, girl, have a seat.\" spoke Shannon. It was barely a minute, but Shannon remembered Jessica was quite the big girl, by this time, THE biggest in the office. She couldn't help but marvel how absolutely blubbery Jessica was everywhere as she pulled herself to a seat on a creaking bench meant for someone far smaller than her. Her collar was the epicenter of her sweat, blossoming out from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week went on, Jessica got better. From a few seconds of punching to a minute, to a few. She found herself more mobile, and more nimble. This was more clear as Jessica spent a night with Dana. They were in their usual pattern of a passionate bout of oral- Dana the Waiter's delicate tongue entering Jessica's plump pussy, as Jessica returned the favor from below. Dana felt Jessica's hands caressing her thick, perk tits. Jessica withdrew her mouth. As the bout ended, Dana spoke up as she rubbed and cuddled Jessica's blubbery form. \"You're less sweaty than usual, babe. You been working out on me or something?\" Jessica chuckled. \"Just so I can be able to move without having a heart attack.\" Dana rubbed Jessica's belly and groaned. \"I don't want it to shriiink...\" Jessica rubbed her hand. \"It won't shrink much. Don't worry. I'll still be your piggy, I just need to be able to walk.\" </span></div></div>",

Jennifer shook her head. \"Look, you're just trying to give into these for a promotion. You can get it still, just keep trying to work hard!\" Jessica groaned and crossed her arms. Jennifer walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica breathily trudged to her room. She sweated intensely from the short walk to her room, and it only helped alarm her more. <i>God, how fat am I? </i> She determined to know. She went to the Bathroom, and pulled out the electric scale that spoke aloud. She stopped being able to see past her gut a long time ago. She stood on it, and it announced electronically: \"Six-Hundred-And-Eighty-Nine-Pounds.\" Jessica gasped and stepped back, grasping at her chest. It was so sheerly devastating. 689? She was going to be 700 soon, she was officially fatter than Emily had gotten. She ran out in a panic to her room and crawled onto her bed and began to sob. She was hopeless now. She was sure she'd never be able to shed that 100 pounds for the Head PR position. She was screwed, because Jennifer was going to feed her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft knock at her door. She opened it and there was a box of Donuts on the floor outside. She took it out of instinct. If she was screwed, she was screwed, and her old friend food was there for her once again. She still hadn't put anything on and she lay on her bed, rabidly eating donuts, her mammoth gut jiggled and shook as she ate like a starving woman. Her stomach quaked and jiggled fiercely as she munched on an extra-large 2 dozen box. She held two donuts per hand and destroyed the box in a matter of twenty minutes. Her mammoth gut didn't care that she had just eaten a feast fit for a queen. A deep sadness was on her, and she was burying it in food. After the box was open, she opened her nightstand. Both her and Alice had snacks stored away in her nightstand and she made full use of this supply, ripping open bags of snack cakes and shoving them in her mouth. Her stomach quaked as she disregarded the contours of her obese body and shoved sheer volumes of fattening snack foods into her mouth. Her two chins and her immensely fat jowls jiggled and inflated as she inhaled the fattening food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, she came to the table with Alice. It seemed as though Jennifer was on hyper mode. There wasn't an inch of clear space on the table, only food. Alice spoke up. \"Damn, girl, you trying to fatten us up or something?\" Jennifer shrugged, while Jessica wordlessly began rabidly shoving food down her throat. Alice raised a brow and then dove in with her. Jennifer felt a wave of lust pass through her. Jessica and Alice seemed to be inflating before her eyes, and it was absolutely sexual to her. It was no longer an aesthetic. It was attraction. She ate her food mindlessly as she watched the two rip through the table full of food. Of course, she didn't notice that her intake of food was increasing steadily itself. Her stomach was now leaving its perch above the waistband of her pants, and sitting down, the button on her pants struggled to stay on, and she was sprouting a growing paunch which exposed her belly button, and rode just above her waistband. </span></div></div>",

In the month since Jessica's capitulation to Jennifer's urge to feed, both her and Alice had ballooned in size. Jessica was unable to wear any clothes that fit at her size, her clothes were obviously meant for someone 50 pounds thinner, and burst at the seams with Jessica's rolls, she seemed fatter in her clothes than out of them. Her stomach was stuffed constantly, always taut in its massive, inflated state. Her entire abdomen was absurdly inflated, with four thick rolls of fat crossing her back, skin-tight in her absurdly ill fitting clothes. Her stomach itself was too massive to fit in her shirt and it was not uncommon to see her massive, pale, flabby stomach hanging out of her shirt, and her pants had to stay at her hips, giving her blob like abdomen freedom to jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was hit harder. The doubled feeding had bloated her stomach to astronomical size, it was a thick slab of fat with a vast apron of fat about it, and her breasts taking up a great deal of space in her cramped shirt. Both her and Jessica barely moved nowadays, but Jessica was transforming into a literal eating machine. While Alice was not yet so preoccupied with food that her work was affected, Jessica was spending every waking moment now stuffing herself. Her emails slowed to a crawl, tasks done in a day now took weeks and soon her day was overwhelmed with nothing but eating and napping.  She did not move now except for the end and beginnings of days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren began to notice the lack of productivity and laziness of Jessica. It was jarring for her as Jessica's superior to see a hard worker turn into a lazy hog. She debated on simply firing Jessica, or simply reducing her down to menial office grade. The initiative to fatten Lauren by the suits was bearing fruit, and her suit became tighter. </span></div></div>",

She figured she ought to let go for a while, but this was a conversation of lower echelons in her mind. Higher up was a brewing decision about Jessica. If she fired Jessica, she likely wouldn't improve, only get fatter and lazier. This rapid of a turnaround was too much to simply reverse overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There's no reforming her,</i> thought Lauren. <i>I gave her time to do that already. It's time for Jess to go. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was spending her usual lazy afternoon in her office, consuming a box of donuts. Jelly was especially her favorite, but it was messy, and it often got on her chins. The fat, lazy whale of a woman was caught in this practice by the chubbier form of Lauren Gordge. \"Hey, uh, Jess.\" Jessica turned to her in slight embarassment. She was in her natural state, and her stomach was hanging out above her lap for the world to see. \"Oh, Hey, Lauren!\" she spoke. Lauren walked towards the desk. \"Look, girl, I really hate to do this. But your productivity has....\" Lauren realized that Jessica was munching on a jelly donut while she was speaking. She gave a sigh. \"...Decreased, noticeably.\" In the back of her mind, she ruminated. <i>You know, maybe I ought not let myself go THAT far.</i> Jessica frowned. \"I don't know what you mean! I got that communique out yesterday!\" Lauren cut in briskly. \"After I assigned it to you a week ago. You haven't been communicating, you take days to reply.\" Lauren shrugged. \"And the cause is obvious.\"  Jessica sighed. Lauren sadly put a small pink envelope on Jessica's desk. \"Sorry, girlie.\" Jessica stuttered to no particular word. She was shocked. She had been doing so well! \"B-b-b-b-but... No, please! I'll do better, I swear!\" Lauren shook her head. \"I gave you plenty of time but you're obviously not getting any better. Best of luck to you, don't show up tomorrow. Sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren briskly walked away. Jessica took the pink envelope, and struggled to stand. Sweat emerged from her brow as she struggled to tuck her fat folds past the arms of the chair. She was also panting from the stress. Fired? It had been so long since Jess didn't have a job. She had no clue what was next. She eventually pried her fat from the arms of the chair, but she was out of breath from the endeavor, with her great, rolling gut flowing onto the arms of the chair. She committed to getting up and stood up with a great heave of her mass and stood, even sweatier than when she'd begun. She grabbed her donuts, her salty snacks, her absolute vast troves of food. She was taking it all home and going to stuff herself with it. What the hell was there to do now? What was there? She hyperventilated harder, her vision became blurred as tears streamed down her face. She stumbled out into the hall with her vast trove of things. She stumbled to the elevator and when the door shut, she sobbed the entire way to the parking lot, to her car, and then back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first Jennifer knew somethign was wrong was when the door burst open with Jessica carrying a great deal of snacks and a few small cardboard boxes which she haphazardly hurled onto the couch as she dropped and began stuffing her face and drowning her tears in food. \"Baby, what's wrong?\" Jessica mumbled through a full mouth, but Jen couldn't tell what she was saying. \"Speak clearer, babe, you're not making sense. Jessica swallowed, her fat jowls shrinking slightly. \"I got fired...\" She took three panting huffs and continued, \"'Cause I'm a fat piece of shit...\" She dove back into her food. Jennifer patted her on the back. \"It's okay, baby...You'll find another job... You're not a fat piece of shit...\" Jess was inconsolable, though. The best Jen could do for her was add fuel to the fire and shove more food into the pile. By the time Alice came home with a big bag of fast food, Jessica was still munching. Jennifer had funnelled a great deal of snacks onto the pile, and Jessica was covered in the infamous \"fat sweats\" from the exertion of consuming the ever-growing pile of food. \"Babe, I heard what happened at work. I'm so sorry. I'm going to try to help you out.\" Jennifer patted Alice on her flabby arm. Alice simply left the food and went to get something to snack on, she hardly took the time to breathe, she hardly took the time to wipe sweat from her forehead as it gathered and dripped down her collar. Her already overtaxed clothes ripped apart but Jess didn't care. She just kept eating. She felt a tiredness at the back of her mind, but she didn't care. All she cared about was drowning her woes in food. If she never felt worse and simply exploded she wouldn't care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer and Alice were eating dinner at the table when they heard a soft 'thud' from the other room. They ran in and checked on Alice. She was clammy and sweating like she'd just ran a marathon. The food pile was only down to a small mat of food on the coffee table, but there was still some left. She was out, cold, but awoke in a few moments. \"Jess, you okay? Girl?\" Jessica mumbled something to the affirmative and reached for some more food but groaned in pain as she cradled her massive gut. \"Too full.. Too full.. It hurts...\" \"Okay, girl, okay, we'll take it away..\" Jessica smacked Jennifer's hand with force, leaving a red mark. \"NO!\" she screamed in a scream of desparation that shook the room. Jennifer withdrew the offending hand and wove it in pain. They left her sitting on the sweat-stained couch, gasping for breath from the exertion and the fullness. The stomach was hot and taut to the touch, which looked nearly impossible for its size, but it was true. Jessica stared into the ceiling as she struggled to breathe from her sheer mass and the absolute exertion she had made. The shortness of breath and the sheer fullness of her stomach kept her from sleeping that night, and she was short of breath the entirity of the next day.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't find a job anywhere, and she was certain it was due to her weight but she was in no position to resist the feeding charms of Jennifer, nor her stable income and the nice house they lived in. Alice eventually stabilized at around 600, learning an example from Jessica. The days became a long, indistinct blur of eating. Eventually, Jessica became unable to move, slowly outgrowing mobility by her sheer mass. The rest of Jessica's life was spent in one long, endless feast in her industrial bed, and to be a tale that was regaled about the upper echelons of Gordge for some time, that there was indeed a limit to how lazy and fat one could get at the office, and it existed in Jessica. There would occasionally be one or two of the upper echelons who ended up suffering the same fate, but never one so egregiously lazy and fat as Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this phase, Jessica's  actual weight became a purely academic endeavor, unable to be weighed due to the simple fact that she couldn't stand up. Her stomach was one giant, endless mass that blocked her vision, and as time went on, crushed downwards onto her lungs. Breath was a war fought every second against the endless rolling fat that Jessica had accrued through associating with Jen, and partaking in the ceaseless gorging with her and Alice, a war that would eventually require the assistance of oxygen tanks. Her crippling addiction to ever-increasing amounts of food had brought on this vegetative state of life where time was intangible, a concept that escaped her when every second was occupied with sleeping or eating. This would be the rest of Jessica's life, an existence dedicated solely to gluttony.</span></div></div>",

Most folks with a sedentary job would start thinking of cutting back in the early stages of weight gain when they may be only a little pudgy after a tight squeeze with the uniforms pinching a small muffin top or padded out bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for Jess, being a 460 pound fatty would prove that trying to whip her obese frame into any semblance of normality would be a task easier said then done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day of her diet was almost over before it started, with the brunette instinctively reaching for a jumbo box of double glazed doughnuts located on the kitchen counter of her home so early that she hadn't even gotten dressed yet, only being clad in a hilariously undersized pair of pink bra and panties. Cutting deeply into her meaty breast and hip blubber like a fillet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as her drowsiness tapered off, she realized that doughnuts would mean an early end to her healthier plan. She glumly put the box in the trash can before glancing to the wall clock hung on the left side. It displaying 07:35.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! I'm gonna be late!\" She mentally noted as she waddled to her bedroom. A healthy breakfast would have to wait until she got to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a last push to the front door, Jessica had made it with two minutes to spare. In her haste she realized that the pair of pants she grabbed may of been an older pair as it dug <i>wayyy</i> too deeply in between her tire-thick belly rolls, causing great discomfort. The only feeling that Jess found even more painful was the rumbling titan of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her delaying her diet for six weeks, Jessica never had a proper grace period to ease herself into it. A problem quickly discovered was found as the bulging office worker was depriving her gullet of the fatty foods it had grown accustomed to having shovelled in it at an almost constant rate had come back to bite her big. She had to find a source of food that could shut her tummy up while not exceding her daily calorie intake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Jessica had known at Gorge about the food available was it's pension to establish a vending machine in pretty much every department. Only problem being all of them only having candy bars that resembled computer keyboards, potato chip bags rivalling school bags in size and enough soda to fill a family pool to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica began to really regret not eating anything before. Even a completely plain doughnut was a nutritious feast compared to the calorie bombs offered in work. But she had to hold out, all Jess could do to resist temptation to trundle her way to the machine in the back and going to town on all the chocolates she could buy was work away at her desk, ignoring the ever present creaking of her chair and not think about food at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the morning, Jess was ravenous mess who glugged bottles of water.(One of the few \"Healthy\" options from the vending machines.) in an attempted to calm the storm of her stomach's demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it was 11:55, almost lunch break. Jessica could stop by the nearby corner store and pick up something she could eat that wouldn't destroy her diet in an instant. Even she was surprised by her willpower to make it thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, that would be challenged when Jessica, who was hefting herself out of her woefully under-sized chair, the armrests lodged onto her blankets of thigh flab, was interrupted by... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jessica stood in the elevator, she began to catch her breath. She fanned herself with one hand and dug into her laptop bag for something to help quiet her hungry, doughy belly. Her gut began to grumble more and more as she ascended the tall office building. \"It must be the stairs making me this hungry. I suppose... Maybe it wouldn't hurt to reward myself for doing such a good job. It was at that moment that Jessica's eyes lit up; a smile appearing on her face as she had finally found the snack from her laptop bag. Upon reaching the top floor, the gentle ring of the elevator sounded as the doors to the carriage slid open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnybody looking in this direction would see Jessica, no longer fanning herself, instead busied her left hand with holding a wrapped king sized Butterfinger which she had picked up on the way to work; the other hand returning to a bag of full sized snickers that she brought from home (just in case she got peckish later in the day) which was cradled softly between her quivering upper arm fat and elephantine belly. At least one wrapper could be seen peeking out from the pocket of her strained slacks, chocolate smears faintly gilding the black fabric as it bounced and wobbled to the rhythm of her gait. Continuing on the path to her desk, she peeled the gold-yellow and blue wrapper away from the candy bar, and heaved a sigh. The discomfort of her walk was the primary reason for the exhale, but the feeling of satisfaction that came with a well-earned reward as delicious as this seemed to add a huff of contentment to the end of the sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hefty office employee trundled nearer to her desk, Emily, one of her co-workers, greeted her in between finishing the butterfinger and reaching for her next treat, catching her with her mouth empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Jess!\" Emily waved a fat-swaddled arm to her heavier co-worker as she brought a chocolate-filled glazed eclair to her delicate, smiling mouth. Jess responded, \"Hi..*huff*..Holly\" she paused, leaning heavily on the desk of her co-worker to tear apart the wrapper of the fourth chocolate confection she'd rewarded herself this morning. As she leaned on the desk, her lowermost belly roll drooped heavily within the confines of her somewhat ill-fitting pants. moving further up her rolling torso the top roll of flab strained and overwhelmed her creaking waistband. Her breasts and arm fat billowed onto the flat hard surface of the desk, jiggling as she worked the wrapper down the candy confection. \"Mmmmm, I love snickers bars.\" Emily said through a mouthful of eclair; taking time to swipe the gob of chocolate frosting from her lip, and promptly returning it to her mouth. She continued \"Ooh! and I haven't been able to put down these doughnuts either! I think there's something in the water here, or maybe it's the vitamins I've been taking, or the altitude or whatever, but I have been so hungry lately.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an air of experience, Jess interjected, \"You should try their cinnamon rolls, they're divine!\" She hummed happily and began to rub the side of her now hungry belly; a glazed look returning to her eye as she brought the snickers to her mouth again and resumed her chewing. The memory of \"Porky's Three Pound Pan\" Cinnamon Rolls combined with the chocolate melting on her tongue and the waft of the fried pastries sitting on Emily's desk seemed to distract the grazing corpulent corporate worker. Her full mouth restricted her further correspondence to grunts of approval and agreement. Jessica would catch snippets of what Emily was saying. She would go on for a while about this restaurant or that, and how rarely she'd have opportunity to eat out at a restaurant before she moved here to the city and the corporate offices; about how nice the option of delivery was, and how she was just thrilled about her new corporate card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I won't keep talking your ear off, Jess, have a good day.\" Emily finished. \"I'll see you around.\" Jessica responded as she turned to finish the journey to her desk. After a short pause, Emily called out \"Want to get lunch with me sometime? I mean, I feel a little silly knowing more restaurants than I do people to go to them with, and I just thought...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face Emily caused the ocean of flab around Jess's middle to slosh, only coming to a rest when she began to say...</span></div></div>",

Which means that I was looking for the option wherein <i>every</i> woman in the company's higher echelons all get extremely fat for some reason. Possibly, the company even has a history of women getting fatter mostly in proportion to the rank within the company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in that case, an office drone at a smalltown branch might get hired as a slim, conventionally attractive woman. The head of that local branch would, apparently by coincidence, be an ssbbw. And the people working in the main office in New York are <i>all</i> at least very chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven people who are hired usually seem to end up, somehow conforming to the proportional fatness of their place within the company. Slim women are still <i>hired,</i> but they end surrounded by heavier women, and a culture of fatter people being more important, until it feels normal. They stop questioning it and start to allow themselves to get fat, until they match the size of their colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith promotion comes more money, but also a bigger office, on a higher floor, with fatter coworkers and more constant access to junk-food. The slim, conventionally attractive woman who was an office drone at the New York head office might, one day, be joining the board of directors. But, if that is the case, along the way she will probably:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoin the company thin, but quickly find herself surrounded by very, very chubby women, until the morning that she forgets to care about her bathroom scales telling her that she's hit the 200lbs mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet promoted, and put in an office in a higher floor, with an expenses budget for business lunches every day. She starts taking business lunches at least twice a day, because it just seems to be how everybody wants to meet. She barely has time to check her weight, which the scales telling her that she's up to 300lbs now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet promoted again, thanks to her many successful client meetings, getting a much bigger salary, a much bigger office on a higher floor, and a much bigger expense budget. Seeing how the real pro's do it on her new floor, she starts having her business lunches brought to her fancy office, so that she can fit in more meetings per day. If she had time to care what her bathroom scales said, she still wouldn't be able to find out. Partly because she couldn't see the numbers anymore past her waist, but mostly because her scales only went up to 350lbs, not 450lbs like she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet promoted again, because she's impressed some very important people. She gets a new office, bigger and better, with easy access to the luxury free buffet. She even gets her own personal assistant who is actually disturbingly thin when she starts (actually, she's 200lbs) which soon changes as she indulges often enough at the buffet with her new boss to get quite chubby (actually, she gains 100lbs). Our main character also gains little weight, but she pays little attention to irrelevant details, like \"650lbs\". She <i>is</i> finding it increasingly hard to get to work, however. That's why she's trying to work towards the built-in apartment offices on the top floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet promoted again, joining the live-in board of directors, with her own, huge office-apartment. They have video-conference for meetings, so she doesn't actually even need to leave to do any work. There is even a service elevator for take-out deliveries so that she can have a decent amount of food brought to her while she's in the meeting. Her personal assistant (now weighing 450lbs) is actually the one to fetch the food trolley, to pick up the take-out. In fact, most days, the main character only moved from the bedroom, to the living room for conference calls, but she soon realised that the other board members were taking the meetings from their beds. She started doing the same thing. Now she doesn't leave her bed. Although she no longer has any idea what her weight is (900lbs), she acknowledges that she couldn't get out of bed anymore if she tried. Luckily, her personal assistant has moved in and she hired a live-in nurse for the two of them. The nurse is worryingly skinny (200lbs, actually) but they'll soon have her eating better...</span></div></div>",

Checking up on how assignments were going, discussing new clients, going over the schedule for the week, not very interesting stuff. After the business topics it was on to the issues within the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay so I upped the daily order of doughnuts.\u201d Jenna said. The room applauded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill it be two boxes per person?\u201d Melissa asked. Everyone in the office (accept Christina) ate enough pastries a day to fill probably four boxes of doughnuts anyway but it was always a bit sweeter when it was freely provided by the company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, also there is a new Chinese food place in the food court downstairs. You guys get the same discounts there as with the rest of the food court.\u201d Jenna said. As Jenna searched through her papers there was a symphony of chewing, crunching, drinking, gulping, unwrapping as well as belts being loosened, fabric ripping slightly, buttons being undone, and as the obese employees shifted their massive bodies the chairs shrieked and groaned. Melissa reached across the table for another pastry. It was the last coffee cake on the platter and was on the opposite side from Melissa. She pulled herself in closer but still couldn\u2019t reach it. She wanted to lean over table but her big fat gut pressed against the hard edge of the table. She tried to lift herself out of her chair so she could reach across but her heavy overfed frame was too much for her too lift for more than an instance. Luckily Christina noticed the event and pushed the pastry closer to Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright listen cause this is important. There\u2019s a new service store thingy on the 4th floor that is from the company.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom Gordge?\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s called Employee Comfort Services, and it\u2019s basically an area you can go to for any number of problems. They have a tailoring section where you can go if you need new or patched up clothes. If you need a bigger chair you can go there for new one. If you have any requests or issues just go see them and they\u2019ll help you deal with it.\u201d Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great.\u201d Courtney said. All the employees were excited about it. Finally the meeting was over and it was time for the first break of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\u201cSo are we gonna use my car until you get a new one?\u201d Melissa asked Alice in the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Alice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice you can barely fit in the driver\u2019s seat!\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. I can\u2019t believe I need a new car.\u201d Alice said in a dejected manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNew car? Why do you need a new car?\u201d Courtney asked as she entered the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe driver\u2019s seat is too small and I always end up sitting on the belt buckle.\u201d Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s Japanese. Those Japanese cars aren\u2019t made for Americans.\u201d Courtney said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s like they\u2019ve never heard of fat people before. Like, big is normal now.\u201d Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right. Although I have gotten pretty big recently.\u201d Alice said. They all sat around eating junk food and talking about whatever. Quickly though the break was over and it was back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\nAs Courtney sat at her desk she had one hand using the computer and one hand feeding her. It was a veteran skill that comes from years of practice. Courtney\u2019s big gut was the outcome of years and years of avoiding exercise and eating tons of sugary greasy food. Courtney leaned forward in her chair so that she could reach past her big blubbery middle. Her thick bottom roll of fat hung over the edge of her chair as her massive belly sat between her round plump thighs. The poor desk chair could barely handle Courtney size. The chair was supposed to be for a fat person. It was made stronger and larger than your average chair, but the chair was not meant for someone as gargantuan as Courtney. Courtney was beyond fat. She was a blimp. Not only had her weight exceeded the suggested limit of the chair, her body had literally outgrown the chair. Courtney\u2019s abundant flab was overflowing in the seat. Her big round hips were swallowing the pitiful armrests. She could barely fit her overfed butt on to the seat. As Courtney leaned forward in the chair her blubbery legs and belly slipped more and more off the chair. Courtney made an attempt to coral her flab back into the chair. She leaned her bulk back and pulled her gut up. As she leaned back the chair let out a cry as the parts started to come a part. A series of pops and groans were let out as the chair crumbled under the immense manatee. The whole office shook as Courtney crashed to the floor. Courtney\u2019s mound of fat jiggled until her coworkers came over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre *pant* you okay?\u201d Alice said, out of breath from jumping out of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t think the chair is gonna make it though.\u201d Courtney joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristina help her up.\u201d Alice said. Courtney stuck her two arms in the air. Alice and Christina pulled but couldn\u2019t move her an inch. Courtney sat on the floor like a beached whale. The only one fit person in the office was Christina but she was hardly strong enough to budge Courtney. Finally they got everyone in the office pulling Courtney up. Slowly Courtney started to rise off the floor. Eventually Courtney finally could stand. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, tune in tomorrow morning from your phone! Because after all, what\u2019s better than waking up with a KISS from two sexy radio DJs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the live feed was cut. The two women went limp in their chairs, finally able to relax after a long day\u2019s work of plugging ads and taking calls in their own little hotbox. Cass flung herself forward, leaning on her panel where she\u2019d taken all her notes, while Marni slumped back into her seat. It was an ungodly hot Summer day, and the AC unit in the building had given out earlier in the week. The crew had done what they could with electric fans and lots of bottled waters, but it just simply wasn\u2019t cutting it. What\u2019s worse, the fans kept blowing into the feed, so they had to move them whenever they were on the air\u2014which meant <i>lots</i> of commercial breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank <i>gawd</i>.\u201d Marni whined as she hopped out of her chair, her brown hair frizzy and curly from the heat, \u201cI thought today would <i>never</i> end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d Cass agreed flatly as she poured herself onto the floor, \u201cAt least they\u2019ve finally got a crew up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass Morgan and Marni Smith had been doing this for a while\u2014for too long, they both often thought. The Cass and Marni Morning Show had traveled to three different states in the past nine years, never really finding its niche while Cass and Marni spent their twenties trying to figure out how to appeal to their frequently changing audience. They were running on their third year now and they had just gotten renewed for their fourth year at their latest studio. Which would have been great if they weren\u2019t so willing to cut corners\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you want another water before lunch?\u201d Marni bent over and reached into the ice bucket that an intern had provided, rattling the ice around as she searched for a particularly cold one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Cass held out her hand, \u201cHydrate me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their closeness, Cass and Marni couldn\u2019t have been any more different\u2014appearance-wise or in personality. Marni was a short woman whose feet didn\u2019t even touch the ground when she sat in her booth, with slight curves and a round face that gave her a very young appearance to better fit with her sillier personality. They were the same age of course, but Marni was the only one who got carded at the club. Cass was a statuesque, tallish woman with a large bust and long brown locks that came to tickle the back of her shoulders. Her lean figure was an accomplishment attributed to long hours of yoga and self-control, very much contrasting the soft svelteness of her lazier coworker. They had few interests in common, aside from their shared interest in broadcast, but managed to make themselves into quite the working pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women left their mics, waters in tow, and stepped out into the less blistering section of the recording studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarty, <i>tell</i> me those guys are gonna be done by tomorrow.\u201d Marni took a big gulp from her bottle as she approached a slight man with a goatee, \u201cOne more day like this and you\u2019re gonna have to work \u201cextra crispy\u201d into our show\u2019s title.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready on it. Great show today, you guys.\u201d Marty said confidently as he gave a congratulatory handshake to both women, \u201cI just wanted to let you know that since you guys have signed on, we\u2019ve been picking up sponsors like crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. Sponsors. As in those guys that they had to stay after for later today to make those stupid pre-recorded commercials that everyone hated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Cass rolled her eyes, \u201cWhat have you got us peddling now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are <i>peddling</i>\u2014\u201c Marty said with a playful emphasis on Cass\u2019 negative tone, \u201c\u2014for some company called Gordge Enterprises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do they do?\u201d Marni asked, taking another sip, \u201cAre they, like, some kind of tech company or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 they do lots of things.\u201d Marty said unsuredly, \u201cBut who cares right\u2014they\u2019re <i>fans</i>! They like your show so much they wanna give us money\u2014that\u2019s what this whole biz is about, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d Cass rolled her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, they\u2019re <i>so</i> happy to have you guys, they sent you two a little something.\u201d Marty took both women by their sweaty shoulders, \u201cIt\u2019s in the break room fridge. Go in, cool down, and check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass and Marni let out matching sighs as they peeled themselves away from their supervisor. Today hadn\u2019t exactly been the easiest days, and while it was nice to know that they had such dedicated fans, it didn\u2019t exactly make them feel any more certain about what they were doing. Things had become just so\u2026 <i>blah</i>. And not just in their latest town, but in general. It was a <i>lot</i> harder being a radio host than either one of them really thought it would be way back when they started this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they reached the break room, Cass flung herself down on the couch while Marni made a bee-line for the fridge. While the taller of the two situated herself as comfortably as she could in the scorching heat, Marni opened the door (enjoying the momentary break from the heat) and pulled out a giant wicker basket wrapped in cellophane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>To Cass and Marni, From Gordge Enterprises. Please enjoy the first\u2014but certainly not the last\u2014courtesy gift that comes with Gordge Enterprises\u2019 sponsorship.</i>\u201d Marni read aloud from the card attached before flipping it over, \u201cAnd back here it says <i>We really like your show\u2014Alice G., Melissa H., and Courtney S.</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus <i>Christ</i> that\u2019s huge!\u201d Cass said with surprise as Marni set it down on the table, \u201cThey just <i>gave</i> this to us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently.\u201d Marni said with similar surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women peeled apart the wrapping on the basket and took a good look inside; taking note of all the snacks and goodies that they had been sent. Candy, snack cakes, coupons to restaurants; there was enough food in there to last a week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a <i>lot</i> of food.\u201d Marni said, her hands on her hips as they looked over the generous spread, \u201cThese Gordge people are crazy generous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously.\u201d Cass let out a little whistle, \u201cNever gotten benefits like <i>this</i> before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they took advantage of their little perk. They skipped their usual outing to their usual venue, and treated themselves to the plentiful goodies inside the Gordge Benefits basket. Neither Cass nor Marni could really say no to such a generous spread, and from such dedicated fans of the show. They did their recordings, plugged their ads, and made sure to keep Gordge Enterprises happy for the forseeable future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the benefits didn't stop there. Baskets arrived once a week, each one as full as the first. Gordge Enterprises donated a new AC unit to the studio in exchange for more adspace for their company and other affiliated clients. Money was pouring in, their bosses couldn't have been happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut between all the welcome baskets, complementary discount dinners at partnered restaurants, and freely accepting the suggestions from their friends in the Gordge Enterprises break room, it was beginning to seriously affect...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Between all the welcome baskets, complementary discount dinners at partnered restaurants, and freely accepting the suggestions from their friends in the Gordge Enterprises break room, it was beginning to seriously interfere with Cass\u2019 exercise regimen. It started out rather small, some minor inconveniences that weren\u2019t quite enough to cause concern but enough to throw off her carefully crafted routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordge was a company that dipped its fingers in a lot of smaller businesses around town, both women to wake up early or stay a little later to pre-record commercials for various businesses around town. It was something that they did normally, yes, but Gordge\u2019s sponsorship required doing a whole slew of them. So, for fear of sounding burnt out on the recordings, Marty decided that it would be best if the girls did them one or two at a time for about a week. Rather than wake up even earlier (four \u2018o\u2019 clock in the morning was enough, thank you very much!) Cass just skipped her morning workout routine. She rolled out of bed, did her makeup, got dressed, and went out the door without doing her stretches or her cardio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only her morning coffee to wake her up, Cass was usually a little groggy by the time she made it to the studio. She had something of a tradition where she would grab one of the breakfast bars from their dressing room before going on the air, but Marty needed the new commercials recorded ASAP. Luckily for her appetite, not so much for her conscience, Gordge had started delivering them donuts every morning, which they kept right outside the studio for convenience\u2019s sake. Marty practically ushered her into the recording room, pressed for time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t a girl get some breakfast first?\u201d Cass bit back groggily at his pace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere just\u2026\u201d Marty plucked a cr\u00e8me-filled pastry randomly from the box, \u201cJ-Just eat this. And be quick about it\u2014once Marni gets here, we\u2019re going on the air!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir morning show went mostly unchanged, thankfully. There were no censorships in place, and there was no interference with the programs already scheduled. They still did Second Date Update, Ask Cass, To Catch a Cheater, and et cetera, but there was a slight push from their new sponsors to include products from affiliated companies in their morning discussions. They were given plenty of free samples across a wide variety of companies to \u201ctest out\u201d for the show, and the studio execs actually pushed to have a new program created called KISS it or Cram it\u2014a solid ten minutes taken out of every day where one of the girls would talk about a certain product that they were gifted from one company, talk about how awesome it was, and basically mention how easy it made their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo today\u2019s KISS It or Cram it is dedicated to the PediPad.\u201d Cass said into the microphone one morning, powdered sugar dusting the corner of her lips, \u201cIt\u2019s made by the good people at You\u2014the company that makes and designs products based for\u2026 well, <i>you</i>\u2014and\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 wow. Just so wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s feeling very articulate today.\u201d Marni teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, for real, it\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019s this high-end foot massager that reads the stress and strain on your feet\u2014like say, after a long day at work, you come home from work or from a workout\u2014and it gives you a personalized, deep-tissue massage every single time you use it. It tailors what it does to fit how sore your feet are!\u201d Cass actually pulled up a picture on her phone and showed it to Marni, \u201cLadies, you know me, I\u2019m <i>all</i> about fitness. But I just got this thing, and I sit down and I put my feet in it, and all I want to do is {i]relax\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most intrusive part of Gordge\u2019s sponsorship had to be their insistence that their clients got the most detailed review possible. It was understandable, of course, that they wanted their companies to be represented honestly and professionally reviewed. So all the new gadgets and frivolities that came with sponsoring companies like You or Gadgetech were to be expected. Even if it meant that Cass had to take time out of her workout routine to test things like the PediPad or the shoe organizer from Mauve and John\u2019s, she didn\u2019t necessarily mind so much. It was part of the job, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more often than not, Cass and Marni found themselves dining out. Gordge apparently sponsored a lot of local restaurants (chains or otherwise) and expected the same treatment that they gave to the other companies. It was in their contract, actually. Marty was insistent on ordering from Gordge-affiliated eateries for lunch in the studio, taking extra steps to keep the money flowing into their pockets. Thanks to the discounts provided by Gordge\u2019s sponsorship, Cass and Marni actually found themselves eating out more, even when they weren\u2019t on the clock. This wasn\u2019t so much of a problem for fun-loving, laissez-faire Marni. But when it came to salad-munching, ab-crunching Cass, who lived on nearly half the calories that Marni did, all this food was beginning to become a bit overwhelming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Cass, wanna hit up House of Wings?\u201d Marni asked her one day, not long into their sponsorship, \u201cIt\u2019s about dinner time, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. No way.\u201d Cass burbled, cradling a swollen stomach, \u201cI\u2019m still full from lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t be such a baby.\u201d Marni psshaw\u2019d with a playful punch in Cass\u2019 well-toned arm muscle, \u201cYou had like, one sandwich.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA footlong! With sausage and ham and turkey and enough empty calories to send me to the hospital.\u201d Cass rolled her eyes as she walked her teeny-weeny cohost into the parking lot, \u201cSeriously, all this food is killing me. I feel like I\u2019m going to pop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t do it in my car.\u201d Marni hit the unlock button on her key fob, \u201cC\u2019mon, you still owe me for bailing when you got that stupid foot massager.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBluh. I feel like I need to hit the gym.\u201d Cass gave a self-conscious rub across her bloated belly, \u201cI\u2019ve been eating a lot lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, House of Wings is on the way!\u201d Marni said sarcastically, \u201cWe can just\u2026 y\u2019know, pull into the Fit Life parking lot, park, and then leave. That\u2019s <i>technically</i> going to the gym, right? I mean, you <i>went</i> there, am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I just hope Gordge sponsors an AbLounge next or something.\u201d Cass puffed as she poured herself into the passenger seat, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can take much more of this\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An <i>office party</i> though, seriously?\u201d Marni curled her nose as she looked out onto the rolling hillside of the local park, \u201cSeriously\u2014I thought these went the way of Dinosaurs and VCRs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, be nice.\u201d Marty snapped at the smaller woman, who stuck out her tongue in response, \u201cThese Gordge folks are paying us a lot of money; the least you could do is sit down for a few hours, keep your trap shut, and eat some free food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d much rather breathe the stale, recycled air of our hotbox.\u201d Marni snarked as she crossed her arms defiantly at Marty, who made his way out into the park to mingle, \u201cSeriously Cass, what are we, Gordge employees now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Marn\u2026 might do us some good.\u201d Cass said with a weak smile, her arms wrapped around her torso defensively, \u201cYou know, socialize, fresh air\u2026 get some exercise, maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni rolled her eyes again and stomped off in a huff, leaving Cass all by her lonesome. Once her itsy-bitsy co-host was out of sight, Cass relaxed the grip of her arms around her waist. She breathed a sigh of relief, content to finally let her breath out. She\u2019d been holding it in since the car ride over, doing her best to flatten her tummy, but she just couldn\u2019t take it any longer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hff</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the protective shielding of her arms, her waist thickened slightly as she let go of the breath she\u2019d been holding in her chest. It was hardly noticeable, especially not with the precautions she\u2019d taken in anticipation of going out and about today, but the extra ten pounds or so may as well have been ten thousand to Cass Morgan as she struggled to deal with her extra dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d been forced to break out a baggy pink flannel shirt for these people, and her jeans were tight as all get-out. She felt practically naked in everything else\u2014what with that oh-so-slight belly bulge that almost nobody but her could have detected\u2014but she hardly felt confident at all. Cass had never been more than five pounds overweight in her entire life, let alone ten. The baggy clothes did little to boost her esteem; in fact it did just the opposite, Cass felt like a whale! She should have been burning this free time shedding some pounds at the gym, not fulfilling yet another contractual obligation with these Gordge people. Every second smelling hotdogs and burgers and all that greasy, salty prepackaged food in the air was another second spent ballooning up rather than slimming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass was so self conscious in fact, so put off by the inactivity of it all, that the normally confident and sterling broadcaster found herself doing her best to shrink into the background of this event. She didn\u2019t know anyone, nobody knew what she looked like (even if they were huge fans of the show, that was one of the perks of being a radio star!), so that gave nobody any reason to just come up and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh my god\u2026 a-are you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You\u2019re Cass Morgan!\u201d came the cries of one star-struck fan, far off to her right, \u201cF-From the show, right? Cass and Marni?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\u201c Cass shrank modestly before turning to face her approaching fan, whereupon she found herself at something at a loss for words, \u201c\u2026woah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly approaching from the port side was a real whale of a woman, a real chair-squasher if there ever were one. She was about as big around the belly as a beach ball, tucked into some ill-fitting casual clothes that were hardly park-going fare. She looked to have outgrown them just recently\u2014the sly sliver of her belly threatened to pop right out of the waistband of her khakis. She had a really pretty face though, beneath all the chins, and gorgeous blonde hair that fell down to her shoulders. On her right tit, there was a nametag that said \u201cHello, my name is\u2026 Alice\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, <i>yeah</i>!\u201d \u2018Alice\u2019 said excitedly, \u201cWoah is right! I can\u2019t believe you guys actually came!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, uh\u2026\u201d Cass did her best not to stare as Alice\u2019s chest heaved and ho\u2019d with every belabored breath that the quaking office fatty took, \u201cYeah, y\u2019know, happy to be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy to have you! Y\u2019know, it was <i>my</i> idea to have Gordge sponsor you guys!\u201d Alice said proudly, taking Cass\u2019 hand and shaking it lightly, \u201cI-I\u2019m just\u2026 <i>wow</i>. It\u2019s so weird. My friends and I listen to you guys every day\u2014we <i>love</i> your show!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Cass eased up slightly, coming out of her shoulders somewhat, \u201cWell that\u2019s really nice of you guys. Me and Marn are always happy to meet a fan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarn.\u201d Alice snorted giddily, \u201cHey, me and the girls were actually just about to sit down and have something to eat, would you\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe want to come say hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass initially recoiled at the thought. The last thing she really wanted to do right now was eat, given that all she had been doing lately was scarfing down junk that Gordge sponsored. She\u2019d had so much free food lately that the thought of any more honestly made her a little sick. But what else was she going to do; stand there all day in the sun and bake? And Alice seemed nice enough, even if she was a little overzealous\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn\u2019t exactly automatic, but Cass and Alice had really hit it off by the end of the day. They proved to have quite a bit in common, despite their wildly different personalities and interests, and sort of complemented each other in an odd way. Cass liked to talk, Alice liked to listen\u2014and with plenty of interesting interviews beneath her belt, that meant Cass had a <i>lot</i> of stories to tell. Even as Cass was slowly integrated into the pool of Alice\u2019s coworkers at Gordge, as she met Melissa and Courtney and Victoria and all the other office women, the two women seemed to get along rather nicely. So nicely, in fact, that they continued to kindle their friendship even after the office outing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, the two women continued to keep in touch. There was some texting, a couple of phone calls, but their friendship mostly manifested in a few friendly afternoon lunches together. Being the host of a morning show Cass and Marni were off the clock by around noon, which crept into the latter half of Alice\u2019s two-hour break. A few times, at least once a week, Cass and Alice would meet up at some restaurant around town\u2014often with Melissa and, once these meals became more commonplace, Courtney\u2014and eat lunch together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her considerable size, Alice was more than willing\u2014almost eager\u2014to order greens and low-calorie options (albeit in rather large portions!) wherever the two of them went; something that Cass was grateful for. With less time than she would have liked to devote to keeping her body toned and lean, and her own lacking self-control as of late, Cass readily braced herself against Alice\u2019s promising amounts of self-restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to lose some weight.\u201d Alice had said with a distasteful curl of her nostril one day at lunch, \u201cY\u2019know, try and get my Varsity Squad body back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Cass couldn\u2019t have agreed more. Now unaccustomed to her workout routine, the slacking siren was finding it hard to get herself back into the game. It had been at least three weeks since she\u2019d been to the gym, and even longer since she\u2019d actually broken a sweat. Which is, honestly, why she found herself going out with Alice more and more. All Marni wanted to do was go out and club. All those empty calories\u2014that expensive beer and bar food\u2014weren\u2019t good for Cass\u2019 waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once Melissa and Courtney became more frequent fixtures in their party of two, temptation once again reared its ugly head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome <i>on</i> Alice, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re just going to get a <i>salad</i>.\u201d Melissa, another woman whose overall size was comparable to Alice\u2019s, nudged her flabby friend in the flank, \u201cWho comes to a buffet and orders the salad bar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Alice would say, looking to Cass, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I guess\u2026 i-it is kind of dumb. Cass, do you want to maybe try out the buffet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course she would agree\u2014she\u2019d been good for a long time, right? Only taking samples from the Gordge baskets, doing her best not to abuse her discounted meals at the various restaurants around town, picking low-calorie options, the usual. She deserved a reward here and there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Alice\u2019s friends, who were hardly bound to Alice\u2019s lofty ideas of diet and moderation, became more familiar with Cass, they also became more persuasive. Soon Melissa didn\u2019t have to nudge the two dieters into picking the buffet option, and it became something that they indulged in \u201conly when Melissa was around.\u201d But after that, it became Alice breaking down and taking the low road, convincing the poor dieting DJ that it was okay to have a little treat every once in a while. And by the end of it, it just became habit. Pretty soon, Cass was eating at buffets almost every day for lunch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Cass, I was gonna try out that singles bar downtown later\u2026 wanna head out?\u201d Marni leaned over her stand, arms folded and propping up her head as her feet swung in her chair, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we just\u2026 hung out, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d Cass smacked her lips, a plastic-wrapped Porky\u2019s Pastries muffin with a big bite taken out of it placed firmly in one hand, \u201cWhat, like\u2026 go clubbing? C\u2019mon Marn, you <i>know</i> if I go out with you tonight, we\u2019ll stay out late. I kinda want to sleep <i>before</i> tomorrow\u2019s show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd? Come on, let\u2019s go out.\u201d Marni pouted, sticking her lower lip out as far as it would go, \u201cI feel like I never see you anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmpmh\u2026\u201d Cass took another big bite of muffin and swallowed. She poured herself onto her feet, dusting the muffin debris off of her accumulated paunch and out of her shelf-like cleavage, \u201cI know, I swear we\u2019ll hang out soon. But I already told Alice we\u2019d meet up at that new Chinese place for lunch today. Maybe you want to come with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d Marni puffed, irritated, \u201cMaybe this weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis weekend, definitely.\u201d Cass managed through her muffin mouth, \u201cSee you then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni watched as Cass made her way out the door, full rear and thick legs swaying behind her as her biggened belly threatened to pop the buttons on her tightening blouse. She rolled her eyes and whipped out her phone, the responsibility of being her adult supervision and straight man falling on one of her other friends yet again\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCass, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d came Alice\u2019 meek voice from the changing room, \u201cI feel like I look ridiculous\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No way!\u201d Cass said with her hands on her widening hips, \u201cCome on out sweetie, I\u2019m sure you look fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened on Fit Life\u2019s sole handicap changing room, slowly revealing a meek mountain of a woman standing inside. Alice had apparently followed Cass\u2019 advice and forgone all the expensive exercise gear that she\u2019d seen the day before when they\u2019d planned this little outing. She was tarped in a simple t-shirt, stretched tight around her double-wide figure, and her legs were crammed into pink spandex. Her hair was pulled back into a tight little bun, giving Cass a clear view of her round cheeks and her swaddling double chin. Alice had to turn sideways to get out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, I <i>told</i> you they made yoga pants in your size.\u201d Cass reassured her enormous friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d Alice squeaked, \u201cThese are maternity sweats\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a baby?\u201d Cass raised one eyebrow in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been talking about going to the gym for weeks now. Between all the lunches and the after-work get-togethers with all the girls from Gordge, not to mention having to turn in early almost every night so she could get enough sleep before the Morning Show, there wasn\u2019t much time to work it in. They\u2019d finally made the time after more than a month of empty promises, with both women going out and buying new workout gear for the occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Cass had suggested it as a way of attempting to hide her substantial weight gain. She had grown quite soft in the months since renewing her contract with the studio. She had made excuse after excuse, slowly falling off the fitness wagon, ever since the beginning of the year. She\u2019d let herself go really badly, but she knew she could get her body back with a little help and support. Since Marni didn\u2019t seem to be particularly interested, that meant that she had to bank on Alice\u2014who, in her defense, <i>had</i> mentioned trying to get her own figure back quite a few times since she\u2019d known her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass\u2019 flabby stomach oozed over the waistband of her spandex bottoms, which were stretched to transparency around her broad cheeks and thick thighs. She\u2019d tucked her tummy into the pants, making them bulge out noticeably, even beneath her t-shirt. Any trace of muscle that she once had was now buried under layers of soft fat, brought on by months of inactivity and indulgence. Though she would admit to herself, and only to herself, that standing next to Alice made her feel substantially better about her body. At least, Cass consoled herself quietly, she'd never be as big as Alice was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them went to the man floor of the gym; a sea of treadmills, elliptical machines, exercise bikes, and more laid spread out before them. It had actually been so long that Cass was genuinely at a loss as to where to start. Not at the elliptical, that seemed like too much. But the exercise biked seemed too easy. She wanted to work up a sweat, but she didn\u2019t want to tire herself out so much that she couldn\u2019t continue. There were plenty of other rooms in Fit Life\u2014with lots of classes being offered. She was a premium member; maybe one of those rooms had something a little better suited for her? But could she really face her yoga instructor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 do you want to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, hop on a treadmill?\u201d Alice suggested finally, ripping the doughy DJ from her predicament, \u201cSeems like a good place, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah!\u201d Cass said in a feigned confidence, \u201cTotally. Wherever you want to start!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women claimed a set of treadmills, and Cass set their respective paces. She had put Alice on a relatively low setting, so as not to discourage her, but enough to challenge her. Meanwhile, Cass had made the grave mistake of putting herself at her old speed, to which she found very quickly that she was no longer capable of matching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass felt like she was running a marathon. Her leg muscles, atrophied after months of misuse, were awoken suddenly and sharply. Her stamina had nosedived, barely able to maintain a steady pace after just a minute on the tread, due to a combination of her newfound weight and her lazy lifestyle. She was sweating for the first time in months\u2014a real sweat, one that left her sticky and hot\u2014as she struggled to maintain <i>a</i> pace, rather than a steady one. Finally she just had to give up. She got off the treadmill, bent over her knees, sputtering and spewing like a faulty engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m doing it!\u201d Alice puffed confidently, enjoying her leisurely pace on her own treadmill, \u201cCass, do you think you could maybe turn up my speed a little?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 not now.\u201d Cass said abashedly, \u201cLet\u2019s, uh\u2026 let\u2019s try the exercise bikes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven faced with the reality that she wasn\u2019t in quite the same shape that she was used to be, Cass still found herself bested by every machine that the gym had to offer. She was beat pretty badly by the exercise bike, finding her legs in such supple shape that they were hardly equipped to handle the pressures of Fit Cass\u2019 workout. The elliptical made her thighs and arms hurt, even after setting it to no resistance. And with Alice beside her every step of the way, huffing and puffing like she was about to pass out at every second, Cass just finally had to break down and stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 okay\u2026 good effort.\u201d Cass puffed, her spirits crushed, \u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 let\u2019s just call it a day\u2026 okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 I was having\u2026 fun!\u201d Alice was still winded, despite the fact that they had been sitting for some time now, \u201cYou\u2026 you said you\u2026 you wanted to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what I said.\u201d Cass bit back, \u201cBut I\u2019m not\u2026 I just\u2026 I <i>can\u2019t</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice watched as her friend began to tear up. Cass chewed on her bottom lip, struggling to hold back her tears as she was faced with the reality that she had really let herself go. Alice had seen that frustration, that desperation, in her own face more than a few times as she slowly ballooned over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Cass?\u201d Alice said softly to her teary-eyed friend, \u201cYou\u2019re a premium member, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, don\u2019t remind me.\u201d Cass sniffled, \u201cThe studio sponsors this gym\u2026 Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women lay in the restricted spa section of Fit Life, available only to Premium Members. It was a luxurious space, with few and far patrons between the rooms that it encompassed. Cass couldn\u2019t even <i>hear</i> the grunts and clamor of the gym fare in the other room as she lay sprawled out in her wooden recliner, a green facial mask on with two pickles over her eyes. Her freshly wetted hair was wrapped up in a towel, and her still damp body was covered by a big fluffy robe. The worries of earlier that day had melted beneath massages and manicures, all at a low-low cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis <i>was</i> a good idea.\u201d The chubbing hostess said with a smile on her face as she popped a complementary chocolate into her mouth, \u201cI needed this. Thank you, Alice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Alice said contentedly from her position on the massage table as four masseurs kneaded and squeezed her abundant form, \u201cThank <i>you</i> for letting me be your plus one.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cass had been in the middle of lunch. A long lunch, admittedly. She'd been plopped down in the studio break room since about one in the afternoon, right after their show went off the air, taking full advantage of her sponsorship perks. Yesterday, on a restaurant crawl with Alice and the girls, she'd stopped at no less than three restaurants on a mission to pick up lunch for the next day. And it wasn't until well into the night, their bellies having gone from soft and flabby to turgid and drum-tight, that she made good on that statement. Cass had taken two full courses into the studio today; an especially large hamburger with bacon and egg trimmings, fries on the side as well as an equally heavy chicken dish that was covered in cheese, tomato, and various spices. Ostensibly, the former was for breakfast, but she'd forgotten all about that dish when she spied the donuts on the counter. Now she had to eat them both\u2014not that she'd complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around halfway through her burger when Marni and the studio executives came into the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass and Marni had been friends <i>long</i> before they were co-stars of the KISS radio show. Ever since they were two strangers announcing local events at their community college, what at first seemed to be insurmountable differences became a fierce and fast friendship between the two siren-voiced sweethearts. What seemed like forever ago, the two of them had only signed on to do their morning show if it meant that they could do it together\u2014which meant that the ensuing conversation between the two former friends was incredibly uncomfortable for at least one party present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>what</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, after the Gordge Offices had gotten out for the day, Alice politely declined the various invitations to go to this bar or that restaurant. After the abrupt, worrying message that Cass had sent her about being fired, all she could think about was getting to her friend and favorite (former) radio hostess's apartment as soon as she could. Unfortunately, that meant waiting a full three hours after it had been delivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that time, Cass had already fallen well into her downward spiral. The pants that she and Alice had bought together some weeks ago, already tight enough to give her a distinct muffin-top along the circumference of her belly, were strewn across the ugly fake house plant that sat in the corner. Her bright blue top met a similar fate, wadded up on the floor not far from the couch. And there, laying on the couch, was what was left of Cass Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrading in her pants for a pair of leggings, the outline of her belly clear as day as it bulged underneath her loose KISS 102.5 t-shirt, Cass looked like an absolute wreck. Dark circles of ruined makeup ran down her cheeks, streaking gray flooding from her eyes as she bawled helplessly on her seat. Cass had done what she could to tell Alice the details of her termination in the text messages, but during her spectacular breakdown on the other end of the line, she managed to forgo just how torn up she really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fired!\" Cass bellowed, spoon filled with strawberry ice cream that quickly made its way to her quivering mouth, \"I can't believe it! I'm such a loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's hands pat Cass on the soft back as she collapsed into her friend's pillowy bosom. She hugged Alice's ample frame tightly, shuddering as she bawled openly in the arms of what now felt like her only friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you're not a loser.\" Alice stroked Cass lovingly, comfortingly, with one hand, \"This could happen to anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except <i>Marni</i>.\" Cass spat distastefully, \"How the fuck does that short little cunt get to keep her job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, sweetie\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't even stick up for me!\" the former fitness queen bellowed, straightening up so she could get some more ice cream from the carton, \"She just... just stood there and watched while I got my ass handed to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass had been alternating between emotional tirades and emphatic tantrums since before Alice arrived. She had never thought that she\u2014one of the first names in local radio hostessing\u2014would be handed her entire career like this. And for such shoddy reasons! \"Marketing issues\", \"budget cuts\", who the hell cared? She didn't deserve this! She didn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass collapsed back into Alice. Of course she deserved this. She'd been pigging out on corporate sponsorship for a long time now. Getting fat off of profit, phoning it in on-air and leaving Marni to do all the hard work. Their ratings had dropped just as quickly as her weight started to rise, and now she was in the only logical position there was left: a washed-out, blown-up hasbeen crying on her couch. A couch she couldn't really afford anymore, at that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Alice ventured tentatively, \"What are you gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Cass sniffed, putting the nearly emptied carton down, \"My career is wrecked. It'll be <i>years</i> until I get another job like the one I pissed away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence filled the apartment as Cass began to cry again. Ever the people pleaser, Alice set straight into work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I could see if I could get you a job at Gordge!\" she offered helpfully and enthusiastically, \"We're looking for someone to fill in for a transfer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus christ, I don't know Al...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just until you get another job on the radio.\" Alice did her best to smile reassuringly, \"We all loved to listen to you on the radio, so I doubt anyone would say <i>no</i> to having a local celebrity come work with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez, don't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Alice smacked her friend on the arm playfully, \"I can talk to Jenna tomorrow and maybe you can have a job by the end of the week. What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d been there for all the ups and the downs, watching her friend\u2019s mood ping-pong from resigned to hopeful to optimistic to crashing and burnt. She was there when Cass realized that she didn\u2019t have any business casual wear that fit her in the closet, she was there when she drunk-messaged Marni and made an ass out of herself, and she was there for the feel-better ice cream binges and the clothes shopping. And more importantly, Alice was going to be there for her at her first day at work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass wobbled through the office doors like a kid on her first day of school\u2014her eyes simultaneously wide and darting everywhere but to the people around her, feet shuffling, tugging at her uncomfortable new clothes. It had been so long since she\u2019d had to wear a blouse to work that she\u2019d honestly forgotten how to wear one. How did she look? What would all of her coworkers think? Would they <i>know</i> how pathetic she felt, coming into an office job after years of working in a radio show? What she wouldn\u2019t have done for just another day to stay in bed and mope\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Cass\u2014I\u2019ll take you to meet the girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I already know the girls.\u201d The chunky brunette said dryly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo, <i>the old</i> Cass Morgan knew the girls!\u201d Alice said chipperly, taking her elbow and locking it in the smothering nook between her fleshy forearm and her upper armwing, \u201cThey have yet to meet the <i>new and improved</i> Cass Morgan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <i>new and improved</i> Cass Morgan. What a joke. Eighty pounds heavier and crammed into a blouse. Working at a dumb office job to pay the bills until she could get another job back on the radio. As grateful as she was to Alice for helping her score this job at Gordge, she could have dialed it back a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice led Cass down the aisle of cubicles, waving at familiar faces and showing off their new coworker. Cass sheepishly ducked away from the limelight as well as she could. She wasn\u2019t exactly in the best place to take affection right now. Never the less, Alice wasn\u2019t going to let up anytime soon\u2014the big sweet balloon was showing her off like she\u2019d discovered a new species or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is our new girl <i>Cass Morgan</i>!\u201d Alice would gesture with prestige, \u201cFrom the KISS morning show?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, getting to see everyone\u2019s wowed (or if not wowed, at least polite) expressions did Cass some good. It was nice to know that people enjoyed her work on the show, and she\u2019d be coming into a place where people already seemed to know her well enough. Or at least, her radio personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much of her radio personality was different from her regular personality\u2014she hadn\u2019t even thought about that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the parade led to a large room a little off of the beaten path. The building was divided into two main halves, and in the middle was a hallway. At the end of that hallway was a small black and white plaque that said BREAK ROOM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez Alice, we just got here.\u201d Cass snarked, \u201cI know it\u2019s my first day, but I don\u2019t think I need a break just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you do!\u201d Alice smiled, her chubby cheeks bunching as she nudged her friend by the chubby buns into the room, \u201cGo on in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the handle in hand, Cass shrugged and opened the door. Feeling around for the light switch, Cass touched the side of the wall and flipped a large switch. The fluorescent lighting came to life, and with it so did the break room\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSURPRISE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass was assaulted with the sight of about ten women waiting for her, all spread out along the break room. Some of them, she knew already\u2014Alice\u2019s friends Melissa and Courtney were faces she recognized. But then there were younger ladies, like a blonde with glasses and a sort of Italian looking woman whose enthusiasm didn\u2019t quite match the rest of them. But in the middle was the largest woman that Cass had ever seen\u2014Jenna, her new boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome aboard Cass Morgan!\u201d she said with a smile, holding a sheet cake in both of her chubby hands, \u201cWhat do you think\u2014were you surprised?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Cass blinked, her eyes getting watery, \u201cYou don\u2019t do this for all the new hires, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t been listening to most new hires on the radio for years and years!\u201d Alice grabbed her friend by the shoulder and forced her into her fluffy side, \u201cWe already feel like you\u2019re part of the family!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you do?\u201d Cass asked dumbly, starstruck, \u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is about the only special treatment you\u2019re gonna get, so don\u2019t get too used to it.\u201d Melissa snorted, \u201cIf we bought a cake for every new hire, I\u2019d be Courtney\u2019s size by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna waddled over handing Cass the sheet cake. There were three little candles on top, and in pink frosting, the words <i>WELCOME CASS</i> had been written. Struggling to maintain her composure, Cass took a big breath and blew out the three of them as her new cast of coworkers cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give everyone thirty minutes and then back to work.\u201d Jenna said as the applause died down, \u201cCass, hun, welcome to Gordge\u2014I think you've got a big future ahead of you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been an awfully long time since Cass Morgan had been able to go anywhere and not be\u2026 well, Cass Morgan. Her radio program may not have reached the largest population, over the years it had afforded her a certain level of local fame that had made it at least a little difficult for her to go out and just try to be a normal human being. Her face being one half of two on a billboard certainly hadn\u2019t helped matters in that regard\u2014but now that it had officially been painted over, that sort of acted as the definitive nail in her radiowave career, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d be hard-pressed to admit it, but there was a certain <i>appeal</i> to her new life as just regular old Cass Morgan\u2014one of many code monkeys, agents, and otherwise chair squashers at Gordge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Cassie!\u201d came the voice of her truest and oldest friend at Gordge, Alice Gellar, as she toddled towards her cubicle, \u201cI made a run by the snack machine\u2014brought you your <i>favorites</i>~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Cass took her eyes off of the screen she\u2019d been staring at for the better half of her morning, she was greeted with a package of powdered white donuts. She managed to catch them, with some struggle, as Alice finished her wobbling walk up to Cass\u2019s desk. Her own matching package in hand, her stubby but nimble fingers were already working the clear plastic wrapping open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Al\u2014but I <i>really</i> don\u2019t think I should.\u201d The brunette lowered the donuts onto the desk, her grip loosening slightly, \u201cI just got this suit like <i>two weeks ago</i> and it\u2019s already a little tight. I\u2019m gonna have to start cutting back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, we\u2019re <i>celebrating!</i>\u201d the three-hundred-plus pound woman was as giddy as a schoolgirl, already a donut deep into her five-snack pack, \u201cIt\u2019s your first week\u2014you\u2019re <i>gonna</i> be bombarded with snacks around here, so you might as well enjoy it while they\u2019re free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass grimaced a bit as she watched the outcome of that philosophy stand in front of her, rolling over the waistband of her circus tent skirt. Alice was a big girl, and it had never really been an issue before. Even back when Cass was much more <i>into</i> fitness and all that junk (a habit that she often chided herself about getting back into!), she\u2019d never given much thought about where all of Alice\u2019s extra fluff came from. But after less than a week of working at Gordge\u2026 it was pretty clear that her workspace had something to do with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, they <i>were</i> free. And if she said no, what was Alice going to do? Shoot them back up into the vending machine? She might as well enjoy herself a little\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey <i>were</i> celebrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell.\u201d Cass finally said with a shrug of her soft shoulders as she ripped into the packaging, \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you get a new job, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Alice giggled, \u201cOoh, that reminds me, some of the girls wanted to take you out to lunch\u2014do you wanna go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, yeah, sounds great.\u201d Cass bit into half of a powdered white donut, \u201cI could afford to not pay for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay cool, I\u2019ll let them know.\u201d The big blonde smiled excitedly as she began to walk away, her lips dusted with confectionary powder, before turning back, \u201cI know I\u2019ve told you this a lot, but\u2026 it\u2019s <i>so</i> great having you work here\u2014I mean, best friend talk, I know we don\u2019t like to talk about the past, but we\u2019ve listened to your show for <i>years</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass felt that bittersweet pang of former radio starlet status tickle the back of her throat. It wasn\u2019t exactly easy thinking of what had been\u2014and what she\u2019d thought she\u2019d always be\u2014as of just a few weeks ago. She hadn\u2019t even turned <i>on</i> the radio in her car coming to work, and hadn\u2019t for the past few days. That being said, when Alice and the other girls talked to her about it\u2026 it didn\u2019t always feel <i>bad</i>. Especially when she said things like\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re basically one of us already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as her best friend walked away, clicking and clacking on her overtaxed heels, Cass felt pretty good about her choice to come to Gordge. It had been hard at first, but only a week in and everyone had done such a good job of making her feel welcome. Maybe it would be a little much smushing lunch on top of what had turned into a big breakfast <i>and</i> a donut or two from the employee lounge (and now these little guys) but they had been putting in a lot of effort to keep her happy around here, and in just her first few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer diet could start next week\u2014after all, she had a lot to celebrate.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney and Melissa were two of Alice\u2019s friends who Cass had met once or twice before coming to work at the offices. They were big girls, like Alice. Rather, they were big<i>ger</i> girls than Alice, and built very differently. Melissa was all belly, and Courtney had the biggest set of T&amp;A that Cass had ever seen on anyone in person. Alice was somewhere in between, just kind of big all over, like a marshmallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t very important, except for the fact that it made it very difficult for them all to sit at the same table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had all agreed to eat out at some Mexican restaurant called Juan Gringo\u2019s. Apparently Friday was Extra-Long Lunch Day, which meant that they could afford to have a margarita or two at lunch (given the size of them, maybe even three) without being too tipsy to get back to work. It was something of a tradition for the three of them, give or take a guest, to frequent the Tex-Mex restaurant on these weekly occasions so that they could really get their grub on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Cass was one of those guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoof, you are lookin\u2019 <i>hot</i>.\u201d Melissa said with gusto as she took a gulp from her half-drunken martini, \u201cIs that a new suit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>May</i>be.\u201d Cass said in a playful, confident tone as she wriggled into the inside of the king-sized booth, \u201cI\u2019d like to think that I\u2019ve got a face that people would like to see on a billboard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say you do.\u201d Courtney chuckled thickly, her fat neck rings jiggling, \u201cThe rest of us would just have to settle for being the billboard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a good laugh between all four of them\u2014their fat bellies wobbling in deprecation of their own stupendous sizes. Such a meeting of massive women could only come from the Gordge offices, and everyone at Juan Gringo\u2019s could pick out the new hires as easy as uno-dos-tres. Granted, Cass had something of a head start over the likes of Christina and Victoria (not that they were exactly skinny anymore, these days) even if she <i>did</i> look sort of familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass was sandwiched in as Alice wriggled her way into the booth, filling more than her fair share of the poor overtaxed seat as she spilled over and onto the table. Her belly met in conference with Melissa and Courtney\u2019s\u2014both larger, both greedier guts\u2014as if they were privately discussing in gastrointestinal code what to make of Cass\u2019s starter gut. The round radio siren couldn\u2019t have looked more out of place with the three blimpy office fatties, though she would admit to coming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to eat?\u201d Courtney finally said as she opened the menu, \u201cThe usual?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe usual.\u201d Melissa nodded definitively, barely bothering with the menu and far more focused on wrapping her chubby finger around the martini glass, \u201cMaybe a little something extra though. Are you feeling dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could do dessert.\u201d Alice added without hesitation, \u201cCassie, you want some dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Cass pat her round tummy beneath her blouse, \u201cM\u2019on a diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass\u2019s news of diet and moderation was met with the usual fervor that one would expect from a bunch of overfed office fatties. Being the smallest member of the group, none of the three massive ladies saw any reason for Cass Morgan\u2014former radio star and barely at two hundred pounds to their three-plus\u2014to do something as silly as diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, why though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince when?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, like, look <i>so</i> good though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Cass took it all in stride\u2014it was nice to be complimented after feeling like shit about herself for so long, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but I\u2019ve really let myself go lately.\u201d She said with a derisive pat of her belly, \u201cYou might say it\u2019s been a LONG time since my last Mimosa and Yoga special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they all laughed\u2014despite having literally no inclination to participate in what had once been Cass\u2019s fitness-oriented special that happened every second Tuesday, they all caught the reference. It was a little strange for the three of them to put the name to the face. They had always\u2014Alice included\u2014Cass as this thin, athletic, toned woman who would never have sat down and had a meal with any of them. Marni had always been the favorite for her likability, after all. The woman sitting across from them wasn\u2019t Cass Morgan, the Morning Show Starlet though. She was just\u2026 <i>Cass</i>\u2014their new recruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if nothing else, Gordge Girls <i>knew</i> how to welcome new recruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiets are dumb and tacos are great.\u201d Courtney corrected her curvy coworker, \u201cI\u2019m very firmly in the camp of chalking this up to you trying to mingle with the cool kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, come on, it\u2019s just one dinner.\u201d Melissa snorted, fat chins bunching, \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Cass was still a little on the fence about it. But it was when Alice, her longtime buddy and the person who had helped her get this job, leaned in and gave her a tight little side hug (smushing her against her ample amounts of side-boob) and a little shoulder pat that Cass really started to get on board with the idea of just a little extra indulgence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re <i>celebrating</i>, remember?\u201d Alice offered in a helpful tone, \u201cNew job, new life\u2026 new Cass. Y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was that pause\u2014there\u2019s always the pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell.\u201d Cass said for the second time that day, \u201cYou guys are paying, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely, we got you girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen bring on the tacos.\u201d Cass took the margarita from the delivering waitress\u2019s hand and tipped it behind her head, \u201cAnd bring on the dessert!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was met with a chorus of cheers from the three fat women as she sat at attention in her seat at the booth. She wasn\u2019t getting out any time soon, and they were already bringing in the girls\u2019 lunch. A smorgasbord of meat and tortillas, cheese and sour cr\u00e8me, lettuce and tomato, with burritos and salsa, chips and queso\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her was worried, sure, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was <i>celebrating</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew job, new life... new Cass, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Let it be said here, if nowhere else, that Cass <i>did</i> at least <i>attempt</i> to maintain some semblance of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike a lot of their formerly fit employees (cough cough, Alice, cough cough, Courtney) Cass was not as easily swayed to the lazy lifestyle that Gordge offered its employees. The benefits were great and she liked the other girls but Cass was, deep down inside, still a fit girl at heart. She wasn\u2019t as inherently lazy as some of the other girls that had wandered (later waddled) through the doors, and wouldn\u2019t so easily succumb to every tempting treat that crossed her path. Just because she wasn\u2019t on the radio anymore didn\u2019t mean that she was keen on blowing up into a balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, diets were fucking hard enough already without working at Gordge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was practically built around food in these stupid offices, from the morning meetings to the casual conversations between employees, to how you traded for favors. In her first week alone, Cass had wound up with more apple pies, coffee cakes, and donut packages than she thought she\u2019d ever eat, and it was all so that Christina could have the third off on short notice\u2014Cass was a little hard up for money, given her recent termination at the station, and she wasn\u2019t exactly keen on saying no. But these snacks\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you <i>so</i> much, Ms. Morgan.\u201d Christina folded her hands in front of her, \u201cI <i>really</i> appreciate you doing this for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*munch munch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s no problem.\u201d Cass brushed the apple pie crust from her lips, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to bribe me <i>after</i> I already said yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I just <i>really</i> wanted to show you how much I appreciate it.\u201d She offered a genuine smile, \u201cAlice said that you liked these so I figured, you know, you did me a favor\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if giving her all these snacks were a favor. All Cass seemed to do at her desk was eat\u2014crunch numbers, type on her keyboard, and eat. At least at the station she could get up a little between commercial breaks. She\u2019d barely left her office chair since this morning. Lunch was just around the corner, and Alice and the girls wanted to go out again, and she barely felt like she\u2019d have any room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it <i>was</i> Fish Camp Tuesday\u2014and Cass had learned to <i>live</i> for that shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate it, but next time just slip me a twenty or something.\u201d Cass laughed, her belly bobbing a bit underneath her blouse, \u201cI don\u2019t need all the extra calories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny intern smiled approvingly, appreciatively, and dipped out back to running whatever errand that Courtney currently had her working on. They worked the hound out of that poor woman, but it made Cass all the more appreciative that she\u2019d been hired on full-time right from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that gophering, going from place to place looked <i>exhausting</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, like, this is what <i>I</i> use to get past the firewall.\u201d Victoria said in a bored tone of voice as she shifted on her meaty ass in Cass\u2019s chair, \u201cIt\u2019s not the best program, but it\u2019ll like let you get on Facebook and shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass had never been very tech-y. Personally, she\u2019d never expected Victoria to be very tech-y either, given her thousand-yard stare and inability to answer even a simple phone call. But that wide-rumped Italian woman had been very helpful in finding a way to make Cass\u2019s workspace more accessible\u2014it was a crime that she wasn\u2019t given access to the entire internet at a place where she had to spend <i>most</i> of her time. Normally she\u2019d use her phone but this place had shitty signal and the wi-fi was subject to the same rules as the terminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Victoria\u2019s big round ass squished into her office chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, Vicky.\u201d Cass said, standing awkwardly in a place that she\u2019d gotten very accustomed to sitting in, \u201cI really appreciate this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever\u2014I did you a favor, right?\u201d Vicky swiveled, her round belly pouring onto her lap as she turned to face Cass with a bored expression on her face, \u201cDo you think you could, like, put in a good word with Jenna and get her to spring for some extra donuts around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026 there are already a lot of donuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe always run out because Melissa and Courtney are fucking pigs\u2014and I know that\u2019s not HR friendly or whatever, but I\u2019m pretty triggered.\u201d Vicky said with a dangerous, venomous roll of her brown bovine eyes, \u201cJenna\u2019s, like, in love with you because you were on some dumb radio show or whatever? She\u2019ll take whatever you say pretty seriously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a part of Cass\u2014the part of her that still wasn\u2019t over not being a local celebrity anymore\u2014felt a little touched by the insinuation (accusation?) that because of her status, Cass could convince anyone to do anything. Let alone her boss. Even if she\u2019d eaten enough donuts in the past few days to fill a bakery, the thought alone was\u2026 well, it was something that she wasn\u2019t sure that she\u2019d ever feel again as far as her own lingering fame was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can manage that.\u201d Cass said confidently, her arms crossed over her full chest as the fabric in the back of her blazer stretched taut, \u201cI\u2019ll put a good word in for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Victoria rolled her eyes and, awkwardly, tossed an apple pie on the desk, \u201cThis is for you. Just, like\u2026 thanks. Or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the stupid plugs that she\u2019d had to do in her years of radio, she\u2019d never once been to Dumpo\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this horrible, hole-in-the-wall sandwich shop that only someone as brash and (frankly) kind of trashy as Melissa would frequent. And normally she wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead in a place like this (especially during her Yoga guru days) but Cass hadn\u2019t regretted her decision since she\u2019d first bit into her hoagie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GOD</i> this was a good sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get you fat.\u201d Melissa chuckled thickly, encompassing literally the entirety of the other side of the booth, \u201cI know all the best places\u2014Dumpo\u2019s, Italiano\u2019s, the pizza place up on main. Jesus Christ Cass, you don\u2019t even fucking <i>know</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meat was so greasy. It practically dripped off of her chin. And the thought of something like that was, inherently, disgusting. That pale yellow shit rolling down from her chin\u2014the Old Cass would have never been caught dead in a place like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was beginning to see the appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so, I\u2019m on a diet\u2014\u201d Cass said as a more of a formality than a disclaimer, \u201c\u2014but I think once a week, maybe twice\u2026 that wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh.\u201d Melissa snorted, her flat nostrils curling at the idea of moderation, \u201cSuit yourself, Radio Star, but I probably park my fat ass here at least every other day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa\u2019s great gut gurgled in agreement of the larger opinion. If it was possible, she looked to have grown even larger since Cass had started. No one in the Gordge Offices was exactly Jenny Craig-ing, but Melissa was the most adamant about her eating habits. If anything, the woman was on an anti-diet\u2014a regiment that Cass found awfully hard to pass up on the occasions that Melissa invited her out for lunch, or dinner after work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see why.\u201d Cass practically moaned as she took another big bite, \u201cThis is <i>great</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I used to think that Marni was the fun one on KISS 102.5.\u201d Mel smacked her greasy lips, \u201cBut I\u2019ve gotta say, I\u2019m comin\u2019 around to the new Cass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as silly as it might have sounded, Cass could only shrink into her shoulders and smile. It was so nice to hear that she was beginning to grow on people. Even if she was growing a little outwards in the process. Her skirt was getting tighter by the day, and this morning she\u2019d popped a button on her blouse\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna grab some ice cream?\u201d Melissa asked after a truly heroic bite of sandwich, \u201cI know a great place downtown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026\u201d Cass grimaced, stifling a greasy burp that squeaked out of her packed-tight stomach, \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, let it be said (if nowhere else but here) that Cass made an <i>attempt</i> at dieting. But it was hard. Harder than she was prepared for it to be\u2014without the funds provided by her cushy radio job, she was suddenly out of a gym membership, out of the means to afford her pricy fitness foods, and saddled with a whole community of women who seemed to equate friendship with food. Already having securely fallen off of the fitness wagon, Cass could only do her best not to see the writing on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnacks, plus friends, plus big meals, minus exercise, plus even <i>more</i> to eat throughout the day\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the important part was that she was having fun, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the bloated beauties waddled out of the buffet, and Marni waved a goodbye, with a loud yell \"See ya at the singles bar saturday!\" Cass replied, \"You too!\" With the gluttonous glob that was Marni gone, Cass turned to Alice. \"Alice, I just wanna say, I'm proud that you're eating better.\" Alice nodded. \"Well, you know, I kinda got tired of being this big.\" Cass spoke. \"Y'know, I miss my old routine and I was wondering, wanna hit up the gym with me?\" Alice replied, \"Hells yeah! Let's go, I was actually planning to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the obese blonde squeezed her way into Cass' passenger seat, Cass slid into the driver's seat. As alice struggled with the seatbelt, having to stretch hit out to about as far as it would go to be able to barely force it into the buckle, Cass noticed her paunch as she slid the keys into the ignition and pulled it. Though she was not nearly as fat as Marni, let alone Alice, she was considerably larger. She had grown a paunch that added about 6 inches to her formerly waifish 25 inches, giving her a rather large 31 inch waist. Her bust had booned from this, however, also growing to 39 inches from her old 36. Her booty had gained the least out of them, at a 2 inch growth from 35 to 37. With the ignition lit and the two fat females prepared, Cass pulled out of the park, and drove to Jim's Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim's was a rather squat 2 story building, built wide to fit every inch of the lot space. The windows were wide and spacious, but tinted to block vision inside. Alice popped open the buckle, the seatbelt reeling back and seemingly sighing in relief, and Cass unlocked the doors, popped out, and grabbed her Gym bag, as did Alice. The plus-sized ladies approached the receptionist, who was a bright blonde, whom they could tell had dyed her hair, who was a little larger around the middle than they expected, just a little short from Cass' size. \"Hey! Can I help you two?\" \"Yeah,\" said Cass, \"We'd like to buy a membership.\" The receptionist, whose name was given away from her tag as being 'Samantha', replied. \"Alright! How many months?\" Cass, emboldened by her recent earnings, said \"5 months, I'll cover both.\" After a swipe of a debit card, and a bit of shuffling behind the counter, the chubby blonde handed them a dark-blue card, with the red words 'JIM'S GYM' and a lighter blue phoenix in the background.  \"All right! You're good to go!\" spoke the chubby blonde, who promptly sat back down, and after checking for anyone else, returned to dutiously scarfing down a Snicker's before the Management could see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two blubbery maidens waddled over to the Cardio machines, where awaited an assortment of machines: Stationary cycles, both of a normal type and a flywheel type (The kind used in Spin classes,) as well as Stairsteppers, Treadmills, Ellipticals, stretching machines, and, surrounding it all, a track.  Across the track lay the weightlifter's realm, with a variety of free-weight machines: Arms, Legs, Bench, Squat racks, and an area with a horridly cracked floor and a free-weight rack that stretched up for what seemed like miles. Any experienced lifter would know that as the Deadlift area. On the upper floors there was, at first, a lounge filled with healthy vending machines, and beyond that, fitness classrooms, for everything from Yoga, to Zumba, to Spin, to Jazz and Tap dancing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start off their routine, Alice and Cass began on the Treadmills. Not eager to do any running after the massive splurge both ladies had just eaten, they simply walked at 3 mph at a steep incline. Doing a solid 30 minutes, they took a break afterwards and watched the Television at the Juice Bar, where they drank from their capacious water bottles. Beside them were a row of buff bodybuilders, all talking about their latest lifts and their troubles in life. There was a fourth man, not partaking in the conversation. At first, to Cass, it seemed like hew as simply staring off into space. Then, she realized that the angle of his eyes was more or less pointed at her and Alice. Cass, without directly looking at the guy, nudged Alice, whispering to her. \"Watch this.\" She then turned her head slowly and at a deliberate pace towards the man, paused for a moment until the buff black-haired man's eyes fixed on her. Then, she pulled the Coup de Grace: A deadly, well placed wink in his direction, before she retracted her head. Alice couldn't help but look on in awe at this master of seduction, as the black-haired man's jaw practically hung open. \"Damn, you gotta teach me how to do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the bout of flirting and rehydration at the Bar, the two ladies, still a little winded from the walking, shifted to the Elliptical machines. Alice was not as confident in her abilities, so she kept the resistance low. However, Cass, after managing to survive 30 minutes steep walking on a treadmill, was rather more cocky, as she cranked resistance up to 15. She rapidly regretted her decision after about a minute, and withdrew her cockiness. Alice giggled a bit through her panting. The two managed to go for about 15 minutes more, until they decided to try the daunting Stairmasters. After a bit of rehydration, they daringly assaulted the Stairmasters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairmasters hit back: After only 5 minutes, the two were forced to withdraw. Feeling sore but satisfied, the two ladies passed the receptionist Samantha, who now scarfed down a bag of chips away from the gaze of her Supervisor. After this initial bout of exercise, one of the ladies decided they couldn't handle it...</span></div></div>",
