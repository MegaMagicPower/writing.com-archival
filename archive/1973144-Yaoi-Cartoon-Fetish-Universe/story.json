            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One day Jake was keeping the magical world as separate as possible from the human world, in this case with an artifact. The artifact in question was an oil lamp that acted like an actual genie\u2019s lamp. It was called the Lamp of Leprada, a dead wizard who attempted to use the Lamp as a trap &amp; binding agent for capturing other magical creatures inside, torturing them to coerce cooperation with the wielder, and force them to grant his desires. The Lamp of Leprada was about to trade hands with a shady pawnshop, who most likely knows nothing about its true power. Jake\u2019s mission was to retrieve the lamp before any wishes were made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment Jake flying invisibly to the naked eye (a new trick that is part of his shapeshifting abilities which he has now fully unlocked) prepared to sneak into the shop and retrieve, pardon liberate the goods that weren\u2019t supposed to be there in the first place. At this point in Jake\u2019s life he was 17-years-old &amp; a junior in high school. Jake was feeling both exhausted &amp; hungry from all of his latest missions to protect the magical community of New York. Jake was beginning to feel the pressure &amp; was bound to crack at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust last week, he had to organize the annual festival between the pixies living in the toy factory (they helped make toys resembling themselves for children), &amp; the brownies in the bakery (they loved sneaking crumbs &amp; pastry ingredients out, especially brownies for obvious reasons). They were two different types of Fair Folk living in New York that were so similar in some respects, yet so different in others. The week before that, the centaur clans in the underground markets needed help building a new tunnel to gallop through, so as not to arouse suspicion from humans with their activities, or interfere with the goblins and trolls operations who shared similar tunnel networks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&amp; the week before that Eli Excelsior Pandarus had struck a deal with several dark sorcerers to form a coven to take over the world by sacrificing powerful families of magical species. Pandarus\u2019s plan was built up years in advance since his previous defeat by Jake &amp; Spud. Pandarus\u2019s recent plan required him to sacrifice a mother, father, &amp; only child of a powerful family per magical creature species (all species are included), at the same time with their darkest magic being the catalyst that would spark their newfound amplified transcendent wizardry; but I digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had been pushed to the near physical breaking point through all the accumulated disasters &amp; machinations, leaving him with a lot of all-nighters, frequent social outings missed, &amp; homework that needed to be finished unless he wants to repeat a grade like Brad Morton did. Jake was especially mad because Brad Morton was still in the same school as him, granted he was only allowed to continue his education &amp; bullying due to his football jock status. Brad was even more relentless than he was in middle school. Throughout all of his trials &amp; tribulations, Jake was beginning to wish he had never been the American Dragon, so he could enjoy life more as an ordinary teenager, or at least get some reprieve until he graduated high school. A wish he would soon have the chance to grant himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake broke in undetected, he found the Lamp of Leprada inside of a vault in the back of the shop. Jake reminisced what was the last nail in the coffin for his choice, the day he &amp; Rose broke up about a year ago as they both felt they \u201cneeded to see other people\u201d to branch their horizons as they grew apart. Jake realized he had a chance to grant his wish, so after grabbing the lamp, he went to his secret place to make his wish away from prying eyes &amp; ears, even those of his family &amp; friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it is goes.\u201d Jake made a deal with the last souls inside of the Lamp of Leprada that he would take the lamp with him to free their tormented bodies &amp; souls from the lamp after granting final wish, his of course. \u201cI wish I had never been the American Dragon\u201d. Then after the lamp began to vibrate &amp; heat up, a magical fire came out &amp; swallowed the world as Jake felt hotter than he\u2019d ever been in his life thinking maybe this was the wrong relic as he saw the light. Not realizing this was just a part of his wish getting granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Jake\u2019s wish get granted? One: to make sure Jake had never been the American Dragon, his parents never met &amp; gave birth to him, but he still exists as an orphan adopted by a wealthy family, despite the paradox thus meaning he had. \u201cNEVER BEEN the American Dragon\u201d. This means he has no magical heritage or responsibilities; he is gay, &amp; wants to be fattened into immobility; with a new circle of friends to help him accomplish his goals; &amp; his friends &amp; family as well as the people who knew him wouldn\u2019t recognize him at all as he had never met them in this timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo: Jake\u2019s parents never met &amp; Jake just doesn\u2019t exist period, instead being sent to a limbo dimension where unborn souls of stillbirths as well as those who have been erased via time travel paradoxes, live out their fantasies in a new reality they can never leave to prevent more paradoxes from destroying all of the time-space continuum. In this reality Jake made himself the halfling child of a wizard on his dad\u2019s side, &amp; his mom was a human. Jake is powerful enough to make himself fatter &amp; beloved at the cost of regular human\u2019s free-will. This includes his posse of new \u201cfriends\u201d &amp; \u201cfeeders\u201d who keep him company &amp; fed without realizing they have no other choice, as Jake\u2019s parents are important people who practically run the New York criminal underbelly without alerting the Magical World of their activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree: Jake is sent granted this wish by being put into a perpetual dream state through the power of a family baku who existed inside the lamp. The Baku is an immortal, shapeshifting entity capable of eating dreams of other sentient beings (in particular humas) by granting them their greatest desires to keep them trapped for psychic sustenance similar to the Black Mercy from DC comics. While this is happening, the family of Baku Jake releases from lamp gets stronger &amp; begin to trap New York City into a perpetual nightmare, with Jake\u2019s friends trying desperately to wake him from his slumber. In this dream, Jake is born a human who lives a spoiled rotten life by his new rich parents, who keep him happy by having him homeschooled. Jake also has a harem of muscle boys to have bara sex with who dote on his every need. So how does Jake\u2019s wish get granted? Option 1, Option 2, Option 3. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was time for another awesome summer vacation with Grandpa Max &amp; my lame cousin Gwen. All I wanted was to make some new friends since I've never made one before. It might have been because of my weight. I'm around 150 &amp; really out of shape, so I use crutches to get around. Gwen often chastises me for my gluttony &amp; girth, but I don't think I look unattractive, in fact it makes me feel empowered &amp; handsome for my age. Still, I wish other people could get to know the real me &amp; we could hang out &amp; whatnot, but I'm always a laughing stock for my obesity, coupled with my short size made me look like a squished gumdrop. But I digress...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI was picked up from school with Gwen &amp; went to our first stop on our road trip, a camping trip at a nearby site. I went on my own to try &amp; exercise per orders of Gwen, just to get her out of my face. I hobbled along when I nearly tripped &amp; as I was getting up, I saw a meteorite about to crash into me. \"AAAuuugghh!\" I screamed. Then the meteorite stopped in place &amp; fell down quickly with enough momentum to make me lose my balance. I fell backwards &amp; saw that it wasn't a small meteorite, but a black orb of metal &amp; circuits, like something out of an alien movie. It opened up to reveal this weird bit of armor with a digital screen like a computer, no, a wrist watch. I was  captivated by the alien watch, so I touched it &amp; the watch wrapped around me &amp; as it vibrated &amp; glowed, I felt an unusual drowsiness fall under my eyes &amp; I plopped asleep on the spot, while I felt it well, I guess the best word to use would be that it bound itself to my swollen wrist without cutting off circulation.<br>\r\nAs I slept &amp; started to dream, I heard a voice calling out to me. \"Ben. Bennn. Bennnnn... Wake up.\u201d As I awoke, I opened my heavy eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Then I stirred when I realized I was floating in what could only be described as a Zero-G dimension, I certainly wasn\u2019t on earth anymore. Then I wiped some sweat off of my forehead &amp; saw the alien watch from earlier. \u201cWhoa! Why\u2019s that weird alien watch on my arm??\u201d Then I tugged at it but felt a shock go through me, \u201cOkay, better question, why is the watch stuck to my arm???\u201d Then the watch stretched around me like a liquid blanket of metal under my clothes, till I was naked. \u201cHey!!\u201d I said bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm yourself Benjamin Kirby Tennyson. I am here to help you unlock your dreams.\u201d the voice called out to me, closer than before. That\u2019s when I realized that it wasn\u2019t just coming from anywhere, it was right on me, it came from the alien watch. \u201cYes I am an alien human lifeform. Now, you are probably wondering, why is this alien watch talking to me? Or how is it talking to me? Or where I came from? Well I will answer all your questions if you let me bond to your nervous system, or in human anatomy, your brain. I will always be there to protect you &amp; help you accomplish your desires... So are you ready to be bigger, befriended, &amp; bully-free?\u201d Wow, this was so cool, I had an alien watch at my disposal &amp; now I could probably do whatever I wanted. \u201cWatch bond with me &amp; grant me my desires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Beginning genetic bonding of omnitrix to organic vessel. What is your designation?\u201d The Omnitrix, as it was called asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen Tennyson!!! or Ben 10 for short.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, then where shall I be placed on your body for manual mode?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, can you explain that a bit more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly. It means that if you or someone you trust needs to activate the omnitrix manually should your neurosystems become compromised, this will need to be an easy to access part of your external body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case, I choose to wear you as an unremovable headband so I can control you with my thoughts. Next question\u2026 How are you powered &amp; what do you do to grant my desires?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am powered, by a sub-nuclear nearly limitless bio-energy that self recharges. &amp; as for what I do, I do many functions, G.P.S., telecommunications, genetic modifications by infusing alien DNA via a complex bio-energy system, telepathy, &amp; technological manipulation. Next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Why am I naked?\" I asked trying desperately to hold onto the rags that are my clothes to spare my dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You technically aren't naked, you are being covered by a non-stick, breathable, flexible, &amp; disguisable gel clothes for now so I can grant your desires. So now it\u2019s my turn to ask you the questions\u2026 What do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to be so freakin\u2019 fat, that I can\u2019t move a single external muscle without you to move it for me so I can do anything, communicating, eating, sleeping, bathing, &amp; playing. I want to find like-minded friends my age who would love to be with me just for me so I can one day share that power with them &amp; make their desires come true. &amp; I want to make sure that NO ONE, tries to hurt me, my friends, my family, or spoil my wishes &amp; fun-filled desires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do the first two, but the third one will be tricky without time &amp; I need to make direct &amp; prolonged contact with your friends &amp; family's skin to do so. So ready to gain weight???\" I was so giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course omnitrix. Hit me. Oh, &amp; alow gain over the summer &amp; isolate Gwen &amp; Grandpa Max so you can 'change' their perspectives about my bigness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, master.\" Master, I liked where this was going... I awoke with a start inside the Rust Bucket. I started to feel extremely, hungry, like I could eat a dozen boulders &amp; an entire forest of plant life just to sate my appetite. My body became slightly stronger &amp; slightly faster, then I opened my mouth &amp;...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I felt my innards feel contorted &amp; fused together into a single organ. Then I knew what to do, I opened my mouth &amp; these tentaculous tongues came out &amp; grabbed nearby plant matter &amp; dirt, which I then consumed liking the taste. I swallowed &amp; felt it compress &amp; digest, I did this in a blinding hunger state till I cleared out at least a dozen trees &amp; 70 cubic feet of soil in the same place. \u201cOh that feels good, now what Omnitrix?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I must revert you to your original state, though the food will be processed into pure caloric energy &amp; instantly assimilated as fat while your clothes &amp; crutches grow with you. As for how to explain this to your escorts, I sent a subtle psionic call to them to find you, so sit down pretending to be near collapse from exhaustion &amp; they will carry you back to the \u2018Rust Bucket\u2019. While they are carrying you, you must drape your arms &amp; hands around their heads making skin-to-skin or skin-to-hair contact. Then focus on what you want them to think about your changes &amp; each time you do it, it will slowly rewrite their minds so that you will have an accepting family.\u201d the Omnitrix explained monotonously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I glowed &amp; turned back into a human, I saw my body grow even wider &amp; fatter &amp; than before, I was already 150 lb. with a 20 in. waist, now I must be at least 275 lb., with a 30 in. waist, plus a bigger gut, plushier moobs, &amp; a rounder butt. I was exhausted but I knew this was just the beginning of my girth, I mean growth. So squatted down noticing I appeared fully clothed, minus my sack-like arms which were exposed for my wish to come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen! Ben!! Bennnn!!!!\u201d Gwen shouted then she saw me &amp; looked shocked. \u201cBen, Ben, are you okay???\u201d She asked with genuine kindness &amp; concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not, I feel like I can\u2019t stay standing.\u201d I panted, then I faked a fall on my butter butt, &amp; Grandpa Max tried to lift me up around his neck,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy Ben, we\u2019ll get you back to camp.\u201d Grandpa Max reassured me, not that it was needed. \u201cGwen since this long exercise excursion was your idea,\u201d Grandpa Max said almost harshly. I kind of felt sorry for Gwen when I saw the look on her face, sure she\u2019s a doofus, but Grandpa didn\u2019t have to be so cold. \u201cI suggest you take off Ben\u2019s clothes &amp; we help him cool off once we get back to the Rust Bucket\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!?!?!?!?\u201d Gwen\u2019s reaction was priceless, but I concealed my feelings well enough. \u201cBut Grandpa, I know I wish Ben wasn\u2019t in such a bad state, but I can\u2019t undress my own cousin, that would be, well weird\u2026 &amp; besides Ben\u2019s too heavy to undress.\u201d Gwen protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts, I think we really need to reconsider if this is what Ben wants in life. So help me carry him back.\u201d Grandpa Max responded adamantly. I knew the Omnitrix was doing its job well enough, but I had to keep on focusing on the ideals I wanted my family to be. Grandpa Max, being a chunky sort of person, was well in empathy of my plight, despite only being obese when he became a senior citizen, but he was always supporting of me, so he would be easy to convert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Gwen replied in defeat. \u201cReady to stand Ben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Okay, help me up &amp; I\u2019ll try to waddle the rest of the way. Oh &amp; Gwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I put my arm around your head, so I have something strong to support me?\u201d Gwen was even more baffled, but she silently conceded by letting me put my oil pipe sized arm around her head. I focused on both tasks at hand; waddling back to camp, &amp; rewriting the feelings Gwen has for me, using subtle empathy with my feelings being dominant. I wanted someone who could completely be a helpful &amp; supporting family member. With each step I waddled, I felt closer to my goal of earning Gwen\u2019s understanding, but telepathically, the Omnitrix told me otherwise, it turns out it\u2019s true that when you exercise you can repeat information faster in your head. Repeating the information in my head will help the process along &amp; luckily I took a long walk out of camp before finding the Omnitrix, so I made a lot of progress...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After returning to the R.V. I slept like a baby for the first time in months not thinking about how I could lose weight. Now I could focus on my weight gain &amp; making new friends. My first new friend was an older kid named Kevin, we found him pickpocketing us off of the streets of New York City, &amp; boy was he in bad shape. He was deathly pale, raggedy gothic clothes, only a little bit taller than me, but cadaverously skinny, with little to no muscle tone, &amp; he seemed almost desperate, behind a cynical mask of rage. I knew I could help him, part of me just clicked knowing I'd be doing something good by helping this poor soul find happiness. Grandpa Max apprehended him &amp; we were brought into the police station to question him. It turned out that Kevin ran away from his mom's house after having a falling-out with his step-dad. He accidentally caused the house to blow up &amp; his step-dad blamed him for it, in a moment of sadness &amp; grief thinking his mother didn't want him anymore, Kevin stole a few jewels, money, &amp; a knife from his step-dad, &amp; left on the lamb. After we were questioned, we were asked if we were to press charges, I convinced grandpa to decline if we were to help rehabilitate him. We had him taken by handcuff to the Rust Bucket, where a tracer was placed on him, &amp; when the police left, Grandpa told us some shocking information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ben, Gwen, there's something I need to tell you. I'm not just your average plumber, I'm actually an agent for a secret protection organization known as the Plumbers for earth &amp; other planets out there.\" Grandpa shocked us all, even Kevin, when he showed us the cool technical details of the Rust Bucket that was well hidden. It was like looking at something from a science-fiction movie, but it was all real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a Cerebrocrustacean hospital bed, with all the latest features Mr. Tennyson\" Kevin asked with certainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, how did you know that was alien technology? &amp; what\u2019s a Cerebrocrustacean?\u201d Gwen asked baffled for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Cerebrocurstacean is a crab-based alien race that is usually full of intellectual minds &amp; sharpened electrical energy powers. &amp; I know this because my dad was a plumber too, &amp; now that I mention it, he always mentioned someone named Magister Tennyson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally Kevin\u2026\u201d Grandpa Max pondered while scratching his chin. \u201cWhat was your dad\u2019s name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it was Devin Levin\u2026\u201d Kevin responded shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you look so familiar!!! Devin was my Osmosian apprentice before he di\u2026 I mean perished during that mission\u201d Grandpa Max responded solemly. Kevin looked surprised, he didn\u2019t know this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo um Mr. Tennyson\u2026 What do you mean my dad perished during \u2018THAT MISSION\u2019?\u201d My mom told me he was dead in a lab accident he was trying to evacuate.\u201d Kevin quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa Max looked nervous, \u201cHuh, well Kevin I don\u2019t think any of you are ready yet to know because it is very disturbing how he died. Besides we\u2019re running late to reach Mt. Rushmore. There I have some Plumber Tech for helping Ben get around without exerting himself too much\u2026 I\u2019ll leave you three in the back to enjoy the ride &amp; have some snacks.\u201d Grandpa Max responded &amp; left us with at least a two dozen jumbo-sized bags of chips &amp; cookies. Things went kind of silently awkward for a while now so I decided to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Kevin, your dad is an Osmosian, right Kevin?\u201d I asked &amp; he nodded yes. \u201cSo do they have any unusual powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, besides absorbing energy, I\u2019ve heard they can manipulate most inorganic matter through direct contact (flesh-on-flesh) &amp; they can manipulate the hormones of humans &amp; other organic species. It\u2019s incredible but it has a dark side, one I know from experience &amp; I\u2019m kind of scared to use it again\u2026\u201d Kevin responded scared &amp; sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the dark side Osmosian powers, &amp; why would you know from experience. IT\u2019s not like you\u2019ve deliberately used these powers to hurt other beings right???\u201d I asked jokingly. But Kevin didn\u2019t take that too well &amp; just frowned even sadder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see different kind of Osmosians can absorb different forms of energy: thermal, electric, psionic, nuclear, heck even life-force energy. In cases with energy from machines &amp; natural occurrences, I can loose control &amp; hurt people by amplifying it with my own life force &amp; hurt people, the more joules it has, or energy units, the more dangerous.\u201d Kevin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that\u2019s bad.\u201d I responded grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt get\u2019s even worse. When I absorb different forms of energy from a living organic being like life-force energy\u2026 I can\u2019t control how much or how quickly it drains. The benefit allows me to absorb a weaker (about 30%) but still substantial version of their powers, bu the cost is I could literally kill them or damage their very essence whether it be genetics or energy frequencies in the case of pure-energy beings. I almost blew up my mom &amp; step-dad\u2019s house &amp; got close to killing several people, aliens, and assorted small animals to keep me alive while I was on the run. It, it, it was horrible!!!\u201d Kevin panted close to tears. \u201cI could hear the voices of every being I\u2019ve ever absorbed energy from.\u201d I must\u2019ve gasped at this because Kevin looked at me with an even more pained expression on his face than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t control it, people thought i was a freak, so i became a monster &amp; tried to hurt people when I pick-pocketed them or worked with gang activity in New York city. I don\u2019t know if my mom could ever forgive me for what I\u2019ve done, I don\u2019t know why you &amp; your family seem to be so forgiving, especially knowing all I\u2019ve done.\u201d Kevin finally burst into tears there &amp; then, &amp; though I was mostly immobile &amp; Gwen didn\u2019t know him, Kevin just need a hug &amp; a shoulder to cry on. I thought my life was bad, but looking at Kevin\u2019s puts everything into perspective. I had a decent life, but Kevin &amp; his kind, the homeless, the orphans, &amp; the forsaken of not just Earth, but every world deserve a second chance, &amp; at a better life. I knew now what I could do with my Omnitrix, but first. I tried to use my minuscule strength to get up &amp; hug Kevin. Gwen saw my struggles &amp; gently pushed Kevin into my warm, soft moobs, I mean chest. As Kevin sobbed, he looked up at me with a warm, wonderful smile on his face, &amp; wiped his tears away, then he\u2026</span></div></div>",

It was okay at first, a little cold, but as it got uncomfortable, I started noticing my fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen you okay, you don\u2019t look so good. &amp; you know you shouldn\u2019t be standing for so long, even if it is for a hug.\u201d Gwen pointed out tactfully. That\u2019s when I noticed I was sweating from every pore in my body, close to panting in my breathing rate, &amp; about to collapse on my knees from fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I felt the Omnitrix speak inside my brain &amp; it spoke to me. \u201cBen 10, it seems that the Osmosian physiology of your older companion is accidentally sucking not just metabolic &amp; caloric energy, but life-force energy from your system. If this continues you could suffer severe damage. Suggested tactic, allow me to protect you by creating a breathable, but protective forcefield around you, so that every time the Osmosian tries to touch you, he won\u2019t absorb energy from you, but rather from my near-limitless supply of energy. Awaiting orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it, but make sure nothing happens to Kevin\u2019s body or mind, at least nothing that is permanent.\u201d I responded in though within 30 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Activating forcefield.\u201d Then I felt a pulse of energy surround me &amp; shock Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaauuugh!\u201d Kevin shouted as if he were shocked by a massive bolt of static electricity. The Omnitrix surrounded me with a green spherical barrier, much to Gwen\u2019s surprise. Kevin was knocked back, slightly charred on his fingertips, &amp; somewhat shocked, but still he was somehow fine which was a relief to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeee-vvvin!!!\u201d I shouted exhausted, as I was also regaining my balance &amp; catching my breath while landing on my butter butt. \u201cI-I-I-I\u2019m so sorry Kevin, I-I-I-I d-d-d-d-didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on back there?!?!\u201d Grandpa Max burst in through the curtains of our living spaces (after he left of course during our previous conversation) &amp; looked at all three of us in surprise and shock. \u201cGwen, answers, NOW?!?!?!?\u201d Grandpa Max exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen. Hugs Kevin. Energy Feedback. Forcefield. Singed Kevin\u201d Gwen tried to explain calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?!?!? Ben where did this forcefield come from, &amp; why is it helping you now?\u201d Grandpa Max asked quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay but let me catch my breath, since I\u2019m a little winded from the experience myself.\u201d I gasped then after a minute or two my system was regulating itself normally. \u201cWell I guess the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I found this strange looking watch from a meteor in the woods. So I cleaned it up it sort of well bonded itself to me. Next thing I knew I\u2019m awake, naked, &amp; it was turning into a protective device for my forehead, &amp; then (wait for it), it spoke to me, INSIDE my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!??!?!\u201d everyone looked at me like I was from another planet. Anyway I continued to explain recent events at our first campsite, &amp; all my dreams in all honesty. &amp; for the first time ever, I felt like I belonged with my family &amp; Kevin figured out that even though he\u2019s given up on bad behavior, his powers must still be active &amp; it must have been slowly draining me of my energy during that long hug. Any longer &amp; it would have killed me, but the Omnitrix intervened &amp; shocked Kevin with energy he can\u2019t absorb to push him away while protecting me with a barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow this is incredible!!!\u201d Gwen responded, \u201cYou could change the world Ben\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in all, as interesting as it may be, I hope you take this power responsibly.\u201d Grandpa Max commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I wouldn\u2019t dream of it, as long as I have my supporting family &amp; my friends like Kevin. Well we\u2019ll change the world without hurting anyone. Isn\u2019t that right Kevin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Well of course Benji. You\u2019re my buddy for life &amp; you standing up for me means a lot.\u201d Kevin replied with zeal &amp; admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat because meeting you has changed my whole perspective on my life &amp; the lives others must have. I thought I should use this power to help me in my dreams so long as they don\u2019t infringe negative effects upon others civilians or innocent beings. But after meeting you Kevin &amp; hearing your story, I realize I have to branch out &amp; share t'my power with others who need it &amp; deserve the right to use it to help others &amp; themselves. That\u2019s my new goal, Expanding the World\u2019s Freedom &amp; Compassion, one pound at a time. &amp; you guys are gonna be in it to help me out in the long haul\u201d I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Ben, I wouldn\u2019t dream of it any other way. I just hope Carl &amp; Sandra are okay with this.\u201d Grandpa Max responded with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry we\u2019ll figure it out sooner or later. But in the meantime, let\u2019s enjoy the summer vacation.\u201d I responded by tapping Kevin on his shoulder. This was gonna be great, that\u2019s when I noticed something happening to Kevin. He was transforming into an alien just like my forms. Must\u2019ve been the side-effect the Omnitrix was talking about. What alien is he turning into???</span></div></div>",

It feels like just yesterday I was enjoying the life of the circus, performing around the world, bedazzling audiences in awe of our amazing acrobatics, &amp; having a family. Bruce took me in, &amp; though he can never replace my parents, he really gives me comfort  &amp; understanding. Bruce thought it be best I try to mingle &amp; mainstream myself instead of being cooped up here in the mansion or the Batcave, that\u2019s right, Batcave, my adopted father is the freakin\u2019 Batman. He avenged my parents &amp; saved me from the orphanages &amp; social workers, he is &amp; always will be my hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough about me though, I was going to enter Gotham Academy with my butler Alfred taking me to the main office &amp; exchanging paperwork &amp; greeting the school officials. I thought this would be a hard day, I was wrong, it was a horrible day. I was instantly tripped up &amp; outed as a nerd by the boys, &amp; a potential hottie for the girls. I was known as Dick the Nerd for my clean-cut look, heavy backpack filled with books &amp; a laptop, &amp; my scrawny physique. This wasn\u2019t a bad school, or even a sporty school, but even the nerds had a higher social status than me, though I figured it would only get worse when the other kids arrived from Central City &amp; Happy Harbor. Then my day just started to shine when I was late to class &amp; forced to sit at the back with two exchange students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know what it was at the time, but I knew I found something appealing about these two students, One was tall, black crew-cut hair, above average muscle-bound, with powerful upper body strength &amp; a carved physique that screamed Adonis. His Adonis physique was only further exemplified by his XXL, but still tight Gotham Academy uniform that seemed scandalous yet daring . He seemed to give off a body language that said \u201cI\u2019m tough, &amp; you better believe it!!!\u201d The other was a tall &amp; gangly with some lean muscle, messy red-head (or should I say bed-head) hair, with slightly a wrinkled Gotham Academy uniform. He was quickly sketching some graphic art I was admittedly impressed with though something seemed weird. It seemed that he was quickly drawing these strange rounded, globular, almost blobbish shapes then quickly erased them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI introduced myself to them, \u201cHuh\u2026Huh\u2026Hi I\u2019m Dick.\u201d I said almost instantly regretting that I was well-known around this school before the year began, &amp; that my name though it sounded manly, was also very perversive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head looked at me with a sense of decency &amp; warmth, that was completely unexpected. \u201cDick, interesting name\u201d he said holding back a chuckle. \u201cDon\u2019t worry I like you. My name\u2019s Wally, Wally West don\u2019 wear it out.\u201d He said with frantic contained delight &amp; constrained speed like he was about to speed babble. \u201cOh &amp; this is my friend, Connor Kent.\u201d he pointed to the caucasian Adonis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Sup.\u201d he said in an almost passive fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind him, he\u2019s had a hard life\u201d Wally said with surprise. \u201cHe was an orphaned for 10-years by an abortion plan gone wrong, he was resuscitated &amp; then raised in some corrupt scientist\u2019s lab for before he escaped out of Metropolis into Happy Harbor. Then his dad who he never knew was dragged into a court case &amp; forced to take him in, they haven\u2019t exactly been on good terms\u201d Wally explained with sadness that he seemed to recognize, \u201cThough between you &amp; me, I think Connor\u2019s dad is just scared &amp; confused, Mr. Kent doesn\u2019t hate Connor or not love him, i think he just was dragged into an unfamiliar setting &amp; is trying to make the best of it.\u201d Connor looked at Wally with a glare then it turned into a frown &amp; a sad expression that was subtlety &amp; conspicuous pain.  I don\u2019t know why but as Wally described this story, I didn\u2019t feel sorry for Connor, I felt like I saw another side to Connor, like I was peeling back the hardened callous surface of Connor\u2019s mind &amp; seeing a warm &amp; tender, but clearly broken heart. I wanted to give the guy a hug &amp; tell him it\u2019s alright, but I wasn\u2019t any better off. My family was dead, &amp; though Bruce tried, you didn\u2019t need a doctorate\u2019s degree in psychology or psychoanalysis or any of those psycho-degrees to know Bruce was clearly struggling trying to balance so much of his life into making a good family &amp; also running Wayne enterprises. To be clear, he was Bruce Wayne, the head CEO of Wayne Enterprises, a conglomerate network of companies that extended a reach almost as far as Lex Corp &amp; was founded right here in Gotham. He was kind of a show-off &amp; playboy, but that was undermined by his many charity organizations, donations, &amp; contributions to lower society with protection, homes, jobs, &amp; monetary distribution that the city of Gotham wasn\u2019t giving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I digress\u2026 I was talking with my new friends as we chatted about our lives, I talked with Wally &amp; Connor &amp; they wanted to talk to me in an unused classroom during the break period. \u201cOkay so where to start, I\u201dm Dick Grayson, ward &amp; adopted son of Bruce Wayne, the Prince of Gotham\u201d I introduced myself tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait Dick Grayson!\u201d Connor responded, \u201cAs in the last of the Flying Graysons, from Haley\u2019s Circus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yes.\u201d I said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay dude. I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019ve been in the circus. I\u2019m a little jealous actually.\u201d  Wally responded then nudged Connor in the ribs slowly, though it probably didn\u2019t hurt much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you think it\u2019s wrong if you came from the circus?\u201d Connor responded, he clearly didn\u2019t know how to be social or interact in a normal environment, then Wally face palmed himself &amp; asked if Connor &amp; I could come over to his house near S,T.A.R. Labs in downtown Gotham. I told him for now it\u2019d have to be him coming to me. I knew Bruce would be okay so long as they don\u2019t cause too much trouble. They then shared some snacks with me during the nutrition, it was slightly fattening, but delicious pastries. School went by in a blur, then came the important question\u2026 Would Bruce allow me to go visit my new friend\u2019s house or would he only allow them to come &amp; visit.</span></div></div>",

It smelled like a normal house should &amp; it seemed more, well I guess the word \"homey\" would work, but it wouldn't come close to cutting it with this house. I was glad to meet Wally &amp; Connor who liked me for who I was, Connor's subtle actions &amp; deep frowns, it just seemed like they would be great friends. \"Sorry about the mess, but this is as clean as it gets on such short notice... Anyway, my Aunty Iris is making cookies for us, so save room for dessert cause we West men eat a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are your parents again Wally?\" I asked, almost instantly regretting it seeing the sad expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not able to make it. My dad's still in prison for child abuse, &amp; my mom is in a rehabilitation center for alcoholics in Central City\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, well I'm sorry I asked. Let's move on\" I said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had some snacks, played tag outside &amp; talked for a little while. Then Connor asked me something I never would have expected to come out of his mouth, \"So Dick, I'm wondering, is there anyone in class you love, I mean like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was baffled by that statement, I hadn't thought about that before. But before I could awkwardly answer, Iris West came saying, \"Snack time boys!!!\" So I was saved by the snacks. Now I'll admit it, I like to eat a lot when I get the chance to, but never junkfood like chips or cookies or pastries, not very often at least. There were enough snacks for a family of eight to gorge on comfortably. I ate what I could watching Wally eat at such fast speeds with such vigor that I almost forgot he was a human being, not a vacuum or garbage disposal. Connor admittedly tried to keep composed about his hunger, but he still ate quite a lot more than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour, I started to feel sick. \"Oooohhh!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Dick? You look a little green\" Connor asked, &amp; he was right, I was slighlty tinted &amp; tinged with green, probably from eating so much. \"Wally what do we do if Dick is sick?!?!?!\" Connor shouted with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry *gulp*, we'll just go get some antacid for his stomach, you carry him there since you're taller &amp; stronger &amp; then we'll make Dick feel better.\" Wally responded relaxed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo.\" I groaned, \"I'm fine just need to rest for a little bit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-can-do Dick. Connor up-and-at-em'\" Then Connor carried me over his shoulders &amp; we went into kitchen &amp; Iris gave me some antacids to drink. I'll admit, I've never had a stomachache, or stomach sickness, probably because I never ate that much before. When I looked down at my belly in the mirror, I saw a pale little bulge on my once flat childish torso. While I was slightly sleepy, Wally started to rub my belly, &amp; it felt soooo good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy Dick, why don't you stay here for the night. We'll keep you company &amp; comfortable until you wake up\" Connor said with a concerned look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo, Bruce'll be worried, besides we have school tomorrow.\" I responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Dickie-bird, it's just a Firday. Besides, I think some rest will do you some good.\" Wally reassured me with his soft voice. I drifted off to sleep. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I fell asleep I felt a weird sensation in my stomach and my, private parts. When I next opened my eyes, I was in a circus tent dressing room, could this be Haley\u2019s circus. Could I be dreaming about my life here. Please not the night of their deaths. I tried to get up, but I noticed I couldn\u2019t move my head any lower or even stand. It was like I was weighed down by a gelatinous mattress tied to my body. I shifted my body &amp; noticed a jiggling sensation in my belly as it toppled a cup with the shockwave of my body in my \u201cdressing room\u201d. Wait I have a belly? \u201cHey what\u2019s going on here. I heard my normally young &amp; high-pitched voice go up into a lower octave tremor reverberate across the room then my parents came in. Yep it was a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy Richard. I know you\u2019re hungry but you gotta wait for tonight\u2019s show.\u201d My dad assured me, then I noticed something, a full-body mirror in my line-of-sight. I was bulkier than I remembered. I looked less like an acrobat, &amp; more like a circus fat man, well boy is more like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm mom, dad\u2026\u201d I asked, still surprised by the pitch of my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Richard.\u201d my mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I so well big? &amp; what happened, last thing i remember was sleeping off a lot of snacks at a friends house in Gotham\u201d reminisced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy does it boyo. I think you must be having another food coma-induced dream. Which has happened before, but don\u2019t worry Richard, whatever weird dreams you\u2019re having, it\u2019s not real.\u201d Dad responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat your father is trying to say in his own round-a-bout way Richard is that you\u2019ve always been a, well \u2018bigger\u2019 boy, &amp; that your dreams of these friends are probably just figments of your imagination induced by all the good food you\u2019ve eaten all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, are you saying these weird dreams that feel so real are just fugue states from my food comas. I remember strange things, memories like another lifetime ago, none of it was real; me being an acrobat like you guys, your deaths at the hands of that extortion racket by Tony Zucco, my adoption by that billionaire Bruce Wayne, the time I spent in public school, &amp; now meeting two great friends. Was it all some sort of cruel, sick joke?!?!\u201d I shouted in my deep voice, my parents were slightly stunned at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRichard it\u2019s okay I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but we\u2019ll talk about it after the show. Maybe it\u2019s real, maybe it\u2019s not, but one constant is true in both of these well \u2018worlds\u2019 Richard, we love you now, &amp; we always will look out for you. Now let\u2019s get you prepared for your big performance.\u201d Mom spoke calmly, then gave my dad a look I couldn\u2019t see, though it was probably something along the lines of \u201cHoney, help me out here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now that we\u2019ve all taken a deep breath, is there any questions you\u2019d like to know about your life before we go on stage son? We\u2019d hoped you would grow out of it into a light, &amp; spectacular acrobat. But your body wanted to be bigger, so we improvised and you\u2019re now our circus fat man, well boy but you get the idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then let\u2019s get you onstage Richard for your next performance. You\u2019ve got to eat your entire body weight in fattening foods within half an hour. You hungry big boy?\u201d Dad remarked playfully while gently patting my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it dad.\u201d I responded. Strange as this dream was I let it play out, right until the end of the show where I finished eating all 200 lb. of fattening food and entered a food coma. When the dizzying but wonderfully full sensation ended, I was awake, but who did I see?</span></div></div>",

However before we meet Parker, let's start out on the day my life changed. Several months ago I was on a field trip to my best bud Harry's dad's laboratory for his company Oscorp where they were testing genetics on harmless spiders when one snuck out &amp; painlessly nipped at me. I only noticed it only because I saw it bite my hand, but I didn't do anything about it because I felt compelled to see where it went. After school that day I started feeling feverish &amp; exhausted so I had Aunt May call me in sick &amp; I stayed home for eight straight days. I wasn't in a coma or anything, or in extreme pain, I was just really tired &amp; it felt like i was having my innards rearranged slowly over that time, but that wasn't even the weirdest part. I felt like my senses were being enhanced, including my sight, which was always poor, thus my nerdy wire-frame glasses. I also noticed these weird silky ooze strands coming out from under the bedsheets that seemed to come from where my arms &amp; legs had been, almost as if I had been sweating it out or secreting it in some other gross biological way. On the second evening, I started having weird dreams of a giant spider talking to me, it was so big &amp; so powerful looking black and purple wolf spider, with a scarlet web design on its body. It was so huge and terrifying awe-inspiring, it made the acromantula Aragog out of Harry Potter look like a larval housefly in comparison (yes I read those). I was freaked out at first when I discovered I was tied down to a giant sticky web. with several spiders with downward fangs &amp; what appeared to be glowing rattles/magical ceremonial tools attached ot it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be alarmed Peter Parker. My name is Wolf Widow, &amp; you will not be harmed by me or my children... in fact soon you shall have more power &amp; control than you could ever dream of. Your life will undergo a most miraculous and meaty metamorphosis into a new way of life. All you have to do is hear me out\", the giant spider now known as Wolf Widow reverberated in a surprisingly deep resonance that sounded like a human jazz singer mixed with a calm, collected, and understanding mentor figure. It was strangely calming, despite the monstrous appearance of my would-be tormenter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I'm listening, but only since this has to be a dream.\u201d I respond shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is no dream Peter Parker, for when you wake up you will remember every detail that happens &amp; as proof, look where the spider from the place known as Oscorp bit you &amp; look at the wound under a microscope &amp; you\u2019ll find that it looks different from before, very different.\u201d Wolf Widow explained, \u201cBack to the matter at hand, you have always been uncomfortable &amp; powerless in your own body, but taste a tidbit of what could be done with our power once you meet the Manipulator of Life and your ideals &amp; dreams can come true once you work with him. His name is Parker, Parker Porter. he will join you in the midpoint of the areas where you have been wronged, ridiculed, &amp; bullied for most of your life. Now Leap, Spinner, help me show him his future. BEHOLD!.\u201d Then the spider Wolf Widow\u2019s eyes started to convulse &amp; spiral, while his children, Leap &amp; Spinner cocooned me up while placing a special cloth blindfold over my eyes (that appeared to be made of spider-silk as well). Even though my vision of Wolf Widow was covered, it felt as though he were still looking at me with all eight of those beady eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was petrified with fear &amp; shivering despite being bundled up with really warm spider-silk cloth in a cocoon. I was about to be eaten, then as I felt the puncture marks on my hand burn, I awoke\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, what a weird dream?!?!?!?\u201d I sighed in relief, only to remember this dream/nightmare in full sensory perception, &amp; the strangest nagging urge to loo underneath my microscope at the wound where the Oscorp spider bit me. I consider myself a very intelligent teenager, &amp; I am very detailed-oriented in the broader scope of science. However when I looked at the spider bite on my hand, what happened next was stunning visual for all the senses\u2026 What happened?</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll admit, I was scared out of my mind: one, I didn\u2019t know what that surreal dream/nightmare was about or why I had it; two, I barely got a look at my wound under my microscope, it looked was like I was spliced with bug DNA, without becoming a freak of nature; &amp; now three, I somehow have summoned an army of insects &amp; arachnids which are insisting carrying me out of my room to a dark, creepy, crawly underworld beneath my house. I wished I had never touched that spider to begin with, but then I noticed I wasn\u2019t feeling numbed or in pain from the bites, it actually felt kind of relaxing as they were somehow sedating me to sleep with both venoms &amp; a sort subharmonic voice singing a lullaby to me, one that though I didn\u2019t recognize, felt almost real. Subconsciously I realized that this must be bug pheromones working it\u2019s magic on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I awoke, I discovered I was in a soft, silky hammock-like cocoon that covered everything below the neck so that I could sense my surroundings even if I wasn\u2019t able to turn my neck very much. From what I could gather it appeared as though I was in a massive, dark, underground cavern network that looked like it was built by trillions or more different species of bugs &amp; worms with lots of burrows &amp; holes that seemed to be filled with larvae, a lot more real, and a lot more gross than anything they show on National Geographic or the Discovery Channel. There were also dozens, upon hundreds, upon thousands of roots &amp; mycelia from plants &amp; mushrooms, &amp; from two of those mycelia coming out of the walls &amp; hooking into each other, my hammock cocoon was hanging along with more webs, &amp; silk strands as thick as metal cables for architecture. Then just like in my dream, I saw him again, Wolf Widow, though  I didn\u2019t recognize the human riding on top of him, it was clearly a human with vast power over bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. I know you were taken, but I promise you will leave here with greater understanding &amp; power for yourself than ever before. Just hear me out.\u201d the young human spoke in an adolescent voice, it was a teenager like me. \u201cI was an ordinary human like you once, My name was Parker Porter, now I am BioMana, the Manipulator of Life, Empowerment to the Innocent, &amp; the Bane of Death &amp; Evil. I released that mutated spider from Oscorp so that it may find &amp; bite a suitable host to embody its power. The Agent of Power bit you Peter, that\u2019s why you had that dream last night, this is both magic &amp; science working together to create greater powers &amp; enhancing the lives of sapient beings. But for the power to work, you must be made bigger Peter.\u201d Parker or BioMana, spoke with such glee &amp; elation, you\u2019d think it was his birthday &amp; he was sharing one of his presents with me, not conducting some freaky experiment/magic ceremony to alter my body to his whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I appreciate the idea &amp; the offer. But what do you mean by making me bigger? Ummph\u2026\u201d I responded only to find that somehow a series of ants &amp; larvae were using their pheromones to paralyze my head, leaving me even more helpless than before as they forced this sweet &amp; colorless goo into my mouth &amp; I quickly realized it was pheromones, powerful pheromones that only bugs should have. I was being force-fed this substance by the quart into my underweight &amp; weak body. I didn\u2019t realize how powerful this must be because strangely, I may have subconsciously LIKED IT!!! At least, if my hard-on meant anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t see my body until after the transformation, but I knew I hadn\u2019t even attempted exercise since yesterday &amp; now this kid was force feeding me some strange &amp; delicious substance that was supposed to make me bigger, but I think he meant fatter. I was really bloated &amp; then they released me from my hammock prison, giving me a good look at myself as they brought out a giant mirror for me to look at. How much bigger was I\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had gained a total of 300 lb. of highly concentrated, liquified, terrestrial arthropod pheromones. Even as the paralyzing venom wore off, I realized that getting up was most certainly an issue now, let alone standing or walking, or should I say waddling. I got a good look at myself in the mirror &amp; it was both startling yet erotic how I looked &amp; felt. I\u2019d always hoped to be bigger, but was this what I needed, soft, squishy, bulky, &amp; hindering adipose tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head was already beginning to smoosh &amp; meld into my giant jellybean shaped torso through three chins, &amp; facial cheeks the size of volleyballs. My abdominals, or should I say \u201cmoobs\u201d were fat sacks of lard that were just barely contained by my shirt like a giant bra held together by a single strand of spider silk. Then my ass cheeks were like meteors, or desktop globes stuck together in an endless collision that is my butt. My arms were about the size of a king cobra at its widest with the hood, all around my body as it looked like a long equilateral sausage with tinier hotdog-sized fingers in my bun-shaped palms. I could just barely see my legs which were in the same shape as my arm with feet that looked like fully-grown, honey-baked hams with stubby studs for toes. That just left my gut, yes I had a gut so big, that it put Kenny Kong\u2019s entire, fattened, football body to shame. If Flash Thompson or any of his other bully cronies found me like this, they\u2019d pin me down &amp; use me as a love seat. But despite this I felt, proud of my gains. I just hoped Uncle Ben &amp; Aunt May could understand my \u201ctransformation\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I knew that this kid Parker (what a coincidence, his first name is my last name) could really help me improve my life. First, I needed to know what would happen to my family &amp; my few friends, as everyone would be wondering what happened to me. My newfound body would surely arouse suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about your family &amp; friends. I have the power to make them accept you without changing their personalities. I also have an idea for what to do about your body &amp; the school board\u2026 Within a few days I\u2019ll transfer to Midtown High as a new student, &amp; during that time I could arrange a lab \u2018accident\u2019 that requires you to be homeschooled for the rest of high school. No one will get hurt, but you\u2019ll have to fake not knowing anything for this to work. As for your body, I have magic that will \u2018compress\u2019 &amp; \u2018store\u2019 your current body mass for later usage once you are at home. I can also promise you a boyfriend since I also know whom you've been pining for since you were little\". Parker explained coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by boyfriend?\" I queried in embarrassment. \"I don't know what you're talking about\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Peter, I know you're gay, because I am gay too &amp; i've gone through what you're experiencing right now\", Parker reassured me, \"I discovered magic which is how I got these powers. I was an outcast as well in my hometown before I developed these powers &amp; live with fortune, friends, &amp; family. Now you can have ____ as your boyfriend, or maybe even a trio, or more boyfriends until you are ready to decide.\" Then Parker transferred the fat out of my body into these globs of pheromones underneath the floorboards of my house, as my clothes were repaired by these magic spiders even though they are not spider silk...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was back to my normal body weight, fully clothed, &amp; mostly cleaned up despite feeling the subsiding hormonal effects of cumming within my FUPA. I know I should feel grossed out about having cummed into FUPA at the thought of my love interest Eddie (my \u201cbrotherly\u201d figure) even for a little bit, but strangely I felt erotic &amp; entranced by the thought of yo-yoing back to that size, maybe even bigger. For now though I realized my alarm clock was about to go off, so I decided to snooze &amp; get ready for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ate my usual small breakfast portion, &amp; while my stomach was full, my conscious mind felt, I guess the word would be unsatisfied. I took my backpack &amp; went to meet Harry &amp; Gwen at the subway. I was both dreading &amp; anticipating the next few days for two reasons: one, I would make my future in fatness so that I could be with Eddie, which I was anticipating; &amp; two, I would meet a friend who would \u201caccidentally\u201d hurt me that I would need to go to the hospital &amp; get out of school forever. On the down side, I would miss walking with my two legs to get around once I get hospitalized, along with other mobility based issues such as masturbation. I would also probably miss being physically able to take care of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side however, I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about gym class, or popularity, &amp; especially Flash Thompson. Gym was by far my worst class ever, even before Flash became my main bully. Of course, I was never popular in school to begin with, &amp; once these next few days are done, Flash wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt me physically or otherwise. I can\u2019t say I hate flash anymore, but I can\u2019t say I like him either. Soon however, my fat fantasies would be reality &amp; all of those troubles would be in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we entered the school yard, I saw a new student who I subconsciously recognized as Parker Porter. I tried to hide my recognition as he came to talk to us &amp; I remembered his plan in our shared-dream\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m a new student. My name is Parker, Parker, Porter. What\u2019s yours?\u201d Parker asked cordially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Harry Osborn, &amp; wow what a coincidence, my best bud\u2019s last name is your first name.\u201d Harry beat me to the punchline with a friendly snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, you don\u2019t say Harry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, my name is Peter Parker, &amp; this is our friend Gwen Stacy\u201d, I responded while Gwen winked in confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your first period?\u201d I queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBiochemistry 101.\u201d Parker answered swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, what a coincidence, same as us. You should sit next to us, especially Peter, he\u2019s a whiz at science in general\u201d Harry complimented me. I blushed for a quick moment, then we all shook hands. We walked to our class. There, Parker introduced himself, &amp; the teacher had us all come together into pairs for a laboratory. I was with Parker, &amp; Harry was with Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we listened for our instructions which were to pour the chemicals into the beaker, so that they would bubble &amp; fizz over into a basic state. Parker followed those directions, but due to a slip-up in his hands, too much of the tonic landed into the beaker, which then fell into my lap. I knew what was coming next, but pretended not to notice, as my pants &amp; shirt were set on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I my pants were on fire (embarrassing I know), I was trying to pat it out, only to trip on my own two feet &amp; land in the chemical closet. More chemicals spilled on me, which made my pain even worse. Parker pushed me down &amp; tried to use my jacket to douse the random tonics on my pants, before they seeped into my skin &amp; burned there . As I was panicking, everyone else looked at me with mixed expressions of concern, humor, &amp; in Flash Thompson\u2019s case malice. Gwen snapped some sense into our clueless teacher who was fiddling with the fire extinguisher &amp; trying to get close enough to douse me. I was held down by Parker gently, but with insistence that everything would be alright. The fire extinguisher didn\u2019t work, but strangely the fire alarm did &amp; the sprinklers went off making the fire worse. As everyone, minus Gwen, Harry, Parker, &amp; our teacher tried to flee the classroom, Harry went to get help from the nurse\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in that instant that I fainted either from smoke inhalation, or pain, or panic, or maybe my asthma kicked in as I was having some other emotional reaction to this situation &amp; I drifted into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI next awoke in a hospital bed, wheezing &amp; in agony, while my arms &amp; chest were covered with bandages in a loosely-formed cast. I saw two people next to my bedside. Who were they?</span></div></div>",

What happened?\u201d I asked grimacing in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy does it there bro, the doctor will be in &amp; explain everything. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re not harmed. Your new friend from school Parker called me using Gwen\u2019s cell phone to tell me you were injured during a chemistry experiment at school\u201d Eddie explained with that warm brotherly compassion of his that just melts my heart &amp; warms me to my soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in the hospital for four days already, we were wondering when you\u2019d wake up, as you only suffered minor damage to your brain, but I can\u2019t say the same for your arms &amp; legs\u201d Parker clarified while pointing out my burned arms &amp; revealing my damaged legs. My legs were covered in bandages &amp; burnt, the same as my arms. Thankfully, the damage didn\u2019t spread to my torso, or my hips, or my ass, &amp; especially my groin region were unaffected by the chemical burns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to my arms &amp; legs?\u201d I asked with apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the tissue has been burned off pretty severely. The chemicals also seeped into your muscles and may have some unintended side-effects if you move too much even after the pain has subsided\u201d Eddie explained. As I tried to wriggle my legs, I felt excruciating distress emanating from my upper legs. The same was true for my upper arms as well. It was clear I wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere anytime soon. \u201cYou\u2019re probably gonna make it through, but in case your limbs are badly damaged, I would recommend learning how to use a wheelchair Pete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh crud. I\u2019m hoping that won\u2019t be the case. My aunt &amp; uncle are barely able to afford rent with government help. I can only image what this would do to them\u2026\u201d I pretended to worry using a mask of concern. \u201cOh my god, Uncle Ben &amp; Aunt May! Have they come to visit me? Do they know I\u2019m alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Peter, your aunt &amp; uncle came to see if you were okay when you were first admitted into this hospital. Also, Harry came by to negotiate paying the bill for you so that you don\u2019t have to worry about financial problems\u201d. Parker reassured me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well, I\u2019m flattered that Harry would do that for me. He doesn\u2019t have to\u201d I replied modestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Petey, Harry is doing this out of the goodness of his heart using his own vacation money, his dad won\u2019t mind him helping his best friend, &amp; besides who are you to look a gift-horse in the mouth\u201d Eddie calmed me down. Boy was he handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Peter by the way, I wanted to apologize for accidentally setting you on fire, and I wanted to commemorate a better future for you, so I made you this little lucky charm to put over your bed while you are staying here.\u201d Parker reached into his pocket &amp; pulled out a dreamcatcher made with fabrics and a sacred geometry symbol, the Tree of Life using overlapping circles. I knew based on my dream that it would be used to communicate with Parker remotely as long as I laid there. \u201cThis may sound spiritual Pete, and not your style, but a little faith can go a long way, so have the nurse put it next to your bedside\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Parker. I really appreciate this even though I\u2019ve never considered myself a spiritual person\u201d I responded coyly. Then the doctor came in &amp; told my visitors it was time for my surgery. She was nice enough to explain what happened with kindness &amp; understanding. First of all, I wouldn\u2019t be using my legs for walking ever again as I\u2019m now paraplegic, even though they\u2019ve retained a firm and stable muscle count. Turns out that when those chemicals burned me, the heat, plus the residual concoction was enough to permeate my skin &amp; damage my leg\u2019s motor-function nerve endings. My fingers and lower arms would recover but they would be paralyzed for months, but I could still turn my torso, &amp; flail my upper arms, thus moving my lower arms &amp; hands in a whip like motion. To prevent me from missing school, Parker paid for me to have a home-schooling teacher once I was checked out of the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks I ate as quietly as I could, &amp; I decided to communicate with Parker in our dreams. I knew the perfect way to reel in Eddie, &amp; have him fully accept the life style with superpowers I would gain. I would use my budding powers over the dreamscape (amplified by the dreamcatcher Parker gave me) to influence Eddie\u2019s wet dreams, to involve me. &amp; what do you know, Eddie was already gay. WE talked it out &amp; confessed our love to each other, now, so that took care of the easy part. The hard part would be to influence his dreams to show me being fed &amp; fattened, while stimulating Eddie\u2019s dream self. Sex between two people in a dream was incredible, but tantalizing for the real thing. I wanted BioMana, pardon Parker to empower me with fatness again. I enjoyed the dreams, &amp; within a few weeks after surgeries were done, I was checked out &amp; ready to confess my love to Eddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? We see Peter &amp; Eddie having dinner at the Parker residence, coming out of the closet with both the Brocks &amp; the Parkers listening in sweet love &amp; acceptance. Peter is given an upgrade to his life, as he now has Eddie as his personal assistant (paid for by Harry Osborn) to feed &amp; care for him, while undergoing physical therapy in their own apartment. Peter &amp; Eddie meet the Klyntar Symbiote that would make Eddie Venom, who amplifies Parker\u2019s powers over life, making Peter fatter, Eddie into a strong venom, and Parker into an omega-level super-powered being (relative to mutants, who may or may not exist here in this continuity).<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To top it off, I realize how special Eddie is to my life, even without romance, though there will be room for that later. I was released from the hospital with crutches &amp; despite Aunt May\u2019s protests, I accepted some monetary assistance from Harry, to pay off Eddie\u2019s new private healthcare career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting it simply, Harry is now paying for me and Eddie to live out on our own in a nice house in the suburbs, where I would be homeschooled. To top it off, Harry is discretely paying Eddie to make me happy &amp; healthy by any legal means necessary. Healthier is the easy part, but I want to be fatter, &amp; now I can live out those fantasies with Eddie, which brings us to tonight. We\u2019ve talked about our sexual orientation about a month ago, &amp; we realized that we loved each other. Then &amp; there it was official; I was a gay teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night was a cool Friday in Autumn, &amp; October was just around the corner. Eddie directed where all the groceries would go to the delivery people, &amp; after he was certain the last of them left, he prepared my meal. It was there &amp; then I would make my move, and show him my kinky side, and my powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Eddie, can I show you something before you make dinner?\u201d I asked tentatively. Eddie paused on his way to the kitchen &amp; looked at me with curious eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing sweetie. What do you want to show me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell before I show you, I just want you to know that this is something about myself I discovered right before the lab accident at school that left me in this wheelchair. What happened the night before was a sort of vision of what would need to happen in order for me to reach my true &amp; beautiful potential.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds, well deep. Just know that I love you no matter what Pete\u201d Eddie reassured me with a gentle wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell here it goes, try not to panic\u201d I then showed him my powers which is when I summoned an army of insects &amp; arachnids from underneath the floorboards, much to Eddie\u2019s (hopefully) initial shock. They then shot their liquid pheromones into my mouth at rapid-fire speeds without wasting a single ounce of fattening goodness. I\u2019d been secretly practicing this power for a while, &amp; I was so good, that I even was able to spare my clothing from being torn or ripped, including my cast with a few magical dream lessons from BioMana. With all the food I\u2019d been eating, plus all the original fattening pheromones I saved for later, I was now almost 1,100 lb. of fat, that was thankfully on the ground floor (this is a one-story house).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPete what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Eddie queried unsure of what he was seeing. Eddie then covered his eyes as he started to shiver &amp; tremble. I was certain he was shocked, but not appalled by what was happening. In fact, Eddie might have been aroused if his groin &amp; covered eyes were any indication, because he wasn\u2019t ready to see me in an indecent state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy Eddie, this is my kink, my fetish. I want to be bigger, I like this body, &amp; I\u2019m certain you do too if your well, pitched tent is any indication\u201d I pointed out with sincerity &amp; a coy undertone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what about those bugs that are in the room. These bugs aren\u2019t going to hurt either of us, are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, they are a part of well I guess you could call it my superpower\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you mean you have a superpower? &amp; it will help make great sex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Only if you want to continue being my boyfriend Eddie, I will love you always &amp; I can only hope that you will love me no matter what I weigh or what I look like. This is what I offer you. So what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say yes of course Petey.\u201d Eddie realized in a moment of sexual epiphany. \u201cGuess that explains why you\u2019ve been so hungry lately &amp; why you\u2019ve spent most of your spending money on food. Let me make you a lardass Pete, now &amp; forever\u201d Eddie rejoiced as he embraced me with his huge muscular arms, making my heart aflutter, or maybe that\u2019s just my stomach being squeezed too tight from his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we ate, &amp; ate, for the rest of the night, or more specifically I laid there chewing &amp; swallowing everything Eddie gave me at my \u201cTrue Body Weight\u201d. From now on, I use this to imply my immobile fat form which is only shown to my True Love &amp; other gay feeder paramours. Eddie was really enjoying this if that proud smile on his face was any indication. The blinds were closed, the lights were off, &amp; the food was fresh. This left us to enjoy my first feeding by candlelight, an oddly romantic, yet erotic element I should really consider for future occasions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI explained what a feeding was &amp; how we would substitute sex with food for now until I was old enough to legally lose my virginity with Eddie. So, what happens next? Choice 1: Will Peter \u201cexpand\u201d his friend group within the next year to include Flash Thompson &amp; Kenny Kong, plus the other jocks at school that made Peter\u2019s life difficult since middle school? Choice 2: Will Peter graduate homeschooling within two years &amp; then gain into the obese B.M.I., earning that sex with his boyfriends Eddie &amp; Parker? Choice 3: introduce Harry to the secret of his growing success over Summer Vacation, or should I say expanding excess, adding him into their inner circle? The choice is yours.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been an eventful year since I showed Eddie my \u201cTrue Body Weight\u201d, and my \u201cDisguised Form\u201d (the form I use for general and public interaction with other individuals) has grown even hunkier. My \u201cDisguised Form\u2019s\u201d weight was originally 180 lb. when I confessed my kinky desire to Eddie, slightly chubbier than my original weight from before I met Parker in my dreams. Now, my \u201cDisguised Form\u2019s\u201d weight is about 230 lb. It was just big enough for now, but reasonable enough not to attract attention from Aunt May, the school board, our family doctors, or anyone else who might be suspicious of my gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this means my \u201cTrue Body Weight\u201d has also grown a bit, but I digress. During the holiday season, Eddie &amp; I decided to tell our friends &amp; families that we were together, much to Aunt May &amp; Uncle Ben\u2019s shock. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they approved of my sexuality, but they weren\u2019t certain if I could wait around to have sex with an older guy like Eddie until I\u2019m 18-years-old. Gwen was astounded, but found our relationship endearing &amp; adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gasped so hard, he almost choked on his soda when we told him, but for a brief flicker of a second I saw a hint of disappointment, like how he should have made this move already. Parker was there as well &amp; we had his full support, as he smiled his way into our hearts, with knowing eyes; sort of like he was telling an inside joke that only the three of us, Eddie, Parker, &amp; I understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that night, Parker somehow connected both of us to Harry\u2019s dreams. It turns out that Harry was gay too, &amp; he also had the same fetish as the three of us. The questions in Harry\u2019s mind were different than mine however, Harry was at a point where he couldn\u2019t decide whether he should be a seme or an uke in his relationship. In layman\u2019s terms, he couldn\u2019t decide whether he wanted to be submissive or dominant, topping it off with whether Harry really wanted to get fat, or just feed someone to that size was astounding too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Harry, I wanted to help him by giving him the option to join us, but Parker had another idea in mind. He wanted to earn Harry\u2019s love and be his feedee. I guess Parker wanted to get fat too. I was impressed, especially as over the next couple of weeks, Parker invited Harry to go out to eat. As the weeks went on, Parker made it a point to gain weight &amp; show it off to Harry through his tight clothing and big hugs, much to Harry\u2019s embarrassment.<br>\r\nWhile I stayed around my apartment being home-schooled &amp; taken care of by Eddie more &amp; more, Parker gained more weight from his skinny 125 lb. to a pudgy 175 lb., within two months. All that eating was almost a pound a day, &amp; it only seemed to fuel the erotic fantasies between Harry &amp; Parker, fantasies of which I helped shape to influence Eddie\u2019s subconscious desires. By then it was clear to everyone within &amp; outside of our friend group that Parker &amp; Harry were close, &amp; some would say it was love of the romantic kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it happened, Parker earned Harry\u2019s love &amp; they sealed their relationship status with each other through a love bite (no, not that kind. Harry was feeding Parker a donut, and Parker bit some of the donut off &amp; gave Harry a tiny, yet messy kiss on the cheeks &amp; they just clicked from there). This was a moment that Parker had showed me &amp; Eddie through his powers over life &amp; dreams. Fortunately for Harry (his dad might not approve of their relationship), it was a private moment at one of Harry\u2019s favorite restaurants. It was small, uncrowded, &amp; just the place where he &amp; Parker could go to get some good pastries, without running into anyone from Midtown High, or the paparazzi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry &amp; Parker arrived at our apartment (I was in my \u201cDisguised Form\u201d), as we were preparing for a nice dinner, they were in the neighborhood, so we decided to have a double-feeding date with Parker &amp; I as the volunteers to taste-test everything Eddie &amp; Harry made for us tonight. I was thoroughly stuffed with pastas, fried chicken, &amp; more maki maki rolls than the actual rolls forming at my love handles (&amp; that\u2019s just my Disguised Form\u2019s love handles).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? Option 1=Harry &amp; Parker come out of the closet as well, which could lead to problems on Harry\u2019s part. This means that harry will become more submissive, and undergo radical physical &amp; mental changes via his relationship with Parker. Option 2=Eddie &amp; Peter experiment more with the growing powers from Parker &amp; the Web of Life. This could mean lactation which leads to mind control (by having straight, skinny boys who have no love for fat people drink Peter\u2019s milk) or power bestowal (i.e. lending Spiderman powers to Eddie &amp; Harry). Option 3=Peter &amp; Parker go all out for their 16th birthdays, with all of them going on a weekend trip to Parker\u2019s family\u2019s hotel called, the Bella Nox Lodge, with lots of gaining possibilities &amp; leisure time activities (possibly smexy stuff). Which will it be?\u2026 </span></div></div>",
