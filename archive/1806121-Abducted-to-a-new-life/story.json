            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shawn was scared, he just arrived home with his report card, it wasnt bad it was mostly A's except for one grade which was a C.  which was still a pass but shawn knew his parents woujld not be happy, they always expected nothing worse than a B, and what he experienced last year when he got a C in his class he was severly punished, it was so bad he ended up needing to get stitches, what made matters worse his parents were police officers...  no matter how much he thought about complaining to someone or running away from it all he always knew it would eventually get back to them and there is no knowing what would happen then..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shawn breathed deeply then opened the door to the house, only to see his mother Kim on the other side waiting for him.  Kim said\"Well shawn let me see the report card.\"  shawn looked at his mother with fear then slowly handed over the report card knowing it wouldnt do any good to hide it...   Kim opened up the card and started to read the report card. Shawn looked at his mom as her expression turned to anger \"What, have I told you shawn,,  that you better not get anything worse than a B\" Kim yelled she then raised her hand and slapped shawn across the face leaving a red handprint on shawn's left cheek. \"Go to your room now, im going to let your father handle this when he gets back from work.\" Kim, yelled \"Oh, and no TV or PS3\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Meanwhile--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Funari mothership has just put itself in orbit of the planet earth with its cloak engaged so it cannot be detected. Gelina who was the ships captain has sent out the order to launch the probes, which was  flying machines with its own cloaking systems and also has the ability to record recordings, and abilty to pass through walls along with the ability to transform into objects and lifeforms when necessary...   Gelina watched as 15 probes decended upon earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Back in Shawns bedroom--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was sitting on the edge of his bed scared for when his father will arrive which could be at any time now... and sure enough he heard the door downstairs open and then close shut, followed by Kim's voice talking to him...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile behind shawn a probe has now entered his room, with its cloak active no one would be able to notice it...  as soon  it stopped moving it started to observe shawn.. It was in good time too, as his Father now entered the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike wasted no time he grabbed shawn and started to hit him while his mother who was at the door was just watching it happen...  while Gelina who was watching via the probes footage its been sending wirelessly to the ship was getting angry at his parents for beating the child, what made matters worse is that is seems the mother was doing nothing to stop it...  she then ordered the probe to start making  preparations to take Shawn away from this situation, Mike yelled\"I'm sure hope you learn your lesson, oh your birthday gift from last month, you can kiss it goodbye\"  Mike then grabbed a baseball bat that was leaning beside the dresser and then used it to smash Shawn's Ps3 into pieces...  then yelld\" Go to bed now, and i better not hear so much as a peep from you or you can kiss your tv goodbye too.\" Mike then slammed the door shut..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn still shaking from the attack stayed up for 30 minutes before finally getting to bed.  A few moments later Gelina materialized in Shawn's room..  she was looking down on shawn with a tear in her eye. She knew Shawn wouldnt understand but she said softly anyway<i> \"Dont worry Shawn I'll take you away from here\"</i> she then turned around in the direction of the probe that was still floating in the room.. She ordered the probe to reveal itself. Then started to devise a plan, normally she would just take Shawn away and then leave, but what was done to shawn was so wrong in her books she decided to make sure his parents wouldnt harm anyone else again... she then ordered the probe to take a scan of shawns form and create a exact duplicate of shawn's body and then have it altered to make it look like he was beaten to death by a baseball bat..  not only that to alter the recorded footage to make it look like Mike murdered shawn with the baseball bat.. She then took the baseball bat and with a device she changed the bat to have evidence to suggest it was used to hit someone.. after 30 minutes of preparations they were done.. with all the necessary evidence to show that Shawn's dad murdered him... she then put her hand on the real shawn who was still sleeping through all this and then dissappeared with shawn back to the ship..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGelina said<i> \"Make preparations To leave orbit..\"</i> She then headed to the medical room to drop shawn off, as they needed to do some things for shawn to make him ready for his new life...  first of which was to cure him of any heath issues he may of had...  or will have.  Gelina then went to the communications room and had the edited footage broadcasted to the earth.  The signal the ship sent was powerful enough to take over all tv signals...  and it also programed a small device to stay in orbit to continue the broadcast for 24 hours which after 24 hours it will self terminate allowing tv stations to resume its regular scheduling.  Once it launched the small device Gelina gave the order to leave orbit and head home.</span></div></div>",

He also saw what seems to be a pile of clothes that was sitting near the bed he must of been laying on, as he started to head towards the clothes the door on the other side of the room opened up..  Shawn didnt take any chances and decideded to dive behind a half wall that was close by..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female Fundari walked into the room looking around..  She was expecting to see Shawn still in bed, she was carrying a device in her hand that would allow for easier communication with shawn.  At first the fundari thought he may of got out of the room so she pulled a terminal and made the ship scan for one of the devices that was planted on him... The ships comuter responded<i> \"Shawn is in medical room 1\"</i> The fundari then looked up and decided to look around.. She then spoke in english\"  Shawn, please come out, no one will harm you here.\"  Shawn hearing what she said slowly peeked around the corner allowing the fundari to see him.  What Shawn saw amazed him.  A alien creature that looked almost human except for some slight differences..  Shawn then asked\" Where is this place?\"  The Fundari responded\" You are on our mothership heading back to my homeworld..\"  The fundari can sense a little fear in shawns eyes..  and then continued\"  Don't worry we wont harm you, infact we rescued you from what possibily ended your life way too early.\"  Shwn replied\"Really?\"  Shwn then thought about it then remembered the events of last night, he knew that the attack last night was one of the worst its ever been and admitted it could of possibly killed him.  As he looked up the fundaroi was already beside him, and the fundari offered he hand to help him up.  Shawn asked \" Who are you?\"<br>\r\nThe Fundari blushed and responded\" Oh, where are my manners my name is ....\"</span></div></div>",

Varis\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn then grabbed Varis's hand and pulled himself up.Varis then said\" well get the rest of your clothes on, im pretty sure your hungry by now and in need of some food\" Shawn then grabbed the clothes that was still on the chair beside the bed and started to put them on. Shawn found it quite comfortable to wear, and as soon as he put it on it seemed to self adjust to the shape of the body to the best fit to make it as comfortable as possible...  Then shawn headed to the door to where Varis was waiting for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shawn followed Varis into the hallway he was amazed to see how many other humans were around each accompanied by a Fundari.  Shawn asked\" Varis, what are you planning on doing with me?\"  Varis looed at Shawn and replied\" We are simply providing you a better life than what you had on earth, and...  at the same time helping our species at the same time\"   Shawn with a puzzled look asked\" What do you mean by that?\"  Varis replied\" Well my race the Fundari is mostly female, while there are male fundari born once in a while, it is no where near what we need it to be to remain a sustainable species,  100 years ago scientists theorized about the possibility of finding compatible species on other planets..  and 75 years ago they discovered your planet Earth which they found that the human species was the most compatible to the Fundari.\"  Shawn then said\" And I suppose i am to be mated with one of your kind?\"  Varis looked back and giggled.. then replied\" In a matter of speaking yes, but not necessarily right away.. when we reach your new home there will sort of be an auction on what your immediate role would be..  and the money spent will determine the amount of wealth you will have to start your new life...\"  Varis paused then said\" some may bid on you to be a mate right away, while some may want to adopt you into their family as one of their own through an act of rebirth, while others want to set you up with a nice job and a place to live, but you in the end do have the final say as it is your choice ultimatly who you end up with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shawn turned the corner a room that looked like a cafeteria was ahead of them, then shawn asked \" Act of rebirth?\"  Varis blushed then replied\" The fundari has the ability to take someone into thier womb and the process will change the person into a fundari child... most of the time the sex of the child stays the same, but sometimes it changes also\"    <br>\r\nShawn entered the cafteteria and looked around there were already about 15 other human beings sitting at the table already eating.  Varis then said \"Well here we are...  well you go grab yourself something to eat, dont worry our chefs are knowledgeable about earth food, and does have a nice selection of food for you to choose from.. of course if you feel adventurous you can also try some fundari food..\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaris then left to do her other duties while shawn was looking at the menu for something to eat...</span></div></div>",

Shawn said\u201d thanks, how much does this cost?\u201d  The Fundari laughed then replied\u201d Its free kid, we don't expect our new members to pay for anything, besides your earth money is no good here so it wouldn't do any good to charge you\u201d Shawn then turned around and began to look for a seat, looking around there were a few tables, some tables mostly had humans sitting at the table eating food,  some tables had a mix of fundari and humans and some tables only fundari sitting at the table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn decided to sit at a table.....</span></div></div>",

Then the person said \"Hello, my name is Mike\" Shawn replied \"Nice to meet you my name is....\"  Mike interupted and said\"Shawn, I know..  infact you have been the main topic of conversation in this ship right now, seeing the circumstances of you being chosen, and the fact that the Fundari's Queens daughter has taken an interest in you.\" Shawn gulped and then looked around and noticed everyone was looking at him, while some tried to make it look like it wasnt directly.  Mike continued\" But, dont worry we are all just curious what your choice ultimatly will be\"  Shawn then asked \"Who is interested in me?\", mike replied \" Well dont get me wrong it may all be just rumour, however some of the crew on this ship know she is currently looking for a mate and she has made it known she is very interested in finding a human male to mate with, as with who she is well we dont really know her name, as for her safety only her personal guard knows who she is, all we know is that she is currently on board, which is slightly unusual for these kind of trips\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn continued to eat his pizza, then asked Mike \" so what brought you on this ship\"  mike replied\"Oh, im actually a crew member here alot of us humans end up seeking jobs on ships like this, the idea of traveling outer space was too good to pass up. i been at it for 10 years\" Shawn was about to say something when a Fundari Guard walked up to him handing him a note. Then went about his duties elsewhere.  Shawn picked up the note and read it \"Shawn, I must request that you come to visit me in my chambers when you become available to do so.\" attached to the note was a map to show you where the room was in the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked at the note then said \"Wow didnt expect that to happen so fast\"  shawn looked up and asked \"Why?\", Mike then replied\"Well its no secret about the auction that will occur when you arrive at your new home, But some fundari has the right to give an upfront offer bypassing the auction altogether, and it sure sounds like something the princess would do to secure her interest, mind you its still up to you to accept or not\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn then stood up and decided to go to where the map leads him and enters the room and finds</span></div></div>",

Mike woke up saying \" Who could be knocking on the door at this time or night..\" Then headed downstairs to see who it is...  As Mike opened the door he noticed it was Tom who was a police officer and close friend.  Mike alson noted there were 2 police cars parked infront of the house.  Mike asked \" Whats going on, tom?\" Tom replied\" We need to talk inside.\"  Mike nodded and stepped aside allowing Tom to enter.<br>\r\nTom, then said\" Have you been aware whats going on right now?\"   Mike replied\" No.\"  Tom then picked up the tv remote pointed it at the TV and turned it on..  Mike looked at the TV in complete shock as the tv was showing a video of him beating shawn to death over and over again.  Tom then said \"You and your wife really needs to expalin this\"  Mike was dumbfounded, he knew he beat shawn up but when he left the room he was still alive, this has to be some joke he thought.  Tom then said\" I already have a warrent to search the house, so I'm sorry that this needs to be done.\"  Mike nodded knowing he wouldnt find such evidence in the house.  Tom then went to the window and signalled the other police officers to come in to start the search.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officers started to go towards Shawns room as Kim started to go downstairs to see what is going on.  Kim asked\" Whats going on?\"  Mike replied\" The police are searching to house for evidence.\"  Kim responded\" Evidence of what?\"  Mike didnt say a word but pointed to the TV.  Kim brought her attention to the tv seeing the grusesome video that is now playing on it...  As mike started to head towards Shawns room the police officers were just about to open shawns door..  And to the officers horror to see what it revealed.. a crime scene exactly as dipicted on the video with Shawns dead body on the floor, the murder weapon laying beside the body. Tom then proceeded to arrest both Mike and Kim for the murder of their son Shawn, none of them knew that wasnt really shawn laying on the floor was just a exact duplicate of shawn, all tests would prove inconclusivly that it is shawn, and all evidence in the room and under shawns nails would point the finger to both Mike and Kim as the primary suspects.The folowing day when the alien device in orbit stopped broadcasting the news were already reporting about the gruesome murder, Along with the mysterious broadcast that practically tookover  all TV  stations around the world for 24 hours. </span></div></div>",
