Only a few weeks ago, had she been kidnapped by the Daleks as an inscentive for her father to do their bidding. Soon enough, the Doctor and Jamie had turned up and she helped defeat the Daleks once and for all, but her father didn't make it. She had tried not to think about it too much, to enjoy her travels with her new friends, but recently it had become too much for her. She had spent a few hours alone in her room mourning her father while the Doctor and Jamie went about their business in the TARDIS, and had been comfort eating. Victoria was a curvy girl, which was almost always hidden by the big dressed see was accustomed to wearing, but the results of he eating had become apparent. Victoria absent-mindedly looked away from the ceiling she was staring up at and noticed just what her eating had done. She was in some casual trousers and jumper, so he could easily see what damage her figure had received. In fact, she had gained...</span></div></div>",

Her face twisted into a confused smirk, as she moved her hands across her doughy belly, which was rising up against her jumper. She could feel her butt had slightly grown also, creating a cushion underneath her, while her thighs seemed to have not grown at all. Her main attraction were her breasts, which had gone from being relatively pirky to hugely porky. She could feel her cleavage were straining her bra to the limit, and estimated they had grown around 2 cup sizes. All in all, Victoria mused, it had certainly changed what she looked like, while still managing to keep her (or perhaps make her more) seductive. She hadn't usually faired well in relationships, usually having kept to her duties at home, but she wondered whether she could actually have a shot. Her thoughts wandered over to the inevitable reactions of the Doctor and Jamie. She could just wear one of her dresses, but she supposed the others would find that odd now and besides, they were rather impractical. She knew it wouldn't be appropriate to try and flaunt her softer figure, the Doctor wouldn't be interested anyway and Jamie was more like a brother than a boyfriend, so she decided it would be best to just explain what had happened. She hoped they would understand and be supportive, just as she knew they were, and made to leave her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was lost. The TARDIS corridors were so similar and huge that they all looked the same to her. True she was accustomed to large living areas, due to her house with her father, but this was another thing entirely. She put a softer finger to her lips and looked down the forked corridor. Was the console room left or right? She supposed she would have to choose. She remembered the rhyme the Doctor had taught her and decided to go...</span></div></div>",

A hand reached out and she took it, being hauled to her feet by the Doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, hello Victoria,' said the Doctor. 'I was just looking for you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria smiled nervously and said 'Doctor! I thought I would be lost here forever.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled. 'Yes the TARDIS corridors are a bit confusing aren't they? I came to get you anyway. We're due to land soon and I wanted to make sure you were ready.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria smiled. 'Thank you Doctor, but you may have noticed something...' She motioned across herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor's brow crinkled as he stared at Victoria before saying 'Oh my giddy aunt. What happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria told the Doctor about her thoughts and snacking and her worries about herself now but the Doctor just smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now now Victoria,' he said. 'There's nothing to worry about. I'm sure Jamie won't think any less of you, and besides...' He creased his brow as if trying to remember something 'I'm sure I have a gym in here somewhere.' He clapped his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now come along, let's not keep Jamie waiting, shall we?' He grabbed Victoria's hand and started to walk off down the corridor the way he had come, Victoria trying to ignore the sensation of her butt wobbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the console room about 5 minutes later, the confusing corridors coupled with Victoria's pudgy body making the journey slower than usual. Jamie was waiting by the scanner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Och finally,' he said. 'I've been waiting for ages.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes well sorry about that Jamie,' said the Doctor. 'What does it look like out there?'</span></div></div>",

His eyes widened and Victoria gave a nervous giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What did you do?' asked Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh come on now Jamie, don't make a big fuss over it, everyone gains a bit of weight in their life,' retorted Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes quite,' interrupted the Doctor, opening the TARDIS doors.

'Come along.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie followed him, but before Victoria could follow she heard movement behind the TARDIS. She poked her head round the corner and a hand grabbed her over the mouth to prevent her from screaming. Victoria struggled but her assailant had a firm grip on her, squeezing her softer form intently. Victoria kicked and struggled but she couldn't free herself from the grip.

She asked the air, hoping for, but not expecting a reply.
