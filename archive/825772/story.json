Today's topic for viewing was \"Are you Looking for Someone?\"  This intrigued Christine.  She watched the show with great enthusiasm. One of the stories featured was that of two girls who were in the same class in grade school.  Christine's mind went back in time.  She wondered whatever happened to the kids she knew in elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This wondering opened some very painful memories for Christine.  Were these kids the same as adults as they were as kids?  How do they treat people who are \"different\"?  Did she dare try to reconnect with some of them?  Would they want to hear from her?  What type of response would she receive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It took about a week for Christine to make the decision as to whether she wanted to start searching.  What would she do?</span></div></div>",

It shone, sure, but it was as if, given a choice, it would have preferred to avoid that window altogether, the whole room, in fact.  It was a tightly packed little room, with a once-elegant set that had become little more than a prop for papers, books, boxes, dusty knick-knacks whose only sentimental value now was in having to admit that they'd lost their sentimental value. The books and debris that had come to infest the dining room had spawned up and into the china cabinet, pushing back the plates and cups and the crystal bell collection mother had left Christine in the will. It was this room that challenged the light from that south window as it begrudgingly lit the one clear spot on the table in front of Christine, who was parked at the hole where Tony had maimed the set to accomodate her chair.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>How stupid</i>, she thought, the show still on her mind, why would she want to find any of <i>her</i> old classmates? If anything, she would <i>avoid</i> them, and in the most visible, obvious way. She poked at the sandwich with her fork then paused to examine it, turning it tines-up and from different angles. She loved that fork. They'd lost four of it's mates at Tony's company picnic. That'd been in early summer a few years earlier. She'd really preferred not to risk any of the elaborate forks that summer, but Tony had pursuaded her, and look what happened. She'd been right about the forks, about them having an incomplete, unusable set, and she'd gotten mile after mile after mile out of it with respect to being right on future disagreements. She turned the fork and noted how the tines were still evenly spaced, even after such a time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony didn't try to pursuade her of too much after that summer, the fork incident having become the perpetual trump in all disagreements over risks great and small. It was invoked so easily, \"... Just like that summer, Tony, remember?\" Yes, she'd been right, and that was no small thing for a woman for whom it was important not only to <i>be</i> right, but to have it <i>acknowledged</i> as well, as if somehow being right or wrong preserved or denied some greater validation. And now that the elegant formal set was incomplete, it wasn't useful. But still, the piece had value to <i>her</i>; it was the evidence that she'd been right to call for caution, and Tony had been wrong that summer, he'd been wrong, and because of it, what was once beautiful and elegant was now incomplete and useless.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Christine rested the fork next to the sandwich, as if in a place of honor, and looked around at the books that were arranged so she could reach them. <i>Old classmates</i>, she thought, <i>How stupid...</i> Her next thought, though, was to wonder what those young classmates would say to her now. Would they see her and come to know what had happened, then reflect back on how they'd treated her? And would they, there and then, learning of her horrible circumstances, fill with regret and flood shame for themselves? Even at that young age, Christine had told them, <i>warned</i> them, actually, that their cruelty would lead to trouble if they didn't stop--which they didn't, not that year or the ones that followed, as Christine recalled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She tentatively reached for a box, then pushed it aside in favor of another, then another, then another, until she found the one she'd collected after the funeral along with the crystal bells. Soon ancient papers and crude tempura paintings were covering the last of the visible wood on the once-elegant table. Mother had kept everything, even the old school records, and for the first time that Christine could remember, it had actually been beneficial. Just like that show, Christine could look up <i>her</i> old classmates, too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After all, it was not enough to <i>be</i>, it had to be <i>acknowledged</i>, as well.</span></div></div>",

She'd found Richard Burrows!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath, steadied her trembling fingers, and dialled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mommy and Daddy aren't home now.

Bye bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, kid, wait, don't hang up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, the child - probably four years old, had already disconnected the phone.

Yes, still the same, just two streets away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, she made up her mind. Throwing on a coat, she walked to the store down the street and purchased a big teddy bear. Then, she went back home, and got the car out. With her disability, it was faster to drive down, even two streets. Teddy comfortably perched next to her, she drove to the Burrows' home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying Teddy, she walked up the Burrows' driveway and rang the doorbell. The babysitter answered the door - thank goodness, it was Trehana, who knew her! \"Hi Trehana, I was in school with Richard, and I thought I'd get a Teddy for his daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Hi, Aunt Christine, sure, come in.
