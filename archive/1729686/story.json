unfotunatly, it lifted it's arm to block the spear, but thankfully you put enough power behind that it destroyed the golem's right arm. after seeing what you did, you shot 4 balls of flame at the golem, which exploded, causing the golem to be blown back with no armor on it's chest. you kept up the shots and the dodging, but the golem also got some good shots at you, leaving you with a broken leg and arm, a near fractured rib, and severe cuts on your face, along with multiple burn marks. you managed to remove all armor from the glom, but with its lava body exposed, this started to burn your house. it was time to end this so you ran right at it with fire over your arm to protect you from the burn. you then made a flame sphere around your hand and made it expand until  the golem exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter the battle, you used your powers to clean up, nothing to do about the broken furniture. you yelled out-loud,\"ok, what the heck is going on here, where ar my parents\" in the hope that the voice who gave you your powers would hear you, which it did but it was a vision of a beutiful woman who wore a silver, flowing dress. \"you were chosen to be one of very few who shall defend the world from an impending threat. you must leave your home behind and begin to search for others who may posses the powers of the attributes.\" you looked at her in shock and asked her,\" but what about my parents? where are they and wont they worry about me?\" she looked at you with a look of sadness and replied,\"your parents have been banished to where this threat is from, they may not even be alive but if they are, then you must set out to rescue them\" this gave you a sudden schock of hatred and sadness and thats where the vision faded with the woman telling you, \"its up to you to save us\" you are then left in the house alone with major injuries and no clue where to start. you decided it would be best to check on your sister: sam, she was at her swim meet and you two were very close, if you had to leave your life forever, you had to bring her along. before you left, you grabed the emegency money, check books, and credit cards your parents kept around but you stumbled on them one night you were sleep walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen you get everything that you needed, you headed off to the public pool to get your sister and when you got there</span></div></div>",

He had no idea who the girl was, or what he and her were doing there, but he remembered her looking at him with her pretty gray eyes and saying \"this is not your fight child of earth, time to wake up\" and then he was awake. He flipped aside the covers and set his feet on the hard wood floor.

It smelt even better down here than it had upstairs in the hallway! \" happy birthday Mike\" she said excitedly as she nonchalantly flipped the pancakes into the air. \"Ready for some delicious breakfast?\" A huge smile crosses your face. You had completely forgotten about your fourteenth birthday today! You run a hand through your dark brown hair as you plop down at the table. \"am I ever!\" You answer excitedly. Mom heaps several pancakes already drizzled with maple syrup on a plate in front of you. The best part about being the only child? You never had to share your pancakes. \"I have a gift for you son\" Dad said reaching below the table. He lifts up a small intricately carved wooden box. There was an odd hexagram on the lid of it. It was odd because there were six circles connected by lines, each having its own weird symbol within the circles. But one circle was about twice the size of the others. The symbol within it was a flat horizontal line wit two smaller lines branching out of it and two more small lines branching off those. \"Cool!\" Said mike as he pried the lid off. Inside the box was a silver ring. The ring had the same symbol as the over large circle on the lid of the box. But Mike hadn't even noticed that. As soon as he laid eyes upon the ring, he knew he was meant to wear it. Rings weren't even his style! There was something about it, something inside him, that absolutely <i>needed</i> to wear this ring. </span></div></div>",

You walk upon the dank main street of Houston on your way to the conveinence store. A light drop hits your nose and you look up wanting it to just pour, blinding you from the uglyness of your life.
