It had been advertised as a studio apartment but at a mere 10x10, it's barely more than a bedroom. The toilet is next to the kitchen sink. The shower is not enclosed so Jason has to be careful to not get his bed wet when he showers. For a stove, he just has a hotplate, no oven and for a fridge, he just has a small icebox. He doesn't even have privacy. He's sure his neighbors can see him no matter what he's doing in his apartment. If he could afford to move, he would. He also lives in a high crime area where his valuables would be stolen nightly if he had any valuables to steal. He doesn't even have a television. He wants to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, he discovers a loose board behind his icebox. He pushes on the board and gets sucked into a vortex. He lands in a field where the grain is ready for harvest. All he has with him is the clothes on his back: green t-shirt and blue jeans. He hears something nearby. He stands up to see _____.</span></div></div>",

He can still see, hear and feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon says, \"Uh oh.\" He slithers away leaving Jason to wonder if he's dead or not. The gorgon comes back with a minotaur and a centaur. The gorgon is not muscular but both the taurs are muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon says, \"See, he's a stranger. Look at his clothes. Have you ever seen clothes like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur says, \"Mean way to greet a stranger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon says, \"He startled me. No one is supposed to be in this field. Where did he come from that he didn't see the sign?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur says, \"It's okay Jeff. Lord Delia will understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff the gorgon steps over to Jason. \"Sorry, stranger. We don't have a local wizard to reverse this. We'll have to send for a travelling wizard but that might take months. I'll pay for the reversal naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur interupts, \"Don't say that. Lord Delia may charge this stranger for the reversal. After all he was the one trespassing where he shouldn't have been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff says, \"You're right Marcus but I still feel bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus the centaur says, \"Now listen stranger. Lord Delia is away on business and has left me, his personal steed, in charge. As deputy, I sentence you to decorate the plaza until Lord Delia gets back. After your petrification is reversed, Lord Delia will hear your case and determine if my sentence is too harsh. We'll make amends then but for now, it looks like an open and shut case of trespassing to me. Why else would you be in the Lord's personal wheat field. Strip him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three quickly strip Jason, the minotaur says, \"He don't look like he got money. How he pay for reversal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus says, \"Well, Bill, he is made out of gold. We could melt him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill the minotaur says, \"That would kill him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus grabs Jason's freshly exposed genitals, \"We could just shave a little off him. I'm sure he'd be willing to give up a little size in exchange for mobility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill lifts the naked gold statue onto the back of Marcus and Marcus carries Jason to the plaza. There is one main building next to the plaza and it looks like a mansion. Other than a few smaller buildings, the plaza is open to the surrounding fields. It's even on the top of a hill so Jason can be seen for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ponders what it would be like to be exposed for months but realizes that in this place, it's not that big of a deal. Jeff is the only one Jason sees wearing clothes so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, Jason gets to know his place better. There are other humans and other beings that live in the manor or the nearby village. The humans and gorgons typically wear clothes but the brownies and minotaurs typically don't. Jason learns the names of several because they stop and visit with him. The plaza is where everyone gathers for various kinds of get togethers. Even though they all know that Jason is a human, they treat him like a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne woman stops to polish him daily. She says things like, \"Good morning stranger, how's our statue this morning?  Did you get a good night's sleep? It's been rather warm. Now you do a good job, statue. You're job is to be pleasing to look at. When guests come and look at you, they see that we are one of the better manors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther people also take liberties with Jason. The gentlemen strike matches against his legs. Little kids pat his butt or tag his cock to be naughty. Sometimes they tie horses to his cock. Sometimes they dress him up for a festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the time, Jason is bored but he gets used to it. He feels like a bona fide part of the community as people gossip near where he can overhear. One night, he overhears two men talking about stealing some of the gold off the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the conspirators says,  \"You idiot. When the statue is reanimated, he'll report us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other conspirator laughs nervously, \"I'm just joking, statue.\" Even he pats Jason's cock as if it was a normal way to reassure a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason is nervous but nothing comes of the conspiracy. He doesn't see either conspirator again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Delia returns but ignores the statue. Then one day, he says, \"I don't see any reason to change things until the wizard gets here. What would be the point of putting you in storage? Some dignitaries are dropping by for a visit and it would be nice to have a gold statue in the plaza to greet them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visit with the dignitaries is a success. They compliment Lord Delia for the wonderful statue in the plaza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the wizard arrives. He doesn't reverse the whole petrification. He just gives Jason the ability to speak so Lord Delia can finally hear his case and determine if he's a trespasser or not.</span></div></div>",

But from where Jason is looking, there is a gap in the canopy forming a perfect open curtain onto the scene of a farm girl as she bathes. The girl looks to be the same age as Jason or slightly younger. Jason is transfixed to the spot wondering if the girl is single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes a step back only to bump into a wall of muscle. He looks up to see a minotaur and the minotaur does not look happy. Don't minotaur's eat people? The minotaur reaches down and yanks Jason off the ground. The minotaur brings Jason up to his mouth and roars louder than a lion.

I demand my dignity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen says, \"Very well.\" She gestures and Jason's pile of clothes wrap around him and shrink to fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you have magic? Restore me to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen says, \"Everyone here has magic but most of us aren't powerful enough to undo a paradox spell. Don't you have magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where I come from, no one has magic. Will I get magic while I'm here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a possibility but not a guarantee. Although, as a brownie, your chances of developing magic will increase. Brownies have a distant link to fairies and fairies always have magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they are talking, Helen carries Jason by his tail into the mansion to the brownie director, Brad. Brad is in his forties but ruggedly in great shape. He does look like he's been in a fight or two, like he ought to be wearing the uniform of a drill sergeant but he's naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen says, \"Brad, I have a new servant for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad asks, \"Why is he wearing clothes? Did you dress him up? I didn't think you were that cruel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He insisted on wearing clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen sets Jason down in front of Brad. Brad draws his sword and presses the point at Jason's neck. \"Is this true, stranger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason says, \"Yes.\" But Helen feels the need to intervene. \"He was transformed into a brownie by magic. He's human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad eyes Jason a while before withdrawing his sword. Even as he sheaths his sword, he continues to give Jason the look of death. \"Very well. I suppose he can clean out the chamber pots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen says, \"I did warn you. You'd be better off naked. Besides, I think your cute. I've got duties to perform but I'll check in on you later. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen leaves. Brad leads you into one of the brownie passages of the house, the way brownies get around to do their duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jason is in a brownie passage, Brad draws his sword again and attacks. \"Traitor. Human spy.  The king must have sent you here. The revolution is underway and you're too late to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad slashes Jason's clothes off of him aggressively. Jason bleeds in a few places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad yells, \"You think you can force us to wear clothes? You humans are always trying to control us. You demand that we buy clothes from you and that we buy food from you and that we pay your rent. The brownies will live free.\"</span></div></div>",

She loves machines and owns her own business, an automotive repair shop. She also dates and wants a husband. This causes no end of conflicts in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther women give up part of who they are in order to get along in a society that expects women to fit certain roles. Some women give up all aspirations for the sake of finding a husband. Other women give up on finding a husband for the sake of some personsal aspirations. Rachel refuses to be pushed into a category. She wants both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to make her even more three dimensional, Rachel is deeply spiritual. She recognizes the spiritual difference between men and women. She doesn't pursue her mechanical career in an attempt to challenge gender roles. She pursues her mechanical career as a woman, and resents it when people tell her how unfeminine she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis costs her. Many customers refuse to let a woman fix their car. Many employees refuse to obey her. Many employees try to act like the boss and tell her what to do. Many people call her names. Many people expect that if she is going to do a man's job, then she should at least dress and act like a man. But because she dresses and acts like a woman, many people accuse her of being a flirt and a tease. She has even had sexual harrassment cases filed against her despite the fact that she always behaves professionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the dating front, this costs her because boyfriends expect her to live for them. Boyfriends expect her to serve them, to satisfy them, to drop all extra activities for them, to live, eat and breathe for them. She has yet to find an available man that would allow her to have a life. They all want to smother her and replace her life with theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while fixing her own car, she sees a strange glow on her engine block. She puts gloves on and touches it. She is instantly sucked into a vortex. Besides the blue latex gloves, she is wearing work coveralls and make-up, and her hair is tied in a salmon colored scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lands in a lake, not far from shore but deep enough that she can't just stand up. She flails at first before she orients herself for swimming. That's just enough time for a few merfolk to swim up to her. They offer to help her but she recovers on her own and they all swim for shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn shore, she is greeted by a motley crowd of the strangest creatures she has ever seen: centaurs, minotaurs, fairies, and even a male gorgon. They all seem friendly although confused by her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA merman dressed in orange says, \"I'm Eric the fisher. What's your name?\"</span></div></div>",

For further information check out \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/2079307-Guide-to-Mythreal\" title=\"Some of the people, places and things you may encounter in Mythreal\" target=\"_top\">Guide to Mythreal</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"Some of the people, places and things you may encounter in Mythreal\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/2079307-Guide-to-Mythreal\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realm is medieval with many small kingdoms (no empires). However, due to magic, the people enjoy a fairly decent quality of life. Even the poorest people have access to some magic although their magic is limited to a few basic spells such as cloth mending or food preparing spells. Only the wizards can perform grander spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">RULES</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. <span class=\"clred\">Ask permission before adding any creatures or mythological beings.</span> I want some consistency across all the creatures and beings. Most should be species with their own cultures and not monsters. I will not allow beings that cannot be made to fit this realm so no demons, giants or dragons. Regarding giants, I'm establishing a reasonable size limit at no smaller than six inches and no larger than twelve feet for any adult individual. Also no smaller than twelve inches and no larger than ten feet for any species average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. <span class=\"clred\">Don't go overboard with the magic.</span> I'm allowing magic primarily so the protagonist has the opportunity to become a mythological being. I'm also allowing magic so the lives of the poor aren't so depressing. However, I generally dislike magic and how easily it can lead to chaos or godmodding so keep the magic limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. <span class=\"clred\">Sex is allowed but don't overdo it.</span> Gay or straight is fine. In fact, I prefer the protagonist be male. However, I am more interested in the relationship than I am in the sex. Some interspecies sex can produce viable offspring such as half-minotaurs or half-gorgons. It's magic folks. Even a gay couple can magically have offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. <span class=\"clred\">Don't be blood thirsty.</span> Death is allowed and you can even write a story where someone is out to murder someone. However, allow options where the characters survive and don't write any \"last one standing\" type stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. <span class=\"clred\">Don't be gross.</span> This is not a weight gain story or a fart story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. <span class=\"clred\">Write quality.</span> I do reserve the right to edit or delete poorly written chapters.</td>",
