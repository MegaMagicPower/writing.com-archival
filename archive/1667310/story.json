She is a red-head, trim and always wearing her maid uniform out of duty. She is very cold to you upon meeting as she is still saddened by your uncle's passing, who had raised her like his own child. But over time, she will warm up to you and possibly fall in love. Age: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi: Your new chef. She is quite short and chubby, and her cute little babyface and lack of proportions would suggest she is the youngest. In reality, she is actuallly one of the older girls and talks in a mix of childish words and rather risque adult language. Mimi has two long black ponytails, usually wears her chef uniform, and comes up to just above your stomach when you stand next to her. Mimi is always cheerful, but may be hiding an inner pain that only you can help her with. Age: 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu: The house doctor and an amazon of a woman. She is tanned, somewhat muscular, and has the largest bust of all your girls. Suzu is a brilliant doctor, far beyond her years and those of older doctors, curing several problems related to obesity. Suzu seems rather fond of teasing you like a plaything, but you may get through to the real her yet! Age: 24<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate: Another maid that works with Anya. Kate never talks, Suzu explaining something traumatic silencing her. Kate is an albino with pale skin and white hair, and a little overweight yet still cute. She seems scared of you at first, but perhaps you may bring words to her lips once again. Age: 21<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika: An over energetic and rather violent (in a playful matter) security guard. Mika is quite obese, yet she moves like she weighs nothing. Mika is almost always eating and acts like she's nine years old with her juvenile attitude and always needing to be scolded. You're often the victim of her horseplay, but that may just mean she like you...a lot. Age: 26<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which of your girls do you meet first?</span></div></div>",

You had been working extra hard make sure you have plenty of money for food, the bills, etc. Today was supposed to be a day off...so you didn't expect a girl in a maid's outfit to smash down your door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!!!\" you scream, seeing the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-headed maid looks at you and asks for your name. You give it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great...well, orders are orders. You're coming with me,\" said the girl, grabbing you by the collar. You try to fight back, but she gives you one look that terrifies all the strength out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you taking me?'\" you shiver, as the girl forces you into a limo. You note that's a bit weird for a kidnapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your new home. You have an uncle Lucas, right?\" said the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, and nod. But you also remebered getting a notice about his recent passing. You didn't know him that much, except that he was your grandmother's older brother. Apparently, the family didn't speak to him much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the master has passed away...and has left everything he owns to you now,\" said the girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen upon hearing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...do you mean?\" you blink, wondering if by any chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your uncle had a great deal of wealth and a big mansion with several servants. They now belong to you and the servants working for you now. \"I'm Anya, and though you can't replace your uncle, I'm your head maid,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still doubt it, but when the limo pulls up, all doubts disappear when you see the huge mansion that now belonged to you. You look to see Anya, and think you get a cute girl like her working for you? She's a bit skinny, but she definitely is good on the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you staring at me?\" frowned Anya, giving you a look. Right...better not piss her off. She doesn't look like she'll hold back just because you work for her now. You get out of the limo and decide to check out your mansion. You go inside and walk around until you end up in...</span></div></div>",

You observe the elaborate carvings on the nearby doors and ceilings as you continue trekking forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uncle Lucas loved the Renaissance era\" a sad smile creases your lips as you try in vain to remember your uncle; with a sigh you divert your attention to your side and spot a large set of double doors. \"What do we have here?\" you inquire as you grab the elaborate handle and tug the door open; inside was a vast collection of shelves filled to the brim with books. Spiral staircases lead to a second and even third floor with shelves so large that one couldn't conquer one without a ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have found paradise\" your knees almost buckle as you try to decide where to begin. With much haste you head towards a nearby shelf and begin to browse its contents, perhaps living here won't be so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are all first editions\" you marvel as you try your best to avoid smudging the pages \"Uncle Lucas had some strange tastes though, these are all books on myths and legends.\" You speed read through a couple of books before returning them to their rightful places; you climb back down the ladder and turn around to find a pissed off Anya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The master did not have weird tastes\" she quipped as you shrunk back in fear \"There are many practical uses for such knowledge\" you could only nod in agreement as she rambled on in anger. \"This was Master's favorite place so I suggest you bite your tongue here\" she stormed off as you tried in vain to collect your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I gotten myself into\" your head is throbbing due to your increased blood pressure and you begin to massage your temples. \"The throbbing is getting worse\" you take a deep breath and your head begins to clear \"Wait that isn't throbbing its more like thudding.\" You whip around to find an immense woman heading your way; despite her size she seems to be moving effortlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese woman is garbed in a security guard's uniform and seems to be glaring at you; you hate to admit it but you are to memorized to do anything other than stare at her. Her forefront is vast and her presence is intimidating, you were beginning to understand how she was able to maintain her position. Her black hair was tied up in a ponytail and her guard hat was stationed perfectly on her head; her cheeks were plump and you couldn't help but notice a donut sticking out of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou diverted your gaze downwards to her ample chest, two large orbs of pliable flesh, which were thrusting hard against her shirt. You guessed she was easily an E cup as you watched them bounce to and fro across her belly. Her belly was large and divided into two separate yet large rolls of fat; her uniform obscured the large mass making it appear smaller than it truly was. You watched as her large tummy slid beneath her uniform, peeking out from the bottom of her miniskirt,  swinging from side to side across her thighs.  She pushed the donut past her lips and begin to chew softly; each bit of mastication caused a bit of jiggling within her chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Anya went to find you after all\" you whipped your head up quickly trying to avoid another potential disaster; the obese guard smiled evilily as she gauged your reactions. \"I am Mika your personal bodyguard big boy!\" Mika cooed bending over slightly exposing her cleavage to you \"Don't worry I won't let anything happen to you\" she winked and blew you a kiss as you tried your best to keep composed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika giggled as she watched you squirm in anguish \"You should go meet the rest of the servants\" she chimed as she straightened her body upright. \"You should head to meet Suzu; She should be in the foyer right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika erupted in laughter as you sped out of the library's double doors \"Seems like things will be getting pretty interesting now\" she giggled as she waddled off in search of more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou travel through another set of corridors until.....</span></div></div>",

You looked from wall to wall as your walk slowed to a creep down the hall way, slowly taking the paintings, most of them from the renaissance era. You see a figure off in the distance in a maid's uniform. You breath a sigh of relief, this maid was a bit too big to be Anya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pale, and had white hair. She was probably albino. You always thought pale girls were pretty cute and never understood why so many girls did so many odd things to make themselves look tan. She was big, but not quite as big as Mika. She seemed rather harmless and looked like she was enjoying her task at hand, dusting the paintings. So, you decide to talk to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand behind her for a good few seconds, watching her dust before making your presence known. \"Hi.\" You simply say to the girl. She nearly jumps to the ceiling when she hears you. She turns around, a look of sheer terror had befallen her face. Her slightly larger than normal chest was heaving, up and down. Her red eyes, yep she's albino, were open wide, starring at you. You look back at her, a little surprised. \"Are you ok?\" You ask the girl quite concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't talk.\" Said a bold voice from behind you. You turn around to see a fit, well toned woman before you. \"Her name is Kate. According to Lucas, she became mute due to some sort of traumatic incident in her past. She's only ever spoken to Lucas, so none of us know what happened to her.\" The woman explained as she walked over to Kate's side and wrapped her arms around the frightened girl. The woman's ample breasts were in Kate's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shushed the girl and stroked her with calming repetitions of \"It's ok.\" and \"I'm here.\" Kate calmed down in a few seconds. \"She also startles easily, so don't sneak up on her like you probably just did. My name is Suzu, by the way. I'm the house doctor.\" The woman said extending her hand to shake. You shook her hand before she turned back to Kate. \"Kate, this man is our master now. He's a friend and won't hurt you.\" Suzu said to the still slightly frightened maid beside her. \"Right?\" She looking back at you, giving you a slight glare. Suzu obviously cared very deeply for this girl. \"Of course.\" You say with a smile trying to re-assure Kate, who gives a slight nod. She brushed her uniform off after Suzu let go of her. She looked up at you and gave a slight smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, Master.\" Suzu said. \"Let's go meet the others. You too, Kate.\" Suzu continued walking down the hallway. Suzu leads you to...</span></div></div>",

Your amazon of a doctor pulls the double doors open, her impressive stature gives her more than enough might to manhandle such heavy oak. You, still cautious, walk through the doorway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she smacks you on the rump. Terrified, you whip around to face the statuesque woman only to get a faceful of cleavage. \"Well, go on!\" she says playfully, \"As much as I'd like to spend all day showing a cute little boy his house, I have important work to do.\" she cooed, sending a playful wink your way and immediately shutting the door behind you. As you stare at the doors, you can't help but shake the feeling that Suzu might have groped you a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, here you are. Alone in a huge dining room with large intimidating furniture. You can see the opposite end of your table, the chair at that head seemed much more like a throne. Probably yours. But as you walk closer, you can see that the armrests are crafted to resemble dragon's heads, the legs bearing clawed feet and \"scales\" of artistically crafted patterns. This was Uncle Lucas' chair. You try to picture him sitting down in it; an old man looking forward to an elegant meal after a tedious day, licking his lips in anticipation of what glorious delicacies one of his servants, possibly Anya, might place in front of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you can't do it, you still can't place him. He had never been mentioned by Mom or Dad, or even your grandmother, so it wasn't particularly suprising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear something rustling to the right; something was in the kitchen. A wonderful smell wafts into your nostrils, you recognize it as fresh cinnamon buns. You figure it's probably another one of Uncle Lucas' servants doing their job. However, you can't help but shake the feeling that you should probably be polite and introduce yourself...</span></div></div>",

You walk into the kitchen to find what looks like a little chubby kid with a shawl on her head and an apron tied around her little body, as she stands on some kind of low stool to allow her to stand above the counter. The girl is apparently carefully cutting some vegetables to put into the heating pot of broth nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me. Do you know where the chef is, little girl?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" smiled the girl, turning around. \"Oh goody! You must be the new master! I was really hoping you'd get to taste my tasty cooking! I assure you it'll be a taste sensation that will also give you the energy you need for all things, including down there,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?

I make delicious foods that are not only tasty, but vitialize master for the long nights he may need,\" said the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, this girl talks like a kid one point and then like a sexually active adult the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...how old are you exactly? If I may, I mean...\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi blinks and says, \"I'm twenty-five,\" Your eyes widen, making Mimi laugh. \"I bet that shocked ya!

Not like you're good enough to do anything useful, so just walk up there, write your name down, and smile, got it?\" Anya replied, eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anya!\" Mimi stammered, approaching with a second spoonful of broth, \"Here! Have a taste! It's really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really good, huh?\" Anya chuckled, \"No thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Mimi's eyes widened, her once joyous lips curling downward into a broken frown, \"It's really good, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And probably really fattening, too.\" Anya turned around, avoiding Mimi's hurt eyes.  \"I can't get fat.

You want to reach out to help her, to console her, but the fear of Anya's wrath outweighs your desire to help, and, soon enough, she disappears around the bend of the threshold.  You turn briefly to Anya, the silence consuming all the words in your mouth.  Anya's eyes are so deadset, so frustrated, so full of that same teary quality that you saw in Mimi's eyes. You have to say something, and you say the first words that come out of your mouth.</span></div></div>",

Finally, after five seconds of considering, rolling the thoughts over her tongue, she relented, lowering her head as she exhaled. \"He took me in when I was little, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he was like a father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I never really knew my parents all too well. My mother psychologically abandoned everyone, and my dad,in his grief, just abandoned me physically to bring my mom back. They both died a few years later. It didn't really bother me. I was just a kid, ya know? Then again, just not having anyone there is kind of bad too, ya know?  So your uncle, he adopted me when I was really little, and took care of me. I had to clean up afterwards, and I was a real jerk to him sometimes, but he never really got mad at me. He'd just laugh me off, and that would sometimes piss me off even more, but even so, I--WHY THE HELL AM I TELLING THIS ALL TO YOU, ANYWAY!?!?!?\" Anya spun around, her face livid, but her eyes betraying a tear of mourning that ran down her slender cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I dunno!\" you stammered, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez!

At that point, she glanced toward your face, her eyes narrowed lividly. \"You really are an idiot, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya spun around, pointing at you again, \"You really are stupid, aren't you!?  You nodded way too soon! You looked like a friggen idiot! Just nodding like a damn bobbblehead, or maybe it was bubblehead--OR WHATEVER THE HELL THOSE THINGS ARE CALLED!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me to calm down, Master! I can't believe I have to serve a loser like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hate me so much, why don't you just quit, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya's eyes widened, her skin losing all color as she glanced over at you, her eyes wavering in fear. Her lips flapped wordlessly as she tried to speak, but all that emerged was, \"Please, don't do that.\" You didn't need to hear anymore to understand.  The air in the room had grown cold, and you had hurt Anya far worse than Anya had, until now, hurt you.</span></div></div>",

The decor, once only slightly creepy, seemed downtrodden and almost hostile towards your presence. Even you, who had taken much more abuse from her sharp tounge, felt sorry for your poor maid. It was obvious she loved her job and took it very seriously; and for you to threaten to take away her whole life was pretty uncouth. But it wasn't like you could just rewind time, the only thing you could do was move forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe butter her up with something nice to help smooth things out~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mimi?\" you peek your head into the kitchen, finding yourself without much energy after trekking the mansion, \"You got a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny figure perched atop her steppingstool turned around, a single splash of something resembling gravy decorated one chubby cheek. \"Oh, Master!\" she squealed as she tentively worked her stubby legs down the ladder, \"Have you come to try some more of Mimi's Super Stew with Miso Pork?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so hard not to openly coo in this tiny chef's presence; she was just so adorable. \"U-Uh no Mimi, thanks though.\" you respond courteously as your chef stands at attention, \"I was just wondering if you could tell me about that one maid, Anya; I was kind've a jerk to her earlier today and was wondering what kind of stuff she likes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi's adorable little head tilts slightly at your query, \"Anya?\" she parrots, bringing an undersized finger to her chin. After a second or two in supposed \"deep thought\", Mimi's round face lights up with epiphinatic grin, \"Well I like latex and bodysuits, but I think she's allergic to that clingy fiber...\" your expression drops in despair of your babyfaced chef, \"Ooh, I got it; maybe Master could dress up in one of her spare uniforms and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T GO THERE!\" you silence her with your exasperated expression. Despite being cut short, she still smiles and is openly apologetic, \"Oops, sowwy Master!\" she giggles, \"I get carried away sometimes, heehee.\" You sigh, perturbed at Mimi's blatant perversion, \"Anyway, I meant something along the lines of her favorite meal, a dessert... something?\" Mimi took one more shot at concentration, and after an even longer pause, she came up with yet another brilliant idea:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could make her a chocolate cake the shape of a d-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" you holler at the top of your lungs, lest be forced to hear the end of that sentence. \"Wait, the first half of that sentence works, maybe you could help with a chocolate cake for dessert, just for her!\" Mimi shrugs, \"Okay Master, whatever you say~\" she chirps, \"Just don't come crying to Mimi when Anya wanted an eroti-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP IT!!\" you wail, \"NO SHAPES EXCEPT FOR CAKE SHAPE!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As dinner was being served, you sighed in relaxation, glancing at the occupants of the table. Apparently, your late uncle found it costumary to dine with his servents, and, unsurprisingly, you find no qualms about it either. In fact, the company leaves you delighted, overjoyed with their little nuances and characteristics. However, for every second you laugh, you spend two glancing over at Anya, her eyes lowered at the plate of food out before her, slowly stirring it clockwise once and counter clockwise twice.  She never broke pattern, leaving you to wonder if she had a mild case of OCD or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food served for the main  meal was absolutely delicious, and no one seemed to either deny or resist the delicious tastes, the surges of flavor filling up every fiber of the guest's tastebuds.  Even Mimi was found serving herself several plates, drinking the soup heavily. If you saw correctly, at one point she even went into the kitchen, then returned with crumbs sprinkled around her lips from some sort of desert. If she ate some of that cake, for the love of all that was holy--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then dinner was over, and desert was served. You had discussed it before with Mimi, as you took a bite of the cupcake in front you, glancing at Anya as she too nibbled on her cupcake, distractedly and off-handedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you wanna serve it when she's eatin' the rest of her desert?\" Mimi had asked, curiously, before a small, slanted grin crossed her chubby cheeks, \"Ah, if you want I can serve it to you in bed--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in God's name is wrong with you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hormones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going through late puberty, are ya!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sowwy!\" she replied, cutely, \"But seriously, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do that--well--she's proud. I don't think she'd want others to see her vulnerable, ya know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as your mind returns to the present, as the rest of the people leave the table. Anya remains behind, which saves you the trouble of having to single her out to stay. Rising with a look of resignation on her face, she walks around the table, head lowered in shame, as she takes your plate. \"Allow me to put your dishes away, mast--\" However, then was when you grabbed her along the wrist. For a second, she stared at you, surprised, before her face knotted in fury. \"Look, you sick freak! I'm sorry, alright?! I was outta line, so what the hell do you want of me now, huh!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay a little behind for a second,\" you say, smiling, \"I have something to show you. It's a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna see your hairy--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it with you people and sex, huh!?\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you aren't gonna rape me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave you that idea!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, idiot, the whole grabbing my wrist when we're all alone? Mental note: doing that screams rape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sounds kinky in there,\" Mimi giggled, poking her head out as she brought in the cake.  She held it out on a glass platter, placing it on the table beside you and Anya. Anya glances at it. It isn't a large cake, but large enough to fill the stomach of a sumo wrestler. Anya glances at it, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a big appetite,\" Anya mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who is it--oh.\" Anya's shoulders slumped down as she took a seat beside you, her cheeks filling with scarlet blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to apologize for before. I'm sorry. I was out of line by threatening to fire you. I know this place means a lot to you and everything. so--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only place I know as home, ya know,\" Anya replied, simply, \"I grew up here. All my happy memories were here. A job is a job, you know, but, well, this isn't just a job. it's my home. I was so afraid you were just gonna throw me out I just--I just--\" Tears ran down Anya's cheeks as she covered her face, sobbing into her hands as she rested her head against your shoulder. Uncertain how to respond as tears soaked onto your skin, you simply pressed a hand comfortingly on her shoudler. Mimi giggled a little before retreating behind a door, leaving a fork and knife for Anya to eat with. The two of you sat there for awhile before Anya finally rose, sniffing slightly, rubbing her eyes as she smiled, ever so slightly. \"You're still an idiot, ya know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya managed to eat every crumb of the cake that night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hallways seemed much less hostile that following morning, in fact everything seemed brighter and much more upbeat after making amends with Anya. The sun was shining, the birds were chirping, and the halls were glisteningly clean and imaculately tidy. Your bed was cozy yet spacious and the sheets soft and silky. You awoke to the scent of fresh lavender and a nice warm bath already drawn for you. All in all, it had been a great morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Master.\" Anya bows slightly as she meets you in the foyer, \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a hearty yawn and stretch vigorously, \"You bet, I'm almost sorry I had to get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, if there was one woman who could ruin your good mood; that woman was Anya. \"Well, sorry to be a spoilsport, but...\" your head maid grunts slightly as she picks up a hefty stack of papers and drops them into your unwitting hands. \"You've got work to do.\" she says plainly, \"While you slept your morning away, I decided to help you out a bit and categorized.\" she rested a hand on top of the mighty stack and glared at you, \"Your uncle would have already been half-done by this hour; Idiot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fill these out,\" she gestured to the top of the stack, \"deliver these to Suzu in her office,\" she pat the middle, \"and... and I'm not too sure what to do with these, so I just kinda piled them up on the bottom.\" she pondered over the remaining third of the pile, \"Ask Suzu while you're down there, she'll know.\" she pat the top of the stack, \"Anything with a red stamp on it is just a duplicate, and reciepts just go in a stack for now; so the workload probably won't be too heavy for you this time. Slacker.\" she quipped, \"Got all that, or do I have to repeat it more slowly next time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your good mood thoroughly thrashed by Anya and her stack of paper, you solemnly resign to your fate; one that apparantly didn't include a lazy morning in your new mansion. \"Um... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya giggled, \"I'll try to catch you after you've woken up a little bit next time.\" she smirked gently, \"You are just an idiot after all, but after a few weeks of this I'm sure you'll only be a moderate failure.\" At first, you can't help but feel just a little bit insulted by the pet name 'idiot', if you could call it that. But slowly, you catch onto a few key differences in Anya's demeanor; you see that she didn't seem near as stern as usual, and she had been much less willing to sling around insults this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling okay?\" you finally ask, a little wary of her newfound warmth towards you, \"Well, my stomach is still a little stuffed after all that cake last night, but other than that I'm fine.\" she responds sarcastically, \"It's gonna take me weeks to work off all those calories...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember last night, Anya delicately pecking away at Mimi's cake soon turned into ferociously packing it away before you finally gave up and turned in. It was understandable that she still feel a little queasy, maybe when she was sick she was nicer? Go figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so long as you're all set, I've got work of my own to do.\" she nonchalantly strolls out of the lounge, \"Don't screw it up too badly, alright Master?\" You laugh, finally catching her game. \"Yeah, sure, don't break anything!\" you try bantering with her, she only laughs as she continues down the hall. She turns slightly, pale skin glistening like porcelain in the bright morning sun. She smiles lightly, eyebrows raised slightly with a superior look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really suck at this.\" she chuckles</span></div></div>",

Knowing your track record, you'd just trip and drop everything, or maybe something else might happen to screw it all up. Sighing, you resign to your fate, filling out the form, stamping where it much be stamped, and every other tedious chore associated with filling out forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled out forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the best way to describe the albino maid Kate as she entered the room, dusting the furnature, going upon her pudgy tippy-toes as her soft, delicate, yet still pudgy hands brushed and stroked away the numerous turrets and appendages of the chamber, every surface polished off before your eyes. As eye strain settled in from staring into the dark ink, you'd glance over at her trials, just to find something else to do. You'd notice, with mild bewilderment, how Kate's derrier trembled and her pudgy upper arm shook when she brushed the dust away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pretty cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, if Anya caught you slacking off, she'd probably just beat you upside the head with a frying pan.  Hastily, you turn back to work. You resolve not to look at that girl's glorious thighs, or her pudgy stomach, or anything about her. Still, the problem with willing yourself not to do anything is that, in the end, you're just reminding yourself that it exists. Indeed, it's hard not to take a peek occassionally at someone else in the room when you're trying to ignore them, especially when your thoughts go to rather dirty places. You felt disgusted with yourself for feeling that way, yet what other choice did you really have other than to submit partially to longing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, when she set down a tray of tea and cookies for you, you smiled ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kate,\" you replied, sampling her delicious cookie with a little sip of tea, \"It's great, really it is.\"  Kate blushed, her chubby cheeks filling with scarlet as she tipped her head down, her double chin forming ever so slightly as her collar bone pressed against the underside of her jaw. \"So, uh, did Mimi make this?\" Kate nodded, her hair flopping up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't talk a lot, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate shook her head, silently frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why not? I'm sure you have a lot to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate blushed once more, glancing off at her toes as opposed to actually glancing you right in the eye. Her cheeks were now scarlet like a rose in a rose garden, her entire body almost trembling from anxiety, fingers interlocking carefully and anxiously as the seconds passed, her eyes glancing toward every window and door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she so nervous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, are you sure you don't want to tell me? I am your new master, after all.\" Anya had opened up to her pretty easily before. She was a good girl, Anya was. Sweet under that sour exterior, and you truly wished to get a better feel for her, too. Kate was cute, too. Why didn't she speak? Did somethign traumatic happen to her? Probably. Probably why she was so shy, too. Nervous of rejection, perhaps? Or of attacks? Maybe she was an orphan like Anya and was abused in some way before being adopted by his uncle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Anya emerged, a tray filled with tea and cookies, more cookies than Kate had supplied, as she walked in, a lazy smile on her lips. \"Hey, idiot, I'm sure you're slacking--\" However, the moment her eyes landed on Kate, her lips tightened, her eyelids lowered as her pupils filled with a cold, empty fire. You felt a chill run through your spin as you stared at her, trembling. With silent fury, she said, in an off-handed tone, \"Oh, Mimi told Kate to give you a snack, did she? I guess she must've forgotten when she gave me this, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, probably,\" you laughed, trying to sound off-handed. Kate, however, lowered her gaze to teh floor, ashamed and mildly terrified as she slowly inched away. Anya, however, smirked a rather cruel, furious grin.  \"Why're ya leavin' so soon? Don't you still have to clean a little more, Kate?\" Kate nodded, slowly, her eyes wide with anxiety. \"Then get to it already. The dust isn't gonna dust itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kate staggered out of the room, glancing over her pudgy shoulder every second or so to ensure that Anya wasn't going to throw something at her, the scarlet haired maid clenched her fists, and stomped frustrated on the floor. What was up with her, anyway? Why was Anya reacting like that? Yes, you could sense more fury deep within her heart, but the fact that there was fury at all just because Kate was doing her job seemed a bit much, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't you see? She's tryin' to get your attention again. That little brat kept putting on that whole not speaking thing for him, too. It's just that she wants attention is probably all She acts so delicate and frail, too. The litle actress should get an Oscar. And you!\" Anya snapped, turning toward you with a look of frustration, \"Eat my cookies, alright? She probably messed up somewhere along the lines with serving them. She's always so  clumsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but what about her cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya snatched one of the may from her bowl, and munched on it, before pulling a second little treat from the same bowl, a renewed sort of joy in her eyes, a grin on her lips. \"Ya know, Anya, if you want my cookies, you can have 'em.I really don't like sweets too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya glanced at you as though you had twenty heads with lobsters crawling out of your ears. \"Well, no sweets? I guess I'll help myself, then.\" Anya reached a shakey hand into both cookie bowls, feeding herself two cookies at once, a look of euphoria on her lips as she started nibbling delicately, refined, before degenerating, eating it like a girl possesed, crumbs falling over her outfit. After leaving both bowls half-empty, she caught herself, drew back, and brushed off the crumbs with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid...\"</span></div></div>",

Their high spirits didn't seem to last long when one of your servants was unhappy. Or maybe you were just imagining things, it was only a house after all. But somehow, you feel the negative emotions pouring from the siding, reflecting off the tiles, and even exhibited by the oil paintings. While you were by no means in a terrible mood, you were far from chipper in these halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was the fact that you were stuck lugging around about twenty pounds of paperwork down two flights of stairs; all of which had to go to Suzu. The cumbersome stack got heavy after a while, and you wished more than anything that you could put the stack down; but knowing your luck your ever-present battletank of a maid would catch you \"slacking off\" and find some household object to beat you with. So, reluctant and already winded, you tough it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the upside, it's given me lots of time to think.\" you mumble to yourself, \"I guess about Anya, she's been acting really weird today...\" you whisper going down another staircase, \"Like with Kate, she didn't do anything wrong...\" you mutter passing the kitchen, \"But Anya still bit her head off...\" you come across the lowermost foyer of the mansion, \"I wonder what's up with her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talking to yourself, Master?\" a familiar, sultry tone upsets your self questioning, \"I'm sure I could prescribe some anxiety medication to take care of that.\" Turning around, being very careful not to let any wayward sheets fly off the top of the mighty stack, you see that your doctor had snuffed you out. \"Oh, Suzu!\" you cheer, releaved that you can finally get to put down your heavy burden, \"I'm so happy to see you!!\" Suzu took a curt sip of her coffee and a slight exhale before responding, \"And I you, Master, I've been so bored without my paperwork to keep me company.\" she quipped. Her tone was dry, yet you still couldn't tell if she was being sarcastic or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can put those in my office, if you please.\" she says plainly, your expression drops. \"Oh come now, don't pout young Master.\" she purrs, taking a few steps towards you, \"You've made it this far, why not take just a few more steps?\" you blush slightly at her light teasing; her office wasn't that far away after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Suzu?\" you peep after a few steps, \"Oh, you're not tired already are you; such a weak little boy.\" she states plainly with another sip of coffee, \"Why does everyone here have to bust my chops?!\" you holler, \"Sorry, do go on.\" your statuesque doctor chuckles slightly at your outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I wanted to know a little bit more about Kate.\" you say, readjusting the stack of papers, \"I mean,  I know you said she only talked to Uncle Lucas, but you two seem pretty close and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You seemed much more interested in Anya yesterday.\" Suzu purred, \"Are you going to keep switching favorites like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turns hot, cheeks boiling red at the notion of you having an attraction to your battleaxe head maid. Sure she was cute, but- wait, that's not the point. \"N-No, I just figured that-\" Suzu cuts you off yet again, much to your chagrin, \"I'm afraid I can't tell you much,\" her pace slows, mood shifting from coldly playful to deathly serious, \"But I do know that she's very delicate; do anything to hurt her and you'll surely suffer the consequences.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver, \"I-I-I would never, I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but of course, you're just a good little boy after all~\" she takes one last sip before whipping out her keyring and coming to a complete stop, \"If you think you can make it, my office is in here, little boy.\" she pops the key into the lock, activates the tumbler, and opens the door, \"Just put them on my desk and you can go.\" Suzu says boldly as she meanders into her office, \"Thanks for keeping me company.\" she says politely as you walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... no problem?\" you smile warilly at the enigmatic woman, \"Oh wait, what about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, due to the tight springs on Suzu's office door, the heavy oak shut itself before you could finish that sentence. \"Kate...\" you finish your sentence solemnly. \"Huh... I guess I'll just have to find out myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething soft bumps into you from behind, cutting your sentence short. A meek sound without much of a pitch peeps from behind you. You turn to see Kate, who if you had to guess was so busy looking at her feet that she didn't notice you in the doorway. In her plump hands was a tray of cookies and on her tested belt a featherduster. Her face was cherry red at your gaze and she seemed to be taking tiny steps backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kate,\" you try to keep your tone soft but familiar, \"I'm sorry, I guess I didn't see you there.\" nervously, the plump maid shrinks up into herself, \"I take it you're supposed to clean Suzu's office right now, huh?\" you ask, to which she responds with a meek nod. \"Well... I guess I won't keep you.\" her expression shifts slightly and she extends the silver tray of cookies towards you. \"Oh, for me?\" you ask, pointing to yourself, \"Thanks Kate!\" she smiles lightly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... how cute.\" a Suzu's voice booms from no where, \"Kate, why don't you take the hour off and play with our little master?\" you can hear her pause to take a sip of coffee, \"My office is clean enough as is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly spooked by Suzu's seemingly omnipotence, your expression drops yet again. \"S-Suzu?\" you ask, voice cracking in fear, \"How are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intercom outside my office.\" she answers curtly, and with a click she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little wary about Suzu and why she was allowed to have her own PA system, you decide that this is a perfect opportunity to get to know Kate better. \"Well, you heard her Kate.\" she jolts upright at your address, \"Whaddaya say we head to the foyer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red eyes light up and a happy smile crosses her cherubic cheeks, she nods vigorously and allows you to lead her back to the lowermost foyer of the mansion...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walked down with Kate, down the hallways as they approached the lobey.  You delicately poked her arm, unable to resist touching the soft flesh for  very much longer. At first, Kate flinched and recoiled, as though the finger was like ice pressing against the warmest of surfaces, but soon relaxed, her shoulders lowered, her vertebre unrolling and unclenching as she sighed. She glanced over at your face, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took this as an invitation to poke her yet again, which you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something so simply and rhythmic about poking Kate.  It started out with the plushy arm, a soft surface filled with flesh.  Bountiful, creamy white flesh.  Her skin was so pale, after all, so very white.  Whenever you made contact, you left a slight imprint in the form of a scarlet dot, much like her irises.  Soon, however, you began poking her belly, covered up by her maid uniform. You poked again and again, watching as Kate recoiled silently, a strangled giggle on her lips as she backed away, her smile there, her cheeks flushed, yet a restraintment imposed, a sense of forbidden delight no doubt surging through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to this girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Kate, why don't you talk?  I'm just curious is all. I mean, I just think you'd feel a lot better if you opened up to me, seeing as how I'm your new master and everything,\" you said, shrugging as Kate pressed a pudgy finger against her chin, thoughtfully. she sighed slowly as she lowered her head, lips pursed, forehead puckered, as the seconds passed by, ticking on the clock as she lowered her head, her double chin spreading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could give a response, a shrill voice filled the lowermost froyer: \"What're you two doing!?\"  Kate flinched as Anya emerged from a nearby room, glancing at the two of them as though she had just walked in on a violent scandal of sorts. Indeed, she sort of had; you were flirting, after all, with one of your own maids after promising to spend more time with Anya during meals. You couldn't truly blame the scarlet haired girl for her rage; you had lead her on, and now she felt the sense of betrayal surge through her heart, an icy pain which even Hell knew not of. \"Idiot, don't you have work to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave it to Suzu. She'll handle it, she said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure she will.  But what about Kate?  Suzu gave her time off, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" you reply, \"but so what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya sighed, running a hand up her forehead as she glanced aside, blush filling her own cheeks.  \"I have more work for you to do is all. Not like I actually care whether an idiot like you has any fun anyway. Stupid. I have more papers to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frowyer was silent for several seconds as all eyes turned on Kate, her chubby hands balled up momentarily into fists. However, upon realizing what she had said, she recoiled, glancing once more at the ground. Anya, however, drew closer, her eyes narrowed in frustrated anger. It was restrained, yes, but you could almost smell the fury boiling under the surfaace, surging outward, as she neared her rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it? Stop what? Doing my job? Do you want me to just lay down and do nothing like you? Hmmmm?\" Anya snapped, her eyes wide with fury, \"Oh, I'm sure some of us have the time to just longue around in Mimi's kitchen and just snack all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's out of line, Anya!  One more word and you're fired.\" As you expected, Anya stopped in her tracks, her eyes wide as her hands trembled anxiously. She backed away, glancing at the ground in shame and fury. You felt bad for her yet again, but she was still out of line for making that comment about Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair. It's always you everyone likes,\" Anya whispered, simply, \"What's so great about you, huh, Kate? WHY DOES EVERYONE ALWAYS LIKE YOU AND NOT ME!?!?!?!\" Anya darted off, tears running down her cheeks, slamming the door harshly behind her as you reached out for her, helplessly watching a piece of sheetrock tumble from the ceiling from the force of the impact. You sighed, lowering your head.  Now it all made sense, why Anya had been so upset. Dare as she wanted to blame Kate for being mean to her, or for taking things away, or for trying to pretend to be shy and timid to garner attention, the truth was, when one got right down to it, was that the real reason Anya hated Kate was that she took everyone's eyes off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took away their admiration for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took away her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Kate?\" you asked, glancing over at the chubby maid. She nodded, slowly, eyes watering slightly.\"You wouldn't mind cleaning that up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Kate withdrew a shovel and broom, hastily sweaping up the pieces of ceiling off the floor.</span></div></div>",

The sky was filled with dark clouds, rain tapping down on the windows incessantly, dim lighting conditions bringing shadows to life as they stared down your meek person. \"These hallways are scary...\" you mumble to yourself as you get stared down by seemingly intimidating grimaces in paintings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't entirely sure if the house really followed the demeanor of each and every one of your servants, or if it was just your concience trying to irk you. Not only had you upset Anya, again, your interferance had also resurfaced buried feelings of betrayal and jealousy in your head maid. Not that she didn't deserve it, harsh feelings or not Anya was still pretty harsh towards her poor staffmate. But whether she deserved a little scare or not, as Kate and Anya's master it was your job to make sure that everyone in the household got along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that seemed like a job much easier said than done...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Anya?\" you peek your head into the maids' quarters warilly, \"You got a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, she jolts backwards to face you. Her soft ivory skin was flushed red, and her eyes still puffy; she obviously hadn't stopped crying since her sudden departure. \"Wh-What do you want; come in here to yell at me some more?!\" she barks, still sobbing heavilly, \"I'm not sorry about anything I said!\" she snaps, \"I'm a better maid than her, she doesn't do ANYTHING, you should fire he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off with a firm hand on her shoulder and a stern look, \"Anya, I'm sorry I threatened to fire you again, I shouldn't have gone there.\" she interjects once again, \"You're damn right you shouldn't have!\" you silence her, \"But I really think you and should work these feelings out with Kate.\" Anya looks at you, appalled that you would suggest such a thing, \"You really think that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know you don't really like eachother,\" you take your hand off of her wavering shoulder and meet her gaze with soft eyes, \"But if you and Kate don't settle this, you'll never feel any better.\" Your smile seems to comfort her just a little, her breathing was becoming less erratic and her tears had dried ever so slightly. \"But...\" she sniffles, drawing in a little closer to you, \"I don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you meet me in the dining hall?\" the suggestion seems to confuse her, Anya's facial expression twisted slightly after the sentence was out, \"Wh-Why?\" she asks, her tone regaining her familiar indignant pitch, \"Just trust me, how's lunch for you?\" you smile, bringing a hand to her toned arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-uh...\" she composes herself, readjusting her fiery locks and tidying up her uniform a bit, though missing some small unexplained chocolate stains on the corners of her mouth, \"I can go now, no big deal after all.\" she says after a deep inhale. \"No rush, around noon is just enough time for me to get everything ready.\" you start towards the doorway, leaving Anya just a little confused...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, in the dining hall, you had a fairly easy time roping Mimi into providing refreshments for your ametuer therapy session. The hard part however, was convincing the chef that it was in no way an attempt to get either of them in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S NOT A THREESOME, MIMI!!\" your protest echoes throughout the dining area much louder than you would have intended. Kate, who was seated in your direct view quietly munching away at a platter of cookies, turned scarlet red at the idea. \"Sowwy!\" the dwarfed woman giggles, \"You know how Mimi gets carried away sometimes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how'd it turn out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, as always!\" she gave an adorably undersized thumbs up, \"You, Anya, and Kate can soon indulge in a debaucherous meal made specifically for you in no time!\" You, as well your muted maid, turned bright red, \"THERE'S NOTHING DEBAUCHEROUS ABOUT IT!!\" you correct her sternly, \"IT'S JUST A MEAL, JUST A MEAL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure Master!\" she says, undaunted by your hysteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S TRUE!!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The platters of food were wafting steam high into the cieling as Anya entered. You could tell by the immediate bulge of her eyes she hadn't expected such a grand meal, but as she glanced over at Kate, she lowered her gaze, mildly irritated, yet even more so morose. She took a seat immediately next to you, pulling her seat up as she mumbled, \"Figures she's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, feeling the sweat billowing over your palms. For a moment, you consider that this entire plan is doomed to fail, that there isn't a shot in hell that these two people could ever come to any sort of understanding in any way, shape, or form.  It was a hopeless situation, it seemed, yet, by the time the first course was served, you found yourself resigning to continue hoping for a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't a massive eater.  Yes, as a man your appetite was traditionally more pronounced than women, who are physically smaller and thus require less food.  Regardless of your miniscule hunger, you still stuffed yourself to the gills with food, and yet the two maids outdid you effortlessly. Yes, they were restrained and classy as they stuffed their cheeks full of veal, brocolli, and pasta, yet there was an air of competition between the two of them, as Anya  continuously glanced up as she slowly increased the speed of her delicate munching. Indeed, Kate increased the quantity of food on her fork, before, by the time you finished your second plate, they started on number four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I win! Take that!\" Anya laughed as she finished her sixth plate before Kate could finish her fifth. The scarlet haired girl leaned backward, pressing her fingers gingerly against her bloated belly, which, you noticed, bulged out under her breasts, visibly pulsating as her body struggled to  both contain and digest the foor. Anya's eyes were unfocused, a small grin on herl ips despite the fact she  could not truly see straight anymore. After completing her fifth plate, Kate leaned backward, hands on her stomach, slowly prodding it with her pudgy fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Anya leaned forward. \"What're you doing?\" Kate blushed, unwilling to talk. \"C'mon, tell me. I wanna know,\" Anya repeated, only to recieve the same response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesnt' talk to people she doesn't trust,\" you replied, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see how it is!\" Anya spat, turning her head away, \"So she's too good to just talk to me, huh? That just figures!  Kate has an additude, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she wouldn't if you were nice to her,\" you repled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya frowned slightly, lowering her head, \"Now it all makes sense. You did all this just so I'd be nice to her, huh? As though she deserves my respect? How about she's nice to me, huh? Ever think of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddya mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ask her all the time to help me out, but does she ever even turn around and just tell me she heard me? And whenever something spills over and I ask her to clean it, all she does is just pouts and runs to Suzu, and then I have to clean up her mess because she's sensitive! I mean, really? I don't mind doing some of the work, but it's almost like I'm the only important maid who does anything here, and then all she does is just sit on her butt, eat snacks, and knock stuff over! And then everyone loves her but not me!  Everyone pays attention to her but never me. It's like I don't even exist! I can't take it anymore!\" Anya lowered her head into her hands, smothering her face in her hands as she slowly began to heave with sobs, head lowered, pride broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate rose from her chair, moving delicately with her full belly, and made her way toward Anya as she sobbed. Very slowly, she removed a hankerchief at her side, and handed it to the head maid. Anya glanced up, tears running down her cheeks, before she accepted it, silently, and loudly, almost comically, blew her nose in it, before handing it back to Kate. She held it up between her pudgy index finger and fat thumb, holding it away at arms length as she walked away, only to return to Anya, and go down onto her knees. At first, none of you knew what to expect, but soon Kate probbed her fingers against Anya's bloated belly. At first, she recoiled, holding her startled screams behidn her lips, before her shoulders sagged, her body grew limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels kinda good,\" Anya sighed, almost in a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Mimi chose to walk in. For a moment, she stared at the scene as you stammmered, \"This isn't what it looks like. Really, it isn't. It's just, uh, well, it's sorta--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi closed the door again, but you couldn't help to hear the pudgy little elf of a woman laugh, \"Take your time! Use a condom!\"</span></div></div>",

But truth be told, you'd been having Mimi cook them lunches for about a week now without anyone else's consent before a certain ponytailed gaurd barged in and spoiled everything. But, regardless, the rest of your staff seemed perfectly fine with the time off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika, however, was far less than enthusiastic. \"AW!!\" she whined, letting her doughy arms flop uselessly her bulging sides, \"I WANNA HAVE A BREAK TOO!!\" she groaned to show her displeasure, \"How come they get a break, huh Master?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu, unpeturbed by Mika's underaged behavior, swallowed a mouthful of coffee and coldly stated, \"Do you have emotional baggage?\" Mika blinked stupidly, her slouched position expanded her lowermost chins as they struggled against her collarbone, \"Yeah! Loads of it!\" she cried, \"I got baggage, I get a break then, right?!\" Mimi poked her flabby housemate's bubble butt, \"Not saddlebaggage~\" she peeped innocently, \"WHY YOU-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then!\" you step inbetween the feud before it can escalate further, \"So, no qualms about it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a problem.\" Suzu purred, \"Nope!\" Mimi chimed, \"I guess not...\" Mika pouted, crossing her wide and wobbly arms over her cleavage. Your smile returns, \"Alright guys, thank you so much!\" you thank your staff genuinely as you start back into the dining hall. \"Excuse me, Master?\" Suzu pipes up before you can even so much as open the door, \"Oh, sure Suzu.\" you turn back to face her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember that your job here is to run the house,\" she winks, \"Not gallavant with your incredibly attractive hired help~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, again Suzu had found a way to push your buttons without actually pushing your buttons. She was good at that. \"O-Okay, so... what can I do?\" you stutter, trying to unwrap your tongue from the bow-tie Suzu's flirtatious wink had left it in. The amazon doctor puts an elegant finger to her chin, counting off each of your trials on her fingers enticingly, \"Well, you've done your paperwork for this week... filed our reciepts, paid the bills...\" she seemed to be at a loss, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it, you could inspect the mansion and see to it that your employees have everything that they need!\" she seemed proud of herself, a genuine smile sparked some dimples you hadn't seen before. \"Oh, well sure I could do that.\" you search your pockets for a writing utensil, knowing fully well that you left your good pen on the dresser. \"You got a pen I could use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu chuckles, \"Oh no, not now!\" she waves you away, \"After you have lunch with those lovely ladies in the dining hall, silly boy!\" Again, your face manages to find a darker shade of red to show your embarrassment, \"Oh, yeah, sure right!\" you stutter as she saunters off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the dining hall to see a by now familiar sight, Kate and Anya with lots and lots of food. It seemed that the boiling hatred Anya held for Kate had settled slightly after spending an hour and a half together every week. And while Kate still hadn't spoken hair's more than a word to either one of you, much to Anya's distaste, her expressions were getting softer and softer with each passing day. In more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredibly luxerious meals were one thing; rack of lamb, pheasant, quail, expensive imported sushi, sirloin, all these things were things that Mimi excelled in. But the problem was that both maids recieved a healthy surplus of food, while not near as competitive as that first day they were still far from deprived. Anya insisted on at least two healthy portions, and Kate's appetite wasn't exactly modest either. And in a week, you couldn't help but notice that those uniforms looked just a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey you loser!\" Anya pat your rightful seat <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">by her</span> at the head of the table, \"We've been waiting for you!\" Kate looked at you as if to agree with her redheaded counterpart, nodding excitedly. \"Sorry for the wait!\" you laugh, making your way across the hall to take your designated seat. As you pass Anya, Kate catches your eye, who in return blushes and starts nervously twiddling her pudgy fingers; which if you weren't mistaken looked just a little pudgier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, were they mad?\" she barked through a heavy bite of mutton. You can't help but let out another chuckle, \"Well, no one but Mika, but I think she just wants to get a bite too...\" Kate's expression showed signs of a stifled giggle, \"Yeah I'll bet, but let's be honest, all she does is play around and sit on her fat butt all day.\" she sneers to no one inparticular, \"Let's be honest, us maids do all the real work!\" she swallows, \"You think I could get this with some barbecue sauce if I asked?\"</span></div></div>",

You gulped, nervously as Suzu turned back toward you, a frown on her lips, an anxious, sullen frown. \"I--er--what is the phrase?--I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother speaking,\" Suzu replied, frowning, \"Look, you seem to care about Kate, but rest assured: if you harm her, I will see to it that your achilles tendons are severed and used as clothing hangers, understand?\" You were silent as you visualized that grizzly image. A grin surged across the woman's lips, which lead you to believe, for an instant, taht this was the end, that you were going to die becasue of a mad employee. However, soon she broke into a smile, patting you on the head, \"I doubt you would, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you checked all of Suzu's possessions, examining her work station, and interrogated her, a single questiom emerged in the back of your mind. It was small, almost unimportant really. However, no question had plagued him more since he arrived in this estate, and thus no other question brought him to this desperate point of need, a requirement to hear the answer, be it good or bad, as he did now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why doesn't Kate speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, he had said it. Simple, done with. Suzu turned toward him, and you expected a frustrated expression. Rather, all you recieved was a morose frown. \"Oh, sweetie, listen very carefully to waht I ahve to say. I don't feel like repeating it again, so rest assured this is the one and only time I'm gonna say it. When Kate was little, she was adopted by our former master, and, for awhile, she was a happy baby, always light hearted and cheerful, never wishing harm on others. However, it wasn't long before everything just changed. It was the night of Christmas Eve, I remember it well, when her old parents came back and took her home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, i thought she was adopted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because you're adopted doesn't mean you're old family isn't still alive. Your uncle had assumed the same thing, so when they came home that day and took her away without a warrant, he found every lawyer in the country he could affort to get her back. However, from waht we could tell, there was a good reason we were lead to believe the parants were dead. After all, if they were dead, we'd make no attempt to contact them, right?  Well, what happened was that, when Kate was returned to us, she was silent, refusing to speak a word. Physical examines proved her vocal cords were perfeclty fine, but...\" Suzu paused, running a hand through her hair, \"But, well, there was scar tissue around her vaginal walls. They were the type of scars that only come from contact with, well, metal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor awhile, you couldn't speak. All you could do was stare at Suzu, your eyes wide. Finally, you could breath. Kate was raped. She was brutally invaded on the deepest corridors of a woman's body, invaded on the deepest level: ravaged and brutalized inside of her most sensative of realms. You felt like punching her parents with all her might, beating them seneseless as they fell to the grouond, but you doubted that would make Kate feel any good. If they found vaginal scarring on the poor girl's body, no doubt her parents were punished as it were. Kate wasn't consumed by a desire for vengance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was grieved by memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just a young girl, but I still tried to take care of Kate, and your uncle eventually told me everything about her when I came of age. But Anya, well, she didn't know anything. We never bothered telling her, and her lack of knowing ended up leading her to believe it was all an act. We could never bring ourselves to telling her the trouth, but for the life of me I don't know why. Maybe you can change that, you know? Tell Anya everything. She has a right to know, ya know?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, you briefly mull over sending the silly feud for attention between your maids by informing Anya of Kate's story. But, after considering the either scalding fury or chilling indifference that would follow, you decided against it. What Suzu just trusted you with was sacred, and if she hadn't told Anya yet then there was no reason for you to go spread it around the household. For now, it was your job to comfort Kate; to let her that you knew and felt sympathy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the mysterious doctor seemed to read your thoughts; shaking her head slightly as she stood. Suzu brought you into a comforting embrace, her cleavage softly eveloping your head before you could even so much as open your mouth. \"Listen,\" she purred gently, \"I love Kate, but she wouldn't want you to pity her.\" she strokes your head lightly, her skin suprisingly soft for a woman of her impressive build, \"Please, keep this just between us?\" she tilts your head towards her's with an elegant finger, smile spreading just a little further as she noticed how red your face was getting. She brings your head in closer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, before you knew it, the embrace was over in literally an instant. You were at the exiting end of Suzu's office door, and she was giving you a dainty finger-wiggle wave, \"Buh-bye now, little Master~\" she chimed, the door slamming shut behind you; who was left dazed and confused. \"Uh... what?\" you turn around to be met with the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I forgot to mention, I'm low on donuts.\" she buzzed over the intercom, \"Grab me a few from the pantry?\" a small pause followed, \"Or Mika's gaurd post, whichever.\" Click; she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sure was a strange woman, that Suzu... But you completely understood, if she wanted Kate in the dark about your knowledge of her trauma then so be it. Mostly, it was the fear of your tendins being used to hang clothes that kept you from saying anything. That malignant gleam in her eyes was proof enough that she was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by someone tapping at your back, something soft brushing up against your rear. \"Ahem.\" an impatient woman clears her throat behind you, \"Excuse me, Master, but I don't think I want you rummaging through my post for donuts~\" you turn to see Mika, trying her best to feign a sour expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you turned to bump into Mika's impressive foremost roll; sending the low flying flab swaying to the left. Mika giggled as she settle her rustled bellyfat, breaking her obviously fake bad mood with a big cheeky grin, \"But, since you've gotta come to my post anyway, I guess I won't mind!\" her pudgy hands wrap around your wrist, grip suprisingly strong for a girl of her size, \"Come on, I'll show you the way!!\" she immediately starts to waddle off at top speed, dragging you along with her without so much as an answer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd believe it or not, you were actually out of breath trying to keep up with her! Mika was fat, but boy was she fast! She slows down as you reach a small, gazebo-like structure outside the surrounding perimeter of your mansion; huffing and puffing fiercely. You weren't in much better shape either, the last couple of minutes she had to drag you by the wrist. She doubles over stuggling past her own gut, unable to rest her pudgy hands on her dimpled knees due to her massive dimensions. As she bends over, you hear a small tick. Not that you cared whether or not her seams split, not only were you preoccupied with thoughts surrounding poor Kate, you also had to get over the motion sickness and catch your breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Mika pauses to gasp and wipe her brow, \"Here's my position!\" Overall, not a very impressive HQ for the gluttonous gaurd. It had an double-wide office chair, a desk with a miniature TV on it, and a few posters taped up onto the ornate carvings that... \"Wait a second, isn't this just a gazebo?\" you gesture to the poorly converted 'office' that Mika held so dear, \"Yup!\" she put her hands on her hip, forving her belly forward proudly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...'Kay...\" you mumble, stepping into the rather unimpressive building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't doing much to help your predicament regarding Kate. You wanted so much just to be there for her, and all this was doing was proving to be a misleading sidequest. \"Look, Mika I don't have time for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the back you could see Mika's bum trying to engulf the chair, not to mention her illfitting trousers, leaving her with an unsightly coinslot effect through the back of the chair. For a girl of her size, her body was far from what one would expect. Her skin looked soft, not a blemish in sight to mar her silky smooth complextion. And while some cellulite was expected on such an obese woman, from what you could see she seemed really well put together. She pat her gut, which surged forward all the way to her knees in her seated position, \"Mm, I'm starved, pass me a donut?\" she gestures to a box just a hair out of her reach. \"Oh... sure.\" you oblige her request somewhat solemnly, still distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" she immediatly pops the tasty morsel into her full lips. \"Something wrong, sir?\" she asks through donut, \"You don't seem near as freaky-outy as you usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shirk away, not so willing to share your problems when they were kept so hush-hush around the household. \"Uh, no I think I got everythi-\" she cuts you off with a whine, \"Aw come on!\" she pats her lack of a lap, \"Come and tell Mika all about it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you just said that it groaned when-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a sturdy chair!\" she bats her eyelashes playfully as she pat the sides, but her playfullness turns to shock when the chair finally cracks underneath her mighty bulk. On instinct, you go to help her out, but are unable to lift the gaurd and are instead pulled on top of her mammoth belly, her carnivorous bikiniline catching your head in the recoil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mika!\" Mimi's familiar tone chimed from outside the gazebo, \"I've got some more Mimi's Super Special-\" her sentence was cut short when she caught you inadvertantly motorboating her taste-tester, \"OH MASTER!!\" the tiny woman cheered you on from the sidelines, \"Way to snag a bigg'in!!\" she imitated a fisherman reeling in a catch, \"I wouldn't reccomend letting Mika on top though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY YOU-\" Both you and your gaurd start towards the tiny chef. You were <i>so</i> not in the mood for this right now...</span></div></div>",

You watched as her cute little chunky  butt, now straining the back of her maid's uniform, trembled with each movement, her eyes focused above. You wanted to reach out, to hug her, to tell her everything was going to be alright, but you held yourself back. You couldn't speak those words, not really, anyway. Your mouth was dry, unable to utter words, and, instead, drew back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not before you noticed Kate withdraw a rather large brownie from a nearby plate, and shoved it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was how Operation Cheer-Up Mika was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou darted toward the kitchen, where Mimi was cooking up lobster, which, to your confusion, had its pincers unbound, snapping the air before it desperately as Mimi playfully dunked the live  creature in and out of the boiling water. Was this woman an animal sadist? That aws never a good sign. Did she really trust such a delicate, tactful operation in the hands of this lunatic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi, I need your help,\" you finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double bag it to avoid needing an abortion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN!!!!!\" you snapped, clencing up your fists fiercely, \"What I mean is that I found out what was bothering Kate so much, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't tell me, can you?\" Mimi asked, pouting adorably before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, can't,\" you replied, honestly, \"Listen, Mimi, I need you to just treat her to some extra food or sweets. Leave 'em out while she's cooking or whatever, and say they're from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww....they say food is the way to a man's heart, but I didn't know it also led to a womans' vagi--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL YOU CUT THAT OUT!?!?!?\" But listen, you can't tell anyone, okay? They'll get really jealous, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi smiled a large, immature, goofy grin, \"Count on me, Master!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The days soon became weeks, five weeks to be exact. For five weeks, give or take a few days, you had taken up residence in a mansion given to you by your late Uncle Lucas and indulged in the luxery his life had to offer. Time soared by here, probably due to the lax conditioning, and before you knew it a bond of sorts had settled in with you and the hired help; a bond far beyond 'Servant' and 'Master'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Retard-\" Anya's cute little pet names, for instance, had been tossed up to keep things interesting between you, \"I'm hungry too, why does Kate get all the brownies?!\" she giggles, something that you still hadn't quite gotten used to. In order to exhibit whether or not she was truly offended after she slung an insult your way, she would usually do something quite the opposite of what someone who was offended would do; like giggle, or lowering her eyelids while raising one of her red brow to form a moderately superior smirk. Deep down, you knew she didn't <i>really</i> hate you. \"Oh, sure thing Anya.\" you take a few sweets from the tray, place them on Kate's piece of china, and pass the remaining platter over to Anya, who responds with a mock-haughty, \"That's better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate, counterclockwise from your head of the table, looks at you gratefully as she takes a dainty bite off of a sugar cookie. That was something else you hadn't quite gotten used to, after all this time Kate still hadn't said more than two words to you. Literally, two words that slipped her lips all those weeks ago were the only ones so crafty enough to escape that tightly sealed vault.  But despite this, you and Kate had grown very close in the past month. Perhaps it was your deliberate spoiling of her that did so, it didn't matter so long as Kate was happy. \"You like 'em?\" you ask Kate simple questions every now and again, just to test to see if it would grease her conversational wheels a bit. She nods, sending her much fuller cheeks bouncing about along with her bangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was evident that spoiling Kate with cookies and candies and other sweets was having an effect on her; more often than not she seemed very happy whenever she was with you, but her figure had started to get much thicker. You remembered the day she outgrew her trusty well-worn uniform, she was scared out of her wits and didn't want to change out of it; forcing her pudgy body into a much too small maid's outfit! It was cute the way her big belly stretched the black fabric to it's absolute limits, but still spilling over her waistline and folding marginally over her apron. Her skirt was far too small that day, and the poor albino could barely take a few steps let alone clean her sectors of the house. But after some motivation from you and Suzu, and attempted motivation from Anya, Kate found the courage to put on a new uniform. But in all fairness, this new one was already looking a little snug on her, you could see her gut just waiting to burst out of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Anya, slender and no-nonsense as she was, had been affected. For some bizarre reason, wherever you and Kate go, Anya seemed to wind up in the same general area! All this time around Kate had led her to claiming a few sweeties for herself, swelling her frame steadilly until she too needed new garments just a little bigger than her too-tight uniform. It wasn't really obvious unless you look at her from the side, her Z-axis was bigger by just a little bit, and you were sure every now and then you could deduce the hintings of a pot belly forming on your head maid, and if she lowered her head you could just barely make out the formings of a slighted second chin. All in all, she was still a beautiful young woman whose body was still knock'em dead hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seconds!!\" even Mimi had swelled up a little bit, due to increased cooking and low impulse control. She was already a little stout, but you noticed that now her belly sagged a little further down her waistline than last month. Give or take a few factors, it was almost big enough to cover her crotch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks Mimi, I'm-\" Anya accidently lets out a very small, ladylike belch, \"full...\" she pats her stomach to show emphasis. Kate nods her head, impressive proportions wobbling in her excitement. Anya takes note of this, looks her up and down and glances at the clock, \"Aw what the heck, we got ten minutes left.\" Mimi giggles, \"'Kay, what about you Master?\" she gets in awfully close to you, resting her chubby cheek in her hand as she leaned on the table, \"What can I serve my sexually depraved Master today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SEXUALLY DEPRAVED?!\" you show your disapproval by, once again, freaking out and returning to a normal tone, \"N-No thanks Mimi, I've contracts to go over and I just stopped by to check in on Kate and Anya.\" Her eyes start to water, big fake crocodile tears, you knew what she wanted. You place your hand on top of her ponytailed little head and rustle it, \"And you too Mimi.\" She squeals, making her way back into the kitchen; her walk starting out as a slight waddle. \"You mean you <i>still</i> haven't looked over those contracts?!\" Anya, in her leaned back position, tilts her head to face you, \"I've been begging you to do those for three days now!\" Kate giggles, putting a small cookie on your plate to make you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing it in your mouth and giving off a slight grin as you depart, you hear Anya remark in a brown voice, \"We gotta get you like, a dry erase board or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take your leave back towards the daunting stairwell, Mika's now familiar bellyfat brushes up against your side. \"Oh, hey Mik-\" she cuts you off by grabbing your hand yet again, now thrusting it onto her bulging middle, \"Can't you feel it?!\" she whines, \"Ever since Kate got kitchen duty there's been nothing left for me to eat, and I'm wasting away here!!\" While this is obviously upsetting her, you can't help but notice just how soft her belly was... and apparantly how thinly made her uniform was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar from wasting away, Mika's girth was enigmatic. She was huge, yet she was just as active and limber as a child of healthy weight. Her pretty face, scrunched up in a look of dissapproval, was creased by her multiple chins and overstuffed chipmunk cheeks. To be honest, she looked like she was on the verge of hysteric tears. \"You jerk, sir!\" she bawled, \"I'm so mad at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing reasonably afraid of upsetting a woman of Mika's enormous proportions, you stammer, \"W-W-Well, alright, I-\" she cuts you off by wrapping you in a big, squishy hug, \"YOU'RE SO MEAN TO MIKA!!\" she wails, inadvertantly cutting you off from any oxygen required to solve her dilemma, \"I'm... sorry...\" you wheeze, \"Oh, my bad.\" she sounds normal as she apologizes, but quickly reverts back to histrionics, \"Wh-What can I do?\" you stutter, now a little wary on whether Mika was really upset or not...</span></div></div>",

You were about to walk away when a chubby hand reached out, wrapping her pudge-covered fingers around your  wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why not?\" pouted the security guard, \"I really wanna know! I've known her longer than you have.

Just lemme go!\" You strained through tightened teeth, struggling to draw your hand free. The security guard's grasp wasp woerful, however, like an overly tightened vice ready to break its prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you don't tell me I'll just go ahead and ask her, and I'll find out either way, so just tell me! Pretty please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!!! Besides, if you can just find out the other way, then just leave me be and lemme go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't!

Besides, if I don't tell you, what are ya gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll tell Anya that you're making her fat.\" For a second, you stared at Mika with a look of mixed confusion and an eyebrow raised in stunned silence. The way she held herself you'd believe that she actually thought that you were intentionally fattening up your head maid. It wasn't like that at all, nor had it ever been. What was this woman smoking, anyway? When had you ever even implied you had a thing for the scarlet haried girl, anyway? It wasn't like you talked to her all THAT much, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly every few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not fattening her up--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why give her all that food, huh? Looks pretty suspicious, and even if you aren't, well, still looks that way and if she puts two and two together, she gets four, and if she gets four, that means I get her extra snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't wanna get fat. She'll just send all tha fattening goodness over to me, and then where would your stubborness bee, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, figuring you'd need to make up somethign just to satisfy the blubbery maid. She didn't look too smart, so it wouldn't take long for some stupid lie to throw her off. \"Let's see, well, here's the truth: she has a serious injury.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An injury?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a rare condition. Requires a lot of sugar to heal, which is why she'd put on a lot of weight in the past, ya know? Her vocal cords are literally decaying, and the sugar helps her muscles gather enough energy to heal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, i never even knew,\" Mika replied, her eyes wide with horror, her hand over her mouth, \"That explains why you gave her all that desert. I've been so selfish, too--I'm sorry! I didn't realize at all. I feel stupid now. I'll go give her a box of donuts! I'll be back!\" With that, Mika ran offf, faster than a jack rabbit on speed. That would have been all well and good, have been the end of the matter, had a second voice not echoed through the air at that moment, drifting into your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice lie,\" Anya said, entering the room, hands self-consciously on her slightly pudgy belly.</span></div></div>",

Your sweating continues, your blood rushes to your head, you feel just a little bit dizzy; all signs pointing to the fact that you were about to die now.

Her eyes widen, and she backs up with a shocked look on her face; cheeks turning just a shade lighter than her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" she seemed to be trying her best to keep her usual tone, but her pitch was faltering under confusion. You had spoken your mind, while still being a little generous with compliments; Anya liked compliments. \"Y-You think I'm...\" she pauses, doing her best to regain composure, \"I-I mean, l-listen to yourself, you sound like a big pansy in one of those visual novel games!!\" she barks, complexion darkening with every passing second, \"I-I, uh, I don't wanna hear any more of this you... you...

Be it ever slow, be it ever drawn out, be it ever never ending and driving you insane how it just kept going on and on, you  continued regardless. Anya seemed to avoid you almost completely. At first you felt she was angry at you, but the one time you passed her by that day was at dinner, and, for the entire meal, her slightly pudgy cheeks her filled with scarlet color, made even more noticeable by the fact that, whenever you\u2019d turn to look at her, she\u2019d turn away, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t make a move on Anya, did ya?\u201d Mimi asked, a mischievous grin on her lips after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you cut all that stuff out about me having a harem of women I make love to on a regular basis? What in the hell are you talking about, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she was all blushy today. Did you do anything? C\u2019mon, you can tell Mimi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really,\u201d you said, blush filling your own cheeks as you turned away from Mimi, praying she didn\u2019t hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days passed without incident. Mika, it appeared, had bought every word that you had fed her, and now decided, in good will toward Kate\u2019s \u201ccondition,\u201d she\u2019d feed the albino girl every donut in her stash. At first, you had simply assumed that Mika had a couple boxes hidden away for special occasions, but indeed, you soon realized that Mika kept enough donuts to fatten up the army of North Korea! Every few minutes, you noticed Mika withdrawing more donuts from her office, handing them to Kate, feeding them to her by hand. It was rare nowadays to see Kate\u2019s cheeks not filled with desert, her full lips covered in powdered sugar, or her growing belly gurgling as it digested a heavy meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, this made Anya even more jealous than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really think that Mika would be stupid enough to believe that dumb story,\u201d Anya grumbled, shaking her head as she watched Mika feeding Kate from a distance, arms folded over her now doughy belly, \u201cIt\u2019s like Mika\u2019s trying to make her fatten up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d you replied, also watching from a distance, \u201cShe\u2019s just overly enthusiastic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a polite way of saying crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint taken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the month, changes were evident amongst the employees in the house. You were called down by Suzu, who had appeared to lost all tone yet still appeared relatively lithe despite the slight muffin top she now sported. With a slight grin on the woman\u2019s lips as she tossed a munchkin into her mouth, she began to speak. \u201cIn case you couldn\u2019t notice, which I find awfully hard considering the fact you helped contribute to this evolution, a large amount of the employees require new uniforms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to have you help administer a physical exam by helping me record all the data, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do I need to do in order to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu stared at you as though you were a two year old being explained complex mathematics beyond the comprehension of doctorate degree mathematic graduates. \u201cYou write what I tell you to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound too hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a  bit tricky when the patient gets offended.

Oddly enough, despite being the owner of the sizable estate for almost two months now, you had yet to see or even hear about this room. \u201cHuh, I suppose that there are a lot of rooms that I haven\u2019t seen then\u2026\u201d you whisper to yourself as the towering doctor flips on the light switch. It was modest, as far as rooms in this mansion went, with a counter, a bed for one to lie down on with a curtain for privacy, a medicine cabinet and a two-way scale. Why Uncle Lucas would simply limit this room to examinations was beyond you, it seemed very versatile and could even function as a private sick room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, little master.\u201d Suzu placed her morning cup of coffee on the countertop, tying her hair back into a loose ponytail and donning the stereotypical doctor\u2019s reflective lens, \u201cWe should get started soon enough, try not to pass out from excitement.\u201d She says dryly bringing out the measuring tape, \u201cI have to warn you though, this is strictly for medical purposes.\u201d You blink, unaware of what she was driving at, \u201cMeaning, if I catch a rocket in your pocket, I\u2019ll be forced to put it out; permanently.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, your face turns a furious red at Suzu\u2019s suggestion; the image of you being some hyper-pervert had made it\u2019s way around the house without much of an effort. But you realize that deep, brown threats were simply the ways that Suzu showed her affection and almost motherly protection over the rest of her housemates. Still quite red in the face, you nod vigorously without saying a single word, lest it fuel her drive to mutilate your manhood. \u201cAlrighty then~\u201d her demeanor changes swiftly without much warning, \u201cLet the physical examinations begin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Anya was prompt as ever, meaning that she would be Doctor Suzu\u2019s first subject. However, the maid didn\u2019t expect your spectation, and as soon as you caught her eye, she nearly jumped out of her too-tight uniform; \u201cOH NO!!\u201d she hollers, pointing in your general direction, \u201cTHERE\u2019S NO WAY IN HELL I\u2019M TAKIN\u2019 MY CLOTHES OFF WITH HIM IN THE ROOM!!\u201d you can\u2019t help but be incited, and start to snap a quip of your own before Suzu intervenes, \u201cBut Anya, the master is my assistant today.\u201d She said in a tone usually reserved to tease/torture you, \u201cHe takes his job very seriously, and I\u2019m sure his eyes won\u2019t linger any longer than they have to.\u201d She turns to you, an almost innocent grin slapped onto her face; almost being the key word. \u201cRight?\u201d she asks, tone deepening ever so slightly. Without much of a choice, you simply nod nervously and tap the clipboard with your pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya glares at you, narrowing her eyelids to slits; \u201cFine\u2026 but he has to turn around when I undress.\u201d She hisses\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my, Anya!\u201d Suzu\u2019s bedside humor was a little bit of a stretch for you, \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly rounded out this year!\u201d she pats the top of Anya\u2019s head like a doctor would a small child, \u201c68kg from  your 54kg last year!\u201d Anya grumbles something under her breath before Suzu snaps her fingers; \u201cOkay, strip down and we\u2019ll take your measurements!\u201d the redhead jumps, shocked at her physician\u2019s sudden interest in taking her clothes off, \u201cO-Okay!\u201d she whimpers slightly, glaring at you to turn around. And of course, lest fear the combined fury of Anya and Suzu, you obey. What you didn\u2019t see, or weren\u2019t allowed to see, was Anya stripping from her uniform and reduced to far too tight undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pale ivory skin looked even paler and whiter in the incandescent lighting, and the shadows that loomed underneath her newfound pudge were accentuated by the brightness. Suzu grabbed measuring tape and swiftly wrapped it around Anya\u2019s bikini line. \u201cHmmm\u2026 36!\u201d she hollered out to you, currently daydreaming on what you could possibly be missing out on. \u201cH-Hold on Suzu, I just thought this was a physical!\u201d You could hear Suzu chuckle, \u201cOh no Anya, it seems that a few members of the household have gotten just a little bit porky!\u201d Anya takes a moment to eye her own stomach with a questionable look in her eye, \u201cSo I\u2019m taking measurements to send to the tailor~\u201d She pauses, wrapping her tape around Anya\u2019s doughy middle, \u201c28!!\u201d she barks at you, \u201cW-Wait is this inches or millimeters?!\u201d you whimper\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp next, almost immediately a very disgruntled Anya stormed out of the room claiming that you peeked, your other, much more roly-poly maid waddled her way into the examination room. You couldn\u2019t help but notice that she had a donut in her chubby white hands, no doubt another dose of Mika\u2019s remedy, and powder all across her lips; once seeing you in the room she stopped cold, also seemingly embarrassed about having to change in front of you. Her face, all except her powdered lips, turned scarlet and she retreated to Suzu\u2019s shoulder, hiding from your gaze. \u201cOh, what\u2019s the matter sweetie?\u201d she cooed, stroking the young maid\u2019s fat back. Without even having to guess, you grumble and turn around. \u201cGood Master~\u201d Suzu coos, praising you like a puppy, \u201cYou\u2019re learning!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was rounder, flabbier, and much more out of shape. Her pale white gut stuck out from underneath her breasts, forming a distinct layer of three rolls in her heavyweight state. Suzu was stunned as she looked at the scale, once again, not that you read it personally, and you were just as shocked when she called out somewhat sheepishly, \u201c1-114kg\u2026\u201d out of curiosity you turn to sneak just a little peek at the scale, instead winding up with a close up view Kate\u2019s incredibly flabby rear. Her backside surely looked soft enough, they surely didn\u2019t have any sort of definition to them. Flabby, that was the only word that could describe your mute maid at this point. Or really fat, but that wasn\u2019t nearly as nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one reassuring look from you, and Kate\u2019s silent tears dried right up. She smiled, let out a muted giggle, and left after giving you a very adoring look. After a few minutes of waiting, as always with her, Mimi popped right into the room in her usual manner: accusation of being a pervert. \u201cOOH~\u201d she squealed after seeing you in the room, \u201cHow many girls have been in here before me, huh Master?!\u201d she giggled, \u201cDid you cop a field, get fresh\u2026 are you gonna feel up <i>Mimi</i> like you did Anya?\u201d she looked at you from over the shoulder playfully seducing you. Far from amused, you grumble and turn around. \u201cGood now hold still Mi-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I want him to watch~\u201d she says nonchalantly pointing to you, not entirely surprising considering her libido. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d Suzu is left without much to say, and your mouth just hangs open as you slowly turn back around, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s better!\u201d she chirps, holding out her arms wide like a bird, \u201cYou can measure Mimi now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while all the other girls weren\u2019t too particular about what they wanted in regards to their new clothes, Mimi was far from indecisive; \u201cAnd I want some of that stretch fabric, and I want it to be decorative, not just a plain old white smock\u2026 do you think I could get a leotard and a matching ball gag?!\u201d Suzu actually has to push the diminiative woman out of the room, both of your exhausted and quite red in the face after hearing everything Mimi wanted done to her smock, \u201cOkay, okay next!\u201d she hollers after sliding Mimi out. \u201cWait I\u2019m not done!\u201d she whines, giving her best cutesy face in the window, \u201cMastwer!!\u201d she cries big crocodile tears before you see a huge, gray-clad shape push her to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOutta the way shorty!\u201d Mika hollers, a donut matching Kate\u2019s own in her pudgy grip. She stops, eyes glancing you up and down pseudo nervously, \u201cSuzu\u2026 I think Master\u2019s been peeping~\u201d she teases, rustling your hair playfully. At least she had a better attitude regarding her weight, really how could she not at her enormous size? During her measurements, a small complication arose that required your immediate assistance. \u201cMaster?\u201d Suzu beckoned you over, \u201cI think I need another measuring-\u201c immediately Mika, somehow finding another donut in her front pocket and smacking on it, cheers, \u201cALRIGHT, TWO MEASURING THINGIES!!\u201d her victory cry shakes the medicine cabinet, a mighty voice summoned from her heaving chest. In her victory, she pumped one flabby arm high up into the air, you couldn\u2019t help but admire her high spirits. \u201c\u2026Yeah, and I need you to hold it for me.\u201d Suzu glares at you, \u201cNow remember, no groping Mika.\u201d The afformentioned guard chuckles, \u201cYeah, even if I am all big and squishy~\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood lord\u2026\u201d you mumble, turning around to face your demands.

All those numbers, all those pudgier looking women in your employment. You wondered, for a moment, what impact you had on their waistlines. You wondered critically, querying whether or not it was your fault for them fattening up. With a resounding answer, you said \u201cYes, it was your fault.\u201d Even if involuntary, even if subconsciously, it all came back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know whether to applaud yourself or slap yourself, but they didn\u2019t seem to mind too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept Anya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, idiot!\u201d You turned around at that moment to see Anya walking toward you, her hips swaying from side to side as her balled up fists squeezed into her pudgy palm. Her round face was unreadable. You weren\u2019t certain whether she was glad to see you or wanted nothing more than to strangle you at that particular moment. Knowing Anya, you\u2019d say she\u2019d want the latter, but there was something off about the way she was walking, and it had nothing to do with the fact that her thighs were significantly thicker than usual. No, it was something subtler, something simpler, something more emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Anya,\u201d you replied, nervously, unaware of what to possibly expect now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, guess you got to see my naked body, huh? What, did you just beg Suzu to help you with the physicals?\u201d Anya asked, her eyes narrowed dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? No! Not at all, she just pulled me in and I didn\u2019t have a\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say,\u201d Anya mumbled before her voice grew progressively more and more desperate, tears slowly forming in her eyes as she put all her energy into speaking, \u201cListen, you know I\u2019ve been getting a little chubby now, right?  Well, obviously you did; it\u2019s all your fault anyway. Listen,\u2014don\u2019t speak, just listen\u2014I was thinking it all through before, during the physicals and everything, and I have to just say something now or else it\u2019s just gonna eat up my insides, a-a-and just kill me, okay? It\u2019s gonna just kill me, and I know you\u2019re not gonna feel the same way. I know how you feel toward Kate and everything, but if I don\u2019t get this out, I\u2019m gonna\u2014gonna\u2014gonna\u2014\u201d Tears began to stream down her  chubby cheeks, cheeks filled with scarlet blush. Slowly, you wrap an arm around her soft shoulders, pulling her into an embrace, if not only to make her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust say it,\u201d you said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to act so strong all the time, ya know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya nodded against your chest. \u201cI think I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence as Anya\u2019s words sank in. Love? Love with Anya? Could it really be? She was in love with you!? After all that teasing, all that shouting, all that abuse, could that have all been Anya trying to express her emotions, an emotion that, for all intents and purposes, she had never understood nor expressed so thoroughly before? Had she been afraid of it, perhaps terrified of the idea of opening herself up to another human being? Did that excuse the things she had done? No, but, judging by the tears Anya was shedding, she too didn\u2019t think that her actions were nearly justified, and here she was, begging for forgiveness, regretting her sins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what about Kate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen,\u201d Anya replied, brushing tears aside with slightly pudgy fingers, \u201cI know you don\u2019t feel the same way toward me, and all, but what do I have to do? I\u2019ve never felt this way toward another human being, even an idiot like you! I don\u2019t want to stop feeling this way. Seriously, I\u2019ll do anything in the world!

There was a slight silence, Anya\u2019s temperament growing less and less stable with every passing second. \u201cBut, you hate Kate.\u201d you say softly. \u201cI know I do, jackass!\u201d her features soften, \u201cThat should\u2026 that should really show you how much I care about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t help it, the smile on your faces stretches further and further until your cheekbones almost hurt, \u201cWh-What?!\u201d she hollers, getting self defensive, \u201cYou\u2019re laughing at me right, you really are a jerk!\u201d Your embrace gets tighter, not to keep a squirming Anya hostage but to show how much you appreciated her great sacrifice, how much you appreciated getting poor reclusive Kate another friend. Even if it was an arrangement such as this, maybe they could really get along? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No, I\u2019m not laughing at you.\u201d You almost giggle in your excitement. Anya catches your snickering, \u201cYes you are you big jerk!\u201d she laughs too, her tears drying slightly as she plays cat and mouse with you once again, \u201cAm not!\u201d you can\u2019t help but laugh now that Anya\u2019s feeling just a little bit better. Against your better instinct, Anya\u2019s face had gotten much closer to yours, something you didn\u2019t notice until it was too late: you two shared something passionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft lips grew closer and closer to yours, not wavering in the slightest as she narrowed in on you. Against your better judgment, you had done nothing to stop Anya\u2019s campaign. Full lips touched yours, her delicate arms wrapped strongly around the base of your neck, and her eyelids lowered in her euphoria. Her breathing hastened, soft breath released against your chin as she broke away, and a different sort of redness had been painted onto her relaxed, almost lazy, expression. She had kissed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya gazed into your eyes for a few seconds, an almost hazy expression reflected in her bright eyes. But, perhaps realizing that her passion had gotten the better of her, Anya broke away suddenly. \u201cI-I-I-\u201c, she stammered, fearing retribution, \u201cI-I-I\u2026 I better go talk to Kate, right?\u201d she sighs warmly, glancing at you with a hopeful expression. \u201cY-Yeah, you should!\u201d your tone comes out much more enthusiastic than intended, probably due to the heat of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you, so excited that her smile becomes a grin; \u201cYeah, I should.\u201d She coos, \u201cOh, and by the way Master?\u201d you perk your head up slightly at her address, \u201cYou laugh like a retard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to find somewhere quiet in hopes of some thinking time; being caught in a love triangle did that to a man. As you make your way to the study, your thoughts slowly fill the hallway. Thoughts of Anya, thoughts of Kate, thoughts of you and Anya and thoughts of you and Kate. But then again, you weren\u2019t <i>certain</i> Kate felt the same, she didn\u2019t give any confirmation after all. Who were you kidding, the way she looked at you, how she lit up when you gave her something sweet, the way she kept everything you gave her; Kate totally liked you. You couldn\u2019t help but feel like a huge jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the study, you push open the heavy doors and clamor about for the light switch. Finally finding it, you switch it to \u2018on\u2019 and remark on how extraordinary the room was. Bookshelves lined the walls, leaving enough room for a fireplace on one and the balcony on the other, knowing your Uncle Lucas they were probably related to the renaissance or something to that effect. Two chairs sat in front of the fireplace, two glasses sitting next to each other on the shared end table inbetween them. And at the back, just a few feet from the balcony\u2019s arch, a desk with many strange brick-a-brack on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to yourself, you light a fire and bask in it\u2019s warm glow\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat there for what had to feel like hours by that fire, though it couldn\u2019t have been more than ten minutes. Really, it couldn\u2019t have been. It was just the thoughts of those two girls swirling around in your head. Anya had kissed you. You could still feel her puckering lips against yours, pressing and caressing your sensitive mouth, inviting her warmth and excitement into your chest as you longed to probe her soft flesh with your fingers. Then, however, you saw Kate, her chubby cheeks drawing nearer as the imaginary albino in your mind kissed you too. You wondered, momentarily, whether or not there\u2019d be much of a difference in the desire you felt toward them, but knew, in your heart, that Kate and Anya both wanted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it was five o\u2019clock, the house was still, and the young master was alone in his study soaking up the heat of the fire.\u201d You turn around to see Suzu, a box of donuts in her hands, approach you. She was wearing a nurse\u2019s outfit, where it became apparent to you that she had packed on the pounds. Her chubby arms trembled as she lowered herself down, her belly folding enough to fold the fabric carrying it. Her lips curled into a relaxed sort of grin, a laugh on her lips. \u201cSo how\u2019re you, young master? Conflicted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I do. I was in the room next to this one during your whole thing with Anya.\u201d You blush deep red at this. She knew? Kate\u2019s closest friend knew? With Suzu\u2019s husky voice, you couldn\u2019t tell whether Suzu was congratulating you on stealing what could have been Anya\u2019s first kiss, or damning you for being unfaithful to Kate, despite the fact you weren\u2019t in a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, Kate is a very fragile girl, you know,\u201d Suzu replied, \u201cJust the fact that you\u2019re giving her attention that\u2019s polite from someone who isn\u2019t a male, well, it really helped her out a lot. You may not know it, but, before you came, Kate never seemed to really smile a lot. Well, now you\u2019re here and she\u2019s smiling all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is exactly why I should be with her,\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that\u2019s exactly why you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over at Suzu, confused to say the least. \u201cWait, come again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprised? Well, Anya has no problem with physical intimacy. The fact that she kissed you so soon after confessing her love proves she doesn\u2019t just love your personality, which it\u2019s clear that she does: she also loves your body, and wants to be with you on a physical level. Kate, however, is terrified by the idea of physical intimacy. She has a lot of baggage, and puberty or not, the idea of actually making love to anyone is just too much stress to her. If you truly love her, you\u2019d spend the years it takes to rehabilitate her and allow her to be able to not have flashbacks when you make love, but the truth is that if your feelings were so strong, you would\u2019ve resisted Anya entirely, which you didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t feel guilty, though, I know someone who has that patience, and you are not that person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu\u2019s words sink in slowly. You feel a tinge bit guilty, but then realize that Suzu is entirely right. You weren\u2019t prepared for Kate. Though Kate had shot you glances of reverence several times in the past, never once had she touched you. But Anya had touched you so often. You remembered hearing that true love involved a union of both emotional AND carnal needs, and Kate was simply emotional. Anya, however, that was different. She wanted you to touch her, to stroke her arms and let her coo in delight. Did Kate want you to touch her? She\u2019d feel claustrophobic, terrified, for all intents and purposes even a little terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop being Kate\u2019s friend, though,\u201d Suzu said, \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll get Kate\u2019s future lover to kick your ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is Kate\u2019s future lover?\u201d you ask, eyes narrowed as your lips are curled, suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh\u2014hey! Look! Dinner! Let\u2019s head downstairs!\u201d Suzu stammered, rising to her feet as she guided you downstairs, her now round cheeks deep scarlet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It used to be Anya\u2019s job, but after your staff reassignment, she had done a swell job of cleaning plates. Certainly in more ways than one. You take your hands off of Anya\u2019s shoulders long enough to push open the heavy doors, resuming your firm grip on Anya as soon as you could enter. \u201cBut Master!\u201d she groaned, \u201cHOW OLD ARE YOU?!\u201d you groan back. Calling her out on her attitude seemed to be a quick fix, she immediately stood up straight and brushed herself off, \u201cFine, but I\u2019m only doing this because I made a promise.\u201d She huffs, \u201cThat I think I might be regretting.\u201d She playfully sticks out her slender pink tongue, withdrawing it as she turned around and started her trek across the ridiculously long dining hall; where, now that the albino\u2019s work was done and she could get off of her feet, Kate sat enjoying a few day-old treats from Mimi\u2019s private collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 hey Kate!\u201d Anya starts off understandably wary, like stepping on conversational eggshells, \u201cMind if I join you?\u201d the pale maid looks up from her tray of brownies with an astonished look on her face; either she didn\u2019t expect company or she didn\u2019t expect Anya, you couldn\u2019t tell from this far away. But ultimately, she nods her round little head in agreement and Anya takes her seat. Your redheaded maid looks to you for support, which you can only provide by gesturing for her to sit down; which of course she does now that Kate had invited her. Using only the utmost stealth, careful so that Kate doesn\u2019t see you pulling the strings, you hurry into the kitchen to help grease the wheels\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your mind, the plan was simple. Just like the last time you pacified the seemingly never-ending quarrel between Kate and Anya you used food, and while it wasn\u2019t the healthiest suggestion, it certainly made a good stepping stone in the right direction. Plus, Kate liked sweets, and so did Anya. So, put that together and they\u2019ve already got something in common!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Mimi?\u201d you whisper, being as quiet as possible so as to not draw attention to yourself, \u201cMIMI!!\u201d you rasp slightly in your effort to try and be louder. You cover corner to see Mimi bent over something, \u201cLalala lalala la lalalala lalala~\u201d she sings to herself, round body swaying as she moves her hips in her evident excitement. \u201cMIMI!!\u201d you mumble, astonished the plump woman turns around, swollen belly swinging a few seconds behind her. You see that, despite being at the countertop sink, Mimi was not washing dishes, but she in fact has a very large chocolate cake all to herself! Well, had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster!!\u201d she squeaks, tucking her chubby hands to her face in a childish fit of cowardice, \u201cYou scared Mimi!!\u201d you immediately shush her, only for her to look at the ground, \u201cAND YOU RUINED MIMI\u2019S SUPER DUPER CHOCOLATE CAKE!!\u201d she wailed, \u201cThat was for Mi-, er, Kate!!\u201d you desperately try to shush her up as you see gigantic tears well up in her eyes, \u201cMimi, please?\u201d you beg her, jolting up to cover her mouth with your hand, \u201cI need you to be quiet!\u201d you whisper releasing her pudgy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh-uh!!\u201d she cried the instant your hand was off of her chocolate stained mouth, \u201cMimi put her blood, sweat, and tears into that cake and Master had to make Mimi drop it!\u201d she whined, \u201cMimi only got to eat some of it too, you big meanie!!\u201d Feeling sorry for her, and desperate for the plan to work, you try to barter with your tiny chef. \u201cLook, I just need your help today, just for a little bit!\u201d you plead with her on your knees and hands folded out in front of you, \u201cJust help me out and I\u2019ll help you make a new Super Cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT WAS MIMI\u2019S SUPER DUPER CHOCOLATE CAKE!!\u201d she wails, wiping her eyes with unbelievably pudgy hands, \u201cOkay fine, a new \u2018Mimi\u2019s Super Duper Chocolate Cake\u2019!\u201d you shuffle over to her on your knees, \u201cJust please help me make Anya and Kate like each other!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlankly, she blinks at your last sentence; then the wording hit you in the face like a brick. \u201cOh, no, not like that- I\u201d she interrupts you with a hushed chant, getting your game now, \u201cMas-ter\u2019s a per-vert, Mas-ter\u2019s a per-vert~\u201d she sings, \u201cOkay Master, Mimi\u2019ll help you get your freak on~\u201d Not really having the energy to correct her like usual, and fearing that she won\u2019t help, you sigh gratefully, \u201cThat\u2019s awesome Mimi, now help make some cookies or something so we can put it on that table for them to share.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The only way Anya and Kate would get along is if Kate shared even one brownie with her as a sign of mutual respect, if not then Kate was still scared of the redhead and all the effort was useless. There was some one-sided conversation between them, Anya sneaking a confection every now and then, but nothing really profound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like she was trying really hard to live up to her promise of getting along with Kate. But it seemed that she was too focused on being hungry and shy to really notice\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil it came down to the last brownie.

Passing Kate by, Anya almost smacks her in the back of the head, until the albino maid holds out an outstretched hand, something in her chubby fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-For me?\u201d Anya blushes slightly in her surprise; it was the last brownie. And Kate wanted her to have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!!!\u201d you holler, completely and totally blowing your cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYAY!!\u201d Mimi jumps up, mimicking your excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE HELL?!\u201d Anya hollers, \"HOW'D YOU GET OVER THE- GET OFF OF HIM YOU DWARF!!\"</span></div></div>",

You think I was going to give you a token of my love without expecting something in return?\u201d Anya asked, grinning slightly with that critical glint in her eyes, \u201cNuh-uh! Ya gotta do me a couple favors first before I start to really get to fulfill my end of the bargain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. You should\u2019ve known it would be too easy this way. Regardless, you didn\u2019t mind doing her a favor considering what sort of step in the right direction she had taken by treating Kate with respect even once. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m all ears. What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one, tell me what\u2019s up with Kate? I\u2019d be a lot nicer to her if I knew the truth,\u201d Anya said, with powerful, almost piercing eyes. At first, you hesitate. It was true that Suzu told you not to tell anyone, but, as you stared into those eyes, you knew Anya did have the right to know. And so you told her everything, about her parents, what they did to her, the scars on the inside of her vaginal walls, and all that. With each fact presented, Anya\u2019s eyes widened just a little until she was sitting down, her skin just as pale as Kate\u2019s tan-lines, her very joints trembling on their own. \u201cThat makes sense. It\u2019s all coming together now. And all this time\u2026all this time I was so mean to her. All this time I thought she was just faking it, just to get attention. I\u2019m such a bitch. I\u2019m a horrible person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya lowered her head in shame, crying into her soft forearms. Unsure what to do, you simply placed a hand on her shoulder, comfortingly. She glanced up, sniffing loudly as she smiled, slightly, through the tears and thick sobs. \u201cThanks a lot, but ya know I\u2019m still a jerk. I\u2019m cruel, probably evil, for feeling jealous of her. I don\u2019t deserve to be your girlfriend, or anyone\u2019s girlfriend if I\u2019m jealous over a girl who was raped. I get it now why you were so angry at me when I was being mean to her. I didn\u2019t realize\u2014I should\u2019ve realized\u2014God, I hate myself sometimes.\u201d She ran her soft fingers through her hair, squeezing at her follicles, before relaxing her tension, staring heavily at the ground. \u201cJesus\u2026I didn\u2019t think at all. It\u2019s a good thing I asked, though. Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was told not to tell anyone,\u201d you said, \u201cThanks to you, I\u2019m breaking a promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft! Yeah, thanks about that,\u201d she replied, smirking slightly, tears running down her soft cheeks, \u201cYa know, maybe it\u2019s a good thing you came. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be as isolated anymore. I\u2019m sure I must\u2019ve ruined her time here. I must\u2019ve made her feel so miserable. I\u2019m not any better than the wicked stepmother from Cinderella, ya know, the one who tortures Cinderella by making her do all that work and abusing her from time to time?

It practically came out of nowhere; you were just lazily eating your breakfast when she popped the question. And, like so many times before, Anya had definitely woken you up from that hazy half-sleep you felt every morning. It was no big deal, you liked her and she liked you; it was only natural that you two start actually going out, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah!\u201d Anya stutters herself, her chubby cheeks beet red and unable to properly meet your gaze, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s been about a month now\u2026\u201d she stamps her foot haughtily, \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t taken me out once; are you ashamed of your beautiful girlfriend?!\u201d Of course you\u2019re quick to deny her statement, \u201cNo no, not at all I just fig-\u201c, she cut you off with one finger to your lips, \u201cNuh-uh-uh, no weaseling your way out of it, we\u2019re going out on a date!\u201d You sigh, feigning defeat, \u201cOkay then, where too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya jumps, evidently unaware of the popular places that young adults go as couples, \u201cU-uh, I-I dunno, you\u2019re the man, kinda, so you figure it out!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the start of today\u2019s outing; though you spent two whole days preparing for it and even longer hearing about it. Anya had to go out and buy new civilian clothes, since hers suddenly decided that her hips were too full and fat to fit. This led to some confusion in the household; Anya got a day off so naturally Mika wanted one too. Deciding against angering either one of the women, you sent Mika off with Anya. From what you gathered, things did not go well. But, point being that tonight was the long awaited date night; and probably Anya\u2019s first date ever. It was your job to make it memorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a good time~\u201d Suzu walked you two out of the entrance, Kate nervously tugging at her side. You weren\u2019t quite comfortable with Kate watching you leave, she hadn\u2019t quite gotten used to you two being an item, but nothing could be done. \u201cThanks, we will.\u201d You respond with just as much enthusiasm, until Anya pops you over the head, \u201cNot <i>that</i> good of a time, you perv!\u201d She giggles. You can hear Mimi bawling opposite from Suzu and Kate, \u201cI wanna go out with Master too!!\u201d she wails, Mika kicked her in the increasingly round butt to shut her up, \u201cQuiet you, I\u2019m next!\u201d she scolds, \u201cDon\u2019t get in a car crash and totally wreck the passenger side, Master~\u201d her tone changes from salty to sweet in an instant, unnerving both you and Anya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were a considerable walk away from the staff\u2019s earshot, Anya asks a very important question, \u201cYeah, speaking of cars, who\u2019s driving?\u201d she asks, patting her stomach, \u201cOr did you order a chauffer?\u201d Somewhat plainly you respond with a simple, \u201cOh no, we\u2019re walking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya looked like she wanted to pass out and die right then and there. While she was by no means fat just yet, it was obvious she had been neglecting her exercise regimen. Her jeans, a designer brand you had so reluctantly tapped into your savings for, were filled to the denim with Anya\u2019s thunder thighs. Her round perky butt actually threatened to split a seam here and there despite being new and of rather generous proportions (\u201cWhat?\u201d was her response when she modeled for you, \u201cThey\u2019re SKINNY jeans!!\u201d) Her top, a light salmon number with red flowers along the right side, was by no means loose either; her soft swollen tummy seemed to wiggle its way out of the thin fabric prison every other step, forcing Anya to embarrassingly tug down on it\u2019s hem. In short, she was <i>not</i> walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I get your game, you fatten up young sexy maids and then make them walk it off!\u201d she huffs, \u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d You chuckle, her attitude was actually pretty cute after you got used to it, \u201cAm not.\u201d You quip childishly, \u201cAre so!\u201d she responds, really enjoying the little games you play with each other. \u201cSeriously, we\u2019re walking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUT WHYYYYY?!\u201d she whines, stamping her new shoes in the dirt.</span></div></div>",

To say the least, you had been to more elaborate theaters, like the ones in California when you vacationed there. Regardless, it was a nice theater: a big multiplex covered in gaudy lights, as though to beacon in wandering nomads from across the desert to come see whatever big name movie was playing at the time. You approached the theater with a look of excitement, but Anya was positively glowing in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! I haven\u2019t gone to the theaters in years!\u201d Anya stammered, eyes glowing as she took in the vision of each individual movie poster lined up along the wall. Gods of the art of film, all of them, in essence, and this was their temple. Here Anya was paying tribute, a sinner coming into confession for the first time in years. When you thought of it like that, things were even more adorable, as Anya\u2019s round face, usually in control and confident, had turned to mush, reduced to the level of a child being presented with countless gifts at Christmas time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were Santa Claus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both agreed, in the end, on avoiding the romantic comedy movie. Upon realizing that Anya was not a large fan of mushy stuff, you felt relief fill your chest. Sure, some romantic movies were good, but more often than not there was some ridiculous one that comes along that makes you cringe yet every girl goes to see, much to your awe. It turned out, however, that your girlfriend, who had started wrapping her chubby arms around yours, loved sci-fi, and thus the two of you went to see the new sci-fi blockbuster you had heard good things about on the web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ordered a tub of popcorn from the snack line, along with some raisonettes that Anya insisted on getting. After you applied butter to the popcorn, Anya applied her hands to the tub, and ran off with it. She stuck her tongue out at you, giving her the appearance of an overgrown child. You playfully ran after her to the theater, where the two of you took a seat next to one another. You let her eat the popcorn. After all, you had gone to the movies countless times, and yet it appeared she hadn\u2019t gone all too much. Why didn\u2019t she? Was she too busy working as a maid? Surely your uncle took her to see some films, right? Like when the newest Disney movie came out, surely he took her, didn\u2019t he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, upon leaving the theater, departing fully satisfied by the film, Anya tossed aside the empty tub, running her thick fingers through her locks of scarlet before turning to face you. \u201cSo, is that it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin. \u201cNot yet. Wanna get a bite to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya smirked slightly, her dimples showing. She lovingly punched your shoulder. \u201cWhat? Am I too skinny for ya?\u201d she asked, gripping her pudgy, though not nearly fat, belly. She sure was filling out, though, that was for sure. She had to be getting close to the weight Kate was at when they first met, if she hadn\u2019t already surpassed it. And yet, despite at first seeming so upset about her extra pudge, she was joking about it, teasing herself about her fatty belly. Was she growing in other ways? Had she found self confidence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner, in case anyone was curious, was delicious.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was so vibrant, so fun, that the first few days of your relationship were gone in the blink of an eye. You weren\u2019t completely open about your relationship when one of the other girls got interested, but they all saw you court her out on one of your little outings. Suzu was supportive, and whenever you managed to get Anya mad at you, your Amazon doctor was right by your side and nudging you in the right direction. Kate was pretty phased by the relationship, even downright upset, and she still was; but behind her childish timidity belay a maturity that allowed her to accept it\u2026 she and Anya had a somewhat friendly rivalry going at this rate, though the plump maid\u2019s vivacity was dwindling lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that even the house itself supported the relationship; there had been limited rainy days to mar the sky, winds were kept gentle and breezy, and every morning was bright and cheerful no matter what the weather would be by lunch. Of course, maybe it was just your subconscious, blinded by the distinct possibility of love, that wouldn\u2019t allow anything to burst your bubble. Whatever the case, you couldn\u2019t remember the last time you had ever been so happy. And Anya was happy too; albeit her special brand of happy that included sarcasm, jealousy, and even downright hostility. Yep, everyone was happy\u2026 and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Anya moaned, savoring the fluffy chocolate cake that had just passed her painted lips, \u201cThis is so good.\u201d She mumbled, wiping her dainty mouth with a napkin. \u201cWhat\u2019d you call this again, Mimi?\u201d she called out to the increasingly chubby dwarf in the kitchen, \u201cMimi\u2019s Super Duper Chocolate Cake.\u201d You answer for her, feeling a small shiver go up your spine as you remember the hard days of work it took to make that stupid cake just for Anya to inhale it in no time. \u201cOh that\u2019s right!\u201d she playfully slapped your shoulder with one pudgy hand, causing a chain reaction that reverberated in her soft upper arms, \u201cYou broke your back just to make your girlfriend a teensy bit wider!\u201d she pushed another forkful past her full lips, ignoring the grumbling protests from her stuffed stomach. You laugh at her, \u201cHey if you don\u2019t want it, give it back!\u201d you tease faking her out by touching the side of her plate, \u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d she giggled, moving the plate just out of reach, \u201cYou made it for me, it\u2019s mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya had put on an astonishing amount of weight in the short weeks you had been going out, not that you really minded as long as she was happy. The slender, redheaded maid that had loathed you so when you first took over the estate had slowly ballooned into your plump, snarky girlfriend; and to be honest it was getting harder and harder to remember what that skinny, unhappy girl looked like. She had a thick, juicy pair of thighs that brushed together with every step your maid took, wobbling slightly to match her killer caboose as it swayed back and forth underneath her skirt. Anya\u2019s stomach, once slender though without tone, had slowly softened up into the big squishy apron that hung just a hair\u2019s length above her crotch, ironically covered by a real apron during her shift. She had filled out rather evenly, even though her arms and cheeks grew much chubbier than her breasts. It had gotten to the point where Anya was outgrowing just about everything, down to one of Kate\u2019s old uniforms from just a few months ago. But you loved your porky girlfriend, and that\u2019s all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you up for the movies tonight?\u201d she asked, another soft bite entering her mouth, \u201cI saw a great commercial while I was cleaning the den, it looks pretty good.\u201d You smirk, \u201cYou just want the popcorn.\u201d She feigns betrayal, \u201cWell maybe I do, but I like a show when I eat; so you up for it?\u201d Unfortunately, you\u2019re not: you\u2019ve got lots of business to take care of and probably shouldn\u2019t leave the house. \u201cNah, I don\u2019t think I can make it, you know, work.\u201d A look of realization flashes across her chubby features, \u201cOh that\u2019s right, I totally forgot\u2026\u201d she sounds disappointed, and knows full well that she sounds disappointed: easier for you to make other plans. \u201cHow about we just watch a little TV in the den?\u201d you suggest, \u201cYou know, after I\u2019m done?\u201d Anya seems moderately pleased with the results, \u201cTsk tsk, you lazy master, you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She, in turn, responds with a grumpy, \u201cYeah, so sweet they\u2019re giving me diabetes.\u201d To which Suzu quips back with, \u201cI think I have a pill for that somewhere\u2026\u201d the enormous guard had only gotten more enormous in the past months, but only by maybe ten pounds or so. When someone was Mika\u2019s size, it was hard to notice. \u201cI mean, look at that cake!\u201d she whines under her breath, unusually quiet considering it was Mika, \u201cI should be getting that cake, Master should be feeding that to ME!\u201d Suzu giggles, \u201cOh come now, Mika, they\u2019re just having their cake.\u201d She watches as Anya howls with laughter, a stray crumb had flown straight up your nose, \u201cAnd apparently eating it too\u2026\u201d she says tentatively squeezing one side of her own muffin top, \u201cIt seems I may have to switch to decaf soon\u2026\u201d she says sorrowfully\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate soon emerges from the kitchen, a few stray crumbs littering her pale mouth as she carries a silver platter with another one of Mimi\u2019s newest concoctions on it. It seems that Kate had swollen up much more than Anya, a byproduct of your initial spoiling of her due to her condition and Mika still believing the phony one you made up. She had grown enormous, with a chubby face that sported a full blown second chin and a big, flabby belly that had folded into three distinct rolls. Her skin looked like so many of the vanilla cakes she had inhaled while acting as Mimi\u2019s unofficial guenia pig. She had a large, heart shaped bum that no skirt in her closet could cover fully, but the main attraction to the innocent girl\u2019s figure was her uncharacteristically large breasts; they were huge! While it was by no means a bad thing, Anya constantly accused you of staring at them. Much to Kate\u2019s chagrin, you were too busy looking at Anya to notice how well she had filled out. She remained silent, doing her best to deal with your sickeningly sweet behavior with Anya, and placed a slice of the custard colored confection in front of every member of the household gathered at the table. \u201cThanks Kate!\u201d you say graciously, causing a slight smile to grace her chubby lips. Anya pats her tummy, \u201cOh, I think I might bust\u2026\u201d she groans as she notices the sheer size of her slice, \u201cYou really are trying to make me into some jumbo hog, aren\u2019t you, perv?\u201d she lightly punches your arm with her flabby fist of phony fury<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually~\u201d Mimi\u2019s exuberant tone echoes throughout the dining hall, the little woman waddling in after it, \u201cThis is Mimi\u2019s Bestest Beltbusting Butterscotch Bakedthingyma Bobber!\u201d she says proudly, awkwardly making her way to Anya\u2019s side (only barely coming up to eye\u2019s length while the pudgy redhead sat down) Out of everyone, it seemed Mimi had grown the most; but that may have been due to her lack of stature. Once only chubby, she had grown increasingly fat lately: her adorably round face had grown only rounder and rounder (and, truth be told, it did accentuate her cuteness just a smidgeon) and her gut had started to sway back and forth as she walked. Her smock was far too small, even for her, and her belly threatened to burst out of it every chance it got. Was Mimi sneaking one too many of her own meals? \u201cAnd Mimi gave you the biggest piece because, obviously, my Master likes lots more cushion for his pushin!\u201d she pats your crotch with a chubby hand, honestly meaning to pat your thigh instead. Now Anya had two things to be furious about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait, Anya, she didn\u2019t mean to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGET BACK HERE YOU SHRIMP!!\u201d she hollers, lumbering after the surprisingly swift chef in a furious rage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMASTER!!\u201d Mimi hollers, jumping into your lap, \u201cTELL ANYA MIMI\u2019S SOWWY!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH I\u2019LL SHOW YOU WHAT \u2018SOWWY\u2019 MEANS!!\u201d she rolls up her sleeves in preparation for some midget trouncing\u2026</span></div></div>",

The darkness, the sorrow that had overtaken that poor girl even a few months ago had dissolved, and all that was left was beauty, unrelenting beauty beyond the comprehension of most people. How was this the same person? How could it possibly be that same individual? The metamorphosis was stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped walking as you heard Suzu\u2019s voice. You turned to see your rather powerful, and now plump, nurse, who approached you with her head lowered, almost embarrassed. What did she have to be embarrassed about? Thanks to her, you had managed to help change a sad girl\u2019s life for the better. You had, with her, helped salvage Anya from pain and suffering, leaving a beautiful girl in its wake, both physically and emotionally. So, after all that, what did Suzu have to be embarrassed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, are you okay, Suzu?\u201d you asked, knowing the answer long before she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Suzu replied, \u201cI\u2019m just going to rant to you about this, mind you, because I don\u2019t know if I can handle the stress of seeing all this happen and being unable to do anything about it alone anymore, okay? Look: Kate did care for you, but she can\u2019t feel comfortable while in a relationship with another man. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. There would be residual effects. You know what I\u2019m leaning towards, right? You know what I\u2019m talking about? What I\u2019m foreshadowing here? You aren\u2019t stupid, I know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in love with Kate,\u201d you reply, simply. Suzu cringed at the sound of those words as she slowly bobbed her head up and down. She glanced up, almost alarmed, when you began to laugh. \u201cLook, there\u2019s no shame in that. You\u2019re a lesbian? So what? The point is you\u2019re in love, right? Look, I say you just tell her how you feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine how awkward that might feel for her,\u201d Suzu replied, \u201cShe thinks she wants you, but then I ask her to go with me. The conflict would probably drive her mad on the inside. No, I think it\u2019s best that we just don\u2019t do anything at all. I\u2019m just going to sit around and watch her find happiness\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, if you\u2019re really afraid, I\u2019ll have Anya work on Kate too to get her into you some more, see if she likes you like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the simple fact of the matter is that she liked you, a boy, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense unless she\u2019s bi, which I don\u2019t believe is possible seeing as how I don\u2019t\u2019 believe bisexuals even exist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just making excuses,\u201d you mumbled, \u201cLook, Suzu, you need to do this. Not just for yourself, but for Kate, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re right, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re scared, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.

Now, do you mind if I told Anya about all this? She could help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s inevitable for her to know regardless. I get the  vibe she\u2019s already aware.

You and Anya would act as positive reinforcement should either Kate or Suzu come to either of you with unsure feelings, and hopefully nudge them into a relationship together. \"But what if this doesn't work?!\" Suzu, like your girlfriend before her, asked as you and Anya dragged her by the heels into the dining room for lunch, \"What if we're just wasting our time, I mean Kate <i>obviously</i>-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH ALREADY!!\" Anya barked at the uncharacteristically reluctant Suzu, long tired of her whiny attitude towards her own plan. Suzu pursed her lips, finding it just a little ironic that Anya had screamed at her when she had worked so hard to put you two together. \"Listen, I'm just saying that if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut in, kneeling down to smile warmly at her; \"Come on Suzu, you'll never know if you don't try.\" you put a comforting hand on her shoulder, causing her to blush from embarrassment. \"B-But...\" she stammers, \"But... I'm... scared....\" she says softly, gaze travelling upwards to meet yours, \"I'm scared that... that she won't like me... like I like her...\" Your gaze travels to Anya, a feeling of comradery instantly sparked between you and Suzu, one that the forlorn doctor noticed even while caught in her current plight. You stared at eachother for a little bit, before Anya practically slung her into the dining hall. \"Chicken!\" she barked, completely oblivious to the wonderful bonding you and Suzu had just experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't notice how similar this is?\" you ask, oddly nonchalant as to how your maid tossed your doctor to her fate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" She responded, equally nonchalant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, since you and your girlfriend were just as much parts of this as Suzu and Kate were, you had to be present for the plan to unfold. \"Shall we?\" you open the door for Anya, who waddles in with a playful stride, \"Thank you.\" she mocks an upperclasswoman's distinct tone as she waves one thick arm to her side. You soon follow after her, all parts in play for operation \"SuzuxKate\" to begin...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For authenticity, you and Anya kept your respective seats at the head (and right of the head) at the table; where Kate sat at the left of you. The noticable change, however, was Suzu's position swapping from the end righthand corner to just to the right of Kate, putting them right beside eachother. Kate was mildly amused at the prospect of her best friend sitting next to her for the first time since getting these mid-day breaks, and was silently euphoric when she  revealed that she would be sitting with her all throughout her lunch time. So far so good, no awkward silences between Suzu and Kate (tounge in cheek joke) and you and Anya managed to stay a mostly silent third party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can really see how you would enjoy having these little ciestas, Kate.\" Suzu struggles past the shadow of doubt to make idle conversation with the round apple of her eye, \"I wouldn't mind having a few of these myself, if it meant I could catch up with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya giggled and squeezed your arm with her chubby hands, now oddly 'into' the operation since the minimal fruition. Silently, you hold a finger to your lips indicating for her to be quiet so as to not draw attention away from Suzu. It was remarkable how Kate listened to Suzu's every word, compliment or story, without so much as even touching her food. Sure, every now and then she would peck at her chicken cordon bleu, but Kate paid far much more attention to Suzu than any fattening treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Kate's doubley chinned face grew happier and happier as her old friend went on about almost nothing, apparantly Suzu had been withdrawing from Kate due to her feelings of awkwardness. She offered Suzu one of her sides, only for Suzu to turn it down; \"Oh, no thank you Kate, I'm already far too big for my tastes.\" she chuckles nervously, hands shaking so much that she couldn't even take a sip of her coffee. Kate looks down and grabs her lowermost roll, jostling it as if to say; \"Yeah, <i>you're</i> big~\" Noticing this, Suzu responded with a smile, \"Yeah, you're right; gimme that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and and ecstatic Anya were not the only ones watching, however, as Mimi's eyes examined the situation in front of them with just as much glee. \"This is going gweat!!\" she whispered, \"Now for Mimi's Cutesy Ootsey Strawberry Shortcake with a Lovenote Inside!\" the nearly spherical dwarf wobbles awkwardly over to the counter, dragging a platter far bigger than herself off of it and onto a dolley, wheeling it into the dining area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Mimi catches your eyes, most notably the malicious twinkle in her eyes as she wheeled the mighty confection towards the table. \"Oh no...\" you mutter, knowing full well what was going on, \"Mimi's gonna mess it up!\" you turn to Anya for support, but she is lost in the visual embrace of Mimi's Cutesy Ootsey Strawberry Shortcake. \"Aww, how sweet Mimi!\" Anya cooes, \"You made this for me and the retard, didn't you?!\" Mimi snorts, \"Sh'yeah, right, Mimi'll focus on you two later.\" she teases; hand on one of her chins as she tried to remember which slice had the love note in it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" she chirps aloud, grabbing the distinct slice and putting onto Kate's plate, \"Here ya go Katie-Kate!\" she pats the obese maid's swollen stomach, \"From Suzu~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe framed doctor turns to you, a betrayed look in her eye. It was almost as if to say, \"I swear, I had nothing to do with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after devouring her slice, Kate notices that something in her mouth doesn't taste quite right. It wasn't shortcake, it wasn't sugar, it wasn't anything remotely creamy... it tasted like paper! She pulled a tiny scroll from her mouth, and silently gasped as she read the no doubt disgustingly erotic message that it displayed. She turned to Suzu, and back to the note, and then back to Suzu as she pushed herself away from the table; struggling to stand and waddles out of the room with silent tears, leaving Suzu heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Mimi giggles, \"I didn't think she'd rush off to get her ballgag and leather tights <i>that</i> quickly!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week passed after that day, and you could see before your eyes the great change that occurred during those days. Suzu had remained in the kitchen constantly, shooting Mimi fierce, cruel looks of utter fury, much to the girl's general confusion. You had to explain to the woman how her attempt to \"help\" had only resulted in even more frustration and more pain than was logical and reasonable. Kate avoided everyone that week, choosing to remain in her quarters, her massive frame hidden in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it's impossible to gorge yourself to obesity over the course of a week, Suzu did expand slightly as she drowned her sorrows, no, smothered her sorrows, in food. She had once been a strong woman, almost an amazon, but that had  been, for lack of a better word, a lifetime ago. She was now a pudgy nurse, tears streaming down her plump cheeks on a regular basis, cheeks growing rounder at a steady yet constant rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm worried about her,\" Anya confessed as you were laying on a couch, her round face leaning against your chest, \"Suzu, I mean. Look, she's all depressed and everything, so maybe we should try to do something to help out with Kate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi walked into the room, her large belly swaying side to side as she plopped herself down beside them, the sofa sagging under her weight. It might have buckled under her bulk, but Anya and yourself weighed it down more. She held her head in her hands, glancing down regretfully at the floor. \"Mimi tries to help, and all that comes out is just nothing. Aw.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop feeling sorry for yourself!\" Anya snapped, \"Look, you are so damn dense, aren't you!? Don't you realize that you don't know if Kate would like reading that smut you wrote her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not smut, it's rom--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, romance is being hugged by someone and treated to something good, or when you feel all lovey dovey with someone, NOT when you write them some smutty shitty junk!\" Anya snapped, her face turning as red as her hair. Mimi shrunk away, genuine tears running down her cheeks now as she stared in awe at the large, imposing figure of Anya. \"Tell Kate what you did, make sure she knows Suzu's innocent, alright!? And if you don't do it, so help me God, I will kick your ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi nodded, briefly, before darting off, hastily. Anya sighed as she snuggled against your chest. \"That might make things a little better...\"</span></div></div>",

Your girlfriend huffs, pulling her hands from her hips and crossing her arms as she tilt her round body to the left, \"What could she be doing in there?\" she whines, \"This was supposed to be my time off, I wanna clean my half of the room!\" This managed to break the tension a little, as you raise an eyebrow questionably at her idea of time off. \"You clean your room when you're not working?\" Realizing what you were driving at, Anya exhales in an irritated fashion, \"I'm the head maid, duh, I couldn't live with myself if my room wasn't tidy.\" You accidently let out a small laugh at her delegation, to which she responds with a quick pop to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T LAUGH AT MY DISORDERS!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lover's feud was cut short by Mimi, awkwardly hefting her rotund little body out of the doorway; you couldn't help but notice that the tray she had come in with was missing. \"Well?\" Anya demands, \"How'd it go?\" The obese dwarf kicks her adorably chubby foot out ashamedly, avoiding eye contact with you or your portly head maid. \"Well, Kate liked the brownies Mimi brought her, but she didn't say so- (to which Anya nudged you lightly and quipped, \"No shocker there.\") -but I did get her to agree to... someting elwse...\" she exaggerated the babyish drawl in her final words in hopes for some pity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she delegated; Mimi had gotten Kate to agree to meet her in the garden. While it took a little convincing, thus the brownies, Mimi had calmly said that Suzu had nothing to do with the note. In fact, in her own baby-speak, Mimi had explained everything about the situation that had unfolded so far. About Suzu, her feelings, and her depression following Mimi's attempts to help. Unfortunately for Mimi, Kate didn't quite get the whole story, due to the mini-chef's motor mouth; to which Mimi was well aware of and decided to work it to her advantage. Regardless, Kate would be at that garden. Lest Mimi be forced to bribe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Anya exchange confused glances, \"Okay, so we get her into the garden, then what?\" Anya asks impatiently. A mischevious grin spreads across Mimi's chubby cheeks, creasing her lowermost chins. Her monster-belly jiggled as she pointed to you enthusiastically, \"Master gets Suzu into that same garden!!\" she touts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curse Mimi under your breath for voulenteering you for this little mission; Suzu already had a malicious side to her, you couldn't imagine how horrible it would be if you got involved in another fiasco like last time. You poke your head into the kitchen, which had become her home away from home since Sunday, and catch you depressed doctor in mid-feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick tear tracks run down her chubby cheeks, their freshness hinted at by her puffy eyes and broken sobbing. With a padded hand she grabs at her utensil, scooping out another spoonful of sweet fattening comfort food to push past her lips so that they may rest on her expanding frame. Her hair, usually kept neat and tidy, was allowed to fall wherever it may, which just so happened to be very unflattering to her rounded face. She sniffles solemnly and in a broken voice she beckons, \"I know you're there... you're not very good at hiding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been seen, you emerge from the doorway with some hesitation; not quite sure how you were to deal with Suzu in this state. \"H-Hi Suzu...\" you stammer, trying your best to seem informal while you take a seat beside her, \"How's it-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damned well how I'm going.\" she spits back through a mouthful of toffee flavored icecream, \"That short little bitch ruined my life!\" Immediately you try to play mediator, \"Suzu, you don't understand, she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think I understand!\" she barks back at you, \"In fact, I know damned well that I understand. I'm a doctor, remember?!\" she had you there, \"It just goes to show you that I wasn't meant to be happy; I was meant to be lonely, miserable, and depressed!\" You instinctively try to comfort her with a soft hand to hold hers, but she pulled away; inadvertantly causing her taught blouse to pop one its uppermost buttons. \"And FAT.\" she concludes in a self-loathing bellow, shoving another spoonful into her mouth as the word \"fat\" passed her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzu, come on.\" you attempt self confidence, it worked with Anya after all, \"You weren't meant to be miserable, and if you'll just listen I think I can hel-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you think you can help me?!\" Suzu barks at you in her displaced anger, \"You want to HELP me; fire that midget who cooks this fattening crap and it'll solve two problems!!\" you exhale sharply, obviously this wasn't the route to go with a woman as headstrong as Suzu. \"Look, Kate wants to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH AND KATE!!\" she raises her flabby arms in mock astonishment, \"Think of poor Kate in all this, scared shitless of who used to be her best friend in the whole wide world, who's she gonna turn to now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzu, just listen and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm done listening, I've decided that I'm just going to quit.\" she raises her hands defensively, \"I'll find a practice to work with, I can take it, I'm a big girl!\" the dumpy doctor says furiously, \"And whenever Mimi decides to apoligize, she's gonna have to make an appointment and spend $300 dollars to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUZU!!\" you shout, \"SHUT.

Suzu stared at you with wide eyes, eyes filled with awe, frustration, and, in the end, simple bliss. It was shocking how such a usually intimidating woman was now so docile before you, so simple and calmed down, staring up at you with a placid sort of expression on her face. It was shocking this could possibly be the same individual from several days before. Glancing over at you, a soft expression on her round face, she asked, simply, \"You did this all just for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, yeah,\" you replied, hastily, \"Now,  c'mon! We have to get you a little ready for later, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya helped Suzu fix herself up. Naturally, the lines of tears running down her pudgy cheeks were swept away, but then there were other things, such as her frayed hair spiraling all over the place, her clothing disarrayed and messy.  It hung off her body, but her now plump frame, for better or worse, held her clothing tightly across her bust and frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after preparing the girl, Suzu walked toward the spot prepared for her.  You watched from afar as Suzu passed by Mimi, giving her a venomous glare which made the plump, rolly-polly girl tremble in fear, recoiling as she held her hands and arms out before her, protectively. The far larger nurse (larger in height, not girth) gave her a fearsome glance before walking off, her entire body trembling as she neared her designated location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she'll be okay?\" you asked Anya, anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I think so,\" Anya replied, \"Though she's probably extremely nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu's knees buckled occassionnally under her as she neared her destination, and waited.  You watched from afar as Kate's round form approached her, and they spoke. Seconds passed like hours as you felt yourself drawn into their conflict, their plight, despite the fact you couldn't hear a word they were saying. Mimi craned her neck to hear them, but Anya dragged her back by her hair, tugging her into the ground. At one point, Mika attempted to eavesdrop, but due to her massive frame, she utterly failed at being stealthy, and Anya, once again, pulled her by her hair into the nearest pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an eternal five minutes, Suzu approached you, her face expressionless. Was this a sign of rejection, or of utter shock that Kate accepted her. your throat and mouth dry, you finally asked \"So, uh, how did it go?\"</span></div></div>",

Tears could clearly be seen on her soft cheeks, fresh and painful. All you want is to take her in a big hug to squeeze away the hurt, but now wouldn't be the time. Kate briefly glances at you and quickly makes her way by the three of you. You just watch until Kate rounds the corner to her quarters. Your not completely sure, but you swear you can hear quiet sobbing coming from the hall Kate went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...I guess I really messed up, huh...\" said Mimi with more than a hint of regret in her voice. All you and Anya can do is nod at her statement, which activates the Mimi tear program. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" *sniff*...It's all my fault!!! Why oh why did I have to write that stupid little note! Agghhh....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is sigh at seeing Mimi like this, all sad and quivering. You move down and put your arm around her plump arms. \"Hey ,hey.

Just by peeking your head into the doorway, your suspicions were proven wrong. The only person there was Mimi, toiling away over a huge cake that read 'SOWWY' in bright orange frosting. \"Oh, hiya Master!\" the tiny woman puts down her icing gun to waddle over to you and embrace your lower half in a big squishy hug, \"Sowwy 'bout breakfast, Mimi'll get right on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little wary at Suzu's absence, things seemed a little awkward just by being with Mimi. \"Thanks Mimi, Anya'll start swinging if she doesn't get some food in her.\" you joke... well, halfway joke, \"Actually, I was wondering if you'd seen Suzu, she isn't out at the table and she isn't in here... is she, y'know, okay?\" Even while bending over to get some pans for a lightning-quick breakfast, you can see the bounce fade in Mimi's step. \"No, Mimi hasn't seen Suzu all morning...\" she says solemnly, \"But that's why Mimi's making this Extra Special Please Forgive Me Chocolate Cake!\" you eyeball the confection questionably, \"Mimi, I think one of Suzu's problems is her self esteem... maybe chocolate cake the size of a table isn't the way to go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, was she in there?\" Anya asks from her seated position, no doubt waiting patiently as possible for her breakfast and your return. \"No, she wasn't...\" you mumble, \"Hey, Anya?\" she perks up at your melancholy expression, \"You think it would be okay if I skipped breakfast just this once, I wanna make sure Suzu's okay.\" The volatile vixen doesn't even mess with you like usual, \"Sure thing, you go make sure she's okay... but I expect lunch with my boyfriend, my tummy needs company!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, naturally, you started your search for Suzu in her office. She was always an early bird, so it was concievable that even in her current state she would be working. As you crack the door, you see that the lights are off. You poke the intercom, nothing. You make sure to check every nook and cranny in her workplace before heading to your next location... her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting heavilly after trekking the entire household in search of Suzu's quarters, you already feel emptiness pouring out of the room. Ignoring your feelings of doubt, you quietly creep into the doctor's room; remarkably similar to your own, minus the bathroom and balcony, and adding a few dozen bookshelves with medical journals. Searching around a bit proved fruitless, rummaging through her knicknacks proved useless, and checking under her bed was just stupid (\"like she could fit under the bed!\") Without much else of a choice, your search leads you to Kate; maybe the two had reconciled and she had spent the night with the obese object of her affection? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After walking, yet again, to the complete other side of the house you find yourself at a familiar door; Anya and Kate's room, as you preferred that name rather than the 'Maid Quarters'. You knock, not only going without response but it seemed that this room was empty too! That couldn't be, had- had Kate and Suzu actually run away? Well, as long as they were together you guessed... wait, was that... crying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredibly faint, like someone was crying with cotton in their mouths, but you could just barely make out incredibly silent bawling. No doubt Kate, if it was this quiet. You turn the doorknob, old and antiquey, to leave the door alightly ajar. \"Kate?\" you say softly, \"Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't totally dark, the windows were open and everything. And even in the dark, Kate's pajamed body was so pale it would probably have been easy to make her out. The poor engorged girl was crying, clutching to a stuffed animal with her fat grip. Her eyes darted to you, shocked that anyone had come up to see her. Without saying a word, her broken expression nodded 'yes'. And you followed her request, sitting down right beside her . Suzu could wait, Kate was obviously hurting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour interaction with Kate had been limited since sparking your relationship with Anya, mostly due to a mutual awkwardice that you couldn't seem to shake. As such, you hadn't really gotten close to Kate in a very long time. Meaning you hadn't seen the magnitude of her increasingly high weight up close. She had gotten huge, slowly climbing her way almost into Mika's initial class. Her pale skin bulged out of her too-tight pajamas, belly pouring into her lap,  and her rearend providing a gigantic cushion. However happy she may have been to see you, her permenately dimpled cheeks would not flash a smile, for the ordeal with Suzu had proved far too much for her child-like demeanor to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kate.\" you say with a soft enthusiasm, \"How're you feeling?\" she shakes her head 'no', breaking out into more quiet sobs. Your mute maid was broken on the inside, even before Mimi's intervention, now things were just so much worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a single word, you embrace her; something you should have done since the beginning, not spoil her, not avoid her. Just hug her. Your arms squish the flab on her torso, her huge breasts pressing agasint eachother and up against her padded collarbone. You expected her to freak out, \"afraid of physical intimacy\" was what Suzu called her, but no; she just accepted the hug. In fact, much to your surprise, she broke away only to turn back to you and lock your smaller frame into a tight hug of your own. So you just sat there for a long time, hugging this poor obese girl as she sobbed quietly into your shoulder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though you weren't the one torn up on the inside, Kate's pain rubbed off on you as you choked back small salty droplets of your own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lead the portly maid by the hand to the kitchen, after making sure to leave the room so she could get into her new elastic uniform, having the compassion to give the poor girl the day off. \"Boy, Anya's gonna be pissed...\" you think to yourself, imagining the horrible atrocities your battleaxe plumper of a girlfriend would commit if she knew that only <i>one</i> maid would get to slack off. You put Mimi in charge of her (against your better judgement) and tell her to keep an eye on her. If she started crying, Mimi was to be right there to comfort her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one place left to check in this whole damned estate, and that was the security cameras in Mika's <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">gazebo</span> office. You enter the lawn ornamentation, greeted by the somewhat neglected overgrown guard with a big squishy hug. \"YOU CAME TO VISIT ME?!\" Mika wails as she crushes you in her mighty grip, \"AW!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mika... can't... breath...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, sorry~\" the mighty woman giggles as she puts you down, \"So what's up?\" she asks casually, \"You almost never come out to my neck of the woods.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzu's not anywhere in the house, so I was wondering if I could check your surveillance cameras to... y'know, see where she might have gone?\" you delegated to her, responding with a somewhat dumb expression. \"But Master, you don't need to check the cams!\" she said childishly, \"'Cause Suzu left about three hours ago!\" Ironically enough, three hours ago was two hours past eight thirty (ie: one hour after you were suppossed to be up and running the estate) No time to worry about that now though, you may have caught a lead to where Suzu might be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mika, did she <i>say</i> where she was going?!\" you spit the words out frantically. Mika put a flabby finger on her lowermost chin in deep thought, \"Well, she had her breifcase... and that trapper keeper... oh, and a plane ticket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A PLANE TICKET?! you holler, \"WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HER?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she already paid for the ticket, and you can't just <b>refund</b> those!\" she answered childishly, \"I thought I'd be doing her a favor by letting her go, that's almost her whole paycheck, right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get to the airport!\" you start running down the driveway like a lunatic, only for Mika to stop you with a flabby hand. \"MIKA!!\" you holler frantically, \"Don't be silly Master, you'll never get there on foot... I'll drive you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour expression of haste and great worry was replaced... with one of great fear and distress.</span></div></div>",

An hour of cursing at neighboring cars, high speed races that had been \"challenged\", and an hour of Mika behind the wheel. You start to doubt if you'd ever get to the airport in time to catch Suzu's flight. But sure enough, Mika's reckless driving may have saved your ass; all planes were docked ... for now. \"ThanksMikawaitformeherebye!\" you speed towards the front door, knocking several aspiring passengers out of the way in your desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work your way to the Informations Desk, not really sure why you even bothered to check there first. \"Hey, have you seen a really tall, really blonde woman?!\" you must have looked horrible, sweating bullets and panting loudly. \"Um....\" the plump indian woman behind the counter stammered, \"C-Could you be more specific sir, we get flights from Sweden and I think you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off, not having a moment to spare if she didn't know where Suzu was. Frantically, like a jackrabbit on speed, you run laps around the airport. Your feet hurt, your chest feels like it's on fire, but once you find Suzu she'd probably have a pill for that. \"SUZU?!\" You try A1, no answer, \"SUZU?!\" you make it all the way to F5, still no answer. \"SUZU?!!?!\" you holler into the woman's bathroom, \"SUZU??!\" you try the food court. Nothing. But that doesn't mean you'll stop running, even if it means-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your sililoquey was cut short as you rammed into someone. Not a security gaurd, as your behavior would have suggested, but someone soft. Someone who reeked of coffee... someone with... really huge boobs to act as a wonderful airbag. \"Ah!!\" she fell backwards onto her padded rearend, dropping all of her belongings to the shiny tiled floor of the airport. \"Watch where you're going you maniac!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry ma'am, I-I'm just looking for a friend.\" you clammor up all the scattered possesions for her; a briefcase, a first-class plane ticket, and... a trapper keeper? It seemed a little odd for a grown woman to carry around a trapper keeper. You look to the floor, picture had apparantly fallen out of said keeper face down on the floor. You pick up the photograph, a tall, tanned, amazon woman with a porcelain white maid, with an old man who you couldn't quite place... \"Suzu?\" you repeat, hopefully for the last time today...</span></div></div>",

She was dressed in a concealing overcoat and her illfitting regular garments underneath, but there was no mistake about it; this woman was your friend. \"S-Suzu!\" the name sounds so much more meaningful now that she was right in front of you, \"I know, I know, I heard it all in the women's restroom; help me up?\" she said sarcastically, heaving and ho'ing her portly frame about. Seeing her in distress, you outstretch your hand for her to grab; something which she begrudgingly accepts as necessary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately you, your pathetic might was nowhere near enough to lift Suzu's impressive statue and girth from the polished tiles of the airport. To make matters worse, you were sent tumbling to the ground alongside her! Since this is a harem piece, your face landed inbetween her impressive coatpuppies, and likewise because this is an FA piece, the rest of you landed on her soft squishy body. One hand locked onto hers, while the other one shamelessly groped one of her stray lovehandles. Her soft skin brushed against yours as you were brought nearly cheek to cheek, noses a mere centimeter apart. And to make matters worse, against your better instincts and judgements you noticed a peculiar bulge in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh Master, I knew you were a letch but I never imagined you liked 'em tall dark  chubby lesbo.\" she teased, much to your distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL YOU CUT THAT OUT?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout moving you from your perched position, Suzu chuckles, \"Oh come on now, I was only lightening the tension.\" she smiles solemnly at you, \"You don't want me to go, do you?\" she asks. Of course, your answer is no; \"Of course I don't, Suzu, you're one of my best friends!\" Her smile grows wider, yet sadder still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and you've become special to me too.\" she says, stroking one of your red-hot cheeks with her chubby hand, \"After all the times I've messed with you, even threatened you over Kate, and all the free labor I've squeezed out of you, despite your debaucherous intentions (\"WHAT DEBAUCHEROUS INTENTIONS?!\") you've still become someone so very dear to me.\" Suzu visibly chokes up a bit, \"But that part of my life is over, I can't go back there while Kate still hates me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Suzu, she doesn't hate you!\" you try to reason with her, ignoring the growing crowd of people swarming around you, \"She's just-\" Suzu cuts you off, \"Please, don't make this any harder than it has to be; I'm going and that's all there is to be said about it.\" She sniffles, a tear rolling down her chubby cheek, \"But for what it's worth, for the past few months your time at the estate has made me very happy; It's made all of the girls very happy, and I'm so sorry that it has to come to this.\" Suzu pauses to reach past her busom and give you a motherly kiss on the forehead, \"But as long as Kate and I aren't getting along, there's no reason for me to be there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntense throbbing fills your head, her words don't seem to reach you as anger fills your veins and rage boils your brain. Your face visibly darkens, and your lips feel incredibly dry all of the sudden. \"No.\" you order, \"You're not going, that's that.\" Suzu's head jumps back slightly in surprise, \"You can't tell me what to do, I don't work for you anymore!\" she retorts, \"I've already paid for my plane ticket, I'm getting far far away from you and Kate and ALL OF MY PROBLEMS!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand throbs in rthym to Suzu's aching cheek. The crowd explodes in protest and uproar, but your accumulated rage deafens you to their cries. \"GROW UP.\" you bark, \"Wh-What?\" Suzu asks, scared stiff of you and your upstaged palm, \"You heard me, GROW UP.\" you repeat, \"I'm NOT letting you go for such a STUPID reason.\" </span></div></div>",

She kicked, and she flailed, she even accidentally knocked out a woman from the onlooking crowd with a kicked off stray shoe. But it was all useless, she was far from the athletic woman she once was; and the currently out of shape Suzu didn't have nary the energy to buck you off. \"THIS. IS. STUPID!!\" she hollered, arching her back and lifting her entire expanse up into the air, \"GET OFF!!\" but you only grabbed harder, completely lost in your desperation to keep such a close friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Suzu was left a sweating jiggling mass, still wearing you as a belt of defeat. Again, you climbed her expanse; \"You know.... this isn't... a very... adult way... of handling things...\" Suzu wheezed, only for you to lock her into the biggest hug you could muster. Without words, she understood. She understood your desperation, your fear, and your desire to keep such a tightly knit friendship- no a \"family\" of sorts- together. \"So, what do you say, Suzu?\" you ask, your own eyes tearing up a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence. Between you, Suzu, and the crowd, there was complete and total quietness that eeked out to the rest of the airport...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give 'im a chance!\" a woman called from the crowd<br>\r\n\"He obviously wants you back!\" another cheered<br>\r\n\"Cut the guy a break!\" a distinctly male voice cried<br>\r\n\"Take it off!\" a senile gentleman catcalled<br>\r\n\"Yeah... wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I'll stay.\" Suzu smiled warmly at you, returning your hug with a big squishy embrace. The crowd roared, you smiled and laughed as you looked your portly nurse in the face; she smiled too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just after my trip to the Bahamas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" you shouted, releasing yourself from the hug. You and another man from the crowd pried Suzu's girth from the ground, hoping to get some answers. \"Well yeah, I already paid for the ticket; so why not enjoy myself?\" she giggled, only for you to start chasing her around the airport \"SO YOU GET TO GO TO THE BAHAMAS WHILE I STAY HERE AND WORK?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hire a temp!\" she called, waddling about with surprising speed, \"You'd only be gone for about three months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THREE MONTHS??!?!\" Your pace quickens as you catch up to the jogging fatty in front of you, \"Oh come on, this is my first holiday ever!\" she snickers, beding over to catch her long lost breath, \"What do you say we eat some of this nasty airport food, I'm starved!\" she gives you her patendent \"breast squeeze please\" stance and watches you squirm, \"Your treat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I spent all my money on my ticket~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her, she looks at you. Your bond has increased so much from this significant ten minutes of wrestling about on the floor and slapping her big fat cheek. You both smile, \"Yeah, I guess... just this once though!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you spent the meager two hours you had left together. Suzu downed five pizzas at your expense, you bought her a book to read on the plane, and you both said your rather misty-eyed goodbyes. It would be three long months before you would see Suzu again, and you had resigned yourself to that fact; she needed time to collect herself and get back on her feet. in a strange mixture of happiness and melancholy, you made you way back to the parking lot to discover that Mika had forgotten about you in leiu of fast food and a nap back at her post. It would be four hours before Anya remembered that you had skipped their lunch, and she came to pummel you/pick you up.</span></div></div>",

She had a wonderful time in her personal solitude and it certainly showed on her tan\u2026and on her figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the time she spent lazing about on a sunny beach and her casual visits to the all-you-could-eat buffet; Suzu had actually managed unconsciously to loose 3 kilograms on her still chubby frame. It hadn't been intentional, but her frequent long walks on the beach and her daily swim in the hotel pool attributed to slowing down her gain.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite a momentary reaction by Suzu, she soon got over it and in a minute was walking that way. On the way to the Maid\u2019s quarters, Suzu noticed at once that it wasn't just Mika\u2019s waistline that had changed. For such a dreary day, it made the inside of the manor look dark and scary, more so since all the lights were turned off and in some places, white sheets were thrown over furniture in an attempt to reduce the amount of dusting needed\u2026a sign of things gone awry since her holiday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the annex where they maids all lived, they turned into the first room on the left which belonged to the two maids of the house slept. Inside everyone was waiting her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuzu!\u201d Mimi catapulted from her seat and bear hugged the returning vacationer \u201cWe missed you so much!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking above the head of the household chief, one quick look around the room told her everything Suzu needed to know. It was rare enough all of them in the same room \u2013 except dinner of course \u2013 but the looks on their faces told her how glad they were she was back, and that she had certainly come back to a real mess. Anya was leaning on the back wall and had lost some of the weight she had put on since their new master, Mimi was still remarkably the same, and Kate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to Kate?!\u201d Suzu at once panicked. Kate was sound asleep, but with a large cast around her right leg. Her weight also looked reduced by a few kilograms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe broke it about a month after you left\u201d Anya started to explain \u201cAfter which, master ordered everyone go on a stupid diet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Diet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone crazy!\u201d Mimi finally cried out \u201che thinks it was his fault and so he cut my food budget to stop us overeating!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Suzu said confused as she took a closer look at the leg \u201cThat doesn't sound like him at all, what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I guess you could say things didn\u2019t hold together in while you were gone\u201d Anya started to summarize \u201cit all started when Master started blaming himself for you running away\u2026and then he started distancing himself from all of us\u2026but only after he got swamped by the paperwork and made a big mistake in managing the finances\u2026or something\u2026and then Kate broke her leg\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did she do that?\u201d Suzu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe kind of\u2026ate a lot after you left\u201d Mika started \u201ccomfy eating\u2026I think you call it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Suzu was finally getting it \u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then she got so fat she broke the damn ladder and broke her leg\u201d Anya finished it off and started getting angry \u201cand then our stupid master overreacted by putting us on this diet and exercise routine because he is afraid we'll have a heart attack or something...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu needed to sit down. She dropped down on Anya\u2019s bed and looked up at Mimi and Mika, both with expressions between worry and relief that Suzu was back to hopefully sort things out. Suzu was quickly regretting every second of her vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what else do I need to know?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust master is stupid, crazy, paranoid and stupid\u201d Anya replied \u201cAnd I don't know how long we can put up with this, if you can\u2019t turn him around\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the looks of everyone else, it had been an idea they had already considered, though they also didn't sound like they really wanted to do it.

By the time the two of them approached the end where they made a right turn this time, Anya's flashlight became handy. It was almost pitch black without the lights on as they walked towards the study where their master was. Suzu could see a dim light coming from under the door to the elusive study and stopped to listen. She wanted to hear the inside, assuming she would hear the ticking noise of the grandfather clock inside but she didn\u2019t hear it, meaning nobody had turned the key in it for a few days. Instead Suzu could hear the noise of a pen scratching something loudly. Deciding against waiting any longer, Suzu knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d came the sound of master\u2019s voice, right away sounding quite exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Suzu\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu briefly heard him mutter something along the lines of saying thanks to someone before he replied \u201cPlease\u2026.co-come in!\u201d</span></div></div>",

After about five seconds of observations, she finally asked the most obvious questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Suzu started \u201cAnd how bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit that she isn\u2019t a fool. Even with the tan, you can tell her mind has already started working again in a problem solving mode. You want to tell her exactly what's going on, but first you want some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnya?\u201d you turn to Suzu\u2019s escort and your \u2013 hopefully still after all of this is over \u2013 girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrew a pot of coffee with the usual condiments and bring it up here\u2026\u201d you instruct her with the tone of an order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya sighed at the defeat at being ordered out and away from finding out what was going on, but before she left; Anya was given an additional order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnya? When you\u2019re done with that; please inform the others I want to speak with all of you in the dining room\u2026in about\u2026give it\u20262 hours or so, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u201d Anya responded with more animated this time before leaving the study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu waited until the door was closed before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you got your head maid out of the study now, now are you going to tell me what happened?\u201d Suzu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and started to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started when she; the Manor\u2019s resident medic \u2013 and also the designated secretary for the paperwork \u2013 had left for her holiday. You had decided to make an honest effort to do the work without her assistance. But unfortunately, you hadn\u2019t really known what you were getting into until it was too late. At first it looked pretty simple; manage the stock portfolio, read the minutes of company meetings that your uncle had invested in, and then write up your buy, sell and other business transaction orders where you then \u2013 and previously only did \u2013 affix your signature to before faxing it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite the best of intentions, even you had to admit now that you had screwed up. Judging by the reports that kept coming in; you were now fairly sure that you had more than likely destroyed the fortune your uncle had created through some very bad choices. What made it even worse was your attempt to hide this problem from your maids, all of whom depended on you for their wellbeing. You explained that despite what you had said to Anya and the others, the real reason why you cut food budget to only the basics, wasn\u2019t over your reaction to Kate\u2019s injury, but as you explained carefully\u2026you had no idea if you could even afford their \u2013 judging by their collective eating habits, expensive \u2013 monthly food budget or even the electricity bill anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen queried on why you would do such a thing, you went on to explain that it was a habit from the old days; from before you became master of this manor. You have plenty of experience with living with very little cash during tough times and living on a diet of instant noodles until the next paycheck was typical for you once. Unfortunately, you never really had others to worry about as well and in your hope to not alarm the others, you kept it all quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just call me?\u201d Suzu asked, after hearing the fantastic story of your own creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were unreachable, and I thought I could fix this before you came back\u2026\u201d you said honestly \u201cand given what happened before you left, how could I call you back early?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven you had to admit that you were quite stubborn to believe you could fix this problem you caused. Now having told the one person you knew who might fix this, you waited for her reaction to see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow bad off are we?\u201d Suzu asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea\u2026I don\u2019t know how much we have, I don\u2019t know what we own, I really don\u2019t know anything\u201d you finally admit to yourself <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu sighed for a moment and decided to take action, she smiled as she stood and walked around to where you sat. if there was one thing you had been hoping for all week it was that assuring smile and the words that she was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s find out...\u201d Suzu said as she stood \u201c\u2026before you have to talk to the others\u201d</span></div></div>",

Surely not, but, in the first week you sent out a help-wanted add for a replacement, chaos reigned supreme in your humble abode.  The first thing you noticed was that Kate had, alas, fallen into a depression. She you seldom saw her, and when you did, there were streaks of tears running down her cherubic, chubby cheeks. You wanted to hug her, to make her just feel better about herself, about the world, about everything, but, alas, nothing you did cheered her up. She simply returned to sobbing in her room, no doubt upset at the prospect that she, potentially, hurt Suzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor girl,\" Anya mumbled, sighing under her breath as she bit into a half-cooked cookie, almost spitting it out in shock as she tasted the poorly beat flower, \"Yuck!  This is all grainy and--wait, did Mimi use an actual flo--she did, didn't she!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her own guilt, Mimi had started to crumble apart as well. Her cooking, once superb, now bordered on the fine line between inedible and grotesque. For the past few days, you have secretly ordered take-out for all the staff, even Mimi, though she was unaware who was paying for all this food. Kate refused to eat it initially, but soon gave in after the third day of her mournful fasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu's return was the only thing that could truly bring everyone together again, but a replacement for the nursing position needed to be found on a temporary basis. Finally, however, you received a bite. In fact, multiple. You had a call late in the night, which forced you to leave Anya's pudgy side on the mattress as you as you placed the reciever to your ear. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm calling in response to the add I saw in the paper regarding the nursing position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" you stammered, jumping up, eagerly, \"Yes, yes!

That's fine,\" you said, unconcerned about money, \"We just need the position to be filled as soon as possible. When can you start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow morning!

Without Suzu around to mediate (and in no small part the depression that had encircled due to her absence), things had definately gone to hell in a handbasket around the estate. The accounting was a wreck, apparantly Suzu acted as a safety net for your fatal mathematical errors, and you had no idea what to do about the strange fungus that had grown underneath the stairwell. The house was even P. O.'d, no question about it, your days had been foggy and muggy for the past week and facilities were constantly breaking down; last week, Mimi nearly electrocuted herself when the electric stove short-circuited!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup, it really took three women to take Suzu's place (no pun intended). You never realized just how much of a vital role she played in your day-to-day life around here; these three months were certainly going to be long ones. But, today seemed like it was going to be a good one. So without much hesitation, you bounce out of your bed and quickly change into your best casual attire to greet your expected hired help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you stepped out of your chambers, you were greeted with the ever-suspicious Anya. With her arms crossed defiantly over her swollen ivory cleavage, your plump redheaded employee/girlfriend looked just a shade more displeased with your behavior than usual. \"So, I hear we should be expecting <b>three</b> new members of the household?\" she huffed, puffing out her chest as if to stare you down, \"So, what, you just wanted some fresh ass to grab around here, is that it?\" she demanded, cheeks growing increduously red. \"Anya, when have I ever grabbed anyone else's ass around here?\" your rebuttle is plain and spoken clearly, but she simply shrugs it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are they prettier than me?\" she asks, \"Skinnier; oh wait, you like 'em big don'cha?\" she teases you, now you <b>know</b> she's just playing. \"Oh come on Anya, I just want to eat some breakfast.\" you plead with her after an uncomfortable night of wrestling with a newly emerged spring in your matress. \"Oh you're no fun; anxious to get a look at the new doctors are we?\" she wraps her soft around yours as she escorts you down the hall and to the stairs. \"Anya, please, I'm just hiring a temp for Suzu's holiday.\" you delegate groggilly as you and your fat girlfriend make your way to the first floor. \"And what if they want to stay; do I have to compete with some nerdy chick for my precious chubby-chasing master?\" she lays it on thick as the two of you reach the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anya, you know you never have to compete for my affection.\" you smile, at that she gives you a soft peck on the cheek. \"Good answer, I didn't nearly double my body weight for some scrawny bitch to come in and steal you away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the doors to find the usual melancholy of your dining room; still feeling somewhat empty without the constant coffee-sipping presence of Suzu. Mimi rested a fat cheek in a fat hand, twirling her colored cereal about in her milky bowl solemnly. There was a lightbulb out in one of the electronic chandeliers, something that you would undoubtedly have to get up there and fix yourself (much to your chagrin, Suzu could just do it by standing on the table) Mika seemed to be the only one unaffected by the mysterious depression that had engulfed the household, happilly munching away on her take-out breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your seat at the head of the table, reaching over to grab Mimi's box of cereal and half-gallon of milk to pour yourself a bowl while Anya decided to fend for herself in the wasteland that was Mimi's kitchen. Unfortunately, Kate was absent yet again for breakfast, probably sneaking down and getting something to eat earlier before your arrival... \"OH GAWD!!\" she hollered girlishly, \"SOMETHING IN THAT SINK JUST WINKED AT ME!!\" But no one really seemed to notice, each wrapped up in their own preoccupation. You sigh at the recent development, understanding the pain of losing such a close friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could even so much as take a sip of your cereal's milky contents, the doorbell rang. Anya hurried out of the kitchen eagerly, much rather faring the new girls than whatever atrocities Mimi had left half-cooked in her battlezone. In her current apparal, no one would willingly believe that this porker in the lime-green tee and gray sweatpants was the head maid, you had to chuckle slightly at that as you decided to follow her to the front door. You watched as Anya visibly squirmed in her tight outfit, pale creamy flesh bulging out all over the place. \"IT'S NOT FUNNY, STUPID!!!\" she slapped you in the back of the head just at the door, where her demeanor instantly changed as she greeted the three newest members of the household...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys?\" you catch the meager attention of your two remaining staffmembers, \"Can I have your attention please?\" Mika and Mimi complied readilly, but with a certain lack of enthusiasm. \"I think that's about as good as their gonna get.\" Anya quipped as she examined the dour look on the fat womens' faces. You couldn't help but agree with her silently as you continue uninterrupted; \"Our new medical staff came today, so let me introduce Betsy, Veronica, and Kara, who will be acting as our temp doctor during Suzu's absence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three women each had their own way of introducing themselves, Betsy was the obvious energetic, though lacking in height, enthusiastic of the group who seemed absolutely enthralled at simply being there. Veronica seemed... enthusiastic enough, but her creased black eyebrows definately said that she wasn't near used to smiling this much. And Kara seemed somewhat familiar, tall and busty with a nice tan. If it wasn't for the bright orange hair and a slightly different nose, you could almost place her as someone you knew before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, take it easy and help them around the house, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I VOULENTEER!!\" Mika waved a flabby arm euphorically, \"I'll show them all around the house and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just come with me and Mr. Public Speaker of the Year here,\" Anya said coldly, grabbing Betsy by her twig-like arm, \"It's just safer that way...\"</span></div></div>",

Veronica stifled a yawn, nodded at you, and slowly ambled after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                         ****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying Kate had not taken Suzu's exodus well would be an understatement. Aside from being the only soul she trusted utterly, Kate blamed her own actions for Suzu's decision. After learning that Suzu was merely vacationing and allowing a week to pass, she was doing better, but still rather tender. Since she would rarely speak to you, the only thing you could do was quietly sit next to her in bed grasping her hand for support as she leaned against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing sexual about it, you were relieved to say. After choosing Anya, your relationship with Kate had become more brother-sister then potential lovers. You offered comfort in the gloom of Kate's room and nothing more. Fortunately, Anya understood this and, if not exactly happy with the situation, didn't ride your ass. Too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak and flash of light announced Anya's appearance. Turning to tell Kate goodbye, you noticed that she had fallen asleep, her tear streaked face at peace. You gently lowered her onto the bed and quietly exited the room with your plump girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Kate. You know she wakes up crying at night? Suzu leaving really did a number on her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but she'll be back soon...ish. How'd the tour go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya's face soured. \"Ok, for the most part. I don't like that Kara woman. I think she's comin' on to you. I didn't pork up just to have some skinny <i>skank</i> take you away from me. And one of them pinched my butt. And my side. I think we got another lesbo on our hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see who it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no, whaddya think, I was walking backwards? I have no idea which one it was. Don't think it's Kara, though. She's only after rich, stupid men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be stupid, but there's one thing I know.\" You drew Anya close. \"I'm the only one allowed to grope your ass. Or your lovehandles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave each a loving squeeze causing Anya to squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep that up, I might just have to revoke your privileges!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                         ****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the new help, things settled into a semblance of normality. Though no one could do as good a job as Suzu, three could make an adequate replacement. Veronica's enthusiasm only lasted for the first couple of days and her more laid back nature asserted itself. She was soon burrowed in the warmth of the kitchens, helping Mimi with maintenance and general cookery. With a partner in crime, Mimi soon put the catastrophe she engineered out of her mind and began cooking five star meals again, often using the lazy black haired lass as a test subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy's enthusiasm, in contrast, only intensified. Within a week, she was zooming along the halls, dusting, polishing, vacuuming and whatever other little chore there was to do. She filed. She organized. She spellchecked. A constant cheery presence, she spread good cheer in what was a very dour house. Though initially wary, most of the girls in the house quickly grew to enjoy her presence, even if Anya found it wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara found herself work in Suzu's office and would take every available opportunity to flirt with you making Anya livid. After dragging you into the office and explaining to the girl about your relationship, Anya silently fumed every time you went into the room. True, Suzu had done much of the same but Suzu was Suzu, not some upstart newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, if things weren't doing wonderful, at least they were satisfactory.</span></div></div>",

But she was just excited about her job, you completely understood that she was just being enthusiastic. \"No, not at all...\" you say sleepilly, only just now realizing that you hadn't woken up at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY BEDROOM?!\" you shout, throwing both the covers <i>and</i> Betsy off of you in your thrashing, \"AND GET OFF OF ME!!\" due to her small stature and (still) light weight, the poor braided girl was sent into the wall, sliding down and busting her small behind on the floor. \"Ow!\" she whimpered, \"I was just putting everything down on your bed, I swear!!\" she is quick to defend herself, a heavy shade of embarrassed red crawls up her cheeks as she rubs the back of her head. \"Oh.\" you peep, still not quite used to an employee who wasn't raunchy, randy, or abusive, \"My bad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I think I understand why you're so jumpy in a crazy house like this.\" she says almost all-too-forgivingly. All you can do is let out a knowing laugh, \"Yeah, I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks all these women are crazy!\" you say as you offer her a helping hand off of the ground. As you help her up, you can't help but notice just how light she is. Even after staying so long in this house of seemingly endless treats, Betsy Franklin's stick thin body hadn't gained an ounce! In fact, it almost seemed like she'd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're looking great Betsy!\" you can't help but be amazed that the diminiative and somewhat klutzy nurse had actually looked <i>thinner</i> than when she got here! \"Have you lost some weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face turned that embarassed shade of red again as she turned away from you, \"Oh no, I-I don't think so... I-I guess it's just all the extra chores I've picked up around here, that's all!\" betsy squeaked, glasses getting foggy at your compliments as she shrunk into her sweats. Your expression changes to one of humorously blank realization, \"Oh yeah, that's right... Anya and Mika have really started to take advantage of her trusting nature...\" you grimace to yourself, perturbed by the respective devious sides of your girlfriend and guard, \"Well whatever you're doing, it's working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thanks.\" Betsy giggles as she adjusts her round glasses nervously, bending over to collect and straighten the pile of papers that you had kicked off of the bed earlier. \"It's nothing, really though!\" she squeaks meekly, finishing her stack and carrying them close to her near flat chest. \"Hey, you wanna get some breakfast?\" you ask her, \"I'm about to head that way, why don't you come along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, just let me finish up with these...\" she says professionally, bending over your  bed to double-check her organizational skills, \"I think the Guadalupe Contract got mixed up with the Hidalgo Plan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" a foreign voice opted from the doorway; it was Anya! Just the woman you hadn't seen this morning first-thing(something that she was probably upset at)! \"What, gotta give the new girl <i>all</i> my duties now; I thought that I was supposed to wake you up!\" she huffs, crossing her arms and sashaying into your quarters, \"A girl could get really jealous if she thought her boyfriend was making googly eyes with some new office jockey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, \"office jockey\" was far from Betsy's current position in the house. Since coming into the role of the house's nurse and evenly dividing Suzu's duties between her and her colleagues, the would-be doctor had also adopted several of Anya's chores and regular duties! At first it was nothing, a cleaned room here, a swept floor there; but Anya had started to take these acts of kindness for granted... and her laziness definately showed. Already, in just a short month, Anya had already added another twenty or so to her bloated body. Her belly sagged a bit further down her lap, brushing awkwardly against the tops of her white thighs as she walked now, and all of her outfits seemed to reveal a sneaky crescent moon of soft ivory flesh that victoriously peeked from the bottom of every top. Her ass, quite gigantic already, only seemed to accumulate more pudge as she continued to suffocate her poor cheeks with the couch cushions, Mimi's newest batch of cookies in one hand and the remote in the other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT GOOGLY EYES?!\" you shout as Anya's soft arm interlocks with yours, sticking a slender tounge out at Betsy playfully. \"Oh I'm just bustin' your chops, come on, let's go get some breakfast; I'm itching for another one of those hot-fudge chocolate chip pancakes!\" Anya says excitedly as her stomach joins yours in a duet of hunger. Your girlfriend holds you close as you escort her down the hall, keeping your arms lovingly interlocked as she continued to berade you playfully, keeping a watchful eye on the bespeckled \"competition\"...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey thewre evwybody!\" Mimi's most adorable smile decorated her round face, cheeks bouncing as she giggled excitedly at your appearance, \"Bweakfast'll be ready in abowt ten minutes- twry not to stawve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AGH!!\" Anya groaned from her seat, \"I'M NOT GONNA LAST TEN MINUTES!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me you won't starve...\" Kara quips from across the table (knowingly sitting beside Mika, lest any actual violence occur)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got something to say to my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeals around the house were getting back to their usual livelyhood. Even if they <i>did</i> often end with Anya threatening to rip out Kara's hair. Everyone had started to look forward to food again now that Mimi's food had done a complete 180 back to edible, especially you. Food seemed to be a common ground between your girls, when the food was bad they could all unite over how bad it was, but when it was good they could all gorge themselves happilly! Probably not healthy, but pleasant meals were nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother installment that had been sorely missed was Kate's attendance at the dinner table. After a month of darkness and woe, her porcelain skin had gotten even paler than before; and she was scared out of her mind when she saw new people in the house (no one had bothered to warn her beforehand) But even after prying her from behind your back, Kate wasn't comfortable around anyone new. Not just yet. Still, it was Hot Fudge Covered Chocolate Chip Pancake day, one of Kate's favorite treats. You made this a regular breakfast item so that Kate would get out of her room once in a while, but everyone seemed to enjoy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, Mika and Mimi hadn't changed much; much to your suprise over how much that those two had proven they could pack away. Maybe they were just too fat for you to notice, but Mimi's waddling little frame seemed didn't seem any bigger than last month. And as for Mika, you just stopped trying to measure her. At <i>her</i> weight, it was hard to notice something as little as a few extra pounds. But her belly did seem a little softer than usual, as you experienced during your last accidental embrace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, so what's with the coffee machine in my office?\" Kara asks, taking a sip of some fresh espresso, \"I mean, I'm not complaining or anything, but isn't it a little weird for someone in the medical field to drink so much caffine?\" she asked, patting a steadilly growing potbelly that had been slowly inflating underneath her pair of swelling hooters. \"We know, we know, it's not healthy.\" Anya grumbled, \"You've said that a million times.\" Kara huffed, \"Well it's not!\" she said indignantly, \"I mean, seriously, how did Suzu stay so thin with the constant temptation of this stuff?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snorted, finding it ironic that Suzu in fact <i>didn't</i> stay thin. Kara was a very girly-girl, and you had come to welcome that fresh personality after the constant stifling of your manliness in this house of strange women. And you figured it out; Kara looked a lot like Suzu in her physical build. Tall, big breasted, and tan. But she was <b>not</b> Suzu. She was whiny and weak; if it weren't for her flirtatious behavior, you might have gone as far as they were complete opposites! But as she started to fill out slightly, Kara seemed like a visual substitute to an earlier Suzu which, in a way, seemed to irk at you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cram it, you scrawny crybaby, drink your coffee.\" Anya barked, resting back on her softened palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the sweetie-pie Kate seemed to agree with her red-headed counterpart as she quietly downed another breakfast cake. She too must have felt uncomfortable with Kara's resemblence to Suzu. She cowered behind you every time Kara tried to converse with her, and her usually sweet-as-sugar expression turned pouty and indignant at the mere sight of the replacement doctor. You look over to your left, Kate's usual seat, and pat her on the chubby white palm comfortingly as the other stuffed a coffee cake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be a lot of tension about these new doctors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we all just get along?\" you solemnly ask yourself...</span></div></div>",

Like Pavlov's dogs, the women, with the exception of Betsy, in the room began salivating at the sight of the chocolate drenched breakfast food. Mimi followed the nurse, taking a seat next to Mika. Veronica slowly moved around the table, setting down plates stacked high with fudgey flapjacks. When the confections had been doled out, she sat down as well, taking a place next to Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a reason why a task that should have taken only a couple of minutes took closer to ten. Well, two. First, Veronica was lazy. Not lazy in the sense that she didn't do anything, but in the sense that she set her own pace and that pace was slow. Secondly, Veronica was fat. Or at least plump. It was astounding (or maybe not) how much damage Mimi could deal to a girl's figure in just a month. You would never have thought that a girl could gain forty pounds in a single month but the wobbling, slightly off balance proof was right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisjudging the space her body required, she plopped down too close to Mim, .squeezing her chubby thigh against one of Mimi's lowermost rolls. She scooted away soon after. Mimi retaliated by swatting Veronica's bubble butt, but the girl hardly seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another quirk of Veronica's. She seemed completely oblivious to innuendo or anything sexual. Apparently, she never noticed Mimi's sexual assaults but, instead of getting discouraged, the chef redoubled her efforts, going to ever greater lengths to provoke her lazy helper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down from your musings, you noticed a horrible sight: an empty plate. And it was yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe culprit was obvious: Anya's plate had nearly double the amount of pancakes that it started with. Each was soaked through and through with sweet, gooey maple syrup and your voracious beau was tearing her way through the stack with reckless abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anya! That was mine! I wanted breakfast too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fhat, hom merh smmrf om moo gem mhat?\" She swallowed. \"What, don't you want me to get fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a spluttering sound coming from your left as Betsy sprayed the pancake she was chewing across the table into Kara's face. Apparently, she had not aware of the fact that Anya was intentionally fattening herself up, but you were too focused on getting something to eat to notice her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was a lot scause and you ended up going without breakfast, having to make due with a glass of milk as your staff chewed through a remarkably large amount of foodstuffs. At least you could take solace in the fact that Anya had eaten double the already generous portions (though she probably would have gotten most of yours anyway).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to focus on anything due to the gnawing hunger in your gut, your day speeds by, quickly arriving at lunch time.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly and without warning, you burst from your study rejuvinated; your fatigue and despair completely erased as another chance to fill your belly rears it's head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth salivating at the idea of finally getting something to eat, you quickly outlap Mimi and hustle down the stairs. Within moments, you reach the second floor; lunch was just one hallway and one flight of stairs away! All but sprinting down the hall, you hear the old floorboards creak beneath your hasty pace, all the while getting closer and closer to the stairwell. Six doors, five doors, you were halfway there. Four doors, three doors down you could smell whatever ambrosia Mimi was cooking and the intense hunger pains were driving you <i>insane</i>! Two doors, only one more to go-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face makes impact, causing you to fall to your knees clutching your nose. Hopefully, it wasn't too banged up. \"JEEZUS!!\" you howl, choking back tears as the pain spreads to the back of your neck and radiates throughout your rattled skull. \"Oh my gosh!\" a by now familiar explative around the houseas more and more accidents seemed to occur; leaving no doubt in your mind who it was who opened the door so suddenly and knocked you six ways from Sunday. Betsy Franklin, the household klutz. \"O-Oh no, I- are you okay?!\" she wailed, clammoring to your side apologetically as you continue to clutch your abused olphactory sensor in pain. \"Oh my gosh, say something, I didn't hurt you too badly did I?!\" she pries your hands away only to start pinching at your nasal bridge with her fingers, \"Lemme look at it, please?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, it's not broken\" she pants, tilting your head back for further inspection, \"It's not even bleeding... oh, you're not mad at me are you, sir?!\" she begs. Of course you were mad, not so much at her as much as in general. But you could only shake it off, the pain radiating from your nose was nothing compared to the one gnawing at your stomach inside and out. \"Yeah, yeah, dno big deal.\" you say hastilly, rising to your feet with a little assistance from your attacker. You raise your hand to gently stroke the tip of your nose, making sure for yourself. Sure enough, you were fine enough. But there was something on your hand, it wasn't any stray snot or blood that might have come flying out, it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is dis choklat?\" you asked aloud, licking the sticky brown substance on your index finger; the teasing amount of food intensifying your hunger pains. Your watery gaze travels upwards to meet Betsy's but thanks to a lack of concentration on your part (and really blurry vision) you failed to notice the scrawny nerd's cheeks grow bright red behind her big round glasses. \"Th-That's weird, how'd you m-manage to get chocolate on your nose?\" she stuttered, wiping off the substance with a lens cloth from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I dob't dknow...\" you stutter, just a little bit out of it after taking a door to the face. Rubbing your nose to clear up your ruptured sinuses, your slur finally clears up. \"Ugh... let's just go get some lunch, I'm starving...\" you mumble solemnly, turning around and checking your face for any trace of the chocolatey substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah!\" she chirps eagerly, \"Just hold on a second, I have to drop something off back in my room!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't see was your eager young nurse pulling chocolate bar wrappers from her pockets, about seven of them, and hastilly tossing them into the wastebasket. She hustled over to the room's armoir and fixed her frazzled braids in a quick attempt at primping. Betsy would then grab a hankercheif from the dispenser to wipe off her hands and hastilly jog out the door, face blushing bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you alright in there?\" you ask impatiently, unable to stop your momentum completely and quietly inching towards the staircase, lest feel any hunger longer than absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" she chirps eagerly, rushing to meet you (at this point already halfway down the stairs)</span></div></div>",

Though she was busily masticating her own reuben, it was pretty obvious she hadn't taken yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirmed, uncomfortably tight, sitting between Betsy and Anya. For some reason, you had less and less room everyday. Well, technically Anya was continuing to grow, but not fast enough to explain this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Betsy, you noticed that her face might be just a titch rounder then you remember.

Obviously this was a coincidence and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the rest of lunch morosely staring at your barren plate, tortured by the sounds of happy mastication.

She was actually starting to enjoy the gorging, in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she wasn't alone. As she approached one of the many large refrigerators in the kitchen, she saw you making a snack. Betsy stopped, careful not to alert you to her presence.

Grabbing some ham, cheese, and some lettuce and delicately stacking them on your bread, you throw some tender love and care into the mix by making sure everything is <i>just</i> right with your snack. Putting it on a small coffee plate, your hunger pains seem to increase phenominally... but soon that would all be over once you ate this delicious, mouth watering-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, c-can I talk to you about something?\" Betsy's normally loud (usually apologetic) voice seemed timid behind you, meek and quiet was definately something new from Betsy. Not to be rude intentionally, but all you really wanted to do right now is eat your sandwich before the Food Gods denied you yet another meal. Taking no chances and sparing formality, you shove a huge bite of the thick stacker in your mouth and start talking. \"Jeah, s'hoot.\" you sputter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy takes a seat next to you, fiddling with her slightly thicker fingers nervously as she sat. \"I-I, I... uh...\" she stammers, much to your confusion and slight annoyance. Here you were, trying to eat a sandwich because <i>someone</i> kept running around stealing your food in your own (well, inheirited) house, and Betsy was getting in the way of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do you like Anya because she's overweight?\" the words poured out of her mouth like a waterfall, completely and totally our of her control as they sped off of her tounge and burned rubber into your ear. \"I-I mean it's just, well I know its dumb but...\" You can only help but smile as you relax slightly (but not <b>dare</b> put down that damn sandwich)  \"No, I don't just like her because she's overweight.\" you say contentedly, \"I like her because, well, she's-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So, her weight has nothing to do with... the fact that you...\" Betsy says solemnly, eyes travelling downwards to focus on her twiddling digits, trying very hard not to say the dreaded 'L-word' to describe your relationship, \"L-Like her?\" Sadly, the nerdy girl eyes her growing paunch, hidden behind her loose attire but still very much there. \"Well, she used to be a real fat-a-phobe if you want the truth, but eating really seems to make her happy now, so I'm all for it.\" you stammer, growing red in the face as Betsy gives you the third degree, \"I mean, she's really cute with all that weight and everything but still I-HEY, WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST?!\" you break away from that conversation, not so much interested in her response as much as you are getting off the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the already crimson Betsy turns a deep purple at your question. Her increased twiddling speed goes unnoticed as does her foggy glasses. You didn't notice her sweating or how she seemed to be tugging at her oversized sweater with her interlocked hands. \"W-W-Well I-I-I, uh, I-I-I, wh-what I m-m-mean to say is...\" she stammers, barely able to form coherent sentences at this dangerous level of embarassment, \"I-I-I th-thought you just liked her for her w-weight and, um, oh gosh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver the caring, comforting young employer that you are, you place a (meaning <b>one</b> you're still locked on that sandwich.) sympathetic hand on Betsy's shivering shoulder. \"Hey, you can talk to me, you don't have to be afraid.\" you say soothingly, \"We're all friends here.\" Unfortunately, Betsy's condition only grows worse as you make physical contact with her, and she immediately loses control and starts frenching you. However, it takes you a second to realize what was going on, your mouth half-expecting the only thing in there to beeither more ham, lettuce, or cheese...</span></div></div>",

You lay on the floor spitting out fragments of ham and lettuce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU MORON HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME!?\" She shouted, crimson with rage. \"WHORING AROUND WITH OTHER WOMEN LIKE THIS! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began pouring down her face as she said very softly \"I thought you loved me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anya, you don't understand! She jumped me!

Anya clung to your arm like a barnacle on a ship, afraid that if she separated from you for even a second you'd be jumped by some estrogen crazed maniac. Her close contact slowed you considerably, her belly pressed into your side and her hips threatening to knock you over with every swing. Still, it was rather pleasurable and infinitely better to the alternative of being Anyaless so you kept your mouth shut. After several hours of searching in the usual places and being unable to locate her, you were at wits end. But there were only a finite number of places to sulk and you located Betsy in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had it not been for Anya's simple suggestion, you may very well have never found Betsy's hiding spot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a hiding spot it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you had been to the library before, that was almost a given after staying so long in your mansion. But any reading you had to do was left to the vast shelves in your study, you had never actually borrowed anything from Uncle Lucas' extensive reserve of books before! There wasn't really much to it, other than the seating arrangements scattered about the room, a fireplace and a loveseat adjacent to it there weren't many places Betsy could be hiding. The second floor, really just an extension of the first with the floor knocked out to accomidate the taller bookshelves, was visible from the first of course. So if she wasn't on the first floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's up there?\" you whisper to Anya quietly, lest you startle your meek admirer from her hiding spot. \"I guess so...\" she whispers back, moving some of her long red hair from her ear to better listen for any telltale whimpers, snorts, or any annoying \"Oh my gosh\"s, \"I don't really hear anything...\" Anya says quietly, \"Maybe she's not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a quiet crumbling sound catches your attention, something soft yet stable enough to leave crumbs had just been munched on from the upstairs portion of your library. Shortly after, the sound of rustling wrappers acts as condemning evidence, \"Hey Anya, you hear that?\" you whisper to your girlfriend, who shakes her head a resounding yes. \"Yeah, y'think it's her?\" she asks, round cheeks bouncing slightly. \"It's gotta be, she'd be the only one in the house who uses this room.\" Anya huffs quietly, \"Oh, what, so now I'm illiterate?\" she teases, \"So now all your servants; Mika, Mimi, Kate, we're all stupid little fat girls who can't read?\" she gets in closer, grabbing you around the middle and forcing you into her belly playfully, \"KNOCK IT OFF!!\" you rasp, \"THIS ISN'T GOING TO HELP!!\" Anya releases you begrudgingly, \"What, you're <i>my</i> boyfriend, I'll screw around with you whenever I want.\" she sticks her tounge out at you, \"Not my fault Foureyes up there is sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anya are you... jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EXCEEDINGLY!!\" she noogies you angrilly, \"SOME LITTLE GIRL WANTS TO MAKE KISSYFACE WITH MY MAN AND I'M SUPPOSSED TO BE FINE WITH IT??!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHHH!!\" you try to quell her mighty temper after hearing some footsteps upstairs followed by a resounding, \"You guys aren't very good at sneaking up on people...\" It was Betsy; and she heard you. And what a position for her to catch you two in, what with her feelings and all. \"Betsy come down so we can talk about this!!\" you call to her, your voice echoing throughout the spacious library. You would hope that Betsy would be forgiving enough to stomach your presence, especially with Anya behind you, but no such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just go away, please...\" she squeaked over the railing, the visible portion of her face quite red when compared to her brunette bangs. You sigh, genuinely sorry that any of this had to happen. \"Look, why don't I just come up there with you then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Betsy and Anya looked at you with matching levels of confusion, \"Yeah, I mean, we can talk this out; we're still friends right?\" The plumping nurse above you cowered, \"I-I don't know... I like you, and you... you like Anya... I-I just don't know, just leave me alone!!\" she wails, returning to whatever she was doing before you and Anya came along. You catch the sound of rustling wrappers again, followed by scurrying footsteps. Quickly catching sight of the stairwell, you madly dash over to it in an attempt to intercept her escape route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfotunately, it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy had closed her eyes in her desperation, and you reached your position <i>just</i> as her hurried pace managed to catch the fifth step from the ground and heading for the fourth. You were on the fourth headed for the fifth. As you collided, Betsy's things were strewn all about the library, papers, file folders... cookies. One such popped the head maid on the scarlett head, catching her attention. \"Cookies... comfort food?\" she asked aloud, not really expecting anyone to really answer her, and those papers... \"Is that the Huitheurcinq contract? Master Lucas lost a lot of money when that document went missing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was... oh my goodness...\" Betse struggled to regain coherence on the stairs, her plush behind balanced precariously on the angle of one stair, \"I was just trying to get something done... so, y'know... he wouldn't... fire me...\" she squeaked, now noticing that you, dazed from your impact, had fallen onto her not-so-nonexistant-anymore breasts. \"O-O-OH MY GOSH!!!\" she hollered, jumping back to let your face come into contact with the stair. \"Ow.\" you say plainly, having long grown accustomed to pain in this household...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betsy, I think we need to talk.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding against her better judgement, Betsy readilly agreed to talk this predicament out. Maybe it was a drive to put an end to this mess, but something more seemed to twinkle in those puffy red eyes. Something not quite malicious, or even so much as malcontent. Just something that reassured you that there was much more to be said than had already. You bade Anya farewell and escorted the weeping temp out the library door, leaving your girlfriend to pick up the debris that your collision with Betsy had left in its wake. Of course all that bending over was a challenge for her and those already tight-but-fresh-from-the-store pants of hers, so she helped herself to a few of those cookies Betsy had been stuffing down her kraut. But while momentarily satisfied in regards with appetites, Anya had a sneaky suspicion that Little Miss Freckleface hadn't quite gotten her fill of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's up.\" she said quietly after the door slammed shut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Courtyard was a perfect choice for dealing with personal matters of great weight. It was calm and spacious, and at night even gave off a certain romantic aura that permeaded many a date you had shared with Anya over the course of your relationship. Tonight, though, was a different story. One very similar to a night that still lingered around in the back of your mind, the one where Suzu had confessed herself to Kate and was scorned into nearly quitting her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on it all, that night and the series of events that followed inadvertantly had led you back here, to the very courtyard where Suzu's exodus began. This place held a very mysterious connotation in your mind, at one point beautiful and quiet and at another that silence was simply a hush- one that follows a gunshot or a climactic scene in a movie. That uneasy silence had built up tension in the back of your throat, the air feeling warm and heavy as you escorted your admirer around the grassy knoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice.\" she said in a hushed voice, the first words she'd said to you since your walk started. Looking down at her, you could only see the top of her haid, twin braided tails of her brown hair bouncing up and down slightly with every step. Her glasses reflected the hanging moon and it's light in their topmost corners, leaving her sad brown eyes open for your interpretation. Were they upset at you for refusing her advances? Or were they forlorn at the fact that a relationship between the two of you right now was nearly impossible? \"Yeah...\" you must be getting melancholy, usually your responses were better than 'yeah'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be getting melancholy.\" she said, not exactly her perky self tonight either, \"Usually your responses are a lot better than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but crack a smile, she obviously knew you better than you had given her credit for, \"Yeah.\" you say again, this time with a much softer shade to your upset color. Betsy stopped dead in her tracks, keeping her head ducked down low so that you couldn't see her eyes, \"Can we stop?\" she raised her voice ever so slightly to accentuate her frustration, \"We've been walking in circles all around this stupid courtyard for a half an hour now.\" Your muscles tense, then relax. She was right, you hadn't done much talking. \"Yeah, sure.\" you keep your voice low so as to not raise any feelings of anger, \"Where do you wanna go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving your proposal some thought, Betsy's head tilts back upwards- giving you a clear view of her mournful brown eyes behind her glasses, \"Over there.\" she says, pointing deep into the courtyard, \"In the middle, let's sit there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit perplexed at her odd suggestion, as there was no table nor bench to sit at in the entire courtyard; and the middle was no exception. \"Why there?\" you can't help but ask, it <i>was</i> a really weird choice after all. But you got no response other than a glare with ambiguous intent. But her flexed eyebrows and quivering lower lip led you not to protest and you go along with it. She walks up to you, newly budded bosom bouncing somewhat underneath her sweater, and grabs you by the hand firmly. She takes the lead from here, taking very precise measurements in her steps as she led you down into your own courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4...5...6...7...\" she counted off with every deliberate step she took, not looking down past her developing curves to check if her footing was off or not. What was she doing? Counting down to something like a time limit? You could only wonder and follow blindly, she wasn't counting your steps, only hers. \"12...13...14...15...\" she continued counting down as you trailed behind her obediently. Betsy had always been a bit of a perfectionist, did this have something to do with-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop here.\" her pace stops for the second time, your lag leading you to her halted point. \"Why here?\" again, you can't help but ask. You could understand that she was upset, that was a given. But why was she acting so mysterious? Behind those glasses, you could almost swear up and down that she had planned this whole walk. But no, that didn't sound like the Betsy Franklin you knew. Instead of giving you a legitimate response, her body lay itself down on the knoll and gaze up at you, beckoning you to come down and join her. You couldn't help but take up her offer, it seemed harmless enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you lay your head down on top of countless blades of grass, you understood why: the view was magnificent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep blue contours of the sky were freckled with a sea of endless stars. The pitch-black background crowned with the lusciously round moon who, like a beautiful woman in a crowd, claimed all the attention for itself. It was a human response to look up at the moon when gazing at the sky, and it seemed that the moonenite response was for it to stare back at it's admirers. You knew that. But tonight it felt as if you had claimed all of it's attention, like it had shunned the rest of it's adoring fans for you. \"We're in the exact center of the courtyard, you know.\" Betsy's voice said quietly beside you, \"That's why I waited so long to let you and Anya find me...\"</span></div></div>",

You couldn't tear your eyes away from the beautiful sky that Betsy had showed you. She hadn't looked over either, wrapped up in her own spell of the moon. \"You mean you were hiding until then?\" Betsy gave a small noise to confirm you accusation, \"I was hiding in the kitchen first, but then I heard Anya looking for me and sneaking a little bit of dinner.\" you let out a small, unperturbed \"Huh.\" and she kept going, \"Then I was in the bathroom on the third floor next to your office, but you had to pee.\" again a slight rumble of confirmation that you were listening to her soothing tone escapes your throat as she continues, \"And then I guess I just wandered the halls for a while, I told Kara what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break away from your hypnotic stare at the beautiful sky to glance over to your left, where Betsy's face looked over to yours. \"She told me what I should do; she said that I should take you somewhere special at midnight and show you how I felt.\" she lowered her eyelids considerably, seeming to stare at you with the same admiration she held for the lunar display she had brought you to. \"So... you took me here?\" you state calmly. \"This is... probably one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.\" she said sweetly, glancing back up at the moon one last time, \"At midnight, when all the lights shut off, and I'm in the exact center of the courtyard, I can see everything I want right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy hesitated, rolling over slightly to caress your chin with her slender hands as she brought herself closer and closer to you. And eventually... you collided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips were soft in a way reminiscent of silk. Slowly, gently, they pressed together in a slight pucker as she offered their warm embrace to your own. Moistness filled your breathing space as she began breathing harder, her innocent pucker giving way to an adventurous probing tongue that forced its way through her lips and into your mouth. She moved it fluidly, the meshing of saliva and muscle coming naturally as she grabbed your hand. The chubby girl used it as a push-off point to roll the rest of her over just a little bit closer to you, allowing you to feel just how soft her misguided attempts at satisfying your fetishes had made her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her gray sweater, you could feel the soft paunch that her binges had granted her, the back of your clenched hand was forced into her doughy expanse so deeply that every movement of your fingers was blocked by a soft apron of enveloping fat. Her right bosom was squished against the ground and your chest, but the left one let free to muscle about unobstructed (she had taken care to remove her bra before your walk in an earlier stop to \"get the tear stains off of her glasses\") <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips released yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel the same way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see everything that I want right here.\" she whispers, bringing herself back to the comfort of your mere presence. You understood now. She wanted you. In more of a way than a crush or a simple case of admiration taken too far. Betsy Franklin had deemed you worthy enough to... make this night very special. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, while passionate as a red-blooded male could be towards a member of the preferred sex, you were spoken for. Anya was your love, a rapidly growing part of your life. You had known Betsy for the shy side of a few months, but Anya had been cuddling up to you since you first inheirited this mansion! \"B-Betsy, I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... I screwed it up, didn't I?\" she said, choking back tears once again, \"I-I didn't mean... I just...I j-j-just...\" but her sentence was cut short as she let out a loud howl of bawling, sitting up on her knees and covering her dampening face with her hands. \"w-ww-wanted you to...\" she tried to continue, only for her sobs to choke her words back into her mouth. The only thing you could do now was sit up, wrap her up in your arms, and comfort her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it was only Mika and Anya who decided to eavesdrop, as it was Anya's boyfriend and Mika's equipment put up to ante here. But sure enough Kara had the same idea that Anya did, having given Betsy the bright idea to try and seduce you in the first place, and Mika decided to kill two birds with one stone. Unfortunately, she had blabbed to Veronica who, through a mouthful of pie (not just ones with whipped cream) in turn told Mimi. And once <i>that</i> happened, she just had to tell Kate that \"Mastwr's havin' an orgy in the courtyawd! Let's go watch Katie!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to the entire supporting cast (Anya aside, as a main character) being squeezed into Mika's guard shack which admittedly was already \"cozy\" with just Mika inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T BELIEVE... THAT... <b>THAT</b>... <b><i>SKANK</i></b>!!\" Anya hollered into the listening ear of Mika's one-way observatory microphone. Had Mika's shoddy soundproofing of her shack not worked, you may have been alerted to her, along with the rest of the staff's, location as they eavesdropped in on your private moment with Betsy. \"SHE THINKS SHE CAN JUST... JUST... GAH!!!\" she hollered, punching one of the supporting beams that held up Mika's guard post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Anya, you heard him, he's not gonna do anything.\" Kara said, though her tone did little to help Anya's misplaced anger. It was actually one of mixed regret and disappointment; almost like she wanted you to do the nasty with her friend in the courtyard with your big fat girlfriend listening in. \"Looks like I owe you ten bucks, Veronica.\" and, as such, she pulled out a crumpled $10 American from her inflating bosom and handed it to her stoic friend, who was indifferent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanned to hear teh smex!!\" Mimi whined, hitting the console with her tiny fists of upstaged fury. Mika squirmed, though her blubbery booty didn't move an inch as her skeletal system squirmed so deep into her flab, \"Hey, knock it off pipsqueak!!\" she shouted, \"You'll break it!\" Next to Mika, squished between Anya and the wall, Kate let out a muted sigh; obviously relieved that you had opted out of the nasty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SWEAR, THE NEXT TIME I SEE THAT LITTLE TRAMP, I'M GOING TO- TO... GRAHH!!\" she let loose one flabby fist, punching the heavy metal console. \"Owowowow!!\" she waved her weakened hand about, sending her upper arms quite ajiggle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYA!!\" Mika shouted, observing the machine with great care, \"You better be careful with this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a disturbance comes from your wallet, one that sounded vaguely similar to muffled shouting. Betsy was the first to notice it, reaching into your wallet (having fallen out in the struggle) and spying the tiny blue-tooth microphone that someone had \"conveniently\" placed. \"Wh-What is...\" she murmured as the tiny device started hooting and hollering with mixed voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anya?!\" you holler<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHH!! EVERYBODY SHUT UP!!\" the microphone rasped</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a long night but not in the pleasurable sense. After Anya had alerted you and Betsy to the bug in your wallet, she had dashed (well, waddled) off, a sobbing red-faced wreck and you had retired to your quarters, too mentally fatigued to do anything else but rest. Even so, you had spent the night tossing and turning, knowing that you would have to deal with Betsy (and Anya) in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, lo and behold, your prophecy came to fruition. Only minutes after having grabbed a cup of coffee from the kitchen and only seconds after having installed yourself in the dining room, your girlfriend and her potential rival burst into the room. Confrontation loomed and you had neither the wits nor energy to meet it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of chubby- no, be honest- fat women elbowed their way through the double doors, almost becoming stuck in the process. They proceeded, double chinned neck in double chinned neck, towards you, Anya glowering and Betsy looking scared but determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving arrived at your table, Anya placed her hands down and leaned forward, revealing a good deal of cleavage from her too tight bed clothes and resting her belly on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? You gonna tell her or what?\" Anya began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her what, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, that she's fired, that we're dating, that she can't have you, I'm not the boss here! JUST TELL HER SOMETHING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted your gaze to Betsy, noticing that the mere mention of being fired had nearly sent her into a panic. You let out a heavy sigh; it was way too freaking early to deal with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Betsy, I'm not going to fire you. But, Anya's right, I do have something to tell you. I love Anya. You're a wonderful person, and I'm certain there's some lucky guy out there just waiting for you, but I'm already in a relationship. I'm sorry but we can never be together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that pronouncement made, the already weak zephyr powering the freckled girl's sails died. She visibly wilted, her chubby body sagging as the words hit home. Sniffling a little, she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sniff* I-I guess you're... right. I suppose I should have, *sniff*, known better... Now if you'll ex-ex-excuse me there's some paperwork I need to finiiiiiish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last syllable came out as a heartrending bawl, your temp nurse running off to cry her eyes out. You rose to help her but Anya shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it seems cruel, but ya can't go after her. She might take it the wrong way and, besides, this sorta thing needs a woman's touch. But not Mimi's... or Mika's. And definitely not that skank. And Kate doesn't talk. I don't think Veronica would agree to it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cocked your head, looking at your red-headed maid expectantly. She noticed your expression and colored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know what you're thinkin', but I'm NOT going to console her. After what she tried to do to you, it makes me so ANGRY.\" Her anger overwhelming, your pudgy girlfriend punched the wall before yelping in pain. \"She tried to STEAL you from me! Nobody steals from me!  don't know if I can even control myself talkin' to her, regardless of how nice she may or may not be. I might knock her block off or somethin' else I'll regret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, grab Anya's hand, and give it a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we can't just leave her like that. She's in pain. Even if you don't care, we've still got two months before Suzu comes back and I don't know how the house would deal with her. Do it, please. For me? I'll get you some of those cookies you like, the one's imported from France...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... I guess... but only if they're authentic. And it's a full, no wait, TWO full baker's dozens. I'll do it, but I can't promise I'll be happy doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl! I love you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached over the table to squeeze your chunky girlfriend, spilling your coffee into your lap in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" AUUUGH! HOT!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Go on, you can do it.\" you egg your girlfriend on, trying to ease her into opening the door that Betsy had locked herself behind. You and Anya had located the elusive Betsy Franklin by assuming that she would be in Suzu's office and, following the trail of cookie crumbs and tear stains in your carpet, you were right. To cement your assumptions, weak sobbing could be heard from behind the heavy office door. Anya stood there dourly contemplating the results of a pow-wow with Betsy, from the agitated look on her face, not many of the results ended well. If any. \"What are you, scared?\" your attempts at mood-lightening humor don't go over so well, but they catch her attention. She looks over at you from the corner of her eye, \"What'd you just say?\" she asks in a gruff tone, \"Why would I be scared of that chubby, freckle-faced, four eyes when she knows damn well that I could clean her clock any day of the week?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu's PA system clicked on, a rarity nowadays that had gone sorely missed. However it wasn't the breathy voice of your doctor sobbing into the microphone, as expected it had been Betsy Franklin. \"Y-You know I can still hear you right?!\" she bawled, safely hiding from behind the announcement system. Then the mouth clicked and her cries were again muffled by the door. You were both at a loss for words at her sudden outburst. On top of everything, now she had been insulted. Fan-freakin'-tastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a stunning move of maturity and compassion, Anya slowly stepped forward and knocked on the door. \"Hey, it's Anya.\" she said calmly, \"Can I come in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by this new development, in that Anya had actually taken a step forward and reached out to Betsy who -as of maybe five minutes ago- was about to \"have her face pounded inside out\". The woman you had come to know as brash, arrogant, somewhat uncaring and egotistical in some cases, had actually shown some insight into her rival's feelings. You had honestly expected a vastly different set of outcomes, mostly involving you struggling to keep the two heavyweights from ripping each other's eyes out. In fact, a lot of options came to the table, but nothing quite like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more shocking still, the door cracked open just a hare. You could see Betsy's red puffy eyes from behind her glared coke bottle glasses. Her chubby fingers held the door open as she warily looked up to see Anya's cherubic, though most likely scowling, countenance. \"Wh-What do you want?\" she squeaked, obviously the human language was a bit of a stretch for her right now. \"I wanna talk about this.\" Your redheaded belle said flatly, \"This little problem isn't just going to fly out the window is it?\"  You could only stand in the hall and watch as the scene unfolded before you. Betsy's eyes quivered visibly before turning to you for comfort. \"Is... uh...\" she pointed at you weakly, only for Anya to cut her off with that sharp tongue of hers. \"Nope, this is just gonna be you and me.\" she barked at the quivering girl, \"Dumbass is gonna stay out here while we sit down and have a little girl talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy's big brown eyes turn back to you in seeming desperation. The look on her face screamed \"Please don't leave me alone with her.\" But she was right, you couldn't do much but make matters worse- this was Anya's job now. \"Don't be too tough on her, alright?\" you touch Anya gingerly on the shoulder, only for your affections to be coldly shrugged off with a movement of said shoulder. \"Don't get all melodramatic on me now, Dork.\" she said confidently, \"I'm only going in there to finish up what <i>you</i> weren't enough of a man to do yesterday. Don't think you're earning points with me for being the 'adult'.\" She turned and stuck her tongue out at you playfully, \"You go and do whatever, don't eat lunch though.\" she smiled, \"I wanna make up for this lost time, as long as I'm in here- that's how long I get to do whatever I want this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that any different than normal?\" you quip slyly before a quick kiss...<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"Huh, you've certainly added your own... personal touch.\" Anya remarked with little pleasure as she heaved her heavyset bod into Suzu's somewhat cramped office space; seeming even more cramped now that all this crap was in here. Or maybe because she was a lot bigger since she'd last entered? Either way, the intrusion of three different nurses had certainly impacted the once blas\u00e9 decorum that was instituted when Suzu held the position. The brown paneling, still brown of course, was mostly buried under a mountain of paperwork that had yet to be filed. Judging by some of the dates on the lower piles, neither of the three temps could figure out Suzu's impossible filing system either. The desk was littered with knick-nacks, which save for her photo with Uncle Lucas and Kate Suzu abhorred, each of distinct style that clashed horribly with the other. Veronica's on the left, close to the wall and rather cutesy-gothic, Betsy in the middle, mostly tasteful, and Kara's on the end, mostly just her well worn coffee mug and a few discarded makeups. There was even a poster for crying out loud! One of a cat! Suzu's probably rolling in...well, whatever relaxed position she was in right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe startling change of scenery wasn't enough to really get Anya off track though, she was a woman with a mission; that being to put an end to this confounded love triangle. Betsy shut the door behind Anya's blubbery butt as she ushered her eternal rival into the office. \"Yeah, Veronica and Kara are really big on decoration...\" she said weakly, obviously making a pained attempt at avoiding this extremely tentative subject, \"If only they actually matched things wouldn't look so... well, you know how they look.\" she chuckled weakly. Anya immediately sat down on a soft bench next to the doorway, her enormous rear forcing all air from the plush cushion. \"Siddown, I didn't come in here to bitch you out for your lack of design skills.\" On command, Betsy retreated to her seat behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know...\" she squeaked</span></div></div>",

He loves me.\" she folded her chubby hands together and held them over her mouth, leaning forward as much as her billowing stomach would allow. \"And I really don't appreciate you coming onto my boyfriend.\" she continued, \"If you were anyone else, I'd knock the stuffing out of you.\" Betsy's eyes widened slightly at that, she lowered her head somewhat- seemingly contemplating how much stuffing there was to be knocked out. \"In fact, I almost did, but he asked me not to.\" Anya said, still locked on target, \"You're very lucky he asked me not to, or I'd probably al-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShockingly, Betsy mustered up the courage to do more than just meekly confirm Anya's statements; enough to actually cut the battleaxe maid off mid-sentence! \"A-Actually, you're the lucky one...\" she said sweetly, \"I-I mean, you've got someone to hold you and care for you, while I've got... well, I've got nothing like that.\" she turned away, the tears coming back to her. \"He's a great listener, and he's really sweet.\" she lamented, \"I guess I just... wanted that for myself... I've never had a guy treat me like that before... I'm not very attractive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that utterance of self-loathing, Anya completely understood everything. This girl had low self-esteem and took your simple gestures of kindness as inklings of romantic intent. The cold demeanor melted as Anya slowly started warming up to this plight. \"Why do you say that, Betsy?\" she inquired, \"I don't think your ugly, my Idiot Boyfriend doesn't, I don't think I've ever heard anyone say anything like that at all... except for maybe me... and-\" She cut herself off when she realized just where the problem stemmed from. \"Kara.\" Betsy said quietly, \"I-I know she's just teasing but... we've known each other since grade school...she's always been so popular... and she's always been saying things like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to break it to you, Betsy, but your friend is a totally wanked out bitch.\" Anya said forwardly, \"She's got no idea what really matters, and you shouldn't listen to her when... well you probably just shouldn't listen to anything she says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how come no other guy except Him has ever been so nice to me, ever?!\" Betsy barked back suddenly full of energy, \"How come... how come I got stood up and my prom?!\" she continued, now struggling to heave her heavier body from the chair, \"I just thought... that if I gained a little weight, he would find me more attractive and- and... it didn't wooooork!\" the last words came out as an elongated bawl as she fell to her knees. \"And now that I'm <i>fat</i>, I'm even uglier than ever!\" Anya couldn't help but fall down to the floor with her, plopping her heavy body down beside her with a loud thump. \"Listen Bets.\" she said, remarkably sounding very much like an older sibling at this point, \"Being fat doesn't make you unattractive, some people like it and some don't.\" she stated simply, \"The inside is what matters, if eating makes you happy then you should keep doing it- no matter what anybody says.\" Betsy's waterworks increased heavily as she drew Anya into a hug. She struggled to wrap her arms around the thick maid but managed to get by, Anya patting her on the back the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Anya!\" she bawled, \"I'm so so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh... there there...\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\nThe door is a little cold. You can't help but notice that as your ear gradually grows sore from groping its hard wood. Judging by the heavy sobbing coming from behind that heavy oak door of yours, Betsy was really letting loose. Those weren't Anya's cries, they were too high pitched and there wasn't anything broken beforehand. And since you couldn't make out much more than muffles, your imagination was left to itself. What if Anya had told her to leave?! That certainly wouldn't be good! The house would fall apart, everyone would get all sad again, everything would probably be repo'ed before Suzu even got back from her vacation! That would be so terrible! \"ARGH!!\" you grunt as you switch ears, \"I can't hear anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you are pushed back with a driving force that could only be one thing: Anya and her comically over-exaggerated ability to toss you around like a rag doll. You feel yourself inch closer into the wall before making impact, a very painful impact. \"Oh?\" you hear before the door releases you, \"I thought I felt something dumb and useless blocking the way.\" You look up to see your girlfriend and Betsy, the latter looking at you with mild concern and the former only a smug grin. \"Get up off the floor ya little eavesdropper, you're treating two of the most lovely woman ever to lunch.\" she stopped and corrected herself, \"Well, two of the most lovely women a guy like <i>you</i> is ever gonna meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?\" Anya turned to Betsy. She smiled and seemed to catch the message, \"Yeah... lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did things go well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I tell you?!\" Anya hollers, \"Didn't you just hear the whole thing? You're not getting diddly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you holler as she waddles out of your grasp towards the stairs, \"I didn't hear anything! PLEASE TELL MEEEE!!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been two months since the incident in which Betsy had confessed to you. The nice, balmy summer winds had chilled as the leaves had changed color and fallen to the ground. It also marked a change in relationships as far as your maids were concerned. Notable among the two were, of course, Betsy and Anya, the latter still being your porky girlfriend. After the two had talked (which you had eavesdropped on), it seemed the two had fallen into a sort of competitive rivalry. It wasn't at all poisonous. In fact, their rivalry pushed both of them to do the best as they possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are currently sitting in the dining room, looking over some important financial documents. This had been happening more and more often as of late. As you rub your strained eyes and stretch your arms, you hear someone approaching from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, master.\u201d It's Betsy, placing a cup of hot coffee on the table in front of you. \u201cWhy don't you take a small break? You've been working almost non-stop for the past two weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to look at her. According to the rumors that had been flying around the other maids, Betsy seemed to think that if she was fatter than Anya, she stood a very good chance of snatching you away from her. Over the last two months, Betsy had pretty much ballooned. The bespectacled maid was constantly outgrowing her uniforms, and what she was currently wearing was the last one she owned that could fit. Even then, it won't be much longer before she needs to order new ones, judging from the popping seams centered around her impressive bust. It's easily the largest part of her, though her derriere (and the accompanying squishy thighs) is nothing to sneeze at either. Her arms aren't quite as thick as her legs, but the cuffs on her uniform's sleeves are straining somewhat. Her belly is stuck in last place, but it's still rapidly closing in on her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't,\u201d you tell Betsy in a tired voice. \u201cThis contract with the Lorenzo Group needs to go through, otherwise I'll have to start laying off staff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but --\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it's not like he's doing this all alone,\u201d another voice cut in, accompanied by heavy footfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your eyes off the contract once again as you see your large girlfriend carrying more papers in her hands. Then again, perhaps \u201clarge\u201d is too small a word to describe Anya now. Whether she had seen Betsy rapidly gaining weight and decided to keep up the competitive streak, or she had heard the rumors about Betsy's continuing feelings towards you and thus felt compelled to protect her claim, or if she was still continuing her exercising habits (or lack thereof)... no matter which way you look at it, if Betsy had ballooned, Anya's weight gain had been explosive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPorky\u201d is no longer an appropriate description of your fat girlfriend. In fact, it seems as though she's started stepping into the neighborhood of obesity. Her outfits had grown in multiple sizes to keep up with her girth, but she still couldn't cover all of her fat. Preferring comfort over cover, Anya had decided to shunt her massive gut over her uniform's skirt, and said gut had finally, a couple of days ago, completely managed to cover her crotch, the cavernous belly-button peeking out from under her apron. The last was because of her overstuffed breasts, which, on a thin woman, would be a man's wet dream. Her gigantic thunder thighs rubbed together even more now, and her arms were just as thick. Even so, there's still no sign of cellulose to be found on that beautiful skin of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy doesn't stand a chance. The fact that Anya had a head start on her wasn't helping matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with all of that adipose, there came a price. Anya was certainly not in any shape to be doing a lot of the more physical-intensive chores, and if she pushed herself into morbid obesity (or, impressive as it would be, beyond), even the simple chores would be beyond her. Thankfully, ever since that incident in the garden, she's become your unofficial \u201cofficial\u201d secretary, bringing you the papers you need to keep and expand your considerable assets, both in love and in wealth.</span></div></div>",

A rather...beefier...plumper type of woman. You've been attracted to heavy women since you were little, but you could never tell anyone that.

The building has to be at least four stories high and God only knows how wide or long. Gape faced, you slowly stumble forward toward the large oak doors, the bubbly chef pulling you by the hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This....this is mine?\" you stutter, still in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Master, or should I say your Uncle, left the whole thing to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you enter the front of the mansion, passing into a large foyer area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't even know him that well. I visited him a few times when I was a kid, but after he had a falling out with my father I never got to see him. I didn't even know he was still alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He certainly knew you were.\" says a new voice, chiming in from a nearby alcove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spin around in surprise, spying an incredibly well built woman. She's tall, muscular....and sporting an excellent tan? How she's doing this in the middle of winter is a mystery, but even with your preference for bulkier women, this chick's a knock-out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello *your name here*. My name is Suzu. Welcome to your new home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo all those times, it wasn\u2019t dumb luck? It was really him? He was watching out for me this whole time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes indeed.\u201d Suzu said, in between gulps of coffee. She had a massive thermos that she carried around, containing some of the darkest, blackest coffee you\u2019d ever tasted. It was delicious. This girl knew how to make a cup of joe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy college dorm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy free pass into culinary school??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat time in Brazil???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took another large gulp of coffee. This was just too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Uncle kept you safe, in preparation to be his successor, which brings us back to here. Now that he\u2019s gone, the responsibility of running the household falls to you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a loud gulp, and she laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t worry. I handled most of it before your Uncle died, and I\u2019ll handle most of it now. The business is mostly autonomous, so the most I\u2019ll need you to do over the next couple of days is to sign a paper here or there. Now why don\u2019t you go meet the rest of the staff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in acknowledgement, and with a little more gumption than the situation deserves, you walk out into the hallways.

Your Uncle sure has an odd taste in art, but it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t appreciate it. Still, that\u2019s beside the point. You\u2019ve definitely walked through this hallway before. Maybe walking out of the study without any idea where you were going was a bad idea\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you manage to catch the smell of baked goods. Cinnamon rolls if your nose is correct. That\u2019s got to be the kitchen! If you can follow the smell there, then maybe you can get out of this maze of passages! Left\u2026right\u2026another right\u2026.and\u2026..There! Your eyes spot a steaming pot full of soup through a doorway.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nYour eyes go wide as you enter the kitchen. It\u2019s even larger than you imagined, surpassing even the size and scope of the one you working during your stint at the world famous Culinary Academy of New Haven. There are rows upon rows of gleaming cookware and spices! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a large, soft mass plowed like a freight train into your legs, knocking you off balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster!\u201d cried the little butterball of a chef as she crashed into you. \u201cI just knew you\u2019d come see Mimi!\u201d She pressed herself against you, her head resting on your stomach, her breasts and the upper shelf of her belly rubbing against your crotch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl is almost too much.<br>\r\nShe smiles, her cherubic face looking up at you. \u201cNow did you come to try out the cooking, or to try out the cook?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMMMmmmmmm! That\u2019s actually really good!\u201d Mimi said, rubbing her tummy as she slurped down a spoonful of soup you\u2019d whipped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle did send me to one of the best culinary schools. I may not have been the best in my class, but I did pick up a thing or two.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a chef yourself, the kitchen was your comfort zone. Being back inside meant that for at least a moment, all the pressures of inheriting a mansion and its staff could melt away. In a jiff you\u2019d gathered together a few ramshackle ingredients (not that good ones weren\u2019t to be found) and created an odd yet delicious soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI call it \u2018I can\u2019t afford groceries\u2019,\u201d you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi giggles. \u201cSay, you wanna try something super yummy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not?\u201d you say. You are fairly hungry after all. A few moments later and Mimi\u2019s prepared a soup of her own. It\u2019s loaded down with dozens of things you\u2019d never think to put together, much like your own. Taking a ladle, you try a sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant it hits your tongue the world fades to black and white. Sounds lose their luster, and a heavenly choir of angles seems to sing. This\u2026.this is the most delicious thing you have ever tasted! A tear comes to your eye as the sheer quality of flavor overcomes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Okay, maybe that\u2019s a little too much exaggeration, but the taste is ridiculously good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi sees your expression and the miniature chef giggles. \u201cI hope master likes me as much as my food.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off your shock, you turn to her wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing! How\u2019d you learn to cook like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwe Master! You\u2019re making Mimi blush!\u201d she giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious! Your fantastic!\u201d you stammer, amazed that this little woman has such talent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMimi good at other things than cooking too, master\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl keeps pushing your buttons, and it\u2019s working. Despite your best efforts, your friend downstairs just won\u2019t stay asleep. Partly because in an attempt to hide your erection, but mostly because you respected her skill so much, you knelt down in front of Mimi, your head coming up to the middle of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeach me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis apparently caught the little chef off guard, as her permanently happy expression melts into one of surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeach me! Please! Your skills are unbelievable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her stride, Mimi\u2019s cheerful face returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwwwkaaaay! But only because Master is so cute!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat have you gotten yourself into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bell rings. It's time for dinner.</span></div></div>",

Her face was found and cherubic, with a pronounced double chin, and chipmunk cheeks, all framed by long brown hair that reached down to her immense ass. Clutches in her sausage like fingers was a variety of sweets and ingredients.

This jiggling and jostling was, apparently the straw that broke the camels back, as ther uniform just seemed to burst off of her body, leaving her only in her strained black undergarments.

Mika prepares to round a corner, but has to slow down so she doesn\u2019t crash into a wall.

The sheer amount of woman you\u2019re embracing is giving you quite the hard on, your sweaty bodies digging into each other, as the two of you pant harder than a dehydrated dog during a sunny July day.

All the while you were thinking. You didn't like your life; you had a crappy job flipping burgers in hopes of returning to college one day. You lived in a dump what you didn't have time to clean up. Besides, your odd thing for fat women made you lonely; you felt misunderstood all the time. But there were no hopes for any of this to change any time soon, leaving you in a pit of despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lost in thoughts when you heard a knock on the door. You open, only to find a tall muscular and tanned Japanese women looking at you. She had deep green eyes and a cute little mouth. But her face was not what attracted your eyes. She had a huge breast, each bigger than baseball. However, you quickly got a hold of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. My name Dr Suzuki, but you can call me Suzu. I am working for your late Uncle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are working for Uncle Jerry? He owns a bait shop, how can he employ a doctor. Wait did you say late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not too sharp up top, eh? I am not working for that Uncle Jerry; your other Uncle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Are you talking about my mother's brother? I thought he died 30 years ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he died last week. I guess because there was bad blood between them, she must have said that to... anyway. Your late uncle has followed everything you have done since you got into high school. He was dismayed when he found out you were conned out of the money for your studies last year, but your mother didn't want him to help you. As a matter of fact, she didn't wanted him into your life, something he respected\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know. But that is not the point. I have with me all the legal papers. As things are, you are the sole heir of his entire estate; that includes a mansion, the servants, including me, and a huge pile of money, plus all his belongings\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaaat? You mean I am...\" That was a lot of information to digest for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made arrangements already for you to come with me and back to the mansion immediately. Unless you want to keep your life in this... place\". That was a lot of information to swallow; a woman you never met before arrived to offer a new life, talking about a family secret and creating a new mystery. You saw a giant bug circling around Suzu's hair and a couple of cockroaches emerging from your trash... let's just say they facilitated the decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you left  immediately; someone would get your stuff later on.

You were surprised to see such a big mansion and a small comitee waiting for your arrival. Suzu rushed to the other girls to introduce the other girls to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Mika, your guard, Kate a maid here, Mimi, your head chef and this is... damm I forgot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUZU! don't mess with me. I am Anya, the head maid here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's quite the fiery one, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I guess so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT? you two are idiots\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not helping your case\". Not the smartest thing you ever said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are bigger idiot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu spent the day explaining to you how the household was working. Apparently, this was not in her job application; she explained that she was a child prodigee taken in at age 4 by your uncle; at 17 she was done with her medical studies. She was the house doctor; she also served as your uncle's assistant, and before his death, she runned the business herself. Not that it was much of a challenge. After the visit, you went to your new office to sign some papers, have some coffee. You asked to be alone for a while, which was an excuse to play on the brand new computer for a couple hours. After that, you decided to celebrate your first day by having all your employees on a good dinner. You talked to the chef, Mimi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who you are, Master. So what are you doing in those steamy kitchens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? steamy? what are you talking about... anyway, I wanted to celebrate my new life with my employees in that big dinner hall. Can you cook something up? Please make sure that there is good food. And more than enough for everyone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me how to do my job! ... Hum... Am I invited?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! you are one of my employees\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... this is a first for me... you sure it's allright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Just make sure that you can have some time to sit and chat with us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right. By the way, you do realize that a date is a man and a woman together. Not five women. Although, I like where this is going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pretend that this is something else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane? I am not that kind of guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gay or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to prove it to me? Right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I just might...\" you say leaning forward, hoping she is bluffing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better be good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine, I am bluffing. But I am not gay. And I'll see you at dinner\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to run away before your chef tries to jump on you to get what she wants. You decide to go and admire your uncle's art collection; luckily you both have similar taste in art. After a while, you notice your odd pale maid sporting a small bellies and small love handles, and that works for you dusting some of the paintings; with her generous form, hugged tight by her outfit she is indeed to your taste in women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Kate, right?\" That made the maid almost jump to the ceiling; and accidently threw dust at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" She looked absolutely terrified; she was however trying to clean up the dust on you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's alright; don't worry about it. So I guess you can't talk... oh well, you must be a good listener then\" That made her smile, for the first time since you got here<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I am having every one here have dinner tonight. Would you like to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" She just nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master! Kate! Is everything alright?\" you turned only to see that Japanese Amazon working for you coming almost running<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzu! Yes, I was just inviting Kate to the dinner with everyone on the island that I'll have tonight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate, won't you look at that. OUr master thinks he's being generous\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Well Kate, you seem to like the... Kate?\" Kate was gone \"Where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame her. She is extremely shy, especially around strangers. That you got to talk to her is a miracle; and that she smiled is just... Anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she was a kid, she... it doesn't matter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess I'll see you at dinner, then. Oh could you tell the other Anya and Mika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I, your domestic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt good talking to another human being, with being affraid that she might reveal it to humiliate you.

Judging from the ladder, you thought that she must have tried to clean the window from the outside. Unless it was an insolation. But you had no time for such concerns. Your best friend, and the only doctor in the house was laying there. You quickly got her inside and had Mika call an ambulance. Everyone was there to see her off, and everyone was shaken. Particurlaly Kate, who was crying. Dinner that night was silent, everyone absorbed in their own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu was driven back the next day; a doctor and a nurse were accompanying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My diagonosis is not insolation, or head trauma.

That would have killed a normal human being in three days, and it had been several weeks. You could not remember seeing her reading or watching TV at any point in time; the only relaxation she had was dinner and exercising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I give her vacation or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! She cannot travel in her current condition. She should rest for two weeks, perhaps three. But under no circumstances should she do anything that is physically challenging. And I would avoid doing any ressearch as well; working more might shut her brain off. And before I forget, I'll prescribe sleeping pills and other drugs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the master now. Suzu had shared enough of her knowledge and experience for you to run the business by yourself.

Suzu, instead of having normal conversation, would be absorbed by what was on the screen, or what was in her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two weeks, you met Suzu and looked at her full body; she had lost all her muscles; and as it happens often in that case, it turned into body fat. Her arms were flabby; her busts, already big when you met her was now huge. She had no more abs, but a belly instead; supported by small love handles. But most of the gain was in her thighs and butt which were now like small trees!

Besides, what kind of guy would like a girl like Kate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I like her being quiet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant, she's fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, some guys like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, Anya brought the dessert, which was just a few ice-cream scoop, and warm slices of a chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You mean someone could like all of this?\" She pointed to her own curves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, the ice-cream in her spoon fell in her girth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! Are you doing this again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I just might... it's just too warm in here, and it's a nice way to cool off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm that's appetizing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you are you going to have another slice of chocolate cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... are you going take that ice cream out of there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... why don't you come and get it out yourself?\" she said, with a devilish look in her eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the clues you needed. You rushed forward, literally going over the table. Your lips met, and the two of you rolled on floor. The two of you kept going for several hours; luckily the walls were soundproof, so no one would find out about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two of you were done, Suzu could not help but giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" You said</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, you went to the pool to have a swim. When you got out, you found Suzu with Anya and Mika watching TV; they were munching on some cookies. Worried that your chef had broken her word, you went to the kitchen, where you saw Mimi and Kate having slices from the chocolate cake you had earlier. Apparently, everyone was taking some time today, and snacking was as good an activity as another; it's true that it was the summer time, and that it was just too warm to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kate went to the living room.

So no, there is nothing else you can do for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, a couple of weeks went by. Because of the stalemate between you and Mimi, the output of food coming out of the kitchen was astonishing. But because the last time someone had thrown away food, Mimi had cried and did not speak to the culprit for three weeks straight, no one was willing to try and hope it would go unnoticed. You kept away from the food as much as possible; but this wasn't the case of your staff. To keep up with the amount of food, at least one of the girls was eating the food and watching TV at all time during the day. And that included Mimi herself sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, this was starting to have an effect on your staff. Suzu, as she had given a month of vacation to her staff in the city, and had essentially stopped running the business, was the most affected, as she spent her days watching TV and eating. You estimated that she had put another 15 or 20 pounds in the last 3 weeks; her belly now rested on her lap when she sat. Furthermore, her butt was so big, she could no longer sit on stool; she was more chubby than ever. Anya had also gained; most of it went to her hips and thighs. You guessed it was about 10-15 pounds or so. The other maid, Kate was relatively spared; she had a muffin top and slightly bigger breasts. But the two maids were struggling in their outfit, though it revealed their curves. Your chef on the other hand, was gaining a lot. When you asked her, she told you that she was testtasting most of the food she made; and she was falling for her own cooking as well, losing restraint over time. And it showed: she could no longer be consider chubby. with her huge gut, hips and ass; all of it supported by huge thighs. She was 150 when you got here, but you estimated that she was 170, perhaps approaching 180. And finally, there was Mika. Mika was fat when she got here, weighing almost 200 pounds; surprisingly, she was not so affected, having put on only 10 pounds or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only that changed since the beginning of the summer, when you got your new life, was that every couple of days, you were seeing Suzu. One time, after your 'joint exercise session', the two of you were laying, naked in your bed when Suzu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why Mimi has gone food factory on us again? I thought you told her to stop\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. But she asked for me to do something for her later, and I decided not to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get busy with Kate. She thought it might help her with her social issue\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God no! I mean, a fix like this will make Kate feel cheap. You mustn't do that to her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're not just being jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Seriously, I wouldn't do that to her. Not with Mimi as intermediary that is. If she wants it really, do it when she comes of her own accord; but remember our agreement\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. So I guess you'll speak to Mimi then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you do it yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do, it's going to sound like I am trying to talk my way out of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrehaps talking to Mimi wasn't such a bad idea....</span></div></div>",

I am fat as a whale now\" She said, visibly ashamed at herself and the cookies she was holding. \"But you still give me your best when we're together. So, it doesn't take three diplomas and 15 prizes in a variety of fields to get that you like fat girls. Or making them fat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... But Suzu, could you keep this a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. But honestly... do you really think I am attractive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the most georgeous woman I've ever met. With or without the extra weight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Suzu blushed. she needed to hear that in her condition. You then went to the kitchen to see Mimi. There, she boasted that while she was making her last bast of cookies, Suzu came in, to try and talk her out of it. But as soon as she had a taste of the dough, she was \"as quiet and obedient as a little girl\". This made Mimi laugh, and she laughed even harder when said that she was becoming evil. But all in all, it was just fun and games; she was also trying to please you by making sure there was more than enough food to go around. You were worried though, about Suzu and Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, you didn't mention why Mimi was making so much food, because she'd feel oblige to do what Suzu had told you not to do. But as you talked to Kate how Mimi was, in your opinion, something surprising happened. The two of you were sitting on her bed; she was in her maid outfit already. She signaled you to be quiet; then she put her hand on yours and turned off the light. You were not sure what to make of it; but after a moment of hesitation, you leaned in. Your lips touched hers; you put your arms around her; your hands were digging in her soft sides. She responded with a soft embrace of her own, pulling her body onto yours. You dug in her uniform, taking it off as she was taking off your clothes. And then... well that's pretty obvious, so I'll skip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two of you were done, you asked Kate how she felt. She could do nothing but smile and look at you, so you took it she was fine. You asked her if she had feelings for you; to which she nodded no. She took a small piece of paper, and wrote two words: 'thanks' and 'friends?'; to which you answered yes. As you got dressed again, you decided to go to the kitchen and tell Mimi about it. That way, she would cease the hostilities for the time being. Although she was reluctant, she had given her word and could not deny it when she saw Kate with a big grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you informed Suzu of what happened. She was confused about it; she was glad that there would be less food, but you could tell she was feeling a little jealous. Even though, you brought this into the open, she still didn't want to be with you; she was hesitating because you would be both her boyfried and her master<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She called an ambulance, had Mika carry you inside and started to treat the head wound. She left with you in the ambulance; you were in critical condition. Indeed, the head trauma was serious, and the doctors at the hospital were not sure whether or not you would be waking up.

You knew how bad it must have been for her, and you could not beat the idea of her worrying sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, just as you were about to get out of your wheelchair to go to bed, Suzu entered the room. She was still having her dumb smile on her face. She entered, with a bag full of small muffins; she was wearing short shorts and a bra; her long hair was dancing around her breasts giving her a very enticing look. She sat on your lap, leaned forward and started to eat the muffins as fast as possible, just before your eyes. She would play with the falling crumbs and invite you to take them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I am happy... happy\" she said, giving you a little pout with her mouth. God you were happy to be alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I am too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And because I love you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was amazing was that she had seemingly lost all restraint; she didn't seem to expect an answer, she was just sitting there, smiling and looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Suzu\" You had to say that, even though Suzu was in such a condition. It was just too much<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that!\" She then finally leaned to kiss you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you take out those crumbs from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you rose to get to bed, you collapsed. Your head wound was still affecting you, as the doctor had predicted. Suzu just giggled and left you there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was also working in the same area as her, and discovered he was competing for the same grants as Suzu; as well as ressearching the same topic. Only he would be published after Suzu, which would take away credit from him. So when he saw her in the hospital, exhausted, depressed and worried, he decided to take advantage of her and give her those addicting mind-numbing pills, in hope to slow her down enough for his ress<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you and Suzu were not suspecting any of this.

But shouldn't I start reducing the dosage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. I want to be cautious with that. We'll start next week\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay\" You had a bad feeling about this doctor, but had no choice. Besides, Suzu on those meds was also a bit slutty; which you didn't mind. Besides, you knew what stopping cold turkey could do, and just could not resolve yourself to do that to her. So, you went to the living room and sat on your chair to watch TV with Suzu for a while. But as soon as you sat down, Suzu once again sat on your lap, and munched on some cookies. Once again, after she had eaten everything, she leaned towards you to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed like every meal she was putting away a huge serving while you just watched, somewhat turned on. Suzu didn't seem to care about the amount of weight she was putting on. One day after another large stuffing, Suzu looked massive, way over 200 pounds, her thighs were still getting larger, and her arms were starting to become mushy as well. As she was walking away from you, she slipped and fell on her butt, which caused her sweatpants to split down the center, showing off her further enlarged butt, which showed now signs of the former toned beauty, and was covered if fat with some cellulite coming in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whoops,'' was all she said, and then giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to the apatite, she also was getting way more sexual with you as her body grew. Whenever she could get near you, she would sit on your lap, and place your hand in between her large thighs, and bellow her growing belly, and although this was hot, the proximity to the other girls in which she did this alarmed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of this happening, you spoke to Suzu, doubting she would have an opinion on this. She was watching TV,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Suzu, I think I need to slowly take you off these meds.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay.'' She didn't seem to care one way or another, as if this discussion that greatly affected her was only second to the tv shows she was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that she wasn't functioning on her previous high level, so you decide to slowly take her off it anyway, against the doctor's orders, and it works, within two weeks Suzu walks into your office, visibly upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We need to take me off these pills.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, that's what I've been doing.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, cut it off completely, they are just meant to slow me down.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What do you mean,'' you wonder if Suzu is going nuts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They were just prescribed because Dr. Jacobson and I have always been rivals in our field, in fact we're both racing to publish our next projects first.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh my gosh.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make sure Suzu is right, the next day you drive the pills to a lawyer who then hired chemist in town to break down the pills for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day after that you met with your lawyer again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dr. Suzuki is right, these pills are not commonly prescribed for the purposes of anti-depression or to help calm anxiety. I would say that unless Dr. Jacobson can find a medical reason why he prescribed them to Dr. Suzuki, we will be suing him in court, and he may even lose his medical license.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drove back to the mansion, you realized you, or Suzu, were going to have even more money coming in.

Her thighs were threatening to bust out of their confines; you could almost see the shape of them through the dress. \"I think I need some help,\" Suzu said as she struggled to button the shirt over her burgeoning belly. No matter how hard she sucked her fat gut in, she simply could not get the button closed. Suzu blew her breath out as she plopped on the bed in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Suzu cursed. \"This is ridiculous! If only I had kept myself fit instead of turning myself into a fat cow, this wouldn't even be a problem!\" Suzu grabbed the sides of her big belly. \"God, look how fat I am! I'm an overfed cow!\" Suzu burried her face into her hands; she was on the verge of breaking down. I couldn't stand to her like this. I came over to her and swung my leg around her so that I was now sitting on the bed with Suzu in between my legs. I wrapped my arms around her fattened waist, digging into the soft, warm flesh. I brought my lips to her ear and began to talk in a warm whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Suzu...you're not a fat cow. You're a woman - a woman who deserves more than what she's giving herself. You're beautiful in every way.\" As Suzu took her hands away from her face, I got to work. I began to button up her suit, slowly and patiently. I finished the last button. \"See?\" I whispered. \"All you needed was a little bit of help. That's it.\" I could see Suzu blushing. \"Umm...I...I\u201c Suddenly, Suzu turned around. Suzu looked looked at me with an intense fire. \"Thanks. I really needed that. Thanks for making me feel special when I'm feeling down\" Suzu had on a V-neck, so a small opening of her caramel-colored cleavage was visible. Being this close...I was starting to get hard. Suzu wrapped her chubby arms around my neck and kissed me. Soon, she was on top of me as we got down on the bed. Even through her suit, I could feel Suzu's soft body and the body heat with it. Her hefty breasts were pressed up against me, and her straight jet-black hair had fallen in vanilla-scented whisps around my head. My boner was pressing up against her more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I placed my hands on the side of Suzu's hefty thighs, feeling their softness and girth as I slid my hands up them. I moved my hands to her butt, and gave it a squeeze. It was like digging in to cotton candy. Suzu pulled away for air, her eyes wide with excitement. \"We should probably get going. Before we're late for the trial.\" Suzu clearly didn't want this to end, and neither did I. But, unfortunately, it had to - for now, at least. \"Yeah, you're right.\" I admitted reluctantly. Suzu got up off of me, and I stood up. I cleared my throat. \"When we get back though....\" \"Say no more.\" Suzu said with a grin. I gave Suzu a light smack in the rear, making it jiggle for a moment. Suzu looked at me with a smile. I grinned. \"Sorry, my hand slipped.\" \"Yeah,\" she said. \"We all know that's a lie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu and I left the room laughing.</span></div></div>",

Your meager paycheck just getting you by every month (which paid for your poorly developed, yet weirdly pricy apartment). Of course, with you failing to get into your college of choice, you didn\u2019t really have much choice but to spend your time working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, you were just heading to your mailbox, hoping to find your usual junk mail, magazine subscription and perhaps the off chance of the rare jury duty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it was quite the surprise for you to see a girl dressed in a maid outfit standing in front of your mailbox, almost struggling to try to figure something out. It was odd since it\u2019s not everyday you see a maid in broad daylight, even one who was quite chubby and had pale skin (a cute, chubby face though) with white hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her chubby hands was a large manila envelope that she held tightly against her pillowy body \u2013 and her pale face was tinted red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that you\u2019re not a jerk, you slowly approach the girl hoping that you could help her\u2026 Heck, she was a little curvier than the average girl, but that wasn\u2019t a bad thing in your eyes, and she was cute. \u201cExcuse me, do you need some help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe albino maid jumped slightly, dropping the envelope when you called out to her. When she realized how close you were, she slowly began to inch away. Okay, she\u2019s obviously scared, so you slowly reach down for the envelope and hold it up to her. \u201cHere, you dropped\u2026 This?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little surprised when the maid ran off, leaving you standing in front of the mailboxes with a confused look on your face and the envelope in your hands. \u201c\u2026 That was\u2026 Weird\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, you look at the envelope, maybe the girl\u2019s name was on it\u2026 But you raise an eyebrow when you realize that your name is written on the address. So, the envelope is yours, but why did the maid have this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-Ten minutes and a diet coke later-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, in your mess of a room, you opened the envelope to find a bunch of legal papers (you didn\u2019t know how to speak legallease, so you couldn\u2019t understand it), but then you came across a regular letter that summed up the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, your Uncle Lucas (you heard the name before, and knew that he passed away) had left everything he owned to you\u2026 Apparently you got a copy of his will. Back to the letter though, you read that in order to claim your inheritance you had to head to the return address that was on the envelope and sign some papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, this sounded so weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with a shrug of your shoulders, you figure, what the hell do you have to lose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, you were still curious about that cute, chubby maid. And why she was delivering the will and letter herself rather than allow the postal system to do its job\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And it was going to be the same thing for the next day. Sighing loudly, you began to reach for your house keys when you noticed something about your appartment door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slightly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen when you realized that someone had broken into your apartment - Its not like you had any thing of much value (just a few game systems and books you had from your previous semester of college), but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you slowly opened the door to your apartment, trying to make sure that you were completely undetected if the perp (or perps) were still here. However, the moment you took a step into the apartment, your foot just stepped on an emptied bag of chips, sending a loud crunch sound through out the apartment, <i>'Damn it</i>!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to mentally curse yourself for not watching where you stepped, your heart began to pound... Thumping loudly and oddly enough, it began to get louder... Until you realized that wasn't your heart, but rather the sound of heavy footsteps echoing through the floor apartment. '<i>What sort of criminal would break into my apartment that would make footsteps that loud!?!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, your mind produced a criminal who was more than likely three times your size made completely out of muscles who wouldn't have second thoughts of killing you. And you were too scared out of your wits to even move your legs to run from the louder footsteps. Then you saw the perp exiting from your kitchen... And then did a double take at the sight of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway was an immensely obese woman, who despite her size, she seemed to be moving effortlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese woman was dressed in the attire that resembled that of a security guard's uniform and she seemed to be leering at you; for a the moment she saw you, you began to take in her entire appearance - Her black hair was tied up in a ponytail and her guard hat was stationed perfectly on her head; her cheeks were plump and you couldn't help but notice a small stain of orange and white dust. <i>\u2018Well\u2026 I did just step on a bag of Doritos\u2026 Wait! Did she eat that!?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout to yell at the woman, you noticed her ample chest, two large orbs of pliable flesh, which were in a winning fight against her shirt (which had trouble with the buttons as there were wide gaps that allowed you to see her skin). You weren\u2019t an expert in the field of gauging, but from your distance, she was easily an E cup as you watched them bounce to and fro across her belly with every breath she took. Her belly was large and divided into two separate yet large rolls of fat; her uniform obscured the large mass making it appear smaller than it truly was. You watched as her large tummy slid beneath her uniform, peeking out from the bottom of her miniskirt, swinging from side to side across her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she began to step towards you, and while it was effortlessly for her to head towards you, you knocked some sense into your head and slowly began to walk backwards\u2026 Only to slip on the very same bag of Doritos that you had stepped on earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you remember is the throbbing pain in your head as you slowly began to open your eyes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 And immediately felt some blood rush from your nose when you realized that you had woken up with an enormous pair of breasts just barely hanging over your head. \u201cGACK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d the \u2018breasts\u2019 chimed. \u201cAre you awake now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing your hands to your nose, you quickly replied to \u2018them\u2019 and looked up to barely see a face sticking out from over the breasts. Then you quickly realized that you had your head on someone\u2019s lap\u2026 But not just anyone\u2019s lap, you realized that when you saw the black hair and guard cap that was on the chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Who are you!?\u201d You gagged as you quickly pushed yourself from the large girl. \u201cW-What are you doing here? And how the hell did you get in here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The girl mumbled as she rubbed the back of her head. \u201cFirst off\u2026 My name\u2019s Mika! And am I right to assume you're Mister ________?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s my name,\u201d You replied blinking a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Mika cheered as she jumped to her feet (or at least tried, which made more blood rush out of your nose when you saw her enormous breasts jiggle). \u201cNow then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But anyways, this building itself began construction in 1922, as a home for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Suzu went on, you felt a nudge on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.

Besides,, you really don't wanna be around when Historian Suzu comes out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip in hesitation and cast a gaze at Suzu. The toned woman looked ever-forward, occasionally castoing a sideward glance, yet never behind. She probably wouldn't notice the two of you slipping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Come on, let Mika give you the grand tour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese guard grabbed your wrist and rushed off, practically dragging you along. Despite you being in much better shape, there was no question Mika was much quicker than you, despite being double your weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mika stopped at a wooden door marked KITCHEN- EMPLOYEES ONLY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we really do this? I mean, it does say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an employee too, aren't I? I have as much a right to be there as anyone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithiou any chance to respond, Mika opened the door and quietly stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was rather vast, stoves and ovens and all sorts of ingredients took up the space. Your guide on the other hand, seemed pretty fixated on one thing. The bowl of cookie dough on a nearby table, the batter covered spoon dipped within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an easy way to get salmonella, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored you and grabbed the spoon, licking the dough off, rubbing stomach as she did.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suzu motioned an open palm to a red-headed maid standing in the kitchen, wearing a uniform. She had a thin, trim figure and you felt nervous as she seemed to glare at you with her steely green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This would be Anya. She was rather fond of your Uncle, like a daughter. I hope the two of you will get along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pleased to meet you.\" You lean forward, offering your right hand and a kindly smile in a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya merely looks away, her eyes now gaining a cold quality to them as she goes about her business. You feel a large drop of sweat flow down the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The key word there was hope.\" Suzu stated as she reached up with her left hand and rubbed the bridge of her nose. You could swear she was breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu stepped away as a short, stocky young looking girl with black pigtails suddenly walked (though her chubby and short body made it look like a half-waddle in a way) with a worried look on her eyes. She was wearing a white chef's uniform that looked like it was just a little too small for her. Her chubby stomach seemed to be her outstanding feature, with rather small looking breasts and humble hips accentuating her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Mika I told you not to eat the cookie dough! You're supposed to wait so there's enough for everyone else! You're always like a...a greedy piggie!\" The small chef cried out in a childlike voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked over at your companion, Mika's left eye visibly twitched, her mouth curled into an angered scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi...just what do you mean, callin' me a pig like that?\" Mika said, a tone of tranquil fury undercoating her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned closer, looming above the stout chef with her impressive size and obese bulk, making the smaller chef begin to quiver. However, before you could feel like you needed to intervene, Suzu flicked her forefinger into the back of Mika's head, making a moderate \"twack!\" sound as Mika leaned forward in reacting, groaning and rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, the hell was that for?!\" The obese guard complained, puffing up her already puffy cheeks as she gave Suzu an indignant stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know better than to be that rude with Mimi. If you can bother to act your age, then you'll apologize right now and maybe steal less food from the kitchen in the future.\" Suzu spoke with a cold, yet scolding, tone befitting of someone like her as a doctor of high degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika's cheeks flushed as she looked away, shuffling her feet. You can only blink as you see the huge woman's mannerisms shift from intimidating to childlike in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...that was my fault...\" Mika murmured as she looked down at the floor as best she could. Her tone sounded forced, like a kid apologizing on the playground after an accident at recess, but there was still an innocent sincerity to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling forced to the sidelines, you only watch as the chef, who you now know is named Mimi, looks up as best she can at Mika's face past her bulbous belly and large bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Please don't do it again.\" Mimi said shyly, her childlike tone much more subtle now. You can't tell if she's referring to Mika taking food or her scaring the daylights out of Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu smiled as she knelt down to Mimi so their faces met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright. Oh, didn't you say you were making Sachertorte today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh noooo! You're right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi rushed back into the kitchen after that, to check on whatever this \"Soccer-tort\" thing was. You sigh to yourself as she does. All that and you didn't even get to say hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl was an albino by the looks of her; pale skin, white hair and red eyes completing the whole ensemble. She looked pudgy, but overall not as fat as either Mimi and not even close to Mika, that was for damn sure! She wore what looked more like a sort of gothic French maid outfit decorated with frills on the bottom of the skirt and a frilly black and violet hairband. She seemed to have a timid look to her, the heels of her feet pressed together and she seemed to avoid directly looking at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last, but not least, this would be Kate.\" Suzu finished with a small smile on her tanned face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate meekly shot you a glance, blushing lightly and keeping her hands folded in front of her as she returned her eyes to face downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry she...she doesn't talk. Something...happened in the past and since then she was scarred by being silenced. She hasn't spoken a word since I was here.\" Suzu's face darkened. Her tone was much more serious and alluded she knew more than she wanted to let on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look over, even the energetic and exuberant Mika seems to have become more serious hearing this. The security guard waddles effortlessly over to Kate, gently placing a plump hand around the albino's shoulder, humbly hugging the maid close. It was understandable; having someone mention your troubled past around you must not have been something that would sit easily on your mind. Mika sent Kate off with a gentle pat on the back, the albino maid quietly walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That should be all for-oh wait stupid of me. Your new bedroom is on the second floor, second door to the right. The door has a gold emblazoning, so you can't miss it easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Suzu left, giving a polite nod and courteous bow, as opposed to a courtesy due to her lack of skirt, and walked away. You sigh to yourself, feeling the pressure of the whole situation bare down on you. ...Along with Mika, for some reason, pressing herself into you with her impressive bulk. You can feel her plump, large breasts squishing against you as a catty smile spreads on her round, fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, 'Master' now that you're the man of the house...\" Mika says in a playful way that leaves you flustered, your face red and, admittedly, hoping you aren't pitching a tent in your pants. \"You have to grant your servants some certain needs of theirs~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, your face burning with warmth and redness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what...needs would those be?\" You ask meekly as Mika smiles down at you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel yourself sigh as she mentions food. Given Mika's mannerisms and tone, you assumed she was going to try and do something more...risque. She heartily laughs, her blubbery obese belly wobbling in an almost hypnotic manner as her fat, round and impressively large breasts jiggle a bit from these motions. Mika grabs you in a headlock, trapping you in the pit of her doughy arm and squishing you against the side of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Mimi! The prodigal nephew here wants a nice feast for him and his favorite guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFavorite? Last you checked Mika was the ONLY guard here, but then again she was starting to grow on you. She was certainly rough, as the pain in your neck could attest, but she wasn't bad at all. Plus, as far as you saw, she did have a much more gentle side to her from her interactions with Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika drags you over to the largest chair which overlooks the head of the table, planting you roughly in the authoritative seat while she slides out her own chair to sit with you, turning it around as she rests her arms on the headboard with her head rested atop the thick limbs. You notice her clear ocean blue eyes staring right at you, making you nervous. A couple beads of sweat flow down your forehead as her eyes almost seem to pierce you with their gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Head Boy, what was your relationship with your dear uncle anyway?\" Mika asks in a curious tone that comes off as slightly indignant due to her boredom as she awaits her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well uh...\" You try to compose yourself, your mind a bit scattered as the question feels sudden to you. Nonetheless you try to compose yourself and not pay too much attention to the uncanny gaze of Mika as she sits just next to you. \"Well obviously he was my dad's brother. He wasn't always close as he wanted, but he still tried to be. Unfortunately, he got ill right as his duties as an entrepreneur started winding down. I never got to see him when I was graduating collage because he was in the hospital. I kind of remember when he was around those rare times when I was kid. He and my dad were almost more like twins then just brothers, they were so alike. They both had this big grin like...well I can't exactly describe it too well but...it was just this friendly grin I could look at and tell they were good men. He always liked to tease me as a kid and when I talked about growing up and showing him just what I could do, he'd give me this goofy sounding laugh and say, 'well you still have a way's to go, pup!' and then after that he'd usually walk away and leave it at that, which baffled me at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself laughing and smiling at your fond memories of dear Uncle Lucas, Mika feeling the same vibes as she smiles along with you, her mouth stretched across her puffy chipmunk-like face in an affable, somewhat lopsided grin. However, your joy dies down a bit as your grin dims to a slight smile when reality bears down that this dear man is gone. You didn't know him too much, but you miss what you did know of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As if on cue, Mimi pushed her way though the kitchen as a light to raise you from the darkened mood, bringing forth plates and dishes you never even saw outside of the Travel Channel and pack them on the limited space of the table in front of you and Mika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh baby...\" Mika purrs as she wiggles her thick, plump fingers in anticipation, drool trickling from the corners of her mouth. Before you can even think beyond that moment in time, the blubbery security guard is already setting herself on the copious amounts of food on the table, practically inhaling each dish as it disappears down her gullet at as blinding a speed as she moves! Hell, before you can think to take a bite of the steak dish you grabbed for yourself, Mika has already grabbed your plate and started tearing into it. You can actually <i>see</i> Mika grow fatter, slowly but surely, as each dish is consumed by her. Her tight guard outfit becomes even tighter as buttons along the lower part come undone, giving you a nice peek at the flawless skin of her creamy, round belly. Her pants look as if they're in danger of ripping. The fabric must be crying to try and contain those massive trunks Mika calls her legs and those huge swollen pumpkins that serve as her bottom! Her breasts seem to slowly blow up in size too, the fat orbs growing slowly to the point where they look kind of like smaller soccer balls at their current size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuices and gravies stain Mika's plump hands as she continues to shovel food into her mouth, staining her lips and some bits even falling on her second chin and sliding down into her impressive bust, only to be scooped back up and thrown in her mouth as she found herself belching quite a bit, but at least excused herself when she did...mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhhh~ That food filled a hole~\" Mika coos as she rubs her swollen belly with her hands after wiping them off with the tablecloth she was given, some soft belches escaping her lips as the tight sphere of fat is carefully rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're left in absolute shock at the display of rampant gluttony that just unfolded in front of you. The fact Mika could eat so much, even given her current impressive size and just get bigger right before your eyes is enough to almost send you for a spin. However, you feel your eyes lock on her again, admiring her amorous form and bulging bigger frame. You feel your heart race for some reason as you admire her form but...why? You never felt this way before so why now? What was it about this woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Bbbuuurrp~!* Aaah, man if you keep me fed like that I'll guard you for the rest of my days, Head Boy.\" Mika said with a teasing tone as she looks over at you, giving what appears to be a rather saucy wink. You gulp as she stares at you again before groaning in bliss from her meal and some effort as she rises from her chair slowly, her fatter belly wobbling in freedom thanks to her partially unbuttoned shirt. She looks over at you, looking down past her impressive bust thanks in part to her new size as you wonder what this impressively proportioned woman has in store next for you.</span></div></div>",

You're too busy looking on at her impressive fatter body to pay full attention, but when she said 'bedroom' that part your mind definitely registers. And then takes it greatly out of context. Images of Mika laying playfully on a large, king-sized bed in sultry black-lace underwear suddenly pops up in your mind, making your face flush as you try not to focus on that too much on that image in your head. Mika seems to notice that you've egregiously taken her words out of context and grins, pulling you closer to her fat form once more as her feel her puffy fat arm snake around your scrawny neck and pull you close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey! No offense, Head Boy, but we just met! If you wanna get down and dirty, it'll be an extra 20 up front.\" Mika said in a jesting tone as she continues to squeeze. You could swear that your face was starting to turn blue by this point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, you followed Mika along, her movements surprisingly fluid and light for someone so bulky as she. You wonder just how much she weighs exactly, maybe something around 400, 450 pounds? You can't really tell all that well, but it doesn't help to distract you much from the lazily wobbling cheeks of Mika's large butt as she walks in front of you, leading you up some stairs while humming a jaunty tune under her breath. You don't realize it in full, but you find yourself coveting the large moons as well as the rest of Mika's ponderous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, the wobbling fat guard woman stops outside an impressive set of double doors. The handles look somewhat fused together and they have, as Suzu said earlier, a good emblazoning on them in the shape of what looks like some sort of stylized sun crest. Mika turns around, her breasts wobbling just enough for you to notice as she places her hands against her flared, wide hips and smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's your new pad. Pretty impressive step up from your old digs huh? Well better get some shut eye Head Boy. You got a busy day tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busy? With what?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psh, ain't it obvious? Paperwork, confirming the inheritance, transactions, what to do with your uncle's business and all kinds of other legal crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, hold the phone! No one told me Uncle Lucas left me his business.\" You protest, feeling a couple beads of sweat roll down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did say he left you everything. What, didn't that cross your mind too?\" Mika gives you a quizzical stare as she shifts slightly where she stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause. She did have a point in that case, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm barely out of collage and already, I'm suddenly head of a huge business? No offense Mika, but...<i>kind of</i> a big pill to swallow.\" You frown a bit as you say that. After all, sudden success was as much of a sudden shock enough, but getting it just because your uncle passes away...you kind of don't know how to feel about that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika notices the shift in your expression and her face becomes a bit more stoic. She waddles over to you, giving you a rather firm pat on the back that catches you off guard and almost makes you stumble head first into her bosom and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you better sleep already! The sooner you get that paper done, the sooner you can move on with your new life. So you better make sure you can get through it all without chuggin' a gallon of coffee!\" Mika laughs, her creamy belly shifting slightly, drawing your attention. She pat a chubby hand on your shoulder as she passes you, leaving you alone as you enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel everything start to truly sink in as you stand in this room. The large window to your right, the finely designed dressers, the massive bed centered against the wall, the spacious private bathroom to the left of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, getting yourself undressed as you look through the dressers. On the bed is a satin red set of fine pajamas, tailored to your size. You slip them on, feeling as if you're wearing a cloak of silk almost as you carefully pull up the fine covers of the massive bed and slide in under, reaching over to the left and flipping the light switch. You sigh, lay in bed and stare up at the ceiling for a while as you think about everything more. This mansion, uncle Lucas, your new life, Mika...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts somehow focus soley on your rough, obese security guard as you remember seeing her, the gluttony she exhibited, her impressive size, the full figure she practically flaunted through her uniform...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, shifting a bit as you notice something rising in front of you under the covers. As if you somehow feel like you're not the only one in this room, your face flushes with embarrassment as you shift the problem area a bit so it isn't so obvious before relaxing yourself and drifting to sleep...</span></div></div>",

She just keeps eating and eating, and just like earlier, she is growing slightly larger every time she stuffs something down her gluttonous gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes go by and Mika has finally finished off her small mound of food. It's amazing how she has grown even fatter, her breasts have gone up a size or two and they are stretching her shirt to its limit , her belly has bloated out a bit more and hangs a little lower, and her butt looks as if it would snap her shorts at the slightest movement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yeah...that was...URP...great!\" Mika said blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just watched Mika pack on 15lbs as if it was nothing, and an even crazier thing is that it looks like she could eat more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHey, Head boy could you do me a little favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh y...yeah, whatever you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!

I've seen three females, one of them came up to me and said \" Hi, my name is Suzu, this right here is Anya\" Anya did not look interested in seeing me. \"And this is Kate, she does not talk much\" Kate looked like a girl who had something to hide. \"Mika will be your tour guide, Mika show him around\" Mika nodded her head and we started her tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first place we stopped was the kitchen (no surprise), where she walked up to a small chef. The small chef took us to 4 wooden chairs and a rectangular table outside, the chairs look really cheap but it didn't matter. I sat next to Mika, and the view of her was mesmerizing, Her face was drowned with fat, she already formed a double chin. Her breast looked like an E cup, Her butt was the 2nd biggest part of her it was like 2 big watermelons. Her belly was the main atraction it look like an overinflated beach ball.<br>\r\nAfter I was done looking at her body, the small chef brought large portions of food. Cheeseburger, pizzas, fries, etc. Mika mouth water from the sight of. When she start eating it, she was eating the food like a wild animal. She tore thru the drumstick, I almost thought she was going to eat the bone. She didn't even pour the gravy she was drinking it instead. For some reason I was being turned on by the sight. I looked at the back and her butt crack was showing. I thought \"This Is SO Freaking Hot\" <br>\r\n20 Minutes past, one of her buttons pop revealing her bellybutton. She stopped eating for a moment and looked at her body and said \"C'mon you can do it\" The all of a sudden the button of her pants had popped, she was patted her belly and said \"good girl\" to it. After she was finished eating, she sat back of her chair at a relaxing position. She let out a belch that could shatter windows. She smiled and she said \"I'm full\" She grabbed  my hand and put it towards her belly. \"Look I feel all of it kicking\"  <br>\r\nshe said like she 8 months pregnant, which she was definetely not. her belly was the best feeling in the world. I loved the way it jiggles on my finger tips. I rubbed, patted, and squeezed it. I was enjoying every moment of it. All of a sudden her wooden chair could not support her weight any longer and broke in half. It felt like an aftershock when she hit the floor. \"I knew you would eat all of that food, fatso\" the small chef said. \"Hey, I'm not that fat Mimi\" Mika said childishly. \"Well then what is all of this i'm touching\" Mimi poked Mika belly while she was on the ground, injected a finger and pull it out and watched it jiggle. \"Sure looks like a jiggilo-type whale to me\" All of a sudden Anya showed up and was mad. \"What is going on,, Mika you are supposed to take this dickhead on a tour not stuffing your fat face\" Anya said pointing at me. Mika said \"But Mimi called me fat\" Anya was furious \"you are fat fatass\" Anya slapped Mika belly violently. Now get up and take this idiot on a tour. Mika nodded her head and got up. Anya then barked Mimi \"don't be telling people their fat, because your fat too, Now get to work. We all went to our business of today and went to our next destination</span></div></div>",

She is a red-head, trim and always wearing her maid uniform out of duty. She is very cold to you upon meeting as she is still saddened by your uncle's passing, who had raised her like his own child. But over time, she will warm up to you and possibly fall in love. Age: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi: Your new chef.

Mimi has two long black ponytails, usually wears her chef uniform, and comes up to just above your stomach when you stand next to her.

She seems scared of you at first, but perhaps you may bring words to her lips once again. Age: 21<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika: An over energetic and rather violent (in a playful matter) security guard. Mika is quite obese, yet she moves like she weighs nothing. Mika is almost always eating and acts like she's nine years old with her juvenile attitude and always needing to be scolded. You're often the victim of her horseplay, but that may just mean she like you...a lot. Age: 26<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who do you meet first?</span></div></div>",

Through the window I watched the streets become filthier with litter and the buildings older and shabbier as the bus drove me to where I lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped off at the first stop and walked to the rundown building where I had stayed in for the past four years. I climbed the stairs and walked the hallway that had a musky smell to it and arrived at my door. Like the rest of my life, my apartment wasn't much but it was livable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparsely furnished, for I scarcely had enough money to feed myself, with paint peeling off the walls, it provided me warmth and a roof overhead. I sighed, I kicked off my shoes and plopped myself down on the nearest sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have much to eat during the day, and my stomach was roaring for some food. I couldn't wait to eat some spaghetti drenched in ketchup and watch an old movie on my laptop. But, as I scraped enough energy together to do just that, my phone in my pocket rang. I picked it up and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Will Turner here. Who is this?\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Mr. Turner,\" said my caller, \"My name is Mr. Witherberry. I'm a lawyer and I'm calling you to discuss a few details with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body went rigid and I sat up, feeling my heart beginning to race in my chest. A lawyer was calling me. I didn't know much about the law, but I knew that such people meant that I'm being sued for something. Wow, wasn't this just wonderful! I had a job, a home and a big future ahead of me. I couldn't afford to get in trouble with the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What did I do?\" I heard myself asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, no, no, no,\" Witherberry said, \"Your not in trouble. I'm calling you to discuss the details about a will that your uncle has left for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI calmed down. \"What will?\" I asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, your uncle has passed away recently and has left for you his estate, business, and fortune to you,\" the lawyer explained, \"I'm calling to announce this to you and get you settled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned. What was this guy talking about? I remembered that I had one wealthy uncle somewhere in my family, but I knew very little about him, and the chances were good that he knew little about me. Why would he leave anything for me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. No, this was probably just some prank call. People didn't simply get rich overnight. That only happened in movies. I wasn't going to fall for this bullshit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, bucko,\" I replied sharply, \"I don't know what game this is, but I ain't falling for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, sir, I assure you this is not a jo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cut the call and went on with my afternoon normally, forgetting the call.

The shock was so overwhelming that I slipped into a trance, my body acting on instincts while my brain tried to process what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I finally slipped out of my trance I was sitting on a bench outside the mall. Three shopping bags filled with food that I could never afford with my previous salary sat next to me. My head was in my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock was wearing off, and I could think things a little easier. I was a millionaire, owner of a estate, and probably a big shot CEO of some large company. Well, I couldn't just sit here all day. I needed to get home, call Witherberry and apologize for being such a oblivious ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was on my way to catch a bus when I stopped. Across the street was a used car lot. With millions of dollars in my account I guess I can finally afford my own transport now. I had a driver's license since I was eighteen, and with a swipe of a card a bought a red car and was driving back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed the stairs of the building and headed to my apartment. When I arrived at the right floor, I froze when I saw...</span></div></div>",

I always locked it and knew that this was a bad sign, for the area that I lived in had a infamous reputation for burglaries. My apartment, I saw, was gloomy when I snuck in and silent as a grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groped around in the darkness and found I broom, hoping that it would defend me against any robber. As I moved into the living room, I jumped when the light switch suddenly turned on and someone spoke with a thick southern drawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, about time someone showed up. I was beginning to think that'll ha'to stay here all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned. What I saw made me drop my broom, for I knew that it would be defenseless against a foe like this. She was taller than me by a few inches. She was obese, easily weighing over 300 pounds, but as sturdy as a brick wall. Her hair was blond, tied in a ponytail, her eyes a bright blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was noisily chewing on a piece of bubblegum, watching me with a grin. Around her ample waist was a utility belt, and I saw that a holster contained a firearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped forward. \"You Will Turner?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, I was intimidated by her size and afraid to answer. \"Y-y-yes,\" I stuttered, taking a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin grew wide. \"Ah, I finally found ya!\" she exclaimed, grabbing me and pulling me into a crushing hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was done squeezing the life out of me, she set me down and introduced herself. \"My name's Mika,\" she said, \"I'm your bodyguard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My b-bodyguard?\" I asked, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Mika said with enthusiasm, before turning sad, \"I was assigned to protect your uncle, but old stuff is gone now, but he told me before he went that I've got to go look after his little cousin, which would be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get in here?\" I suddenly asked, remembering my open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, I picked the lock,\" she answered simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You broke in!?\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Mika said with pride, like breaking and entering was a good thing, \"Have several useful skills to help ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, changing the subject. \"Why are you here?\" I asked, \"I didn't order for a bodyguard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya don't need to order for me,\" she said, \"I'm around you 24/7. Anyway, I came to get ya out of this here dump and take you to the estate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. Sooner or later I had to go to my house I inherited and move. \"Just wait a few minutes,\" I said, \"I need make a call first and pack a few th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika cut me off by grabbing my upper arm and saying, \"I have to take ya now! The gals are all waiting for you back home, and boy, are they all worked up to see the new boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing I knew I was being dragged out of my apartment, being forced down the stairs and out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" I cried, \"My stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to break free, but her grip was as strong as iron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have it packed up and delivered for ya, don't you worry,\" she said while dragging me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my car?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be towed and added to the bunch of other cars ya already own\" Mika said with a wink of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside a silver colored limousine awaited me, and Mika showed me into the back seat before climbing in herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got 'em,\" Mika said to a slender man in a neat suit, who I guessed was my chauffeur. \"Get movin'. I don't like this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, miss,\" he said with a surprisingly deep baritone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the car drove off, Mika offered me some expensive wine to celebrate my succession, but I politely refused it. Instead, I looked out the window, watching as we drove further and further away, leaving the city and driving into the countryside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment on I knew that my old life was over and a new one gas began.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the power went out halfway through the process, so you were stuck with a foul near-inedible meal. You gag on the revolting pile of sludge that could be barely described as food. You go downstairs to look for something that won't make you cough up your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the fridge to find romaine lettuce, half a gallon of expired skim milk, and some smelly American cheese. You open the pantry to find some stale chips, cream of carpet soup (what?), and a tiny can of cashews. You sigh in despair as you hear your belly growl. You're quite a skinny lad, weighing in at 140 pounds standing 5'8\" and this is the reaon why: you can't remember the last satisfying meal you've had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhg, I'm starving!\" You exclaim, getting ready to throw a tantrum in vain. But then,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ding dong*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cock your eyebrow as you approach your door. When you open the door, you look left and right, seeing nobody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid kids...\" You say as you're about to close the door. But before you did, you heard a girl cleaning her throat. You looked down to see a very short and chubby girl. \"Can I help you?\" You ask the short plumper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell you can! It's fucking freezing out here!\" She said. She shoved you out of the way and barged into your humble abode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your name *insert name here*?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What's it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know that your uncle Lucas bit the dust last month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really started to get angry and confused. How did this shorty know about your late uncle? \"What the hell do you want from me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl went to your kitchen and browsed your foodstuffs. \"Wow. You live like a damn peasant, you poor bastard!\" She said, laughing a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, if you don't explain yourself, I'm calling the cops right now!\" You reached for the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You inherited your uncle's mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, flabbergasted. \"I who-in-the-what-now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, if you come with me, I'll bring you to your new home and serve you the best lunch your scrawny tummy has ever had the pleasure containing,\" she said, poking your belly. \"Or you can stay here and vomit up that block of cheese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?

You could feel the limo start driving away from your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe faintly smiled and waved at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where's that lunch you promised me?\" You inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\" Mimi took a massive platter with pasta in a very thick, creamy sauce out of a neatly kept compartment in the limo. \"Eat up, skinny boy! Mimi made this for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrapped some strands and took a greedy bite. \"Jesus Christ, this is fucking amazing!\" You say to the tiny chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi smiled, feeling accomplished. \"Mimi knew our new master would love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making small talk for about half and hour, Mimi began her duty to explain her your new responsibilities as head of the estate. However, you were much, much more affixed on the pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And you'll need to write letters to your late uncle's colleagues about- Are you even listening, dumbass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stfh- What?\" You struggled to say with a mouthful of pasta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi rubbed her eyes and shook her head. \"Now would be a good time for the contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmh- what contract?\" You said with a full mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just says that you're responsible for the property and paying taxes and we're responsible for your services like cleaning, entertainment, and food.\" Mimi took out a giant briefcase about as tall as herself and took out the mammoth contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the sort of contract I should be reading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried reading the first few sentances. It was about as comprehensible as any mysterious contract. It might as well be written in medieval Norse. \"Fuck that!\" You said, skipping to the last page and signing your name next to the maid's names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent...\" Mimi said with a grin as she put the document away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked that five times already!\" Your feisty chef replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We're an hour away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the limo, searching for something to pass the time. But then: *growl*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" Mimi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was me.\" You said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little...\" You replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why the hell didn't you ask?\" Mimi said while pulling a chocolate pound cake out of another storage compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a bite out of the second of Mimi's creations. \"Holy shit, this is is phenomenal!\" You say, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... Oh stop it, you.\" Your pudgy chef gleefully teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use a knife and fork to eat the cake like it was a regular meal. Kate and Mimi observed closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around 20 minutes, half the cake remained but you leaned back in your cushy seat and was stuffed beyond belief. You rubbed your belly in satisfaction. \"I've never had a meal that *urp* good before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you can't finish the rest of the cake, skinny boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned and sat up. \"I bet I can!\"</span></div></div>",

Pick a lane!\u201d cried the short stack chef from the front seat, her two pigtails sliding this way and that with every frantic turn of the wheel. Effortlessly and obviously good with her nimble hands, she retrieved her cellphone and began calling\u2026someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Suzu? Yeah, found him. \u2013Hey nice <i>blinker </i><b>jerkass</b>!\u201d she again shouted momentarily along with another swerve.  \u201cNo, he\u2019s here.  Yeah, the others can come back, we finally got the right address. Yeah,<u> total dump</u>\u2026.<i>Him</i>?\u201d At this moment this Mimi persons eyes seemed to lock on your own, her first acknowledgment of your existence in a while, you weren\u2019t sure but there might have been a slight smile gracing her lips\u2026\u201dOh, well- thin as a rail for one thing\u2026M<i>mmp</i>h well yeah kind of\u2026Oh, you\u2019ll see him in in a few minutes anyway.  What do you mean? I am <b>always </b>a safe driver! K\u2019 bye.\u201d And with that she promptly snapped her cellphone shut. \u201cNow\u2026as for you- <b>Shit</b>! Hang on!\u201d A long honk on the horn from not only the car you were presently held captive in, but from what sounded like a number of cars from outside. \u201cWell, I guess things will be easier to explain it at the mansion.\u201d <br>\r\nYou were glad you didn\u2019t have more to think of; in fact you\u2019d do anything to make sure this crazy chef stayed focused on the road. You close your eyes and pray for what feels like forever until the car (more like roller coaster) finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey ya' big baby! We\u2019re here!\u201d says the chef, along with the sound her door promptly opening and shutting.  You open your eyes and breathe a sigh of relief, only to take huge gasp of air! This place was huge! \u201cCome on come on! There\u2019ll be plenty of time to look around later. <i>You do own the place now</i>\u2026Get your ass in gear!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb out of the car, and remember you were being bossed around by a woman who only came up to about your stomach. Still though you can barely get a question out before she\u2019s half dragging you once more, only this time to the mansion\u2019s front doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to stifle a laugh as she cutely, had to reach a bit to grab the large heavy doorknockers. She gave a short grunt, before the wooden doors slowly opened and you enter the amazing grand entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large staircase and magnificent chandelier are all you have time to process before you\u2019re pulled out of the large room and into the next, what was obviously the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis way. Look later. Eat now.\u201d was the entirety of the chef conversation with you as she pulls out a chair from the head of a very large and grandiose dining room table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, and quite happy to sit and catch your breath, you take a seat in the rather plush dining chair. \u201cUh..thanks. Thank you. Uh..Mimi?\u201d  You finally say still a bit in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi seemed satisfied to have you here, the features on her face softened a bit, and there was less of a hurry about her. \u201cOkay, well. I said you get lunch and <u>mister you\u2019re going to get it</u>.\u201d She said suddenly turning herself around on the spot and walking away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut wait!\u201d  you shout, still dazed and  dumfounded though not daring to get up from your chair. \u201cWhat about my Uncle? Who were you talking to in the car? Why, am I even here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain it all over lunch.\u201d She said sounding quite self-assured as she disappeared behind a door into what must have been the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later as a delicious spread of food is carted out on numerous silver platters... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t know how long you would be able to keep up living on your own like this, but you did know if you had to go through one more meal of these terribly salty noodles and \u201cbroth\u201d you were going to be sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BA-BAM!! BA-BAMBA-BAM!! </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n A sudden banging comes from the hallway knocking at your door with a force that almost broke it off its hinges.  You hurry to open the door not expecting (and definitely not dressed for) company. Your greeted to the sight of a gorgeous tall and tan beauty; her brown tan legs lead up to a pair of adventurous khaki shorts that just barley contained a pair of wide and will muscled thick thighs. Further upwards you get a glance at the roundest perkiest set of breasts you had ever seen, they tested the woman\u2019s pink shirts confines seemingly bending the cloth around them. Up and up your eyes claimed trying to take in the entirety of the amazon in climbing ceased at her beautiful face that featured a look of refinement and confidence on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm is this the residence of the nephew of the late great Luke?\u201d she asks as she takes a glance at the information on the card in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Uh yeah I had an uncle named Luke, I think\u2026 Big big guy, Brown hair, wears these kinds of square glasses?\u201d These were all faint memories you had from when you were much younger, you can\u2019t remember when but you had definitely remembered the few times you had met your uncle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-that\u2019s him to the T\u201d The tan near giantess looks about ready to cry as she slumps down in your doorway and gives you a great big hug. You stood frozen as her powerful looking arms hugged you gently, unable to understand what you could have said to get this sort of reaction. \u201cOh my goodness! You poor thing is this really where you live? Oh and look at you, you\u2019re practically wasting away! This can\u2019t be healthy\u201d she sniffles out, trying to regain her composure.  You nod taking no offense in the remark, knowing full well you were basically slumming it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill slightly emotional she stands  and bows to you, again another action taking you by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to break down like that, it\u2019s just I was one of his close assistant\u2019s and I got to know him very well and\u2026 well I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s dead.\u201d She says waiting to see your reaction. You remain nonplused as the words wash over you:  Your uncle who you barely knew and who this woman apparently cared very deeply about was dead. Ok so that\u2019s why she\u2019s upset. You nod your head in a sign for her to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems your Uncle Lucas had left everything he owned to you\u2026\u201d she explains her voice no longer cracking with emotion, now taking on a husky calm demeanor.  \u201cBut to your inheritance your asked to travel to his mansion, no , it would actually be your mansion now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second word you excitedly pack your things into a small roughed up suitcase. Not having more than a few scraps of clothing all having a rip or tear.  Hurrying out the front door you search for any sign of the wondrous woman you\u2019d just met, but surprisingly she was not to be found. There was a limousine with a door ajar, which you assumed was for yourself. Hopping inside you close the door and the limousine takes off, leaving your old place and your old like behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that you couldn\u2019t see the driver and tinted windows on the inside of the limo meant you were left alone with your thoughts. Actually now that you think about it, could this be a trap or a prank? A whole mansion out of the blue from your dead uncle who you\u2019ve hardly ever met? How this rather attractive and large woman just burst into your life? It seemed a little too suspicious now that you thought about it, and now you were trapped in this limousine headed who knows where, alone. You gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the car stops will you were about to find out opening the door you find yourself outside of the largest pair of double doors to the larges house you\u2019ve  ever known. Suddenly you\u2019re lifted tight from behind.  You feel yourself being easily lifted of the ground by the tan arms and strangely the first thing that fills your panicked mind was coconuts. The coconut lotion smell coming from her coconut sized biceps, and the way you were being mashed into her larger the coconut sized breasts was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right you runt give us the money!\u201d boomingly demands this brown skin kidnapper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d You yipe as your voice crack. You were about ready to wet yourself in fright.  Why oh why had you gotten into that into hat limousine. If you got out of this alive you\u2019d never complain about instant noodles again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhffthahhaha!

You then decide to emerge from the bookcase and hand her the diary. Unfortunately she runs away frightened by the noise. You then decide to read the diary since Kate ran off in a hurry. You discover in her diary that people mistreated her since she's an albino. You then feel sorry for her and want to help her out. But just when you scout the area to make sure it's safe you trigger a booby-trap  and five hunger darts hit you.

Mimi!\u201d Scolded Suzu, she paused for a moment as if she too was remembering something bitter before she continued. \u201cOkay\u2026I guess she is bit of a brat,\u201d She admits crossing her arms underneath her large looking melons. \u201cShe\u2019s already spoiled beyond belief  I mean she does come from a rather rich family, but in case you couldn\u2019t guess from the picture she just craves having more and more of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not \"why her\", why\u2026\u201d you begin but end up pausing for a second as your busy dodging Mimi as she tries cram a second cookie down your throat. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t my uncle just leave it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu shrugged at the question, causing her well-fed looking breasts to jiggle within their confines. \u201cI guess he thought that if he did that Amelia or someone else might try to take it from us since we weren\u2019t exactly blood related. Either way being maids is what we love and what brought us all together in the first place. He was basically  making sure we would still be working together by making sure we do for his heir what we did for him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask her, understanding everything except for the last bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell how else do you think he got so\u2026big? He was only 200 lbs. when he first got here, and brought us all together.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>And still a virgin~\u201d </i>Mimi added slyly, sending herself into a fit of naughty giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you saw that you weren\u2019t the only one who was now blushing from the spontaneous statement. All around the room were faces that remained bright red and were all looking slightly embarrassed. You were beginning to wonder what kind of guy your uncle was, more to the point what kind of women were these maids?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMimi!\u201d Anya said finally speaking up and doing the scolding this time.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ahem* Suzu cleared her throat and resumed her doctor like demeanor. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 beside the point. Really we were surprised as you were when we found out about all of the wills terms. We\u2019ve thought about it and planned it out like this; If you want to \u201cwin\u201d in three years you\u2019ll have to gain about 16lbs a month. If you can do that you get the house, his money, and off course us for the rest of your life. We'll do everything we can to help because I think it\u2019s already agreed we like you a lot more than her.\u201d You look around and see the rest of the group nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this must all seem sudden but what do you say? Suzu asks her pleading face leaning in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Okay I\u2019ll do it!\u201d you say gaining gumption for the idea. 16lbs a month sounded pretty easy, at least you hoped it would be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you agreed the group of girls cheered in delight they were so excited. The night flew by as you were treated to a five course meal of rich hot food. You weren\u2019t sure if it was because of Mimi\u2019s skills or because you had gone so long without a real meal but absolutely everything tasted delicious. You made sure to have your fill too, eating as much as you shriveled stomach could hold. Surprisingly as you looked around the large table at your new servants you saw they were easily eating double your own healthy portions. Actually it wasn\u2019t so surprising considering while you were only sightly taller than most of them, all of them looked to have at least 50lbs+ on you. Never the less a good time was had by all that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch much later you were feeling awfully tired, the thrills of the day (as well as the food) had left you completely whipped. Your new maids helpfully escorted you into the grandmaster bedroom where awaited the largest bed you had ever seen. Crawling in you felt you might drown in the ocean of velvet sheets and down comforter that blanketed the four poster bed. Lying there you could hardly sleep, still in disbelief of your new life of wealth and plush\u2122 Eventually the combination of luxuriously soft pillows and blankets did their job and you finally closed your eyes settling into a warm dream of what tomorrow might hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Outside of your room you quietly waddled your way downstairs towards the kitchen, actually enjoying the feel of your fat front and love handles as they bounced with your every step. You could already smell Mimi making breakfast and from what you could tell it was pancakes this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you passed from the dining room to the kitchen you saw Mimi was not alone in kitchen. Mika was standing by her side; apparently stuffing her cheeks full of snacks, or more specifically the pancakes that Mimi was preparing. Strangely the pancakes weren\u2019t covered in the regular thick and brown maple syrup, or even just creamy yellow butter. Taking a look at Mimi\u2019s face her face looked like it was stained with something that looked like butter-but wait was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re up early Master!\u201d Mimi says running your train of thought of its tracks. She waddles closer, almost literally bouncing across the floor to stop you from coming closer. \u201cMika is testing a new surprise Mimi is making you. It\u2019s a surprise breakfast so back to bed with you~!\u201d she said her short stature just barely able to push you back as her tiny hands sink into your growing blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo<i>kaayy</i>\u201d you say humoring her and exiting the kitchen. From the way Mika was scarfing the food down it must have been really yummy and you couldn\u2019t wait to try it, your hunger being one of the other things that had grown with the rest of you.  Eventually you do manage to navigate the mansions large hallways and crawl back to your king sized bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaaah ~What a life!  you think to yourself.  You absolutely loved having breakfast in bed now. You can remember how every morning of your old life you had to be up and at  work by at eight in the morning, and breakfast was something  you usually ended up skipping.  But now, breakfast was one of the best parts of your day and included seconds, and increasingly more often thirds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gong*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The metallic sound of the miniature golden gong on the breakfast cart wakes you up and lets you know breakfast was now served. As Mimi wheels the silver cart in all of your other maids follow her and stand attending  to your bedside. Judging from the content look on their faces and the their taught looking stomachs they must already be full from their own breakfast... What had Mimi made?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go master\" Mimi says happily sliding a plate of regular looking  chocolate chip pancakes on to your plate. While her chocolate chip pancakes were fantastic, (and fattening) you can't help but be puzzled at what the surprise was. Mimi seems to be reading the look on your faces and disappeared behind the cart for a second. She returns quickly with a carton of vanilla ice cream and a scooper in hand, scooping the whole carton of ice cream on top of the warm pancakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surrrprise!\" she shouts as you watch the ice-cream slowly melt and drizzle over the stack of flapjacks the smell was heavenly. \"Mimi thought you gain even faster this way and  everyone agrees that it tastes great!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only pause for a second as you take in this strange concoction, but then dig in. The weird sensation of hot pancakes and cold ice cream is strange in your mouth but the taste is divine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, good idea Mimi\" you say after swallowing a mouthful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi's so happy you like it!\" she says smiling and clasping her hands together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish the full course meal of a  breakfast the girls all give a bow and leave with a smile. You feel completely stuffed, a sensation you were getting quite used to in fact. Crawling out of bed for the second time that day you notice your swim trunks had been left out by one of the maids. You strip down to nothing but your extra-large trunks letting your stomach roll and flop over the waistband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember why they had been left out and were excited because\u2026</span></div></div>",

Business had been slow and your psychotic ex-boss decided to fire you today once she came by your station and handed you three months of severance. You worked a car mechanic at Crazy Jill's Auto. You were hoping to eventually start your own business, but Crazy Jill insisted that you would receive no more than $12.50 per hour. It was decent, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to pay off your trade school loans. As soon as you received the severance money it went to paying off the remaining balance on your loan. Now you had another problem. You had to pay your rent today or your landlord will kick you out of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Jeremy Strouge was a peculiar man. He expected all rent to be paid on time without exceptions. Without your pay and severance you were sure to get kicked out. As you know Mr. Strouge isn't known for his patience. One time he lost his temper when another neighbor of yours called him a heartless Hellbeast, just because the neighbor was trying to find a new job. The neighbor was 6'8\" and a personal trainer. Mr. Strouge was a very short man at 5'3\", but clearly a man who worked out a bit too much, since the built up that he built up from working out cause him to be extremely moody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at 6'3\" and having an average build you feared what your rageaholic landlord would do once he shows up today to collect the rent that you don't have. You gulpped as you heard a knock on your door. You slowly approach the door and open it cautiously just in case your landlord is in an extremely bad mood. However, once you opened the door you saw an albino woman standing at 5'7\" and sporting a small pot belly. She was wearing a maid's outfit and sunglasses. The woman feigns in fear after getting a glimpse at you. You weren't intimidating, but you were definitely taller than the average guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I won't hurt you. Let me guess Uncle Bill finally died and now I'm going to inherit his vast fortunes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate timidly nods her head yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Now I can leave this cursed existence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheer of excitement startles Kate so much that she bumps into your former landlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big idea! You better watch where you're going if you know what's good for ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr. Strouge. What can I help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can help me by giving me the rent you owe today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that... I don't have the money right now, but I'll give it to you ASAP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! You either give me the money now or I'll kick you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll just pack my bags then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you bub. When you're done get outta my sight and don't come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Strouge stomped off, clearly in a terrible mood. You see Kate trembling in fear. Judging by her reaction she had never seen anyone with an extremely short temper or she had a terrible dating experience that caused her to barely anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Kate,\" you said as you looked at the name tag pinned to her shirt. \"We'll head to the mansion and never see that scary man again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate leads you to the limo. Once inside Kate drives the limo to your late uncle's mansion. Uncle Bill's mansion was like something out of a science fiction film. It was large and it was cover in high tech solar panels and had a turbine to convert water from the lake in the backyard. Also any any dirty water was filter and purified before returning to the lake. You look at your new home in awe. Who would of thought that you would inherit a mansion in Tennessee. You and Kate walk up to the mansion and open the ornate hardwood door. After entering your new home...</span></div></div>",

The obese woman is glaring at me; I could not do anything other than stare at her. Her black hair was tied up in a ponytail and she was wearing a guard hat ; her cheeks were plump and I noticed a donut sticking out of her lips and had another donut in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest were two large orbs of pliable flesh that were going one on one against her shirt. I believed she was an E cup as you watched them bounce to and fro across her belly. Her ass was freaking huge, it was like two fat sumo fighting each other, jiggling trying to stay on top. Her belly was large and divided into two separate yet large rolls of fat; her uniform obscured the large mass making it appear smaller than it truly was. I watched as her large tummy slid beneath her uniform, peeking out from the bottom of her miniskirt, swinging from side to side across her thighs. She pushed the donut past her lips and begin to chew softly for some reason it felt very erotic the way she was chewing, it also made her chin jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Mika, and you are coming with me\", she said evilly, as she grabbed my arm i shook her arm off me caused her arm to jiggle. \"Wait a minute I am not going anywhere\", I said angrilly. \"Why\" Mika \"Please go please, please, please, please, etc.\" she was begging me to go with her, she kept saying please over and over while jumping up and down, which caused her butt, belly, and breasts to bounce up and down violently. After being hypnotized by her bouncing body I said,, \"Okay, okay I will go\" She said \"YAY\", she grabbed my arm and ran to the limo from my apartment. Mika was fat but amazingly she was very fast, not a sign in slowing down, I was watching her body jiggle as she was running while she was grabbing my arm. I got in the limo and Mika drives me to a mansion and then:</span></div></div>",

I walked to chef Mimi and ask Mimi a favor \"I need to gain wait\" Mimi said \"How much\" \"240 pounds\" Mimi yelled \"240 POUNDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why the hell would you gain 240 pounds\" then she start to realize \" Oh I get it, you want to tap Mika's ass don't you master\" she laughed while I stand there embarrassed. \"Okay, Okay I will help you master.\"<br>\r\nThe first couple of days I was eating non-stop I ate: Pizza, chicken, Fries, burgers, onion rings, ice cream, jell-o, and anything Mimi threw at me. I started seeing the results in the first 2 weeks I was a simple 160 pound man to a 275 pound man. My belly was the main attraction I was the biggest part of my body I for sure thought I swallow 3 watermelons. I grew man boobs which were not that big but very visible. I even started to grow a double chin. One day I started eating a huge ration of food, Anya walked up to me and said \"What the hell master you becoming fat as hell, lose some fucking weight!\" I did not let that bother me as I continued on to my food. She walked back to her table having a conversation with the other girls. I overheard Suzu said \"I don't know it is kind of romantic\". I just smiled and kept eating.<br>\r\nThe 3 weeks passed Mika showed up wearing her security uniform and a donut in her mouth (as always). Everyone greeted her back but I was the best greet for last. When she saw me she was in awe. I was 400 pounds every part of me got even bigger I was 50 pounds bigger than Mika. At 275 I think swallowed 3 watermelons, now I think I swallowed 6 watermelons.

So big in fact that you doubted you could find your way back to the exit if given a compass and a week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi leads you into what you assume was your uncle's study. You never really knew much about your uncle, every once in a while he'd drop in for birthdays or holidays, bringing gifts from exotic countries he'd traveled too. You never got the sense that he was trying to show off his wealth-he was just eager to share with you and your family the spoils of his many hobbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the room was an ornate mahogany chair and a large screen TV. Keichi took his station by the screen and you, a little hesitantly, sat down in the chair. Keichi switched on the screen, fast forwarded a bit, and suddenly you were greeted to the face of your uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't expected a video will, but you though it suited your uncles style just well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was propped up on the bed, tubes attached all over hid body, but still smiling, just as you remembered him. \"And to my favorite grand-nephew,\" he smiled because you were his only grand-nephew. \"I leave my house all it's grounds, my business and fifty-percent of my estate. Should be more than enough to keep you happy and feed for the rest of your long life.\" With a wink, he added \"I also took the liberty of hiring a brand spankin' new staff, my boy, treat 'em  like princes alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou uncle then addressed the camera in a more business tone, talking you assumed to an old business partner. Keichi switched the TV off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so... You mean I own all of this?\" You ask, flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master,\" Keichi replied impassively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sat in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say finally. It was all you could think to say. The enormity of the gift and the loss of your uncle stole all other words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi glanced at his watch, \"It is time for dinner, sir. Allow me to take you to the dining room.\" Keichi's last words were muffled by the sound of the door being kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, chuckles!\" You cringe immediately recognizing Taiga, \"Where do you want the Master's shit. Cuz far be it from me to mess up your holy itinerary.\" You note the duffel bag full of your things that you had hastily packed slung over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Keichi looks visibly riled. Not much, but the scary neutral expression was broken just a bit. \"You are interrupting the master, already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga glances over at you and his face lights up in a grin. \"Well look at that.\" He bowed, mocking the controlled and reserved bow Keichi had done earlier, \"Forgive me your Highness.\" The joking, good natured tone of your voice put you at ease a little. Keichi seemed nice-if a little too intense- but you thought you'd go mad if everyone addressed you as 'master' or 'sir' all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi apparently did not feel the same way, \"Get out!\" he yelled jabbing a finger at the door. \"And take off those disgusting boots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga was just about to reply, when another head poked into the door. This face was much more feminine, and was framed by long brown hair. \"Well, well, well what's going on in here?\" he asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, Sai.\" Taiga muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi turned to address the new man, \"Sai, take the Master down to the dinning room please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man-Sai-rolled his eyes alright. He gestured at you, \"C'mon you must be super confused bu now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and almost leap out of your chair.</span></div></div>",

His voice took on a more conspiratorial tone, \"Except for the old chef,\" he grinned like he'd hit the gossip jackpot. \"He stayed on for a month to get Ryu-the new chef situated.\" Sai's eyes got wide, \"and he was huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" You said trying to hide you embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gets better!\" Sai said with glee. \"See first I though, okay nothing weird here, never trust a skinny chef after all.

Next to him a floppy garden hat sits perched on the counter. He's eating a big piece of chocolate cake and looking as if he's in heaven. You'd guess his age to be quite young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also notice that he is quite chubby. When he leans forward a sizeable roll of fat pushes over the lip of his pants and you can clearly see A pair of moobs developing beneath his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he sees you two his face lights up, \"Is that the new Master?\" he asks around a forkful of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and what are you doing eating cake?\" Sai scolds, \"It's almost time for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy pouts, \"Ryu let me have it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on command, a tall stern faced man walks up to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner,\" he said in a gruff voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" The young boy slid off the counter, his rolls bouncing up and down. He grabs your hand, \"I'm Megumi the gardener, and this is Ryu the best chef in the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryujin.\" The man corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man laughed. \"C'mon before it gets cold!\" He pulls you into the dinning room, followed by Sai and Ryujin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter into a large room. In the center is a long dining room table that looks as if it could fit twenty people comfortably. Megumi pulls out a chair for you, and plops down in a chair next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we eat here?\" Sai asks suddenly. \"It's what we were doing before you got here, and apparently what the old staff did,\" he added not being able to resist a bit of gossip, \"but Keichi will throw a fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please eat with me!\" You say. Even though you'd just met them you liked your new servants (your uncle had done well). Besides, since your parent's death you'd lived alone. It would be nice to have some company for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumi nodded furiously, \"Besides, Kei always takes his dinner in his room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to settle it, and Ryujin disappeared only to return a few minutes later with several plates filled to the brim with food. It is so good, that you can't help yourself and scarf it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, when you're done Ryujin disappears and brings out another course. And then another!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice out of the corner of your eye that even though Ryujin puts the same amount of food on everyone's plate, he always pressured Sai and Megumi into taking more and wouldn't take them away until they had cleared it entirely. Megumi seemed more willing to do so, but it only took one silent look to get Sai to tuck in. He was much more lenientwith you, allowing you to take as little or much as you pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga arrived when dessert is being brought out. He mock bows to you again, \"Good evening, young master.\" You blush thinking of his awkward declaration of love but try to hide it. You weren't sure what to think of it quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Tai!\" Megumi says cheerfully. \"You missed spaghetti night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" he grumbled. \"Is there any left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyujin batted him over the head without changing his expression. \"Come to dinner on time,\" he said simply but brought the man a plate anyway.</span></div></div>",

Apparently, there was more work involved in inheriting a large estate than you had originally suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was for sure though- your great-uncle had been right. You could easily just sit on the estate and live comfortably off interest alone. Not that you had any intentions of doing that. It seemed like such a waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd earned your degree in business-paid in part by scholarships and by your great-uncle himself. Besides, you would have to be a complete screw up to squander this fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it was rather stressful now that you was in charge of all the zeros. You'd kept your uncles old financial managers (a couple of stodgy old men who looked like they'd never smiled once in their lives), but all the decisions fell to you: invest in this company or that? Buy more of this stock or sell, sell, sell? Even what pieces of primitive art that your great-uncle had painstakingly collected to be part of the newest gallery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yawn you throw your pen down and stretch. At least you can depend on your servants. They've been as busy as you have-Taiga and Ryujin have been busy transporting everything that wasn't nailed down in your old apartment (and a few things that were) to the mansion, Sai was working night and day to create a new wardrobe for you (one more befitting of a fabulously wealthy heir and less like a frumpy between jobs college grad), Megumi had taken it upon himself to make sure that the inside of the mansion was as spotless as the outside (and that Taiga and Ryujin didn't damage anything in transit) and Keichi and watched over all of them with an iron fist. It was nice to be able to depend on other people again, it was a luxury you hadn't had since your parents died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rap on the door knocked you out of your musings. You were just about to call out come in, when Taiga barged in anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes at him, \"Come on in, Taiga, don't be shy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind if I do.\" With a devilish grin the red-head flopped down on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Was their something you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than answering, Taiga remained silent, his shit-eating grin spread from ear to ear though. Not being able to stand the silence, you turn back to your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, Taiga, if you're only in here because Keichi's hunting for you head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I assure you, I'm not here because of Keichi.\" He whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou startle, not expecting Taiga to be the close to you. You hadn't even heard him get up! He chuckled, deep in the back of his throat. He placed one hand on your shoulder and the other against the small of your back. It crept up underneath your t-shirt and began to trace small circles up and down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am here, just for you.\" He breathed,  warm breathe coming out in little puffs against your neck. You shiver involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cock you head, to look at your cheeky chauffeur. He's still wearing that devilish grin, but his dark green eyes are half-lidded and lusty. Suddenly, you realize this is the closest you've ever been to your not so secret admireror. Now that he was so close you could see the light smattering of freckles across his cheeks and nose and his long dark eyelashes. Also, a few suspiciously placed holes running through his eyebrows and ears, that might once have held piercings. You wonder what he looks like all done up. Despite yourself, you had to admit to yourself that he was kind of cute- in an impish sort of way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled again and began to lean in, slowly. Glacially, one could say. Giving you plenty of time to pull away or push him away if you wanted. Of course, you don't. Like a deer trapped in a headlights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was mere inches away from you lips, he paused again, head slightly cocked. Waiting, for you probably, to either bridge the gap or pull away. You pause and lick your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for the love of.\" Taiga rolls his eyes and plants his lips on yours. This isn't your first kiss, far from it. You've been on dates, had relationships. Hell even experienced the more carnal pleasures of life, but before they had always been controlled affairs. Not spontaneous like... like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga's mouth began to mouth slowly, and as though they had a life of their own your lips began to move as well. The red-head's hands moved up from your back and to your face, pulling you closer and deepening the kiss. You smile when you feel Taiga's tongue flicking out of his mouth and brushing against your lips. You keep your mouth closed though. Gotta keep him in his place after all, no need to let him get too cheeky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minute, Taiga pulled away. If possible the grin on his face had gotten even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough, and turn away, \"Right, that was... Uh.\" You stand, \"You should probably get going now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga pouted, \"What? Seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away, blushing furiously, \"Yea. Listen, Taiga, you're really great but, ah,\" You scratch the back of your head, uncertain how to proceed with you-ahem- little secret, or if you should even tell the red-head at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can decide, you are interrupted by...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The red-head doesn't move. You do note his brow wrinkling in frustration. \"Yeah! Come in!\" You call, thankful for the interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai peeks his head in through the door, \"I've finished the new uniforms, you just need to come and approve them.\" He pauses catching sight of Taiga and your reddening face. A coy smile creeps onto his face, \"Oh, hi there Taiga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, if you want to come, everyone's getting changed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right.\" You scratch the back of your head and cast a sideways glance at your chauffeur. \"Are you coming-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can finish your sentence, Sai laughs and grabs ahold of your hand, \"Oh no! Someone didn't come to the fitting, so he doesn't have his new uniform yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because I was actually doing my job instead of gossiping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai stuck his tongue out at the red-head. \"Come along, Master.\" Your tailor then drags you out of the room, displaying a surprising amount of strength for his skinny frame, and slams the door behind him. You think you can hear Taiga groaning in frustration and flopping on the bed again through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the hallway, Sai laughs again, \"Oh, master, you dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tailor laughs again and pats your hand. Somehow you get the sinking feeling that within the hour the entire staff would be aware of Taiga and your's 'clandestine' meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and pinch the bridge of your nose with your free hand.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSai leads you through  the twisting turning halls and once again you find yourself hopelessly lost. Taiga would just have to wait, as you weren't getting back to your room any time soon. You feel relieved when Sai finally pushes the door to his workshop open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat relief disappears when you see the remaining members of your staff in there, half naked and in the midst of changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saaaaaii.\" Megumi held up a pair of slacks. The small man was wearing only his underwear, a pair of dark briefs that left absolutely nothing to the imagination.  If you had to guess, you'd figure he must have put on a few pounds since you last saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly, while never flat, had developed quite the curve to it, and hung almost an inch over the hem of his underwear. And that wasn't the only part of him that had expanded as well. He'd developed thick (and temptingly grabbible) love handles, flabby arms and a soft doughy chest. His rear wasn't spared either. His ass had expanded into a mountain of jiggling fat and his thunder thighs were large expanses of milky flesh. As he bounced on his feet, you could see his entire fat body jiggle and shake, from his double chin to his calves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again a blush graced your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saaaaii!\" The man continued. If he was aware of the effect his body had on you (or even aware he'd gotten this large) he was doing a good job of concealing it. \"My uniform doesn't fit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tailor frowned and snatched the khaki's away from Megumi. After checking the stitches, he cast a critical eye at the gardener's fleshy belly. \"Well, it fit when I was taking your size. Maybe if you didn't eat so much sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumi rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Sai tossed the khaki's back at the man. \"Well, put it on the best you can for the Master. I'll take it out for you later.\" He waggled a finger at the smaller man, \"But don't gain anymore weight! You hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally ripping your eyes away from Megumi, you glance over at your other servants. To your surprise, a bit of a curve has begun to take to their bellies as well. On Keichi, who was rather thin to begin, with it was almost unnoticeable- just the slightest curve. But when Ryujin bent over, you spied love handles beginning to form at the cook's sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused you glance over at Sai. The man was continuing his argument with Megumi (while desperately trying to pull the smaller man's pants over his thighs) and didn't notice you watching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the others Sai was still skinny as a rail. You sigh and pull your eyes away from his flat belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you. Hadn't his belly been concave a few days ago. You glance back. It was definitely flat now (perhaps the result of packing a few extra pounds on?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill confused, you look over at Ryujin-as he was your chief and likely the source of this development. To your surprise, his dark eyes were fixed on you. You blink, in surprise trying to read his expression. As always, though, it was impossible. After a few moments, you look away, embarrassed for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew.\" Sai whipped imaginary sweat off his brow. \"That's as good as it's going to get.\" He looks at you, chocolate brown eyes sparkling, \"So tell me what you think? Pretty amazing right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore answering you take a moment to survey your staff-if only to make Sai happy. Keichi's usual plain black suit had been replaced with something a  touch fancier-and tailored and cut to his (new) dimensions. Ryujin had dawned a white chef's outfit, with your uncle's crest emblazonded on the breast. You note the outfit showed off his curving belly. Megumi's outfit had changed the most. Usually, the man would work in ripped up, grass stained jeans and a white undershirt- and his trusty floppy hat of course. Sai had dressed him in khaki pants and a pink polo shirt-again with your uncle's crest on the breast. However, the plump man was almost popping out of it. The polo was at lest a size too small, and while the two had managed to pull the khaki's all the way up, they'd been unable to zipper them up over Megumi's flabby belly. The young man's rolls oozed over the top of the helm, and a v-shaped section of belly pushed his fly apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you blushed and had to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah everything looks great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome job as usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course.\" Not that you knew what was Sai's usual. Still even you, the fashion impaired heir, could tell that everything had been cut and designed to the height of fashion and to accentuate the staff's body types. Sai had done an excellent job.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe man laughed, \"Well, of course! If anyone could make these weirdos look good, it would be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, \"Don't you get a uniform, Sai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette rounded on you, \"My uniform is to look as good as possible.\" He waggled an eye brow at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, Megumi made a gagging gesture. You stifled a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well, I'd better be going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai ushered you out of the room. \"Right remember you have a fitting tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tailor slammed the door behind you. His eyes darted to Keichi. The butler blinked. Sai jerked his head over at Megumi. The little gardener had already begun peeling off his new outfit and didn't seem to see the gesture. For his part the butler didn't make any sign, and slowly began to unbutton his vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo! You three will never guess who I saw in the Master's room! Go on, guess!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One wonder if there's something to to this. Age: 23<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyujin: A tall and a bit imtimidating man from China of little words, but a senstive side hidden within. He is your chef and has a fondness for the best ingredients.

After your parents passing, it was either buckle up and get to work or starve to death on the street. Not wanting to impose on the few relatives you still had you learn to balance school and work. Fortunately, school was finished\u2026 there was no way you\u2019d be able to afford college and paid the rent and eat\u2026 Speaking of eating you barely ate anything today. You had just enough to not pass out at work. You decided to eat some ramen when you got home. It was your primary food source since it was cheap and it really warms you up during the cold seasons. You had long gotten tired of its salty flavor, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach your apartment building your eyes are immediately drawn the black limousine parked on the road outside of it. That was quite unusually since your apartment living area was far from luxurious. As you got close you saw how shiny it was and it had no scratches. Someone was living a good life\u2026 Maybe it came to pick up a poor heiress that will inherit money from rich relatives. You laughed to yourself at the thought. This wasn\u2019t fairy tale world; stuff like that didn\u2019t happen for real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScaling up two flights of stairs, you paused. There was clearly guy standing right at your apartment door and\u2026 was he wearing a butler outfit? \u2026He couldn\u2019t possibly be looking for you\u2026 There must be some mistake, wrong room or something you decide to go and clear it up. Up close, this guy was a very dashing and showy man compared to ordinary you\u2026 there was a little femininity in his face along with that long hair he was a bit girly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm hello\u2026 are you looking for someone?\u201d you asked as you walked up to the man and his eyes swiftly turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for the one that lives in at this apartment number,\u201d the flamboyant man replied back as he pointed at the door he was waiting at. That was surly your home, but you still believe this must be some mistake. His eyes intently peer at your face and you wonder if you got something on it from work. \u201cWould this happen to be your apartment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but there mus-\u201d before you could finish your statement, the butler grabbed your hand and shook it rapidly. You flinched and tried to pull it away but he had a good grip on you. You were too stunned for another word to come out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad finally meet you! I've been waiting for awhile.\u201d He expressed his happiness and finally let go of your hand but after he was done with that he continued to examine you top to bottom with his eyes. Then out of nowhere he was grabbing and stroking your side. Your only response was jump in shock. His hands moved up to your chest, then the shoulders and along your arms\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are y-\u201d you are muted again as he suddenly groping down your legs. You were feeling all kind of things but mostly shocked to be felt down by a guy you just met. Your face was certainly flushed a bright shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, the clothes are quite plain and your built is scrawny and bony\u2026\u201d he stated his rundown of your physique. You couldn\u2019t help but feel more embarrass with such a gorgeous person like him standing in front of you. You looked down with you face still burning red. But suddenly his hand under your chin made you lift it again. \u201cBut nice facial features with some work you\u2019ll be perfect~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you\u2026 You obviously have the wrong person!!!\u201d You suddenly shouted out as you take a step back. Your heart was thumping out of control with groping and his comments. What was going on today?!! \u201cI\u2019m just simple guy that lives modestly; you must be looking for someone else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have an Uncle named Lucas, right?\u201d he questioned you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026? Actually I do but\u2026\u201d you tried to retort but like most of you conversation with his guy you were interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your name is\u2026\u201d The shocked looked on your face when he called you by your full name was all he needed for confirmation. You were absolutely dumbfounded\u2026 the idea of this refused to sink into your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026b-but\u2026 why\u2026?\u201d You futilely began to stammer again to only be cut off once more. Not that you really knew what to say anyways\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019re the person I came here to get! Come along now, let\u2019s get going!\u201d He grabbed you again by the hand and quickly lead, pulled you back downstairs towards the limousine. Holy shit! You were the poor heiress\u2026err heir in fairy tale land, weren\u2019t you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushed into the lavish car, seated on probably the most comfortable car seat, you still couldn\u2019t get out of your state of astonishment. You never even dreamed that you would be riding in a limo. Just looking out window, you watch the buildings go by as you travel off somewhere away from your home. As your mind finally caught up to present time you turned to the long-haired butler that dragged you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d you began not knowing where to start, seeing you were so suddenly pulled out of a life you were custom to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, how rude of me. My name is Sai and I\u2019ll be tailoring your clothes, Master.\u201d Sai, you finally had a name to put to the man that frisked you and yanked you into a car in your stated of confusion. He was a tailor, so maybe he was caressing you to figure out your measurements? That made sense, but you were still confused about a bunch of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Sai, where are we going? And what exactly is going on here?\u201d You asked hoping to get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d From there on Sai began to explain the whole situation. Uncle Lucas\u2019s dying and leaving his fortune, mansion, and estate all to you. Your parents and he were on good terms though you only met him once you remembered at your parents\u2019 funeral. You remember you parents talk very fondly of him. He even offered to take you in when they died but you denied. At the time, you were reluctance to leave the area you where you grew up with your parents. The black limousine came to a stop outside of a huge mansion. You thought just riding in limo was amazing, this place was way beyond this. The thought of living there was mind-blowing. The door of the vehicle opened and Sai gesturing you out shook from you star struck state. As he get out you meet the eyes of the chauffeur, thuggish looking man probably older than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are at your destination, Master,\u201d he greet you formally enough despite his looks. You went about to nod your head and thank him when he suddenly wrapped an arm around your waist pulled you into close quarters with him. \u201cMy name is Taiga, and I wanted to see up close since I saw walking into the apartment building.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were certain that this one was not a misunderstanding, like with Sai especially with those lustful eyes gazing into yours. You were at a lost of words again, you were not prepare for these kind interactions that you were having today.\u2026 As you try to say anything he felt his hand on you butt. He gave it a squeeze and you nearly jumped out of your skin. Taiga face was getting dangerously close to yours; this whole thing was just going way too fast\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You put your hands on his rather trim chest and tried push yourself away but he just held you still and kept coming in. It look like he wasn\u2019t going to take no as an answer and you didn\u2019t have the power to stop him. Luckily you didn\u2019t need to this time. You saw Sai\u2019s open hand slap the chauffeur from his chin to his lips and it sounded painful. You were let go off the moment of impact and the thuggish man held his face in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!!! That hurt, Sai!\u201d Taiga growled as he cupped his mouth with made his words a bit muffled.

Was he encouraging him to come on to you again?!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk,\u201d he clicked his tongue as he return to a normal stand. He had a red handprint on his face. \u201cYeah, yeah\u2026 Don\u2019t worry milord. I know it just hard to admit when you like it.\u201d He threw you a wink that you didn\u2019t know how to respond to. It was guarantee this will be a recurring event while you were living here.

His bark is worse than his bite, so feel free to give him a smack if he getting too aggressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d Hearing him tell you that put you at a bit of ease but you weren\u2019t sure if you could do it\u2026 But with your chaste in danger you better muster some courage to protect yourself\u2026. \u201cThanks for the help, I owe you one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou owe me one, huh?\u201d a smirk came across his face and there was deviousness in his voice as Sai said those words.

The ceilings were high and the hanging golden chandler that lit the room gave the front area a very spacious and fancy appearance. Your entire apartment room could easily fit between the front door and the stairs. And this was only a small part of the building\u2026 This huge mansion now belonged to you\u2026\u2026 You simply didn\u2019t feel like you belong anywhere near this place with your plain peasant clothes. Then there was Sai whose flamboyance looks made him fit perfectly in these surrounding\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour silent observation of the area got disturbed all the sudden. Your stomach growled loudly and you only reaction was wrapped you arms around you concave belly. You still hadn\u2019t eaten anything since early this morning\u2026 All of the excitements made you forget you were famished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungry I see,\u201d Sai amusedly chuckled before stopping to think about something, \u201cKei wanted me to bring you directly to him when you arrived, but there\u2019s no need to starve you. Let\u2019s get you some food from the kitchen~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooking your arm again and with pep in his Sai began to lead you down a series of hallways very quickly\u2026 You finding the entrance again by yourself would be impossible, but as a delicious smell entered your nose\u2026 you didn\u2019t even care about anything else. It was a grand dinning room you were brought to. There was a long table with a stylish tablecloth, candles placed on it for decoration and classy and comfy looking chairs. The whole table could probably hold over twenty people with its grand size. As you were walked up to the table you noticed that the chairs were made for a person of a much greater girth. It could probably fit four of you in it comfortably. Sai sat you down in the middle of a large chair as he continued across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ryu, bring out some food\u2026\u201d The flamboyant tailor, called into a small window before glancing back at you. \u201cAnd make it extra nutritional.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment made you look down at yourself. You had to admit\u2026 those years surviving with little has caused you to have a skinny, underweight built\u2026 As you rubbed your sides you could feel your ribs\u2026 Is this what Sai felt when he touched you earlier\u2026? He did call you bony\u2026 A little extra nutrition in your diet couldn\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour food\u201d A tall man in a chef outfit rather plainly said as he set a plate of food in front of you. Firstly the plate itself of giant but then it had food densely packed on it. You didn\u2019t even know when you last saw so much food at once. It smelled wonderful, you stomach let out another growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the food, Ryu\u201d You thanked the man and you were about to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Ryujin.\u201d He corrected you and it then got quiet. This time you noticed that there was a bit of an intimidating air about the guy despite the few words he said. He silent stare was making you a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Ryujin\u201d you spoke back after sudden awkward moment of silence. It seemed to make him happy to hear you said that. He nodded back at you, which was an okay to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach grumbling once again in protest and you finally took your first bite of the food. You were nearly in tears, it was so delicious! Seasoned to perfection and very flavorful\u2026 it has been so long since you ate real food. You seriously started digging in; stuffing your mouth full, like you were always told not to but you just couldn\u2019t stop yourself. You did manage to not lose all of your table manners as you still used the silverware to cut and eat the meal. You polished the whole huge plate in only minutes. You got every little crumble from the plate into your mouth, but even after eating that much you wanted more\u2026 It was definitely from you not eating much. Oh, how you yearned for more of that food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the food it was incredibly delicious! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had such a wonderful meal\u2026 Would it be alright for me to have seconds?\u201d You complimented and then asked. It made Sai laugh for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes of course, you are the master. You can eat as much as you like.\u201d Sai answered you, still chuckling. He told Ryujin to bring you another helping. You were the master\u2026 you could probably get real used to that\u2026</span></div></div>",

You were really feeling like such a glutton gobbling down all that food. It was so good you just couldn\u2019t stop. It was rather strange urge\u2026 You just put off as you overdoing it since it has been so long that you ate such good food. As you lean back in the huge seat and rubbed your belly you were about to start a conversation with Sai when you heard the door opened across the room. Shortly after that you turned to meet the steely expression of another guy in a butler outfit. He had such a cold, unfeeling look in his eyes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d his voice was as cold as his expression.

He was a little chubby but that seem to add to his childlike, cutesy persona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith him there was quite an interest bunch of guys living here and really help you relax a bit even with Taiga constantly making passes at you. You, who once worked two-three manual labor jobs now just had to do desk work and you still could eat well\u2026 And boy you were eating well. A large breakfast brought to you in bed, big lunch in the middle of your work, a huge dinner afterwards and lots of snacks in-between. It was all so delicious you just couldn\u2019t stop stuffing yourself beyond full. Overeating was really becoming a habit of yours\u2026 you never knew how weak you were to the temptations of scrumptious food. In short amount of time you had gain weight though your weight was about normal for your height now. Although you tell yourself it\u2019s just a little bloated your belly seems to be starting to protrude out a bit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you were reading some agreement contract for a chain of restaurants your Uncle left for you. It was good you took an economic class back in high school but too bad you barely passed it with a B. It was a bit confusing; you would have to talk with the advisor about this. As you continued to read, you were stuffing cookies into your mouth. You had already finished off one large platter of them and started on a second. You had to hand it to Ryujin, he was a top chef. How he could make fudge cookies with white chocolate chips this appetizing, you\u2019ll never know. All you know for certain was everything that he made had so much flavor it exploded on your taste buds. Because of that you were always eager to feast on anything he made. And once you started you didn\u2019t stop until it was all gone. This kind of eating problem was new to you so you didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. So you just kept putting it off to worry about other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the document to the side as you finished off the last cookie. Licking you fingers clean, you then began to massage your stomach. It was such a pleasurably relief for your stuffed belly.

The real question though was, why was he wearing that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really busy right now,\u201d The cross-dressing tailor asked normally without a single change in his attitude. You shook your head and smile grew on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s good because your tailored clothes are ready. Come to my work area!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he grabbed and pulled you off, it was quite the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment. As he forced along you couldn\u2019t help but take another looked at his outfit: a short frilly and lacey maid dress skirt above the knees, white knee high socks and Mary Jane shoes. He really went all out with his maid uniform costume, and though it was a bit weird it didn\u2019t really bother you. It actually really quite fit him\u2026 In Sai\u2019s workroom you waited as he went through several sets of clothing of all sizes. He seems to have clothes for the other residences\u2026 By the smaller lengthwise clothes, a lot belong to Megumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of a wait, Sai finally return to you with his creation in hand. As you saw it you couldn\u2019t help but stare. Your clothes are\u2026</span></div></div>",

That only made the work itself more uncomfortable then it already was. Today you'd just surveyed a bit to see how much paint you would need and to give the woman a good estimate of cost. You'd started this business in the hopes of finally making enough money to support yourself and pay off your student loans. You had a degree in business but you hadn't been able to find a job in the field right off the bat and you had to do something. <br>\r\n   You came home to your small apartment that afternoon exhausted. Your head had kept you up all night and you'd had to work early that morning. All you wanted to do was take a shower and hopefully take a nap, if you could fall asleep properly this time. You came in and peeled your muddy work boots off by the door and went straight to the bathroom, the rest of your clothes following once you were in there with the door shut. You examined yourself in the full body mirror, as you usually did before a shower. Your figure was thin, almost unhealthy. Despite no longer being a college student, you still ate like one, your cabinet containing mostly Ramen noodles and boxes of Kraft mac and cheese since you didn't have many customers and plenty of bills to pay. \"I guess the college diet doesn't make you fat after all.\" You chuckled a bit. You hadn't expected anyone to say anything as you lived alone but sure enough...<br>\r\n   \"But living in the lap of luxury might.\" A second masculine voice made you jump out of your skin. \"What the hell are you doing in my apartment!?\" You said angrily after a second. \"I have a gun in here.\" You were lying through your teeth but you hoped it would make any burglar turn tail and run. \"I have a key. You gave your uncle one when you bought the apartment and he gave it to me to come get you. I'm your chauffeur.\" The man explained without fear, the gun comment not affecting him at all. \"How did he give you the key if he's dead? He died a month ago, I was at his funeral.\" You were slowly putting on your clothes again as you spoke. \"He gave it to me before he died. I'm a member of the new staff at his estate, which you've inherited.\" <br>\r\n   You took a second to think about that as you came out of the bathroom, dressed again. The man was sitting on your living room couch, which you could see from the bathroom. You felt under-dressed in your jeans and slightly wrinkled work shirt compared to his perfectly pressed suit and slacks, even his shoes were polished a shiny black. \"You are a beauty, I wouldn't mind even if you were fat.\" He chuckled. His comment threw you, you weren't used to being flirted with at first sight. \"Uh yes well I suppose we should get going then to my uncle's estate.\" You try to brush it off but you're sure that you have at least a slight blush to your cheeks. You put on a pair of sneakers, and with that, he leads you out with your arm under his like a gentlemen and you step into the back of the black limousine he's driving. Before he took off, he lowered the window. \"I'm Taiga by the way, and it is an absolute pleasure to meet you, Master.\" He flashed you an impish grin before starting the car and driving.</span></div></div>",

It only takes about a half hour to get there, and that flies by while you chat, especially with Taiga throwing in surprise compliments all the way through. You had to admit you kinda liked the flirting, it made you feel special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe estate was giant, and when you walked into the brilliantly decorated foyer you were pretty sure your entire apartment fit in just this one room and you couldn't stop a \"Wow...\" from leaving your mouth, making your chauffeur chuckle. \"You've never been in a place like this, have you?\" You shook your head and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cute. You'll get used to it. After all it is all yours now. Your uncle left you everything, even his exotic animal farms he has all over the world. His personal favorites of course though are in this mansion. But you won't have to worry about that. Keichi takes care of all the feeding and cleaning.\" Taiga smiled and pinched your ass, making you blush, but you didn't know how to respond to it otherwise. Thankfully someone did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taiga! I swear to god you can't meet someone for 5 seconds before you're hitting on them!\" A firm man in a suit was walking towards them and he smacked him across the cheek. \"I apologize, Master. If he causes you any more trouble, let me know. I'm Keichi, the butler. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" Even though the words coming out of his mouth were pleasant, his tone was cold. \"It's nice to meet you too.\" You were a bit unnerved by his attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a much happier person walked in, almost the complete opposite of Keichi. \"Oh I missed you coming in, dang. I wanted to meet you first. Oh well I suppose I'll settle for second.\" He practically skipped over with a tape measure. \"I'm Sai, your tailor! It's sweet to meet you, Master.\" You almost laughed at his cuteness as he measured you. You'd actually thought he was a woman for a second before closer inspection. He paused as he wrapped the measure around your stomach and you felt a little embarrassed. \"I know I'm underweight, but its not that bad.\" You chuckle to try to lighten the situation. \"Of course not, Master. It's nothing a trip to the kitchen can't solve! You have a world class chef!\" He said encouragingly, obviously picking up on your awkwardness and trying to make you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" You mouth to him and he whispers. \"You're welcome. I didn't mean to make you feel bad.\" He smiled. You were already liking your new servants, well most of them anyway.</span></div></div>",

It was a really good drama playing that you would probably only watch once since you didn\u2019t watch TV a lot and keeping up with drama after missing a few episodes was impossible. The main female protagonist was crying over the bleeding, unconscious body of her boyfriend injured after a car accident. She was crying and screaming over and over again for him not to leave her. You were starting to tear up yourself as the memory of you long departed parents crept into your head. You grabbed the heart-shaped locket hanging around your neck; it was the last gift they gave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the door pulled you away from the drama and the emotional state you were in. You put the TV on mute and gave your teary eyes a rub as opened the door. Once your hand left your eyes, you were staring straight at a tall thug. You felt in danger and your instant response was to quickly slam the door and lock it. Your attempt to do so didn\u2019t work as the street punk grabbed the door and stopped it from closing. No matter how hard you pushed with your full body it was not budging. Just one forceful pushed from the other side of the door send you sailing backwards, and all you could do was look into his green eyes frightfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Don\u2019t hurt me!!! I don\u2019t have anything of worth to take but you can take whatever you want! I only have a little cash on me but you\u2019re free to have that too!!!\u201d You immediately blurted out things you thought he wanted to hear out of fear. His face showed no new emotions as he approached you. Your body was shaking uncontrollably as you stupidly backed yourself into a wall. One arm went to the side of your head and his body came in close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can take whatever I want, you say\u2026 Then I\u2019ll take you.\u201d The red-haired thug sexily whispered that to you as he softly caresses your cheek. There was aroused looked in his eyes and you remained frozen as you just stared into his eyes. You were suddenly confessed to by a thug and now you couldn\u2019t help but notice how good looking he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis warm, slim fingers moved down to your lips before he gently stroked them with his thumb. His lips were puckered as he moved in for a kiss. Your course of action was to clamp your mouth close and to tightly close your eyes\u2026 a brilliant plan\u2026 for a three year old. You were just afraid of resisting and angering him\u2026 or so you told yourself. You were waiting to feel his lips on yours any second\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch,\u201d the man suddenly yelped and you slowly opened an eye to peek. The redhead was holding the back of his head and standing behind him was a pale black-haired man. What really caught your attention was that he was wearing a full butler outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have known better than to bring you, Taiga\u201d he plainly stated as pushed up his glasses. His eyes turned to you and gave you a cold stare that was far scarier than the thuggish person you were just dealing with. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2026.. the niece of the late Master Lucas, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that is my name, I did have an uncle named Lucas\u2026\u201d You remember hearing about Uncle Lucas passing, but you didn\u2019t go funeral\u2026 after your parents\u2019 it was really just unbearable to go see another sad burying your remaining family members.

Apparently he had left had his entire fortune, this mansion, his business, everything to you\u2026 it was all a little hard to believe but there it was in black and white. All of these was now yours, and free for you to use however you please\u2026 whatever that might be. You were too accustomed to living with just enough money to live somewhat comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the very uncomfortable conversation Keichi, the pale butler began to lead you to the Dining Hall to meet the other people that worked here. While you were walking in complete silence, you glance around at the hanging art and decorations that filled the sides of the hall. You were getting really nervous about meeting everyone\u2026 if the other people, other than Taiga, were as stiff and proper as Keichi, you don\u2019t know how you would manage it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here\u201d the ever aloof butler announced and you took a deep breath as you followed behind him. You spotted the three of them standing by the table. Taiga was among the group waiting for you. With them side by side, it made the different between them obvious. They were all different in both shapes and sizes. \u201cWhere is Ryujin?\u201d Keichi asked the group, it looked like there was one member not present at the gathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s finishing up in the kitchen,\u201d the taller guy you didn\u2019t know informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, let begin anyways. Everyone this is the new master of the house.\u201d He introduced you still with that uncaring tone of voice. It was safe to say even among his fellow staff member he still had that icy cold attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Um hello\u2026 I\u2019ll be staying here now\u2026\u2026 Please take care of me.\u201d You nervously greeted everyone with a deep bow. Oh man, you were super tense\u2026 What kind of people were they? Would hate they that you were their new master? Everything was so uncertain\u2026 it was nerve-racking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Megumi\u201d smallest person of the group spoke first. \u201cI\u2019m the gardener, so if you want any pretty flowers or something I\u2019m your guy.\u201d Megumi was tiny little blond thing in height but his built was largest of the group. He was plump all over but his was round belly and forming mobs were the most noticeable in the shirt that was looking a bit tight. You weren\u2019t sure if it was because he was short and chubby but look like a grade school student, a very cute elementary kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep your flowers to yourself, shrimp if the little princess wants flowers I\u2019ll get for her personally,\u201d Taiga spoke suddenly as he jealously glare at Megumi. The man walked up to you and grabbed you hand, and shrank away a bit as he did so. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take real good care of you~\u201d He cooed and it made your heart beat and this time wasn\u2019t out of fear. You earlier learn that he was your chauffeur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now Taiga, don\u2019t hog the new Master all for yourself,\u201d the next guy spoke up and pretty much snatch you out of Taiga\u2019s grip. He had long silky brown hair and soft facial features that were feminine. When it came to his built, he was thinner Keichi\u2026 almost skinnier than you and you don\u2019t really eat well. \u201cHello Master, my name is Sai and I\u2019m a tailor. I\u2019ll make you lots of pretty outfits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hands off she\u2019s mine.\u201d Again your thuggish crush growled, this time at that the tailor and swiftly separated the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be selfish, we all want to know Master better.\u201d Sai retorted back teasingly with a big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I want to be good friends with Master, too\u201d Megumi also added his statement though his was much sincere sounding than Sai\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeside\u2026got to put my hands all over to get her measurement.\u201d The brown-haired man mention continuing his teasing tone and it set Taiga off. The two when back and forth arguing over you, surprising it made the atmosphere less suffocating. You felt better knowing it wasn\u2019t going to be some cold master and servant thing going on here. You laughed in relief at Taiga and Sai little verbal battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Master finally smiled\u201d the small gardener pointed out with a chirp in his voice, \u201cIt\u2019s really nice you should smile more.\u201d With that statement the two other guys stopped to stare at your face. It was pretty embarrassing having them all staring at you suddenly, but at least you weren\u2019t too nervous and tense anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re finally here,\u201d Keichi spoke again and it startled you a bit. You forgot he was here with all the liveliness in front of you. \u201cThis is the new master.\u201d You followed his eyes to meet the dark eyes of a tall man, taller than everyone else, in a chef uniform. It may have been his tall stature there was an intimidating air coming from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Ryujin.\u201d The guy clearly stated and didn\u2019t look like he was going to say anything else. He continued to silently stare at you. All you think of to do was bow your head and throw him a friendly smile. He just nodded his head back at you. You finally notice the silver platter his hand that you\u2019ve only seen in movies. He place the plate on the table before he plainly saying, \u201cDinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his eyes didn\u2019t leave you, you assumed that was your food. You moved to the table and sat in the seat in front it. You couldn\u2019t help but notice how comfortable and big the chair was, three people could probably fit in it with no problem. As the top came off the platter, the wondrous smell filled your nose. It also looked just as delicious. You couldn\u2019t remember the last time you had a meal that look this good. You were almost drooling over it. You wanted to dig in right away, but that would be rude before everyone got food.

You just glance at the ones that remain for their response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, since I finally got Taiga here I can finally get those measurements I need.\u201d And with that Sai grabbed him and began dragging him off with much complain from the` redhead. But before leaving, he did call back, \u201cWe\u2019ll join you afterwards if you still here~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that it left you with Ryujin and the tall man shook his head no say about not eating right now and Megumi.

You were full after the one and ended just watch the gardener happily stuffed his face. It was pretty obvious how he got that pudgy belly with such a hearty appetite.

Even at your limit you poor tendency told you not to waste food\u2026 You were pretty much was staring down a fork full of cake as you tried to decide to force it down or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t finish your cake, Master?\u201d Megumi asked after finishing his cake with no problem.

When you got it close enough to the chubby blond he munched right over the fork.

It must be because he was so cute especially when he was enjoying himself. You got another forkful of the chocolate cake for him. \u201cHere you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to feed him bite after bite of the dessert and the delight you felt didn\u2019t diminish at all. If nothing else it was more elating every time. You never fed a guy like this before and Megumi looked like a little baby bird begging his mommy for more food. Since he seemed to like it just as much as you, you didn\u2019t see a reason to stop. You were so engrossed into it that you didn\u2019t notice the door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the <b>HELL</b> is going on here?!?\u201d a very familiar voice surprisingly shouted while you were mid feeding Megumi the last of the cake.

You were seriously starting to fear for the life of you and Megumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFood\u201d Ryojin, the tall silent man, suddenly entered with trays in hand. It was almost like he couldn\u2019t feel the tense air in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d the redhead growled as he swiftly took off, leaving his anger circulating through the dining hall. You thought your heart was going to stop. Sai walked over looking rather amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my you sure work fast~\u201d he chuckled and winked at you. Your face turned red as he realize was he was insinuated. You shook your head rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026 not that\u2026 It\u2019s just-\u2026 I wanted-\u201d Flustered, you were unable form a sentence so you were just stammering words like an idiot. You finally just shut up covered your face in embarrassment. You don\u2019t why it was so appealing\u2026 you just couldn\u2019t stop yourself from feeding the hungry baby bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaaaiii~ Stop teasing her! You got her all self-conscious!\u201d Megumi raised his voice and scolded the long-haired man. Much to your surprised but it wasn\u2019t enough to get you to stop hiding your burning red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry couldn\u2019t help but mess with the new master bit. She has such nice expressive face.\u201d Sai admitted with his apologized\u2026 He was surely a spirited person. He didn\u2019t seem to mean anything bad with his statement. It was just a sign of affection for him. You finally stopped hiding your face and find Megumi\u2019s really closed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, Master, this was fun! We should do this again.\u201d His smiling face still smeared with chocolate made you feel so much better. You also really enjoyed the time the two of you spent together. You nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally!\u201d You smiled widely as you agreed with him. You and Megumi had quickly become friends in the short time you both knew each other.

You never spent so much time studying and with Keichi always checking up on you, it was impossible to escape even if you wanted to. But, since it was serious affair you did everything in the best of your ability to get things right. You really liked living in this mansion with everyone even with all their little quirks. So you did your best to stay in good terms and keep this way of living alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough every break you could get you would grab some sweet snacks and meet up with Megumi in the yard and feed him. It was like a horrible addiction that you could not get over nor wanted to end. The little gardener accepted it and would let you stuff him full of delicious goodies. There were some changes in him though it was still relatively small. You noticed that the blond seem to have gotten a bit chubbier. His clothes surly were looking tighter and every time he raised his arms his belly would peek out a bit at the bottom. His belly just seemed to stick out more, but you weren\u2019t sure if it was just your imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that you enjoy his expression and watching his stomach grow out as you added more food into it. You wanted to squeeze it and feel the belly in your hands, but you also felt like it would be too weird to do. The fact that you had that thought at all was strange, so you tried your best to suppress it. You were doing well on that so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour break time has arrived and you grabbed your armful of sweets and started headed straight to the garden where Megumi would be. You had lots of tasty cookies today to stuff him silly with. You were really thrill to do it.

You knew it would only upset him more \u201cGreat weather we\u2019ve been having lately, huh\u2026\u201d Your attempt to change to subject was quickly overthrown as Taiga walking up to you made you back into the wall\u2026 You needed to stop doing that every time he approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing great at all, my master too busy giving all her time to someone else,\u201d the man that looked like a street punk told her with dejected sound in his voice. It made you feel bad when he put it that way\u2026 \u201cIf you want me to feel better, forget about Megumi and stay with me.\u201d And there was his flirty side again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but it makes him happy when I bring him snacks\u2026 and feed him\u2026\u201d It was a plus that it made the blond gardener happy too but you really just wanted to fill those chubby cheeks with the food. Those green eyes stared intently at you before he suddenly took a cookie from you and he bite it in half before offering it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake me happy\u2026 feed me, Master\u201d the way Taiga said that and looked at you made your body quiver\u2026 it was a foreign feeling. To you, he was like an overly affectionate puppy who desperately wanted your attention. You honestly felt like you have been neglecting him\u2026 But then there was your hungry baby bird waiting for you to feed it. Should you abandon him for the puppy? Oh this was such a difficult decision and someone wasn\u2019t going to be happy in the end\u2026</span></div></div>",

And like a dog he ate it out of your and even giving you a little lick which made to jolt a bit. Those hunger eyes of his begged for more. You pulled out another and you stared at his face as he chewed and shallow it\u2026 It was different than the gleeful expression of Megumi, yet it made you heart pound just the same. Did you just enjoy feeding others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fed several cookies to Taiga in the hallway before entering the closest room, which just happen to be the library. Maybe he could sense your excitement because he was getting quite enthusiastic. So with every bite he ate, it gradually was more enjoyable.  Three-fourth through the cookies you could tell Taiga was getting full, yet he continue on anyways. There was much difficult for those last two cookies but he did it. Your eyes looked to his midsection that was bulging out lot compare to his once flat belly. It wasn\u2019t soft and jiggly looking like the Megumi's but you still wanted to feel it in your hands.

It encouraged you to rub it more and more. You stroked his belly until finally realizing you were late getting back from your break. You left him and returned back to a very unhappy butler\u2026 You next break was taken away so you worked all the way up to dinner.

He still seemed a bit upset but he went for it\u2026 and was intercepted. \u201cTaiga!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s was for me!!!\u201d whined Megumi as he furious glared at the taller man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTough luck, do me favor and eat your own food you fat little pig.\u201d sneered Taiga as he returned the angry look back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the gauntlet was thrown as the two furiously bickered back and forth over. The rage was so overwhelming even for Ryujin who did not leave the kitchen to bring Taiga\u2019s food like he would usually do. Your head whipped between the two as they argue over which one of them you would be feeding for now on\u2026 the atmosphere was so intense you didn\u2019t know what to do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust calm down, I\u2019ll feed both of you!!!\u201d You screamed and they both got quiet probably because this was the first time you raised your voice and demanded something. \u201cSit down and patiently wait your turn.\u201d Surprisingly they obey and quietly sat down as you fed each a bite. You actually ended up feeding them most of your food as well as their own and dessert.

You also had cases in which they would visit you in day or after dinner and have you feed them. It was mostly a Taiga thing as he seemed extremely jealous of any attention you gave to the little gardener. He even started to eat larger portion of food to get extra long feeding session. Megumi noticed that and he did the same. It was a constant rivalry to see who could eat the most. It was headache but it was still your odd passion that you enjoyed doing despite that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks went by, and geez they felt long\u2026 in that time you were some drastic changes, especially in Taiga. He went from a nice flat, somewhat tone stomach to a small potbelly of fat. It was so noticeable in everything he wore, just a lump above his waist. But that wasn\u2019t all, his butt also looking huge in those pants of his. It even looked like it bounced when he walked\u2026 not that you spent a lot of time staring at his butt or anything\u2026 His chest was perking up a bit showing signs of turning into small boobs and his face was also starting to round out. The best part of this was that Taiga would want you to rub his belly and you had the opportunity to feel is soft plushy, flesh. It felt so good in you hands. You had an impossible time stopping yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumi had also packed on quite a bit of weight; his little chubby belly was noticeably larger by at least one-to-two inches bigger. It drooped over his waist especially when his pants were too tight. The gardener certainly had some serious man boobs going on; they bounced along with his belly. Most of his clothes could not contain his new weight leaving his stomach expose no matter how much he pulled and tugged and his pants looked like they were going to burst. His face was plump and when he looked down a distinct double chin would appear. For some reason it was incredibly cute on the little blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two guys weight gain you found your eyes would follow them as the walked by\u2026 and you would sometimes look at them too long. You were slowly starting to realize that maybe you like that kind of thing\u2026 but you still mostly remained in denial about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lunch time now and you were feeding your growing puppy and baby bird, with all the food they wanted to eat it was taken awhile\u2026 a little too long because here came Keichi, the ice prince that he was when you met him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, you spent enough time here. You have projects to work on,\u201d His cold statement pulled you away from you lovely stuffing session with Megumi and Taiga. But his icy stare still got you listen to whatever he told you. You nodded and left after saying goodbye to the two men. \u201cYou really should stop spoiling them so much. It\u2019s distracting you, too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u201d you sighed, but even if it was a bit bothersome with their little feud you looked forward to feeding them. \u201cI should just feed you, huh.\u201d You jokingly said that believing he would just ignore the stupid joke all together. Like he tended to do with most conversation you tried to start with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is what Master wants, you can feed me,\u201d he replied seriously as he still continued walking normally. You just stared wondering if he would laugh it off or something but then you remembered who you were talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was kidding\u2026\u201d you tried to explain but he didn\u2019t acknowledge that statement at all\u2026 Oh you just started something, didn\u2019t you\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that you were safe as it was works like always when you were around Keichi. You were going through document and written statements, this was normal for you now that you\u2019ve been doing it for about a month. As you were looking over one of the papers about the company about making plus size clothing, Keichi approached with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026? Food, I\u2019m not really hungry.\u201d It was weird thing for him to do suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt not for that. Master said she wanted to feed me.\u201d Keichi stated normally as he set the food on the desk in front of you. While you were still flabbergasted he grabbed a chair and sat right next to you. He looked completely serious about this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just joking!\u201d Sharp eyes of the butler kept staring at you\u2026 he wasn\u2019t going to accepted that explanation. Keichi just sat there looking at you, waiting for you to begin\u2026 you didn\u2019t know what you should do other than what he wanted you to do\u2026 Getting a piece, you held it to his mouth. He bit it and slowly chewed it. Bespectacled man expression didn\u2019t change at all but once more just watching those thin lips take the food and his jaw move up and down chewing it and swallowing it  was all that you need to make you happy\u2026 You seriously were starting to believe that you had a feeding fetish or something\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to hold out food and let him eat it from you. Your eyes just watched closely as he ate. Unlike the other two, there wasn\u2019t a mountain of food so you got through it fairly quickly. His prim outfit didn\u2019t poke out with belly stuffed with food disappointingly enough\u2026 he probably just need just a little more food for that to happen... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that to your satisfaction, Master?\u201d Keichi emotionlessly said as those icy brown-eyes looked at you. As you locked eyes, the words came out\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several more weeks passed by and you continue your feeding on now three of your loyal servants. You had become quicker and more competent at business. At least according to Keichi. He was able to spend more time as an actual butler than like your secretary. He still would visit periodically to check your work and to let you stuff him full of food. Despite his unchanging expression, he seemed to enjoy eating sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance it seems Keichi remain unchanged under his typical butler suit. You thought at he was immune to your stuffings with the lack of noticeable change with the passing days. But then you caught him in Sai\u2019s tailoring room getting his pants let out. And you saw a little lump in his stomach area. Now when you really look you could see some tension in the midsection of his outfit. You couldn\u2019t wait until it became obvious by glance. You had learn to accepted your feeding and fat fetish by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause you were so much better at managing your late uncle\u2019s business you had more free time. So you were off to gather more food to feed both Megumi and Taiga. They had both gotten even bigger since the time you started feeding Keichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumi\u2019s belly was like a big beach ball when stuffed, reaching out far in front of him. His thighs had become wider and were now press closely together. His moobs had gotten noticeably bigger. He was starting to look spherical as he continue to grow outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Megumi\u2019s overall weight gain was tiny when compared with Taiga who beg your attention at every available time. He had pretty much double in size in a little over a month time. His belly and butt saw the most growth stretching the limits of his older clothes. They bubbled out big &amp; round and bounce with his every movement. His chest poked out a little more but remain rather small. His once chiseled facial feature, they had rounded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would probably eat even more food if he learn about you also feeding Keichi\u2026 Taiga\u2019s jealousy would be really cute if he wasn\u2019t so possessive. It kind of made you want to put him above all the others, but Megumi also looked so forward to you feeding him and you couldn\u2019t bear to let him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the kitchen to pick up some fresh requested food items you found yourself face to face with Ryujin. While you knew he wasn\u2019t a bad person, how he quietly appears to loom over you was intimidating. You greet him with a smile and he acknowledge it by nodding his head back. That was your normal interaction you had with him. While you wanted to take the food and go; you also suddenly felt like maybe this would be a good time to get to know him better\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You, Hitomi Uharu, were feeling a little overwhelmed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing your parents at fifteen was a terrible blow, but an unknown benefactor had kept you in good stead. After all this time, you learned that the benefactor in question was your Mum's brother, your Uncle Iori. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, before you ever had a chance to meet him in person, he too had passed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the writings he'd left you, you learned that your Mum's branch of the family had been rather wealthy, and her family most certainly did not approve of her marriage to a commoner. She'd been cut off, but Iori had ignored the will of his father and helped his sister out whenever and however he could. After the accident that claimed your parent's lives, he'd paid to keep you afloat while fighting to become your legal guardian, a fight made more difficult by your grandfather's lawyers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIori had been diagnosed with cancer and died less then a month ago. This might have been the end of the story, except for one thing; he'd named you sole beneficiary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIori had diversified from the main family and become quite successful in his own right, and no matter how bitter your grandfather was, even his legal staff couldn't block Iori's last will and testament. He had, quite simply, given you a multi-million dollar shipping company as a final parting gift, as well as the mansion you now found yourself in, its (rather unusual) staff, and a spot in Hideki Academy, one of the most prestigious schools in the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe board would operate the company in your stead until you came of age, and Iori had given only a single instruction:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hitomi, I wish I could have been more in your life then a mere name on a cheque, but such is not the path Fate wrote for us. I never married, and never had any children of own. My work was my life, and that I leave to you, my unknown darling. I ask only one thing, and that is that you keep the company. Maintain and expand it as you see fit. I've no doubt that you'll do splendidly, my dear. You may feel small now, but with time and effort, you shall grow into your role. Your parents and I will watch over you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd shed a few tears over that final missive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so here you were, now 17 years old, having lived in the manor for the last few weeks. School would be back in session on Monday, and your story picks up on the Saturday before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting at your make-up table in your bedroom, dressed in a loose fitting nightie. Your stomach was in knots as your nerves were completely on edge. With school starting on Monday, you would be heading out to the mall for your uniform. Sai, your tailor, had been very put out when he learned that his creations wouldn't be worn on campus, but the academy had a very strict uniform policy, necessitating a trip to pick a few up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite frankly, you were scared beyond words. In a relatively short amount of time, you went from losing everything to being a millionaire heiress, and once done with college, you'd be the head of the one of the largest import/export companies in the country. Actually, scared didn't quite do the feeling justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't think I can do this.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't left to your thoughts for very long, and you turned towards your bedroom door as the massive walnut entryway creaked open. Keichi, your young head butler, entered without warning. Always a punctual man, you checked your cell phone on your desk, and sure enough, it was 7:01 am exactly. His sense for time and lack of sense for personal space was the primary reason you were wearing the nightie, as the man had had no qualms walking in when you were in a state of undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken far longer then you cared to think about to convince him you could dress yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was accompanied by Ryuujin, your personal chef. Neither man was given to excessive words, but Ryuujin was certainly the more talkative of the two. His appearance was certainly fearsome. His arms were like tree trunks, and his well developed pecs stretched his white uniform to its limits. A large scar ran down his face, bisecting his left eyebrow and running down, stopping a few centimeters past his lower lip. He had so far refused to say anything on the scar, not that you'd had the nerve to ask anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuujin was pushing the cart that undoubtedly contained your breakfast, and as the two came close, Ryuujin let out a wide, pleasant smile. Keichi couldn't have been any further from his unlikely compatriot if he tried. Cool, aloof, and distant, he came within a few paces, and gave a small bow with his right hand held across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your breakfast is served, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny, black haired young man stood straight as Ryuujin lifted the silver lid off the platter. Your eyes widened and you let out a small gasp at the spread before you. <i>\"That's way too much food!\"</i> you thought as you eyed the massive spread before you. French toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs, waffles, muffins, cinnamon buns and more, all were served on the large silver platter. The fact that you could make out the edge of a second cart in the hallway made you wonder just how much food Ryuujin had prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been one thing that had stood out since you moved in here, and that was just how much food was always present at mealtimes. Your chef always made far more then any person could ever eat, and he definitely seemed to favor sweet foods and pastries, as these featured heavily at every meal. Your staff refused to eat at the same time as you did, which had made you very self conscious initially. But it had smelled so good and tasted even better, and you'd managed to overcome that hump for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, having people standing around watching you eat remained an unusual sensation, and there was always so much. Ryuujin always said it was to make sure that \"Little Miss\" never went hungry, and that you didn't have to eat more then you wanted. It still conspired to be an uncomfortable prospect, and you often caught yourself wondering if it was rude not to at least sample each dish, or if eating so little of such a big meal was also rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryuujin, I've said before that you don't need to make so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese chef smiled, \"Apologizes, Little Miss. Once more, I seem to have gotten carried away. Simply enjoy what you need, and I shall deal with the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lower lip apprehensively. Your meals had been so opulent since you came here that you were worried about getting fat. But it all smelled so good, you were somewhat hungry despite your nerves, and it would be very rude to accept nothing after Ryuujin did all this work. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh Gods... why....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean back and rub your overfilled and tightly packed stomach. Your abdomen has no give to it whatsoever, though after what you'd just stuffed in there, you didn't wonder why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all of Ryuujin's work, you just couldn't turn down the offered fare. Likewise, though, you couldn't eat all of it either. And so you'd decided to sample it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd taken at least a mouthful from every individual dish, and some considerably more then that. Of course the first cart he'd brought in had been loaded with every sugary treat your overactive sweet tooth desired, and your willpower was sorely lacking where such things were concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd made an entire loaf of bread into tiramisu french toast, though you'd limited yourself to three slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small stack of Oreo cookie pancakes loaded with chocolate chips had quickly followed suit, and you'd happily chewed the delectable morsels down with a soft coo of enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you'd had one of Ryuujin's homemade cinnamon buns. They were sinfully rich, and while you'd intended to only eat a bite, they were so, so good. Before you'd realized it, you'd finished the one bun in its entirety, and had taken a mouthful of a second. A little embarrassed at your lack of either control or awareness, you still finished the bun since you'd already bitten into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you were already aware of just how full you were getting. Despite using the offered cutlery, your hands were still slightly sticky, and you were aware of some crumbs that had dropped down and stuck to the front of your nightie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already felt so full, and your lower lip quivered a bit with dread as Ryuujin pushed in a second cart, which had been loaded even higher with fatty breakfast foods, and you weren't yet finished with the first one. Still, you'd decided to try one of everything, and you needed to at least try...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you'd succeeded, if barely. The last dozen or so mouthfuls had felt like sheer torture, and frankly you didn't know how you weren't sick right now. You stifled an unladylike groan, and did your best to stretch out without making it apparent that that's exactly what you were doing. Too late, you realized that the hand you'd been rubbing your belly with had been far from the cleanest, and you'd left a nice, sugary mess on the front of your nightie. If either of your two servants noticed, they made no obvious sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Little Miss, to see you enjoy my food so thoroughly, why it warms an old man's heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the pain you were in, you let out a soft chuckle at Ryuujin's comment. \"Ryuu, you're twenty five. That's hardly old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were fairly certain you saw a faint blush on Ryuujin's cheeks, but before he could speak, Keichi butted in. \"Master, it is hardly appropriate to refer to your servants so informally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, normally, you found it very difficult to deal with the cold demeanor and strict formality of Keichi, but the discomfort you were in left you feeling a little short. \"Perhaps in public, but that hardly matters when we're alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, you regretted your statement, but if Keichi had taken any offense, he made no sign. \"As you command, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking his antique pocket watch, Keichi continued, \"I shall have Taiga prepare the car at once. We are behind schedule, and the store closes in only a few more hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought to make a remark about hurrying to a place of business which wouldn't close until five, but instead had to stifle a belch that had too much potential to become something far worse. After you'd swallowed that uncomfortable thing back down, you said, \"Alright, I'll get changed and be right down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi bowed. \"Shall I help you change, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, no you may not! Did you help my Uncle change!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am perfectly capable of changing my own clothes, so no thank you! Just wait downstairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you command, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuujin gave a far more extravagant bow. \"Will you be back in time for Second Breakfast, Little Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the blood drain from your face as your already pained belly twitched at the thought of more food. \"No, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Perhaps brunch, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I really am good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then perhaps a snack for the ro-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm good! Now both of you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly fifteen minutes after the two men had left for you to feel well enough to try standing. Gingerly, you peeled off your slightly stained nightie and laid it on your bed. Truthfully, you wanted nothing more then to lay back down and stretch out, and sleep this painful stuffing off, but you knew Keichi would simply let himself in again if you didn't get downstairs soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way over to the monstrous walk-in closet and opened the double doors. Everything in this house seemed almost comically oversized. Your bedroom was bigger then your parents' old apartment. Your make-up table was akin to a normal dining room table, and your four poster bed was a monster, at 365 cm squared (12 feet squared). Your closet was no exception, larger then most bedrooms you'd been in, and packed with clothes. Sai, the mansion's tailor, seemed addicted to sewing, and was constantly making and amending old and new outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for you to settle on a skirt and blouse combo for the day. Sai considered your taste in fashion as rather bland, but given his love of lace and frills, you were quite happy he wasn't here now to complain at \"such a waste of youthful beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter donning your underwear, you stopped and looked at yourself in the mirror. Had you gained any weight? Honestly, you couldn't really tell. Your belly might have been rounder, but given the size of the food baby you were carrying, it was impossible to know for sure. Your hips looked a little curvier, and your bum a little bigger, but again, that could have been a trick after that painfully oversized breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wouldn't be surprised if I was, though. That's like the seventh or eighth time I've done that this week.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour politeness was going to be the death of you. Ryuujin over did it at every meal, was constantly making and offering snacks without waiting to be asked, and you consistently felt compelled to eat at least a little each time trying not to hurt the big man's feelings. In the short time you'd been here, you'd been overstuffed several times each week, and were really starting to worry that you'd start blowing up any day now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, though you were loathe to admit it, you were as much to blame as anyone else. Your wicked sweet tooth meant you were often waiting expectantly for Ryuujin's latest offerings, and you seldom felt compelled to say no. The presence of the rest of the staff, Keichi chief amongst them, meant that you seldom had to sully your hands with anything approaching work. At a word, your every whim could be met with zero effort on your part. So, taking all that into consideration, why weren't you getting bigger already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My metabolism must be keeping up so far, but there's no way it can hold out forever. Still, I can't have gained any weight yet; all my clothes still fit. Still, I got to deal with soon or I'll wind up as big as a house.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind made up and with other places to be today, you quickly dressed and made your way out to face the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Hitomi had left, Sai made his way into her bedroom. As well as tailoring, the young man was also responsible for doing the manor's laundry. He saw the dirty nightie on top of her massive bed, and picked it up. His sewer's eye had seen the young master in her evening wear last night when she came down for a slice of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my fair mistress,\" he said aloud, since he had no inner monologue, \"it seems I must let out your wardrobe a bit more once again...\"</span></div></div>",

We can use it this one time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi narrowed his eyes. \"As long as I sign your paychecks, you are my subordinate and must obey. I shall now use small words so that you can't possibly misinterpret me. Go. Get. The. Bentley. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" Taiga growled in the back of his throat, his volatile temper rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you're fired. Until the young Master comes of age, final say regarding the manor staff is my prerogative. And I will not have a little rat undermine this family at such a critical junction for such a foolish reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga's temper snapped at that remark. \"Oh, well, I'm so sorry my choice of car will apparently destabilize the power structures of the world at such an important time. Who died and made you in charge, huh!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi's answer was simple and blunt. \"Master Iori.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men were silent after that for awhile. Keichi never understood why Master Iori had brought home the kid who tried to steal his wallet, nor why he hired him to be his chauffeur when he insisted on driving himself everywhere. Taiga's failure to even act with the basic respect befitting a servant regarding his master had always rubbed Keichi the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Taiga's part, he found Keichi infuriating. Both had been born to the same class, and yet everything about that pompous jackass, from his glare, to the snide tone of his voice, to his dismissive mannerisms, made it clear that he thought he was superior to Taiga in every single way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth, however, agreed on one thing, and that was loyalty to the family. Master Iori had been their life, and the new Master gave them a continuation of that life. Neither man knew the nature of the debt the other owed to the Old Master and his niece, but they knew it was there, and was about the only thing that kept them both tolerating each others presence, if only barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling under his breath, Taiga returned the Rolls and grabbed the proper car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men stood in silence for a long time. Keichi was as still as statue, heels together and arms crossed behind his back, facing the door Hitomi would soon come out of. Taiga was hardly prone to sitting still, and was constantly adjusting his posture, twirling things between his fingers, and attempting and failing to whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi was already somewhat annoyed with the punk, so it was even more unfortunate when Taiga decided to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods of Fate, how much longer can she take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A servant should not complain about his Master.\" Unknown to both men, Hitomi had only just staggered stiffly to her feet, and was currently trying to pull off her nightie while attempting not to bend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's just the consequence of having a woman master, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga continued. \"Guess we'll just have to get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, she's a lot easier on the eyes than old Iori was, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga smiled at finally getting a response from the haughty butler. \"C'mon, tell me I'm wrong. Cute face; long, black hair; soft curves-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End this topic of conversation at once. It's improper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says the guy trying to help her change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the duties of a butler is-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, keep telling yourself that. Bet you were just trying to cop a feel of them tig ol'bi-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! She's 17, hardly a kid anymore. And she'll be 18 in a few more months, then all bets are off. Hell, maybe for her birthday I should show her how a real man does-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga never got a chance to finish his sentence. Keichi moved with almost blinding speed, and before the chauffeur could blink, the lanky butler had him against the car and a long thin blade against his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your continued good health, I would not dare finish that sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga gave a grim, predatory grin. \"Oh dear, did I strike a nerve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi did not respond to the question. \"If you ever raise a hand against the Master, I will bury your corpse in the garden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a threat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No; simply a statement of fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga's grin grew a little wider. \"You'd be planting yourself right next to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi felt a solid object move near his groin. Without looking, he knew that somehow the street punk had drawn his own hidden blade while he pushed him against the car and now had the weapon lined up for a killing strike against his femoral. The two stood in silence for what felt like hours but could only have been a heartbeat or two, before Taiga spoke once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'd never hurt her. She's a sweet girl and the Old Boss was a good man, and I won't give a good turn a bad one. But whatever Iori said, you can't protect her from everything. And if she wants me, I'm hardly about to say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeichi was most certainly not happy with that response, but despite his virulent hatred of the man, he knew Taiga was being truthful, if rather crude. The lanky butler wasn't ready to spill another's blood over this, and he slowly drew back. Taiga straightened himself up, adjusting his clothes, and folding his butterfly knife and putting it back in his pocket. Keichi hid his stiletto back wherever he'd drawn it from, and was back to the prim, perfect butler a heartbeat later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Taiga broke the silence. \"You going to tell Boss Lady about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are certain things it's improper for the Master to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuckin' knew you'd say that.\" Any other words the men might have said were forestalled as the great oak doors of the mansion opened, and Hitomi Uharu made her way out with a smile and a wave.</span></div></div>",

She is a red-head, trim and always wearing her maid uniform out of duty. She is very cold to you upon meeting as she is still saddened by your uncle's passing, who had raised her like his own child. But over time, she will warm up to you and possibly fall in love. Anya will struggle with the idea of liking another girl. Age: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi: Your new chef. She is quite short and chubby, and her cute little babyface and lack of proportions would suggest she is the youngest. In reality, she is actuallly one of the older girls and talks in a mix of childish words and rather risque adult language. Mimi has two long black ponytails, usually wears her chef uniform, and comes up to just above your stomach when you stand next to her. Mimi is always cheerful, but may be hiding an inner pain that only you can help her with. Mimi has already become fond of you and often feels you up by accident, so a lesbian relationship isn't beyond her tastes. Age: 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu: The house doctor and an amazon of a woman. She is tanned, somewhat muscular, and has the largest bust of all your girls. Suzu is a brilliant doctor, far beyond her years and those of older doctors, curing several problems related to obesity. Suzu seems rather fond of teasing you like a plaything, but you may get through to the real her yet! As Suzu likes playing with you, its no wonder she'd be a lesbian. Age: 24<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate: Another maid that works with Anya. Kate never talks, Suzu explaining something traumatic silencing her. Kate is an albino with pale skin and white hair, and a little overweight yet still cute. She seems scared of you at first, but perhaps you may bring words to her lips once again. If Kate falls in love with you, its because you will be the first person she has ever thought of that way. Age: 21<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika: An over energetic and rather violent (in a playful matter) security guard. Mika is quite obese, yet she moves like she weighs nothing. Mika is almost always eating and acts like she's nine years old with her juvenile attitude and always needing to be scolded. You're often the victim of her horseplay, but that may just mean she like you...even if you are both girls.. Age: 26<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how does this begin?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHello. I understand this must be a large shock to you, but welcome nonetheless,\u201d the muscular woman with the husky voice said, \u201cMy name is Suzu. I\u2019ll be the nurse around here and for awhile in charge of most of your affairs. To my left is Anya, the head maid, and to my right is Kate, who, I must warn you, really doesn\u2019t talk a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in acknowledgement, feeling somewhat uncomfortable. Anya seemed to regard you with the same level of regard that a cat would pay a mouse she couldn\u2019t devour. Her heart-shaped face was beautiful, no doubt about that, and, with her locks of scarlet hair, she was quite a sight to behold. You were long aware of your sexual preferences as a lesbian, but this girl seemed to both discourage and encourage your preferences. The girl Kate, however, was just as adorable. She had a round, chubby face with beautiful albino skin, her scarlet eyes staring right at the ground over her plump little belly. You wanted to just give the girl a massive hug, but decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the right time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the next few days, I\u2019ll be doing a lot of your paper work and will require your signature from time to time, but otherwise, you are the Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try to do my best,\u201d you stammered, nervous from this pressure put on you and equally nervous that you\u2019d do just what you longed to do to these women, hold their bodies in your arm and never let go. You were above such all-consuming desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnya will show you to your room for now,\u201d Suzu replied, turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya grumbled slightly to herself as she guided up upstairs, glancing down at the ground. \u201cSo you\u2019re the Master\u2019s niece?\u201d she finally said, grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup,\u201d you replied, morose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe we got stuck with such an idiot,\u201d Anya mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d you stammered, eyes wide with frustration, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me. You aren\u2019t half the man my master was,\u201d Anya mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first off, I hope I\u2019m not. I kinda have a vagina,\u201d you replied, emphasizing the rather naughty choice of words, \u201cSecondly, I\u2019m his niece. I\u2019m not gonna be identical to the guy, ya know?\u201d Who was this jerk talking to her like this? She had some nerve calling HER an idiot. If anything, Anya was the idiot for treating someone badly before getting to know them, before understanding anything. Intolerant little\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya sighed, heavily running a hand through her hair. It was then that you noticed a tear running down her cheek, her eyes red and sodden. She hid her face behind her hair from then on, or at least her eyes, to keep anyone from noticing the tears she cried. You felt anger subside, but not ease away. Was she just lashing out at you because she was sad? That wasn\u2019t any excuse, but even so, at least it was a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your room. Take it,\u201d Anya mumbled, walking away, \u201cDon\u2019t complain, it\u2019s the best in the estate. I\u2019ll bring you dinner in your bed.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, actually, the trolley she wheeled up was laden with dishes of all varieties and sorts, from a full roasted turkey to platters of broccoli and asparagus, beautiful shades of green with large plumes of steam rising from their roasted forms, while trays filled with potatoes and pasta rested beside them. On the bottom trey there were cakes and breads of all sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enough to make your mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya handed you a plate and utensils, placing a small board for your plate as she took up a seat and small table beside you. \u201cSo here ya go: dinner in bed with me, just like you requested. Would ya like me t\u2019 serve ya, too? Give you a pipe and some slippers while I\u2019m at it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please, just enjoy the food,\u201d you replied with a smile, taking some food for yourself on your plate. You taste some broccoli, only for your eyes to widen in awe. The flavors pour over your throat as you chew, surging your body with delight, filling every fiber of your being with desire and happiness as you take another bite, and another, and then another, only to see that Anya is doing the same, albeit in an attempt to look restrained and proper. \u201cWho made this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour chef, Mimi,\u201d Anya replied, harpooning chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a chef?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s awfully good at cooking, but the problem is she has a really sick sense of humor,\u201d Anya commented, irritably, \u201cShe keeps saying I wanted to have sex with the Master! Isn\u2019t that repulsive!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDisgusting,\u201d you agreed, withdrawing some white wine to give to the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhite wine with chicken,\u201d Anya observed, smirking, \u201cSo you aren\u2019t a completely uncultured idiot, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI try,\u201d you laughed, pouring yourself a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you still look like an idiot,\u201d Anya mumbled, delicately sipping her wine as she ate more of the food, a little less restrain now, \u201cStill, it could be worse. We could\u2019ve had someone like Suzu inherit the estate, and then I\u2019d have to work nonstop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork nonstop? Well, I won\u2019t work you all too hard,\u201d you replied, finishing your second bowl, your stomach now slightly distended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took over an hour to eat all the food, but, in the end, there wasn\u2019t a scrap left. The two of you were full to the brim, struggling to sit up as you moaned in pain. Anya eventually managed to rise to her feet, rubbing her palm against her forehead. \u201cI never ate that much before\u2014hiccup!\u2014and I won\u2019t ever agai\u2014agai\u2014hiccup!\u2014excuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you laugh, holding your own distended belly in your hands, \u201cWe\u2019ll do it again tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I could\u2014hiccup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please, this was fun, ya know?\u201d you replied, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya regards you for a moment, lips tightened, before slowly smirking. \u201cYou idiot, you thought this was fun?

The past week had flown by, with Suzu doing the majority of the work in regards to dotting the I\u2019s and crossing the T\u2019s. Although occasionally you needed to confirm something or other, for the most part you had been free to laze around the estate, which resulted in, inevitably, you finding yourself a little lonlier than usual. However, this wasn\u2019t too big of an issue. After all, Anya did grow on someone after awhile, which was what she had done with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both also grew a little, to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say you had gained weight was something minor. Sure, your breasts were a little fuller. Sure, your belly was a little softer. Sure, your butt was a little shakier. Regardless, though, it had to be at maximum four pounds, max, though you figured it was more like three. While that was still a lot of weight in the time span of a week, you weren\u2019t startled too much. Weight wasn\u2019t a huge issue to you as it was with other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther girls like Anya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, these things are just going straight to my hips,\u201d she mumbled as she harpooned another brusslesprout, \u201cI checked the scale, and I put on a good four pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I couldn\u2019t notice,\u201d you replied, very honestly, as you glanced at her soft, slender frame, svelte and luscious, her long locks of hair tumbling over her back as she swallowed the vegetable on her fork. She was a goddess, Anya was. A truly beautiful girl. Her sarcasm had grown on you for the past week, regardless of whether or not it was in cruel intent or not. Still, to see the girl mourn the figure she hadn\u2019t lost was a little much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie. I packed on weight. I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t!

As you brushed by it with your softer knuckles, you felt the soft ring of flesh mold around your hand, as though it were somehow composed of soft, playful puddy of some kind, or, in simpler terms, pudge. Indeed, a week of surrender and planning on how to approach Mimi had left the two of you another three pounds thicker, though despite that that still somehow only made you two the lightest people in the house, with Suzu running ahead of you just barely due to the fact her muscle was heavier than your pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been this fat my entire life,\u201d Anya moaned, disgusted with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fat,\u201d you said, supportively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for that, but I know it isn\u2019t true. Look! I can actually grab it,\u201d Anya said, pulling at the slight flab. It barely was substantial, but it was enough to convince Anya she was a porker set to be thrown to market.  You sighed, well aware that her flab was insignificant, but, regardless, you didn\u2019t want to expand much yourself, despite how adorable Anya looked with that excess flub. \u201cAt least my boobs are bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the nurse\u2019s office, where Suzu was sitting down in her chair, sipping coffee daintily with a mature air about her. Something about her just appear so mature, almost unapproachable. Maybe it was that husky voice of hers, that low deep tone that sent shivers up your homosexual spine. Whatever made that beautiful woman so damn beautiful (maybe it was her boobs), she was, and it took all your restraint not to unveil your lesbian urges right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Suzu?\u201d you asked, attracting the nurse\u2019s attention to the duo outside her door. She walked out, a slight smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t here for a medical examination, are you?\u201d Suzu asked, smirking, \u201cBecause if you want to attract my attention THAT way, clearly you need to think outside the box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just as bad as the OTHER pervert!\u201d Anya stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther pervert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMimi!  Who else is as raunchy, as foul, as manipulative, as\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d you said, tensely, cutting off Anya much to her distaste, \u201cWell, what\u2019s going on is that Mimi is giving us way too much food for lunch, but whenever we go to tell her to lessen the\u2014er\u2014quantity, she just starts hitting on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you enjoy it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT KIND OF STUPID ASS QUESTION IS THAT?!?!?!?\u201d Anya spat, \u201cMy ass is growing while Mimi hits on me! Do ya think I REALLY, PROFOUNDLY ENJOY THAT!?!?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, some people have odd kinks\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAND I AIN\u2019T ONE OF \u2018EM!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Suzu agreed to join them, and they went to the kitchen, only to find the cherubic cook pouting innocently by the stove. On closer examination, they realized she had scorched a pudgy index finger on the stove, crocodile tears in her eyes. \u201cMimi has a really bad boo-boo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you better come with me to treat that burn,\u201d Suzu said, gravely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2014sniff\u2014Anya and **plates fall overlapping name** can kiss it and make it better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Anya asked as Suzu withdrew a box from her back pocket which somehow fit without bulging out awkwardly in any way. How did this woman keep it in there, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMimi, these girls are complaining you\u2019re fattening them up. Is this true?\u201d Suzu asked, placing gauze around the injury after placing a liquid on it. Despite not being a serious injury, Mimi winced upon feeling the liquid touch her. \u201cAfter all, it would be very mean for you to do that, especially considering your holiday bonus is coming along. I\u2019ve been managing that for the young mistress, and, quite frankly, we do need to make some budget cuts for new medical equipment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see how it is,\u201d Mimi moaned, \u201cI\u2019ll do it, on one condition.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Never before did you think a person could physically do as much work as Suzu did every day. Every morning you would be woken up by the sound of a treadmill going a mile a minute, only for Mika or Anya to inform you Suzu had sprinted an ungodly distance before having her speedy cool-down on the treadmill. Afterwards, she\u2019d clean every surface of the house, which was, according to Anya, truly grueling labor. In between dinner and lunch, as all the aforementioned activities were completed BEFORE the clock struck noon, she\u2019d sign papers while doing pull-ups, or perhaps sit-ups, or perhaps travel to important meetings miles away ON BIKE and still arrive on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi was visibly pleased that she was eating the food, but visibly disappointed by her failure to make Suzu gain. \u201cMimi puts all her hard work into those deserts, and it looks like it\u2019s all going to her\u2014nowhere!\u201d you heard her cry one night passing by the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you soon realized, after four days of Suzu resisting weight gain, you still longed to see Anya pudge up, AND you were addicted to Mimi\u2019s cooking. There was something inherently addictive about the meal, something you could not even begin to explain. It was inherent, no, perhaps crafted, but regardless there: it was like tobacco, only worse. It was a craving nigh-impossible to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she resisted better than Anya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days into the new arrangement, you caught Anya sneaking into the kitchen. Following her, you noticed the maid, casually, as to not attract attention, withdraw a single cookie from a jar Mimi kept hidden away, and swallow it almost instantly. She would then dart away, but regardless, the following night she withdrew a cookie and a piece of another one. One would probably ask what a single cookie could do to a waistline, and the obvious answer is nothing. However, what effect can a nightly routine of increasingly larger amounts of cookies do to a person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot, evidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to say Anya packed on weight, but, as the weeks passed and your withdrawal symptoms grew worse and worse, as you were now prone to breaking out into violent fits of sweating, the head maid\u2019s uniform slowly grew a little tighter around the midriff. As she entered your room, which had now become a more a tradition than simply maid duties, you noticed the edges of her jaw was less sharp, more smooth and organic. Indeed, her face and cheeks seemed slightly fuller, her arms having more mass, her fingers, as they massaged your back as requested, pressing against more skin than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gained, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!

The glee you felt was tainted, however, by the sick feeling in the pit of your stomach. You had no intention of helping her lose a single precious pound.

She might have been able to accept that you were a lesbian but to accept you also liked fat girls was stretching it!

You wouldn't tell her about your preferences, at least for now. But you were equally unwilling to let her slim down again. If this meant taking advantage of your friendship... it was worth it. Even if it did make you feel a little ill to betray her so.

Unable to take it anymore, you excused yourself and ran into the bathroom to cool off. After splashing some cold water onto your face and taking a few minutes to let the dirty thoughts clear from your head, you begin to exit before hearing the sound of sobbing from the room. You stop to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... I'm such a hideous cow! E-even my b-b-best friend can't staaaaand meeee! I'm so faaaaat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of Anya crying were too much.

You can just relax,\u201d you said, placing a hand on her shoulder, squeezing it slightly with your fingers. You liked the sensation of her soft flesh rolling around your fingertips.  It felt so good.  Anya glanced up at you, her eyes red, but still with that hint of cocky confidence, now clearly just a fa\u00e7ade for her own insecurity.  \u201cLook you aren\u2019t fat. I ran in there because, well, I had to pee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d Anya looked confused.

Look, I\u2019m not a stick either,\u201d you said, raising your shirt to reveal the soft surface.  Yes, Anya was larger, but that was irrelevant.  The fact was that you too had put weight on from Mimi\u2019s cooking, although you lost much of it thanks to your withdrawal symptoms from Mimi\u2019s amazing cooking.  Still, there was softness there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you are,\u201d Anya moaned, \u201cLook, I feel like I can be so open with you, like I don\u2019t have any regrets. I couldn\u2019t even talk to my parents like this, not that I knew them long anyway. I do remember my mother, my only memory of her, crying about how fat she was.  I don\u2019t know whether she was or not, but my mom abandoned me and your uncle adopted me, so I figure that the last thing I wanna be like is her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were abandoned?\u201d you were both horrified to hear this and a little grateful to get her deviated to another topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, your uncle adopted me and everything, treated me like a daughter,\u201d Anya replied, laughing slightly, \u201cBut, well, then he died, and I had no one.

It didn't help matters that Mimi loaded you down with treats whenever you went to visit her every other day at Kate's bequest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings at the manor hadn't gone much better. Mimi had kicked it into overdrive and even with you taking portions to the hospital nearly daily, there had been plenty to go around. Anya had completely forgotten about dieting and had put on another ten pounds while you had gained back all the pounds you lost plus five.

Her body had changed beyond all your perverse dreams and aspirations.  You had expected a slight metamorphosis, but this soft woman, with her plump rounded arms and rather large, soft derriere, bared little resemblance to the Amazon you had first met upon arrival. Once her arms were ripped with muscle, but was now coated in a thick layer of flab. Her angular face was now round, with her slight double chin clear for even you to see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you too,\u201d Suzu mumbled, her eyes narrowed unimpressed, \u201cI take it you\u2019ve been helping to fatten me up like a pig for market?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not at all, I\u2014\u201d Anya chose that particular moment to walk into the room, only to drop the book she was holding in awe as she took in the blubbery visage of her former nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You got fat!\u201d Anya stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for that observation, Anya,\u201d Suzu replied through her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really, like you\u2019re all flabby and\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Anya, we know.  Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes Santa Clause know you\u2019re stealing his cookies\u2014?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!  Sorry!\u201d Anya replied, laughing in spite of herself, placing a hand self-consciously on her own bulge, drumming her thick fingers against the softness with a slight giggle in her throat.  Suzu regarded her for a moment, agitatedly, before sighing in resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few days before Suzu was allowed back in the house, at which Mimi expressed her love by cooking a massive feast. Though it was quickly devoured by the whole of the house, it was only then that you fully appreciated the metamorphosis the whole house had taken as a result of one woman\u2019s injuries.  Though Mimi and Mika hadn\u2019t changed much, everyone else had.  They were all pudgy now, ranging from soft like yourself to massive like Mika. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was what to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By the end of the day, your precious Anya would be stuffed like a prize hog. Although still ambivalent about your own slowly expanding weight, you didn't stop plying your head maid with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, she had plumped up even more in the weeks since Suzu had returned from the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I really shouldn't... um. We're due for a physical next week and I should really start cutting back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up, her belly folding into two adorable rolls, and turned to you. As your friendship grew, the two of you spent more and more time together. Currently, the two of you lay on your bed together, you doing your damnedest to ensure that Anya got as many calories into her body as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. You had forgotten about the physical. Though you were aroused by the thought of Anya getting measured and weighed (possibly in front of you!), her fatness finally given numeric classification, you feared her realization of exactly how fat she was getting may cause her to exercise and diet away her lovely blubber. It was enough to make a girl cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you shouldn't, don't be silly!\" You replied, eye twitching. \"You're still thin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a look. \"You really are an idiot. Do you call <i>this</i> thin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave one of her rolls a jiggle.

I'm also pretty sure that you like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" It really wasn't helping that she was close, her fat belly pressing into your chubby stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... if you like me... and I'm fat... I think that means... that you... like... fat girls.\" She said, slowly, leaving a pause between each word. \"Guess what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" You replied shakily, aware of just how near she was to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, her lips pressed into yours and the two of you embraced.</span></div></div>",

You were left with nothing but panties and a bra, both of which dug into your flesh ever so slightly, as you stepped onto the scale, Suzu measuring your proportions as you did so. Suzu rose from her chair, her plump derriere bouncing as she did so, before she glanced down at the machine, taking note of the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, you're at 153.  Quite a change.\" You glance over at the mirror incredulously. 153!? Sure enough, your body had changed. Your once angular face was now a round full pudgy moon, your hefty breasts expanded so that you could barely see your stomach, which hung over the lips of your panties. You prodded your belly with your thick digits, your knuckles having sunken into your own flesh already, much to your mix of delight and amusement. Your metamorphosis was, to say the least, rather amusing and hypnotizing for someone such as yourself. Your muscle had disappeared under your layers of flesh, and you barely resembled the person you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you felt you looked cuter with chubbier looking cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'll ask you to change and leave--\" Suzu began, only for you to glance over at Suzu, widening your eyes like that of a puppy dog. You needn't even verbalize your request before the nurse's pudgy cheeks filled with blush. She sighed in resignation, \"Alright, you can stay. Just help me by reading out the numbers, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but not before Mika darted into the room, hastily stripping naked, her massive arms trembling as her gigantic spare tire wobbled dangerously as she approached the scale. Your eyes widened as you took in the behemoth of a woman, her form nearly crushing the scale under her girth. You glance down, only to notice your own belly scrunching up under you. It felt funny. \"373,\" you declare, much to Mika's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was 345 last year,\" Mika mumbled, clearly surprised, \"Wow. Maybe I ought to lay off the donuts,\" she pondered as she left, her butt shifting from side to side. It was then that your favorite costumer, Mimi, emerged, a mischievous little grin on her lips as she slowly removed her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Master, you're here,\" Mimi replied, placing her hand over her mouth in mock surprise, as she slowly flashed her pudgy belly, \"I hope you don't feel too weird. This is my first time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get on the scale,\" Suzu grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi hopped on, spreading her pudgy arms out before Suzu pushed them down, her belly and breasts scrunched between her plump appendages. \"Stop moving. You'll affect the number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's so hard to just stay--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"169.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's up 15 pounds since last year,\" Mimi stammered, \"Let's do it again. This time, I won't move. Promise.\" Mimi stepped off the scale, only to place her pudgy feet back on  its surface, staying straight as a board. This time, you read 175 lbs. Resigning in defeat, Mimi abandoned the pad, allowing Kate to enter, her pudgy body bouncing into the room. She silently approached the scale, averting her gaze off of you as she stood naked in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's 215,\" you state, at which Kate's chubby cheeks fill with blush. She walks off, unable to look at anyone, perhaps out of shame or embarrassment. Her cheeks darken once Suzu mentions that she gained approximately 50 lbs since the previous year, at which Kate looked as though she wanted to hide under the nearest rock in shame. However, you pat her on the arm, trying to make her feel better. Your touch did little, but once Suzu gave her a comforting hug, she blushed deep red, and left the room, flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving your plump lover left over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya walked in, nonchalantly, before noticing you. She smirked in amusement. \"You're a total perv, ya know that?\" she laughed as she undressed from her maid outfit, which was too tight on her. Her  flesh seemed to pop out of it, relieved, before she stepped on the machine herself. You bent over, making sure to have your cheek accidentally brush against her thigh. \"177.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a gain...of 75 pounds!?\" Suzu stammered, \"We have a winner here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya blushed, only to glance down at her belly, weighing it in her hands. \"Wow, who'd figure?\" She was about to put on her outfit when Suzu threw a larger uniform at her. Blushing, yet smiling, Anya put on this new outfit on, finding it to be a much better fit. As Anya left, you turned to Suzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So should we weigh--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did mine first. In case you're curious, I'm 200,\" Suzu smirked, \"It's a 70 lbs increase, if you're wondering.\"</span></div></div>",

But like most of the things she did, Anya was rather... straightforward. Whereas you tried to ply her with treats, getting her to eat of her own volition, Anya took the direct approach and stuffed you until you were near bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she sat on your stomach, legs straddling your sides and bulk preventing you from squirming away. Having made her pronouncement, she shoved a cookie into your mouth with a gleeful grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, eat up, you're WAY too thin. You're the smallest person in this house! You weigh less then Mimi and she's practically a dwarf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, that was true. You had primarily been the feeder to the rest of the house's collective feedee, but you still weren't completely sold on the getting fat thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... Anya liked it and you liked Anya. To be fair, you DID fatten her up, so why not let her do the same to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that realization, you submitted to the ministrations of the red haired maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIIIIIPPP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Anya cried, straightening up and attempting to conceal the tear with her chubby hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's too big for her britches.\" You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! You're not so small yourself, fatty.\" She retorted, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth statements were true. While Anya had indeed outgrown her pants, her plump rump ripping the fabric when she bent down to dust, your own hips weren't that much smaller. In fact, to her arousal and your chagrin they were LARGER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that you were actually heavier then your girlfriend, who had to be up to two hundred by now compared to your measly one hundred seventy nine (you'd checked your weight that morning), but that your bodies were different. While Anya was an astounding hourglass with large bosum, wide hips, and a comparatively narrow waist, most of your fat headed straight for your hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya loved it. She had thirty pounds on you but your hips and rear were actually larger then hers. That's not to say she didn't care for your little potbelly that pooched out over your panties or your breasts that were just a smidgen too large for your bra but your lower half drove her wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heaved yourself out of your chair, another ripping noise was heard. It was your turn to blush and cover your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, stupid? I told you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok. You were right, now lets get changed so we can go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs entertaining and arousing as lounging around the house, bursting out of your clothes, and eating could be, you already had plans today-</span></div></div>",

For as long as you could remember, your sister Alice had been quite a skinny girl. Taller than you, yes, but always a slender, lithe girl. You questioned yourself whether or not staying in this house would alter her physical appearance somewhat. You suspected it would, but you  could not expect the logical in this househoold. After all, logic tended to bite the logical on the fat butt around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I just need you to make sure you can make her feel, well, at home around here. You CAN do that, can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course!\" Mimi cheered, \"I'll make every cake I can think of!  I'm sure she'll taste a double powerful dosage of Mimi's super delicious uuber pink lovey lovey awesome cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just make that up on the spot?\" Anya asked, eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Ain't it cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the crest fallen chef, you left the room, escorted to the airport in your limo. Your stomach clenched slowly as you drove down the road, anxious. The last time your sister saw you, you were so skinny. What was she going to think now of you? You ran a hand over your bulk, sighing slightly as you remembered how you had received each ounce you now carried. The pleasure had been great, but now it was time to face the consequences of your actions. Your fantasy world was great, but reality was often a cruel mistress. Your sister may even despise you now, just for how you had allowed yourself go. You had warned her you had gained some weight, but never revealed the exact amount. Would she even recognize you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited in the air terminal for an hour at least, a rather slow, painful hour, with stress as your sole companion. Finally, after an eternity, you noticed Alice's slim, lithe figure emerge from a line of people. You waved her over, calling her name. She glanced over, hearing your voice, but unable to place it with a face.  She walked away, unable to recognize you as her sister! You darted over as best you could with your bulk, grabbing her by the wrist to get her attention. She responded reasonably by swinging her foot across your face, twisting your arm behind your back, and holding you down with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, freak!  What the hell do you want? I kick the snot out of people like you for breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice! It's me, your sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!

I warned you I gained a little weight, and, uh, I under-exaggerated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice regarded you for a moment before freeing you, blushing deep red. \"Oh, uh, right.

Sitting in the back with your sister, being chauffeured home, the only thing the two of you had to entertain yourselves was conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the proverbial elephant in the room, the two of you engaged in small talk How the family was (fine, mom sends her love and wants you to call more often), how your sister's career was going (eh, it's a job, what can you say?), about boyfriends and the like (nervously fielded by you), and more. Small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was pretty uneventful except for the several times you could have sworn something had poked you in the side. Turning to investigate, all you'd see was your sister intently looking at the passing scenery. It was definitely a mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the manor, you exited the vehicle to be promptly rammed by your lover/maid. Despite her tough exterior, she was very attached to you and worried whenever you left without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping her arms around you, squeezing you into her warm softness, she kissed you. You tried to resist and warn her that your sister was here, but it was simply too warm, too passionate, and you gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing, nothing at all, except you and Anya...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrought back to reality, you realized that not only were you embracing and kissing a girl in front of Alice, but that said girl actually had one hand down the back of your pants, groping as much of your fat ass as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anya!\" You hissed, having broken off the kiss. \"Anya! Knock it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently having forgotten where she was, Anya lay her head on your shoulder and continued to grope, shoving her other hand down to ensure both cheeks got full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYA! Alice is here!\" You yelled, red and sweaty from arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the speed of a girl fifty pounds lighter, Anya slipped her hands out of your pants and took a leap backwards while screaming \"YOU COULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT EARLIER YOU RETARDED PERVERT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing you had an audience, the two of you turned to look at Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, she had watched the spectacle in wide eyed silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god... Oh my god... OH MY GOD. It all makes sense now! You were never interested in boys back when we were in school... and you always watched that one girl, Karen. It all makes sense now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the look of fear on your face she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbracing you, she exclaimed, \"Oh honey, don't look at me like that! You're my sister... I'll love you no matter what! If you like girls, that's fine. If you like...\" Here she glanced at Anya \"statuesque girls, that's fine too. It doesn't matter- I'll still love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling relieved, you relaxed and hugged her back. It was strange, though. It almost felt like something was pinching at your fat sides...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter settling her in and making introductions to most of your staff, you took Alice to the kitchens where Mimi had baked a surprise for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was big. It was pink. It wobbled a little and was most certainly fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hewwo dere master, Mimi made you something... <i>special</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on top of a platter larger then you thought conceivable was Mimi stark naked. Well, TECHNICALLY she wasn't as she was wearing two large globs of whipped cream over her nipples. And her belly and thighs did a damn good job of hiding her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze, completely unable to respond. Fortunately, Alice had always been better with things of a sexual nature then you. She calmly strode forward, dipped a finger in the nipple-frosting, and licked it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... that is good. I presume you're the chef?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Mimi put on a robe, pulled out the ACTUAL treat she had made (a triple layered chocolate cake with vanilla creme filling and strawberries) and sat down to chat with Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling flustered and slightly aroused, you excused yourself, certain that Alice would be alright on her own.</span></div></div>",

This was an odd thing, specifically because the food was so good beforehand that you didn't believe it was POSSIBLE for it to increase in quality in any sort of way, but, there it was, improving before your very eyes. If every meal had been a delight before, now it was a masterpiece, and Alice sampled all of it, smiling as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gonna blimp up,\" Anya mumbled, a small grin on her cherubic face, \"No doubt about it. Total blimp. I can guarantee it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, Alice was immune to the food, eating it gracefully before remaining just as sculpted and slender as before. However, Mimi seemed determined to change that, and constantly handed her sweets and deserts personally throughout the day. One time, you saw the small hippo hand Alice a hand-crafted seven layer cake that had fifteen extra layers. Alice accepted it, eating the entire thing before Mimi's awestruck eyes, before giving the chef a quick pinch of the cheek as she complemented her on a job well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi still sexually harassed both Anya and yourself, but strangely enough you noticed that Alice, the new comer, was baring the brunt weight of the cross of sexual harassment. Mimi constantly pointed fun at the way Alice's breasts were shaped, or her hips, but in that sort of complementary, lustful light that you were all too used to by this point in time. However, rather than shy away, Alice almost encouraged it, flirting and acting sexual right back at the harasser.  Often times, Mimi had no real reaction other than to giggle, smirking as she clutched her growing sides in laughter, while Alice delivered extra zingers to humiliate the girl respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it a little weird?\" Anya asked, finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I'm talking about. Your sister seems REALLY close to Mimi, ya notice that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya frowned, her pudgy forehead puckering up adorably. \"I dunno. I think there's somethin' going on between them. I'm just surprised, ya know? Mimi, of all people, having a girl who ENJOYS all her crap. Wow, I never thought it could really happen, but I actually found someone stupider than you, idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou playfully  punched her arm, at which the two of you rolled onto your bed, deep in an embrace.</span></div></div>",

Mimi nevew said fat giwls were a bad thing, did she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to get fat was actually wrong. Alice, after a months stay, was pretty much there. Fifty pounds she had gained, a number seemingly impossible to attain outside of a poorly written fetish fiction. Between Mimi's cooking and attentions, Alice's metabolism could not hold and Anya's prophecy of her becoming a total blimp was well on its way to fruition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think they're saying in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue. Probably somethin' depraved as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stood outside of the dining room, heads sticking out of the partially ajar door.

I do wish you were a bit more like your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!

Anya had to be around 250 at this point and you yourself were only three pounds shy of the big 2-0-0 as of that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh! Looks like I'm fallin'!\" Said Anya with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, gently, Anya applied her greater bulk to your back forcing you to sink to the floor until you were horizontal. She lay on top of you, her hands still busily massaging and kneading your cheeks. Your fat girlfriend engulfed you with her body, the warm softness so pleasurable that you almost missed the events that occurred next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the dining room, you saw Alice leaning back with Mimi straddling her belly, fork in hand. Nothing but enjoyment was on your sisters face as Mimi forced bite after bite of rich cake down her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... Anya, look at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Anya. ANYA.

You feared your bones might snap under her weight as she hopped on your covers like a feline, or perhaps an anvil. \"Hey, what's the big deal!?\" you stammered, staring incredulously at your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm fat?\" Alice asked, frowning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, let it wait until morning...I need to sleep...\" you mumbled, turning deeper into your bed, but your bouncy sister then chose to pounce against you again, shaking you awake. \"Alright! You're a little chubby, but not fat. Happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sighed, placing her hands on her belly, pinching the fat between her fingers. \"I guess I know why you're so plump now. Ah well, maybe I should drop some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to,\" you groaned, half asleep as you nestled your head against your hands and pillow, \"Now go to  sleep.  Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was a strong willed girl, and it showed during her diet attempt. She explained her plans to Mimi, and, despite Mimi initially responding by laughing at her face, she finally agree to cook some not too fattening foods. Considering this was Mimi, a girl who loved desserts and cooking them, the fact that Alice could even propose the query if she could make non-fattening foods, much less convince her to actually do it, was a miracle in and of itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon, Alice did start losing weight.  You could not believe it that, in a house filled with fatsos, a girl  could ACTUALLY diet and grow smaller. Indeed, her clothing became baggy as her potbelly slowly receded, her arms growing less plump, her cheeks less chubby, her fingers less porky, with every passing day. After a month, she was down to 140 lbs,  which was thick, but not her  chubby state as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, no one really gained much during that period, which was odd. If anything, you even lost some weight. Mimi seemed so distracted she  couldn't focus on making anything fattening to any degree. How incredibly odd it was to you that she'd be in such a downbeat mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit you: no desert making for Alice made her sad. Why was she so important to Mimi, anyway, when she had everyone else to fatten--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course! They were lovers!</span></div></div>",

Once, once you had known popcorn that was stale, bland, and corn related in name only. But you had devoured it happily, not knowing any other sort could exist. But Mimi, or her phenomenal cooking skills to be more precise, had opened your eyes to the truth. She made it herself, using hot oil, fresh kernels, and spices that you had never even heard of. Truly, this was where the good corn of the world went when it died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tonight's fare was different. It was bland. It was stale. And it didn't so much crunch as shatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on your fat lover's lap watching a movie may have been fun, but you couldn't help but feel discontented with such lousy foodstuffs. Still, you knew better then to ruin the evening by complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya, on the other hand, couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EWW! I'm sick of this stuff! We gotta fix whatever's wrong with Mimi cause I can't take this lousy food any longer! Even worse, I THINK YOU'RE LOSING WEIGHT SKINNY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. You WERE losing weight, albeit only a small amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only about five pounds, Anya! You only think I'm small cause you have more then sixty pounds on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso true. Despite her complaining, Anya was still GAINING weight, though the rate of poundage had slowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five pounds today, ten tomorrow, twenty next week! It's gotta stop! We gotta find out what's wrong with Mimi and fix it, pronto! Anyways, as I said before, the food isn't very good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, she was right. The food HAD been (comparatively) lousy lately and you HAD been losing weight. Though once ambivalent about your rising weight, you had grown attached to your fat ass. Plus, Anya liked it. Correction, she LOVED it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you couldn't forget that you'd be helping Mimi out as well. There was always that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll help. But tomorrow, ok? We've got a movie to finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>James Bond probably didn't have this much difficulty.</i> You thought to yourself as you and Anya attempted to make your way into Mimi's kitchen without being detected. Given how bulky the two of you were, this wasn't anything more then a pipe dream and any attempt to gather information undetected was futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter knocking over a glass with your hips and Anya bumping into a trolley with her stomach only a deaf person would be unable to discern your approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Mastwer? What do you want with Mimi?\" Approximately two minutes after entry, Mimi located and accosted you. The faint streaks on her face revealed she had been crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of trying subtlety, you decided to try the direct approach for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all spilled out. About how Mimi and Alice had immediately hit it off, becoming friends. Then more then friends. With glee and longing in her eyes she described how she had introduced Alice to feeding and about how well she had taken to it. With obscene hand gestures she illustrated how astonishingly quickly Alice had blimped up. And with her eyes shimmering with unshed tears, she told of how Alice had told her she was becoming to fat. How Alice had stopped her from making the many things that she liked and refused to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi hurriedly explained that they were still together, but that something wasn't there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing the entire sordid story, you agreed to help Mimi get Alice to at the very least loosen her dietary restrictions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how?</span></div></div>",

But first: You had to find Alice, who was currently doing some exercise in an attempt to lose the extra weight she had gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after wrangling in Alice, you dragged her back into the Kitchen, where Anya was comforting Mimi some regarding what the small hippo of a chef was enduring. Of course, upon seeing Mimi's current mood, Alice had felt this twinge of guilt in her conscience. After all, even though she was conscious of her weight, Alice could still feel guilt like any normal person. So, she cautiously approached Mimi and asked, \"...Mimi? Are...are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Alice's voice, Mimi looked upward and turned her head toward Alice, tears still streaming down her plump, somewhat cherubic face, where she then spoke toward your sister and replied, \"*sob* Oh... Hewwo, Awice. Don't mind me, I'm just...cwying my worries away. *whimper*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did I...did I do this?\" Alice thought to herself, feeling even more guilt than before, as she then turned around to confront you and asked, \"Why is she so upset, Sis?\" \"Alice: If you've been in this house as long as Anya and I have, you would know that Mimi takes pride in making Sweets. She wears her heart on her sleeve like a badge of honor. So, when you had her stop making the things she loves... Well, you essentially broke her heart.\" You explained, which made Alice's decision to cut back weigh heavily on her heart, unaware of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow realizing her grave mistake, Alice attempted to apologize toward Mimi, her voice in a regretful and apologetic tone as she said, \"Mimi, I'm... I'm so, so sorry. I...I-I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Its just that...I was conscious about my weight, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, in response to Alice's apologetic words, Mimi began to stand up from the chair, wiping away some of the tears streaming down her face, where she then confronted your slightly plump sister, standing before her despite the somewhat obvious height difference between the two individuals. But then, completely out of left field, Mimi slapped a firm hand against Alice's slightly fuller cheeks, taking both you and Anya completely by surprise, just as Mimi then exclaimed, \"...That's Bullshit!! Complete, shameless bullshit!! Who cares about what others think, Alice?! I! LOVE! YOU!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, neither you or Anya were expecting Mimi to lose her cool and snap, as the small hippo of a chef then swiftly pulled Alice in for a long and passionate kiss. At first, Alice had this look of complete shock on her face. However, the feeling of shock melted away into a sense of blissful euphoria, embracing the passionate kiss from Mimi. In Alice's mind, this was her first ever lesbian experience in her life. And yet, she could feel how soft and plush their bellies were as they pressed against one another, creating this new erotic feeling within Alice's subconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Alice and Mimi severed their kiss, both individuals blushing furiously with reignited affections toward one another, Alice eventually spoke toward Mimi and asked, \"So, um... You...you love me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Anya bluntly spoke toward your sister and replied, \"DUH!! Why do you think she was fattening you up with treats?!\" Anya's words were more than enough to make Alice blush even more than previously, which prompted your sister to look down at her own plump abdomen, feeling embarrassed yet somewhat aroused at the thought of becoming fatter. All in all, these feelings were completely new to your sibling. So eventually, after contemplating over what she had recently learned, Alice decided to...</span></div></div>",

Anya's about to yell at you, but then stops and cocks her head to the side in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know...I have no idea.\" she says. She can see the expectant look on your face. Hopefully she doesn't read too much into it. She doesn't see the images of that cute little belly, that cherubic, sad face of Kate dancing in your mind. All she sees, probably, is an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll bring her along. There's not much for her to do anyway.\" Anya says. You nod and give a smile. Anya just scowls and looks away. When she isn't looking, you purse your lips and study Anya a little more. A true beauty. You'll have your beauty and your cutie here tomorrow night. The wild and the mild. You're already looking forward to it, perhaps a little too much. You decide it best to try to drown these rising passions in food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, all you have to do is sign a little more paperwork. You spend your time exploring the mansion. It feels like a museum. You know, however, that this is just killing time until dinner. You consider moving your meals with Anya up to lunch, but decide to show some restraint. You'd like her to open up a little, and it was best not to be too forward on that note. So, slowly, time passes until Anya comes in with her trolley. And lo and behold, behind her is a plump little albino with desserts in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might as well get the whole staff in here.\" Anya says irritably, handing you your food. Kate just stands there, looking like a robot. You smile and take the plates from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like, you could always stay.\" you tell her. She looks up at you, and her expression is just slightly mournful, as it always is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, sit down. Have something to eat.\" you tell her. She hurries over and perches on the end of your bed. You smile patiently. She'd follow orders to a T, even if she wouldn't do anything without being told to. You're no dominatrix, but you can work with that. You hand her a plate, and without having to say another word Kate begins to eat. You get the feeling she was thankful, but it's hard to say. You sit down and start to enjoy the heavy meal in front of you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later, and just before lunch you're in your room, reading. You're not exactly an avid reader, but your uncle had a grand library. Now it's yours too. You kind of wonder what he was doing with all the romance novels, many lesbian romance novels at that, but decide not to ponder that too deeply. At least he had an eye for quality, as the little red book you're reading is rather absorbing. You almost don't hear the door open behind you. It doesn't exactly startle you, but you do turn around rather quickly in your seat. There, to your surprise, is Kate. Of course, anyone else would have announced their entrance on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\" you say with a tone of voice you'd usually reserve for a startled animal. Kate looks at you, sad-eyed as always, and then swiftly walks over to your bedspread. You're intrigued, and watch as she begins fluffing your pillows and straightening the covers. You can't help but smile to yourself as she bends over, her luscious rump angled at you. Kate glances back at you, and you try to make yourself look innocent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I guess.\" you say, unsure what she expects. She turns right back around and gets back to work. Not that there's much to do. You wonder briefly if Anya sent her in here. The head maid was a bit more of a grump these days. Not at your meals, but the rest of the time, when she could complain how fat and lazy everyone was getting. She was never too harsh on Kate, but the silent maiden was often a sounding wall for Anya's rants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you think about it, all three of you are looking a bit softer. You're not yet concerned with it, even if your pants are getting far too hard to button in the morning. It's only another couple pounds, and there's no way you're stopping your mini-feasts with Anya and Kate. Anya was looking like she'd need a new maid's outfit before too much longer, the fabric much more taut around her belly, and you've seen her picking at the bustline when she thought no one was looking. Kate's shown no discomfort, but it's clear that her starting figure came from a pitiful metabolism. It seems like each meal makes her just a little bigger, makes that round tummy stick out just a bit further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Kate's straightened and tidied the bed to a point of perfection. She moves on to your dresser, and there she pauses. You realize what she's looking at. Earlier today you started looking over your meager collection of jewelry. You were never one for dressing up, except on rare occasion, but you've gathered a few bits and pieces of gold and silver, most from your uncle. You get up and stand beside Kate. Her hands hover over it all, as if she's not sure she's allowed to touch it. You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of it?\" you ask. Kate jumps and backs away a little, making you laugh. \"Don't worry. I'm guessing Uncle wasn't one for jewelry, was he? I prefer the simpler stuff, really.\" you pick up one necklace you do like. It's a fine silver chain, and at the end is tiny, completely round sapphire kept in a ring of silver. Kate's mouth opens in wonderment, and she reaches up to touch it briefly. Just as quickly her hand darts away. Surprised, you look at her face, finding her blushing a bright pink. She hurries for the door. Once there, she pauses and looks back at you, meeting you eye to eye. And then she's gone. You shake your head, put down the necklace, and get back to your book.</span></div></div>",

You winced, slightly, but essentially thought little of it. Probably someone dropped a tray or what have you. Kate had been known to drop objects here and there every so often.  However, as the seconds passed, you heard the sound of people rushing downstairs, of heavy masses darting down the stairs. Again, inherently nothing too serious, but now you were curious. You rose from your bed, and approached the door, glancing out to see Mika, in all her jiggling glory, darting down the stairs. You pursue her, curious as to what was going on. You find, to your surprise, the morbidly obese woman was taking strides larger than your own, soaring through the air like a cheetah.  It surprised you that none of the china tumbled out of their cabinets and broke under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it downstairs, only to find the source of the sound. There, on the ground, was Anya. She was unconscious on the ground, bleeding from the forehead. Kate stood nearby, her pudgy hands clasped over her mouth in shock, her eyes wide. You stared in disbelief as Suzu approached, effortlessly scooping her body into her arms, glancing toward Mika. \"I want you to call an ambulance. It looks like she has a concussion of some sort. I think there might be a few broken bones, too.  Thank God her neck didn't snap from that fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From--from that what?\" you stammer, your eyes wide with terror as your stare at Anya's unconscious form. Was she going to die? No, that was impossible. Suzu said she'd be fine, so surely she'd be fine. It couldn't be any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll recover, but she'll probably need to stay in the hospital for a few weeks,\" Suzu replied, \"Don't worry, we'll take care of her. We always do when stuff like this happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched that afternoon as she was taken away in a truck, a look of concern on your face. You feared for her safety, feared for whether or not she'd recover properly. You waited for hours before you received a message from the hospital confirming that Anya would recover, albeit it might take a few weeks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're still rather worried that evening over Anya's fall. You can't help but think it was your fault - Anya probably wasn't used to her weight, and if she had gotten up on a ladder....sure it was only a few pounds, but in your mind you all but signed her death warrant. You can't even pick up your book again, and spend hour after hour getting up, pacing your room, and trying to sit back and relax only to get up again a minute later. You're going to worry yourself sick at this rate, but you don't even care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you hear the door open. To your surprise, Kate's there, this time with the trolley Anya always wheeled in. You look at her in surprise, and she hands you a note from the cart. You read it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suzu's going to have enough on her hands without you killing yourself over Anya! You skipped lunch, so I've sent Kate up here with strict orders not to leave until you eat everything. Have fun ;)</i> it's Mimi's flowing handwriting. You don't know how to react. On the one hand, Mimi's got a point. On the other, who is she to send Kate with 'strict orders'? Kate seems ready to comply, however, as she holds up a plate loaded with fine cut steak up to you. You sigh and slump onto your bed, staring at the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Kate, but I don't really feel like eating. Never thought I'd say that...\" you shake your head. You hear Kate sit down beside you, and then the noises of a knife and fork. To your surprise, a forkful of steak is placed right under your nose. You look over to Kate in surprise. She's still sad and silent, but you can see something else in her expression. She's pleading with you. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I suppose I should-\" the rest of your sentence is cut off by that forkful of steak. Surprised, all you can do is chew. As soon as she can, Kate slides the fork out of your mouth and skewers another piece. It's under your nose again before you even have time to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate, I can-\" you don't get it out before she sneaks another piece in. You look over to her as you chew. Her expression is hard to read, but when she sees you staring she pleads with her eyes again. You decide there's nothing to do but let her have her way. Honestly, it wasn't all bad....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you've repositioned yourself to lean back on your bed. Kate still sits besides you, and has slowly moved plate after plate of food into you. You're stuffed, however, and Mimi's apparently decided to make up for your missed meal by giving you tons too much food. You finally get Kate to stop with a wave of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna explode, Kate, I can't...\" you complain, placing your hands on your distended belly. Kate reaches over and hands you the note again. You groan, understanding her point. One way or another, she's not leaving until all the food was gone. Who knew this timid little maid was actually such a minx...suddenly, you get an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let me see that apple crumble.\" you tell Kate. She hands you the dessert. You get into a sitting position, stifling a groan as your belly sloshes heavily. Now, for phase two...another idea gets to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kate, any chance you're....ticklish?\" your hand darts over to Kate's side before she can react. Feeling her soft, giving sides sends you straight to heaven. But you keep your eyes on the prize. A surprised Kate squirms, and unwittingly lets out a little giggle. You strike in that perfect instant, forcing a forkful of dessert straight into her mouth. Her eyes popped wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi said all the food has to be eaten. She didn't say by whom.\" you say, grinning devilishly. Kate blushes, but chews the bite. To your elation, she opens her mouth in preparation of the next bite when you bring it to her mouth. The tables have turned, and the chubby little maid can pack away even more than you. Good, because there's a lot more food to go...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"And don't forget to clear away the dishes when you're done!\" you hear, the yell traveling farther across the mansion than any expected. You wince and shake your head. A concussion an broken leg, as well as a bruised bone on her arm had left Anya wheel-chair bound, and more irritable than you thought any one person could get. The mansion isn't exactly wheelchair friendly either, so most of the time she's confined to the first floor. You've tried seeing her a few times since she came home a couple days ago, but she's in no mood. You get the feeling she blames you for this, but maybe she just wants someone to blame. You can understand. You're sure once she gets time to cool down, things will return to some semblance of normal. Unfortunately, with Anya mostly out of commission, Kate has had to be her arms and legs. The poor girl's been run ragged doing Anya's chores as well as her own, and you're sure Anya is finding more for her to do. Why, you don't know, but you secretly think she might be getting jealous of Kate. In any case, moments later Kate's wheeling in the loaded cart again. She looks up at you with tired eyes, bags under her eyes that stand out against her porcelain skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, poor baby.\" you coo. You cautiously reach out, and trying to find somewhere safe to touch her, end up putting a hand on her head briefly. It was impulsive, and you're instantly worried about Kate's reaction. But, against expectation, Kate actually smiles at you. Just a little smile, and her big red eyes still seem sad, but her lips curve upwards. You smile back. Kate picks up a plate, but on another impulse you grab it from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no.\" you tell her. She looks up in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been busy all day. It's your turn to be waited on.\" you tell her. You do have an ulterior motive to this. You're not yet fat, but your belly is actually beginning to press out over your waistline, and there's a crease in it when you sit. The problem is, you don't really know how to feel about this. You look forward to these little feeding sessions with Kate, which you've been continuing regardless of any chef's notes, but the aftermath still troubles you. So best to take control of the situation before things go too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate has by now sat down expectantly on the bed, and you get to work. She's readily fed by you, and after the first few bites she relaxes. You're enraptured by the motions of her plump little lips as she takes each bite from you. You sneak a peek at her belly. Only a few days of being fed, and Kate was already showing signs of what you liked to think of as 'improvement'. The thing was, she always got fed only after you got full, not exactly feeding off scraps but still only taking what was left. You've never seen her hit her limit before, and start to wonder if she even has one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you start to find it after the fourth course is finished. Kate begins to struggle with her bites, and you can hear her breathing harder. Her brow furrows, as if she's concentrating on this intently. But she's not making any motions to stop, that's for sure. Your heart swells. She's just as into this as you are, you realize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, lie back, it helps.\" you tell her. Kate hesitates, and then complies. She shifts herself over to lean back against your pillows. Her dainty legs don't even reach close to the end of her bed. Lying back, you can see how swollen her belly is. It sticks out from her almost like a pregnant woman. It's confined by her maid's outfit at that. You look her in the eyes, and see that pleading look again. She wanted to keep eating...or maybe she just wanted to be with you, and this was the only way she knew how...</span></div></div>",

You gently lay a hand on her shoulder, stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say you had to leave.\" you tell her. Her eyes grow wide. She lays back down cautiously. You just give her your best smile. You haven't eaten yet, and there's still enough left. Not as much as you usually eat, but that works out fine for you. You grab a plate and begin to eat. You can see Kate watching you intently, her delicate hands resting on her bloated belly. You give her a playful grin, and she goes pink in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I could get used to this.\" you tell her. \"I wasn't sure at first. I know Anya means well, but she's a piece of work. And I think Suzu still scares me a little. But it's nice, living here. I could never be one of those extravagant, rich folk, the kind with a fur coat for every day of the year, driving around to balls and operas...\" you roll your eyes. Kate gives you a little smile, encouraging you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's definitely got its perks. The food's wonderful, and I've got all the time in the world these days. But I think what I enjoy the most....is the company.\" you give her another playful grin. Kate blushes again, but won't take her eyes off of you. You go back to your food, deciding not to push her any further. Kate twiddles her thumbs, staring down at her hands. You'd give anything to get inside her head. Well, inside her pants would be good too, but you really do wish you could just tell what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish dinner, Kate tells you in her own way. You place the empty plate back on the trolley, still sitting down, when you hear Kate move. She gets into a sitting position and, eyes on the floor the whole time, sits right up against you. You feel her hip press against yours. You're elated, and can barely stop yourself from turning around and pinning her to the bed, right here and now. You look down at a small motion, and find Kate's placed one hand, palm up, in the crevice between your leg and hers. Carefully, only just holding back on your urges to jump her bones, you reach down and take her hand in yours. Kate leans against you, head against her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate! Don't make me come up there! Where is that lazy girl?\" you here a coarse yell, and groan. It's Anya. Kate immediately gets up and rushes to the door. But, like a few days ago, she pauses when she gets there and turns back. This time, she's smiling at you, and you can see joy in her eyes. You're just about to call out to her, to tell her to come back, but she's gone. You groan and fall backwards onto your bed. You purse your lips in thought. Something had to give.</span></div></div>",

You didn't want the cat out of the bag too early, but Mimi was such a flirt she drove you wild. It didn't help that the chef had a figure as divine as her cooking. Her ebony ponytails reached all the way down her small back, to stop right above a squidgy, bubbly rear that wiggled as she worked. She had a pot belly that you could barely keep your eyes off of, and her boobs weren't too shabby either. But you had a plan. And, now, a reason to hold back. Well, more of a reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi?\" you call as you enter the kitchen. After dinner, it's pretty empty. You round the corner and find Mimi eating alone at a small table. To your surprise, the peppy chef is actually looking quite down. She holds her head in one hand and looks at a half-eaten roll listlessly. She hears you coming though, and you only get a quick glance at this blueness before she's up in a flash, grinning and batting her eyelashes at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, come for a special dessert, have we?\" she asked. \"I can work wonders with a cherry, if you catch my drift.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're already red in the face, and have to take a deep breath. \"Maybe la...I mean, no, no.

It's like talking to a horny teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Anya. She's been out of control.\" you say. Mimi frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did just take a nasty fall.\" she said. Finally something serious from her. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But she's not dealing with it. She's just yelling all day. I get she's not exactly miss sunshine...like you.\" Mimi giggles at your little compliment. If she knows she's being buttered up, she certainly doesn't mind. \"And it got me thinking. You know when she's the happiest? When she's eating. She just forgets her troubles with a plate in front of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how that goes.\" Mimi muttered. Her pep slips for just a second. \"So what's the plan? She's already eating like a horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she? Oh, okay.\" you scratch her head. \"Still. I think it'd help if maybe she had company. She eats more around others. And if she can look and see she's not nearly as fat, as, say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yea.\" you admit sheepishly. Mimi just giggles, her belly wobbling a little. You go red, but not from embarrassment this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get ya. Sure. I can probably get her to eat with us...and I do mean both of us.\" Mimi walks up beside you and drapes an arm around your shoulder. \"But you owe me.\" she says, prodding you in the tit. You blush, but luckily Mimi walks away. You're doing this for Kate, you convince yourself. Seeing your other staff binge was a good side effect, but...for Kate. Right. </span></div></div>",

It was fun, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you wanna waste your time hanging around a grouch like me,\" Anya chuckled, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously, please!\" you plead, slightly desperate, \"We have way too much food for just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so this is to keep the fat off your rear ends?\" Anya laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, yeah,\" you replied, shrugging in resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it's for such a good cause, maybe I could donate a little bit of my time,\" Anya giggled, for the first time in what had to be quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wheeled Anya upstairs, grateful at this one chance. This was your oppertunity to cheer the scarlet haired girl up some. As you led her to your room, you found Kate had already wheeled the trolley in. You had told Kate to avoid feeding her tonight, as it might weird Anya out if they did too much too soon. Maybe the redhead could join them later, just maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Mimi cooked more food than usual, Kate and yourself were both shocked to find you had less to eat. Anya shoved food into her mouth, hungrily, before resting back, hands on her bloated belly. \"Stuffed,\" Anya moaned, \"You eat rest. Me sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You speak in bad grammar,\" you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, shut up.\"</span></div></div>",

Mimi hums to herself in thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never expected she'd be such a tough cookie to crack.\" she responds. The mere mention of a cookie makes you salivate a little. You're up a wardrobe size, but your clothes still are too tight, and you're fast developing quite a sweet tooth. The only thing holding you back from total fatness was the fact that Anya took the lion's share at dinner. Still, she wasn't gaining much faster than either you or Kate. And that's another thing. Anya's only mellowed out a little, and you still find poor Kate run ragged most days. Now you don't even get the chance to feed her into bliss either! But Anya had calmed down some, and you remembered why you enjoy her company. The bigger breasts and paunch she was sporting didn't hurt either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem is,\" you say, \" as soon as she gets a bit sleepy, she shuts down completely. Can't you, like, spike the food with caffeine or something?\" you look up. To your surprise, you find Mimi giving you a death stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" you mumble, figuring some cooking law had been crossed. Mimi just giggles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know one way to fix that.\" she said. \"She needs a feeder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...what?\" you say hesitantly, trying to appear ignorant. You could already feeling yourself getting turned on. You swore Mimi could tell, like you were a dog in heat, as she sat down across from you and leaned forward, her boobs in full view. She grinned at you mischievously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Kate started working here, she'd barely eat. She was like a child. I only got her to eat when I started feeding her. Made her oddly peaceful too...and you can see my handiwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Kate used to...\" you stammer, eyes wide. Mimi giggles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't make a move on your girlie.\" she says. You turn red. How did she...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make doe eyes whenever she passes, silly.\" Mimi tells you, reading the question on your face. \"Don't worry. No one else has noticed.\" she smiles, but it's a weak smile that confuses you. She wasn't....jealous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyway..\" you say. \"I'll give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl.\" Mimi replies, perking up. \"Wanna practice?\" she grins. You turn red again and rush out of the kitchen. You don't see Mimi's smile fade, or her shoulders slump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon, and after some struggle you've got Anya upstairs again. You tell her to go in ahead, and manage to stop Kate as she wheels the trolley around. You quickly whisper the plan to her. Her eyes go wide, but she nods to you. You help her get the food in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time, you lazy girl.\" Anya snaps. You rile up on the inside, immediately wanting to defend Kate. Anya was calming some, but everyone knew better than to get between her and food these days. She was starting to look quite plump, her rear nearly taking up all of the wheelchair, and her bust nearly as wide as that. You let the meal start normally. Mimi's outdoing herself with the amount of food these days, but Anya still eats over half the amount meant for all three of you. Then, as usual, after a flurry of chewing and gnashing Anya leans back. You make your move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" you ask innocently. Anya cocks one eye open at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" she growls. You shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thought you had more in you than that.\" you tell her. You can practically see her bristling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sleepy is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I bet you could manage one more bite, surely.\" you tell her, holding out your fork. Anya just wrinkles her nose at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done, I told you.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" you continue, adamant, \"You don't even have to do anything. Just chew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya growls and bats the fork from your hand. You recoil it in shock. \"What do I look like to you?\" she snaps, \"some prize hog for the fattening? You're a freak, and an idiot, you know that?\" she sits up and wheels herself out of the room, grumbling all the while. You're crestfallen. Then, you feel a hand on your shoulder. It's Kate. You put your hand over hers and take a deep breath. </span></div></div>",

You oblige, and meet her eye to eye. You see a new expression in her eyes. Determination. She puts a hand on each of your shoulders. Then she looks away and takes a deep breath. You start to say something, but wait. You get the feeling she's about to say something, anything. She moves her lips, alright, but not like you expected. She moves them up, and pulling on you, right into your slightly parted lips. Despite the suddenness, it's not a very forceful kiss. A bit of a childish one, at that, as she's pursing her lips too much. A kiss someone who had only ever seen kissing would give. Carefully, slowly, you guide her lips with your own. They soften and you move to a more comfortable angle. The kiss lasts several seconds before Kate breaks it. You still don't know what to say. Kate bows her head and leans in, forcing your chin on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no idiot.\" you hear. Your eyes widen. The voice is soft, and high without being squeaky. A voice only a soundtrack away from belonging to a soprano singer. You wrap your arms around Kate, tight, resting your hands on her now ample sides. You feel her arms go to your sides, which are surprisingly soft as well. You just smile, your heart warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no idiot either, y'know.\" you say with a chuckle. Kate lifts her head to look at you and smiles. You move on arm up to the back of her head and guide her in for another kiss. This time, your other arm slips around to her hip. She gives a little moan and inches closer, until she's practically sitting on your lap. The kiss lasts quite a while, but when Kate leans back again, you can see that she's anxious. You just smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time, huh?\" you ask with a grin. She fails to grin back, and you decide to comfort her with a stroke down your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I understand. Let's not get too far ahead, eh?\" your words are traitorous to your true desires. But going all the way tonight would be a mistake, and even your libido knows it. Kate nods, and glances over at the still half-full trolley. You get the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay back.\" you tell her. \"And let's make tonight the best night of your life.\" you bring the trolley over.</span></div></div>",

She patted her hands alongside her bulging stomach, sighing in relief as she laid her head against the pillows just as soft and fluffy as her sweet little--well, not too little--arms. She smiled, her cherubic cheeks dimpling, as you rose above her, running your hands up her soft sides as you bashfully played with her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now, doesn't that feel nice?\" you ask as you probe her flesh with your soft, thick fingers. Wow, looking at your now knuckle-less hand, you realize just how much you yourself received out of these all too filling meals. Blushing as you smiled, bashfully, you leaned in to kiss Kate on the cheek, a kiss that was returned to you three-fold, before Kate's tender lips embraced your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate stayed the night in your room. Though nothing sexual or inappropriate occurred, you felt it was almost like a lover's nest, two people full of admiration toward the other laying their heads on the same pillow, drawing up close to one another, perhaps going as far as to hug and fondle one another in the night. Regardless, there was no sex, something that you reminded yourself once you woke up realizing that Kate's soft, pudgy thigh was resting on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rose from bed, glancing at the mirror as you left Kate. What you saw caught you by surprise. You had woken up for years seeing a slender, heart-shaped face girl stare back at you, but today, no, today there was someone else there. She had a round face, no double chin, just chipmunk cheeks. A thick neck but not necessarily a  chubby one, bountiful breasts attached to a chest whose collar bone was faint, almost invisible. Thick arms leading to plump hands with pudgy fingers, fingers dangling by wide hips attached to a plump belly. Below that was the bubble butt and plump thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran your hands across your cheeks, you realized that girl you saw was yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so beautiful.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     So aroused from the sight you witnessed in the mirror, you gave into the urges you had been trying your hardest to fend off for quite some time; you dove headlong into gluttony.  The next several weeks passed with you engorging yourself each and every day, with Kate feeding you much of that.<br>\r\n     You were currently relaxing on your bed in the nude, Kate feeding you the last morsel of a cheesecake that had once been on the cart, along with many more.  The fork slid past your plump lips as the cheesecake bit hit your tongue and went down your gullet and into your stuffed belly.<br>\r\n    \"Mnh... Kate,\" you gurgle.  By this point, Kate knew exactly what you wanted: she climbed up onto the bed and straddled you as she began massaging your belly gently.  Despite how you felt like cheesecake would soon begin to leak out of your navel, your belly still had a lot of give to it.  You no longer bothered wearing underwear under your clothes; your belly now hangs plenty low to take care of that.  It extended on down past your crotch a good ways, resting on top your thighs.  They were now as big around as most people were, and maybe a little bigger.  Their smooth skin stretched its way on down to your once-toned calves, which fed directly into your ankles; you had what most would refer to as \"kankles.\"  Your foot had gone up a shoe size or two due to the weight you put on; you could feel your feet spread out whenever you stood.<br>\r\n     Kate slowly made her way up the sides of your foldless, smooth belly and onto your breasts.  They've grown to quite a large size, as you were now an H cup.  They still retained their perkiness and roundness, untouched by sagging.  Your nipples grew hard and you moaned as Kate's expert hands clutched, squeezed, and kneaded them.  Your arms, now looking like elongated, small pillows shot out as you let out a loud moan; you had achieved orgasm simply from breast fondling.  Your hands, which could now only be described as fat, shot open, their plump, digits grasping at nothing.  Far removed from your chaste relationship you had with her some weeks ago, Kate had grown accustomed to performing such acts.  Her lips darted towards yours, which now readily accepted anything that came their way.  Your double chin became more prominent as your head was pushed back; it had grown to become quite noticeable, along with the rest of your fattened face.  You were now 400 pounds, after all.<br>\r\n     Stiff from lying down for so long, you decided to stand and stretch.  With some assistance from Kate, you made it to your feet.  You could feel your ass spread out, glad to finally have some room to breathe.  It stuck out far enough that, if you could stand still long enough, it could act as a shelf.  They were both as broad as your thighs, and stuck about seven inches.  Of course, it still had nothing on your stomach, whose recent engorgement made it appear to be quite pregnant.  You were leaning back a good bit in order to keep your balance.<br>\r\n     Kate took a towel and, lifting up your belly apron, dabbed the fluids away from your chubby vulva.  She then grabbed your specially-made robe and draped it over your, tying the belt.  You so detested regular clothes anymore.<br>\r\n     \"Ahhh~!  That was a wonderful meal, as usual.  Mimi's food is always delicious,\" you say, patting your turgid stomach.  <br>\r\n     \"Mmhm,\" responded Kate.  While she hadn't become too talkative in the past several weeks, she still was more vocal than she used to be.  While most of her dialog amounted one- or two-word replies, it was progress.  On some particularly passionate nights, she would even speak at length with you.  Well, it was at length for her, at least.  Her girth had remained largely the same; in your gluttony, you would eat most, if not all, of the food yourself.<br>\r\n     Suddenly, there were two loud knocks on your door.  \"Hey!\" shouted Anya's voice on the other side.  She continued to grow quite corpulent over the weeks.  Although, she wasn't at your size; 250 is still light compared to 400.  \"It's from SlimActive!\"<br>\r\n     \"SlimActive?\" you say in suprise.  Weren't they a program involved in curtailing obesity in public schools?  \"What do we have to do with the-?\" you say as you belch; the cheesecake you consumed refused to go down without a little fight.<br>\r\n     Anya strode on into your bedroom.  \"Gee, I dunno; I'm just a freakin' maid.  Maybe if you'd actually pay attention to some of the Old Master's business relations instead of staying up here in your 'lo~ve nest,' you'd actually know,\" she said as thrust the letter into your face.  Reflexively, you opened wide and took the letter into your mouth.  Anya just stared at you dumbfounded, blushing somewhat.  \"Do you just accept anything into your mouth!?\"<br>\r\n     \"Force of habit,\" you say as you draw the envelope from your gaping maw and proceeded to open it.  Anya stood there, staring at your stomach.  You could tell she was aroused by the sight of your bloated, dissented figure; of course, due to your infatuation with Kate, she would never state such feelings openly.<br>\r\n      Your eyes scanned the letter.  Apparently, your late uncle was a \"business partner\" of sorts with them.  The owner, James Radicalstein (which was not his real name), had given him quite a few shares in another company he owned, RadCorp (formerly, it was manufacturer of shutter shades and mullet accessories; now, it was a private military corporation. However, it still kept its cover as a manufacturer of such good), in exchange for your late uncle donating a few hundred-thousand here and there to SlimActive.  He also acted as a spokesperson in the wealthy socialite community, and made donating money to SlimActive the hip thing to do with rich folk with too much money to spend.<br>\r\n     As your eyes drew closer to the bottom of the letter, you noticed something unfortunate, as far as your fattened state was concerned.  You gasped at the news.<br>\r\n     \"Well, what does it say,\" said Anya.<br>\r\n     \"I...I'm apparently obligated to be their spokesperson in an upcoming anti-obesity add campaign!\" you said.<br>\r\n     Kate's face was noticeably horrified.  You were the exact picture of gluttony and obesity.  How were you supposed even manage this.<br>\r\n     Anya looked befuddled.  \"I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  ...Why are you obligated to do this?  Do we owe him something?\"<br>\r\n     \"We own some shares in his company,\" you said in response.  An idea then strikes you.  \"Kate!  Go get the investment portfolio!\" you say, jerking your body in her direction.  As you do this, the belt around your robe splits and your flesh spills out.  Kate, every loyal and loving, ignores her carnal desires and sprints out of the room to fetch the portfolio.  You look down at yourself in surprise; you just had this made last week!  Anya eyes had been stuck open, transfixed on your belly ever since the moment of the split.  She had to force herself to look the other way; otherwise, there would be no chance of her even being able to utter a word to you.<br>\r\n     \"W-what are you going to do,\" Anya manages to stammer out.<br>\r\n     \"I'm going to check the portfolio.  If we're not receiving that much, I'll sell the stocks back,\" you reply.  You grab your ass; was it this big a moment ago?<br>\r\n     Shortly, Kate returns with the ledger.  You grab it and flip through the pages until you see \"RadCorp.\"  Just how many stocks did you own?  Upon finding it, you throw down the book in anger.<br>\r\n     \"How much are we getting?\" Anya asks from over her shoulder.<br>\r\n     \"Let's just say it's too much to consider selling the shares...\" you reply, distraught.<br>\r\n     \"What are you going to do, then?  Try and lose the weight?\" Anya says.  Kate's face gets a horrified look.  The last thing she wants is lover to lose all her pounds of fat that she worked so hard to feed her.  The thought of a skinny you was a turn-off for her, which ended up helping her focus on the task at hand.<br>\r\n     \"No.  That'd be way to difficult,\" you say as you fail to reach the bottom of your stomach.  \"I have an idea...\"</span></div></div>",

You didn't grow all this just because of laziness; you grew it because you liked it.  You thought of procuring a device, but you doubted technology like that existed.  Even then, you would still be obliged to help out this SlimActive company, and that was something you wanted to avoid at all costs.  You finally thought of buying out RadCorp; that would be nigh-impossible as it is a private company.  To get majority ownership, you would have to get Radicalstein to sell his shares, and there is no way he would willingly part with them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?  Any ideas?\" says Anya, staring intently at the wall.  With your creamy stomach still exposed, there's no chance that she could say two words while staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I could marry him, have him sign his assets to me in his will, and then murder him,\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems a tad bit extreme, don't you think?  Besides, why would he marry <i>you</i>?\" Anya snarks back.  And she's right; why would a man that owns a fitness promotion group want to marry a blimp like you?  Sometimes, you wish life was as easy while simultaneously convoluted like it was in a soap opera.  A deep, loud gurgle then passed through your stomach; the fifty servings of cheesecake you ate needed some help digesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, Ka~te...\" you call.  By now, she know exactly what you want.  She moves in front of you and her hands begin dancing across your belly's expanse as if they were dancing.  Anya peaks over her shoulder, curious and slightly aroused.  You notice her glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Anya?  Do you want to join in?  I'm sure with two people it would be even better...\"  you say, smiling temptingly.  You see Anya's cheek turn beat read.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-why would I freakin' bother when you have Kate over there doing it?\" she says as she storms out of your room while poorly managing to hide her embarrassment.  Oh well; eventually, she'll cave in.  Right now, all you do is back up and fall onto your bed.  You're glad it's so close to the floor; otherwise, you might have a few problems getting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate moves her hand back and forth, back and forth across you stomach.  You loved having your belly rubbed after stuffing yourself.  Something about the slight pressure you felt from her hand as she massaged it aroused you so.  Of course, the mere sight of your stomach was currently doing that.  How did you even fit all that cheesecake in there?  And where was it going to go?  Your cheeks?  Your legs?  Your breasts?  Your belly?  Your butt?  Or maybe even your arms?  Actually, that sounds quite nice; your arms need to catch up to the rest of you.  Mmm, what would the public think if they saw you, heiress to one of the richest men in the nation, as you are now:  utterly fat and aroused by it, and with your fat, bloated stomach filled with enough cheesecake for tens of people being massaged by your lesbian lover.  The media would have a-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S IT!\" you blurt out as you attempt to sit up suddenly; of course, you merely come up a fourth of the way before the girth of your stomach forces you back down.  Kate stares at you in shock; you nearly gave the poor girl a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate! Kate! I know what we can do now!  We need to hire a detective!\"  You decided the horizontal position worked just as well for explaining your master plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...why?\"  she said meekly.  It was going to be a while before she could speak with confidence again.  And why indeed!  You had originally thought to try find some skeletons in Radicalstein's closet for blackmailing purposes, and that shouldn't be too difficult.  After all, the man owned a private military company.  On the other hand, you were tempted to pursue the marriage plot from earlier, hopefully minus the murder.  It sounded like too much fun to pass up; you could have him look into what he found absolutely irresistible in women, and (unless he happened to harbor a secret fat fetish) hire someone to date and manipulate him.  Then again, that might get a bit messier than simple blackmail.  Hmm... </span></div></div>",

Your belly apron also complicates things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowy, but surely, you arrive at the study. Making it through the doorway is something of a challenge; it was made for someone less broad as you are. In your attempt to just walk through it, you get stuck. The the doorframe digs into your sides deeply as Kate tries to knock you free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it one more time!\" you shout to her. She walks to the other side of the hall (about ten feet) and charges at you. Her shoulder collides with you plush back and butt as Kate is deflected off like a stray bullet.

You try letting yourself fall to the ground to see if that'll help, but you're wedged so tightly you can't move your legs out from underneath you. Your sides are beginning grow quite sore. Goodness, you knew you were fat, but this fat?  Fat enough to where you're getting hopelessly stuck in doorways? The thought arouses you, and the fact that you can't quite move your arms to pleasure yourself to this thought arouses you even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\" Anya says as you hear her footsteps approach. \"Good God, you're...damn!\" She can't find the right words for the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, on the bright side,\" you begin to say, \"at least we know to hire a detective to dig up some stuff of Radicalstein.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you were on your way to do that when...this...happened?\" Anya says in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know you're enjoying this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know,\" you say as you attempt to wiggle your butt. Thankfully, your fat helps a great deal with the jiggling. \"You could just have your way with me right here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-wh-dh,\" Anya stammers out as her hands grip your jiggly buttox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O~h, taking the bait, I see?\" You feel your arousal grow even further. Anya continues to sputter incoherently as her hands firmly grip and massage your fat ass. Her hands reach underneath your robe and grab it directly, squeezing violently. She shoves her hands across each cheek as if she's attempting to flatten dough. She them bends down and starts licking and kissing your thighs. You knew Anya was attracted to you, but not this attracted.  You then hear more footsteps as another approaches; it's Kate with the butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya gasps in embarrassment as you see Kate begins to dab the butter around your sides, shoving it deep into the spaces. Anya (you can tell it's her because of the rough grip) begins pushing you. After some more butter is applied, you being. To feel yourself slip forward. You eventually fly free and fall straight on your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoaked with butter through your robe, you say: \"Well, who's gonna clean me off?\"  You feel Anya shove her arms under you and flip you like one big, doughy flapjack. She removes your robe and begins licking your sore, red sides.  Her tongue runs up and down the crevices left from the door, licking the butter out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate, excited that Anya was now joining in on the fun, moves the butter bucket up to your mouth as she lifts your head with a free arm. You gladly gulp down the rest of the liquious-solidy butter.  One gulp, two gulps, three gulps; it's still coming. The thought of drinking something so fattening makes you moan and shudder. Anya moves down between your legs to finish the job. She lifts your gems sous belly and gets to work on you starving privates. It doesn't take long for you to reach an orgasm that sends quakes and shivers all throughout the fat expanses of your body.  You had work to get do, but, sexually sated and filled with butter, you just wanted to bask in it all for a minute. </span></div></div>",

You didn't think you pushed her that far! Suzu waves her hands at the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it hasn't come to that. But the mansion is huge, and that headstrong idiot is liable to forget she's in a wheelchair. We just need to find her as soon as possible. So, we need every pair of legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and start for the door. A tiny grunt, more of a squeak, stops you. Kate's gotten herself up, but holds her full tummy and winces.

You look at Suzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan, how are we splitting up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi's holding down the fort in case she comes back.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, you searched high and low for your scarlet haired maid.  You searched every single individual little location you could. You looked in the  bathrooms, the closets, the hallways to every room, her quarters, the maid's quarters, and even, after a while, the basement of the house. Yet, no matter how hard you looked with Suzu, you couldn't find her. You sighed, anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all your fault, and you knew it. Had you not extended your offer of feeding toward the girl, had you not attempted to include her in your rather obsessive little foreplay games, then things might have been very different. However, you HAD done that.  You HAD included her, and from there, only a screwed up world of revelations and relationship crushing situations could prevail. You felt sick to your rather soft stomach about how you had screwed up your relationship with the maid, and her potential for happiness. She was depressed, and you had ruined her one chance at a semi-normal relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou longed to say sorry, yet you didn't know where the poor girl even was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find her,\" Suzu murmured, uncertainly, \"She's gotta be around here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three hours of searching, Mimi emerged, panting, out of air. Turning toward Suzu and yourself, she said, out of breath, \"I found Anya. She's been wheeling her way around the house--she has a knife, a knife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down! What's happening?\" Suzu stammered, eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I saw her taking a knife! She's in the kitchen! I think she wants to kill herself!\" Mimi stammered, sprinting off, the two of you in hot pursuit. Suicide!? Had it gone this far? How depressed was Anya?  How far had you screwed with her?  This had gone way too far. Anya was your friend, a simple friend as that!  It wasn't like she deserved to suffer. She was just going through a rough time. Everyone does at one point or another. There's no reason to commit suicide over it, right?  This was ridiculous! Absolutely horrible! Your eyes widened in fear, your skin pulpatating as you wheezed to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, you were out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of sprinting, you arrived in the kitchen. There Anya sat, a knife in her hand as she raised it high into the air. You were about to dive when she stabbed it down before her, a soft splattering sound filling the air as a scarlet liquid squirted into the air. You flinched, as did Mimi, but Suzu's expression slowly fell. She lowered her head, making strange noises from her throat. No doubt it was tears. You felt guilt settle in your heart. Anya surely just stabbed herself. You were responsible, you were.  It was all your fault for this. You knew it.  It was horrible.  You were a murderer, you had pushed a friend to--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi, you're a fucking idiot,\" Suzu mumbled as she glanced at Anya as she removed the knife from a particularly wet cranberry pie. Anya glanced at the others with a look of mild confusion, cocking her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you freaks doin' now?\" Anya grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anya, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya regarded you for a moment before looking away, a frown on her lips. \"You're a real piece of work if you don't get it. You're such a freak, you know. She really is a creepy--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I thought doing that might cheer you up, but I didn't realize how you'd feel!\" you stammered, your eyes widening as tears rolled down your plump, feminine cheeks, \"Look, I only thought you needed a pick-me up. It brought Kate up a bit, so I just--I'm sorry, Anya! I really am. Please, call me an idiot like you always do, but please snap out of it. I don't want my friend to suffer like this. I really don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya regarded you silently for a moment as tears ran down your cheeks. Finally, she whispered, \"A friend...?\"</span></div></div>",

Her tearful eyes suddenly twisted into a soul-stabbing glare that easily could have killed someone had she willed it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thwak.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're heart skipped a few beats as your soft body went numb. After a moment or so of sinking into a fear-stricken void, you caught sight of the knife Anya had been holding jutting out a few inches above you're left ear. What's more, that knife appeared to have taken part of your perfect bangs with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you are NOT my friend!\" Anya screamed at you as she wheeled herself around the kitchen table and began a bullrush towards the door. \"You're just a freak. A freak with disgusting little fetishes who loves to take advantage of everyone for you're own sick pleasures. Well. I. Am. Done! Do you hear me? I Quit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enraged redhead stopped just short of bowling your doctor and your cook over, applying a handbrake so as to come to rest just barely inside your peripheral vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Master was a great man. He protected all of us and never once took advantage of anyone. But You! Why did Master had to have such an idiot of a niece? You will never be as great as he was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya tried to spit in you're face, but given that she only came up to you're nicely sized bust while sitting in that wheel chair of hers, the saliva was quite a bit short of it's intended target. Opting to instead form a little stain on the neckline of you're favorite red shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the now ex-maid forced herself between your two staff members, and made a rush for the main doorway. After somehow managing to traverse the stairs that sat between the kitchen and the foyer, the enraged redhead practically threw the door of it's hinges as she rammed into it, before leaving the building that had been her home for years now behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slump to the ground. Stunned by the fact that the worst possible scenario had played out. Anya was gone. Because of you. You hadn't wanted her to leave. In fact, her bossy shrillish tendencies aside, you had grown to enjoy her company. But that time was over now. You had driven her away. Never to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu reached her arm around your shoulder and dragged you to your feet somewhat roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Suzu said, a rare look of genuine seriousness on her face. \"I don't know what happened between you two, but what she just pulled just now was way out of line. You can't control how people are going to react. She made her choice to leave, and that's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogical words, but you're feeling way to illogical to heed them right now. You can only mindlessly walk out of the room, robotically tackling each step as you make your way to the foyer, where a sheet of rain begins to fall on you as you stare blankly out into the night through the massive door.</span></div></div>",

After about a minute, you realise that you had finished off your second slice of cake for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr had that been your third?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, it didn't really matter. Ever since Anya had left, nothing seemed enjoyable or worthwhile. You don't read as much as you used to, and food seems to have lost the appeal that made indulging so wonderful. Even Mimi's works of culinary art didn't seem as good now as they had been when you first arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a third (or fourth) slice will have that special touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi, another,\" You say into the sleeve of your pajama's; which you rarely ever bothered to change out of these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of plates clanging together and knives being dropped on the floor, a new slice of chocolate cake slid across the table like a hockey puck, coming to rest in front of you and knocking your old plate to the side slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, cheer up Mistwesss...\" Mimi said in her usual childish tone. \"Mimi wants Mistwess to be happy, if you want, we could slip into the storeroom and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later,\" you mumble to no one in particular as you dragged your rather soft bottom off the chair you had been sitting in for about an hour now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, even your normally ravenous libido had been dampened by your head maid's departure. Your chef's not-so-sublte attempts at flirting with you no longer spark your interest, your doctor's statuesque build no longer looks impressive, and your security guard's extra bulk was just that- extra bulk, and Kate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate...    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Kate. Didn't see you there,\" You whip out an automatic apology as your elbow collided with your remaining maid's soft belly. Ever since you had started feeling down, Kate had become your shadow. Whenever she wasn't busy cleaning up some corner of your over-sized house, she would follow you around the house and do anything she could think of to try and make you feel better. When you woke up in the morning, Kate would be waiting with breakfast prepared for you. When you got up to find something, Kate would begin a frantic search for whatever you wanted. If you decided to lie in bed all day as you often did nowadays, Kate would come into your room during breaks and crawl under the covers and wrap her arms around your nicely formed muffin top. You weren't sure how Kate was handling your decline, but you hadn't heard her speak since that first time all those nights ago. To someone a little more observant, this little fact might seem a bit alarming; at the moment however, you weren't observant of others in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate merely nodded in response and took off after you a few seconds after you left the kitchen, tracing your every step as you made your way up the seemingly antagonistic staircase that seperated your bedroom from the dining room. After conquering the aforemented obstacle, you robotically make your way over to your door; which you push ajar with you're shoulder, before sitting down on your bed and begining your afternoon session of staring emptily at the bookcase jutting out from your wall. Kate enters your room soon after, and merely joins you as you begin viewing today's \"episode\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a knock echoes through your room. You don't register it's presence, so you continue on with staring blankly at the stack of books before you. The door to your room then creaks open, and Suzu's unmistakably deep voice manages to bring your attention back to reality long enough to catch most of what she had been saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... stain on the carpet downstairs, could you take care of that Kate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate seems reluctant to leave you, but quickly nods and takes off to resume working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Mistess,\" Suzu says from the doorway. \"I know that your taking Anya's resignation pretty hard, but that doesn't mean that you can sulk all day long for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your continued silience as a cue to go on, Suzu resumes speaking to you; trying to find the best way to word things as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, she's gone. We all miss her, but we have to continue working. Now, since your so far behind on the paperwork, I sent out a help wanted ad in the newspaper to find you a personal assistant to help pick up the pace, her name is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vivian,\" A new voice picked up where your doctor had left off. You turned to meet it, and laid eyes on a young woman about your age with brown hair, glasses, and a look so confidently smug you could of sworn she had been picked for this job out of ten thousand applicants. Her build was thin- but not athletic. Her breasts were fairly sized for someone her size, but by no means was she extremely well-endowned. \"Now, the first order of buisness today is-\"</span></div></div>",

Your friends were sympathetic, and within 24 hours you had hopped on a plane back to the United States. All your thoughts were turned towards your Uncle, an eternally cheerful white-haired man who never failed to make you smile. It was one of the hardest flights you'd ever made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the airport, you were met by two women in maid outfits holding a sign with your name on it. One was a trim redhead, the other a soft-looking albino. You learned that their names were Anya and Kate, and not much else. Neither of them were very talkative, which was just as well since you didn't feel like talking much yourself. They led you to a limo which brought you over to your Uncle's estate. As you pulled up to the old building, a wave of nostalgia washed over you; you'd spent several summers of your childhood within the building, at least before your family had to move when your Mom had been promoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe limo was stopped at the gate; outside, you could see Anya talking with a security guard. A rather round security guard, as a matter of fact. When she got back into the limo, Anya muttered that the guard's name was Mika and something about her being an idiot. The limo ride through the estate grounds to the mansion itself wasn't too long. After you got out, Anya and Kate led you through the twisting hallways of the mansion, though you were sure that given enough time you'd be able to remember the way yourself. Along the way, you passed the kitchen, where a rather short and chubby woman in a chef's outfit was cooking something that smelled delicious. Anya mentioned that she was Mimi, and not much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you made it into your Uncle's room. Sitting in a chair near his bed was what looked like a bodybuilder with a lab coat on. You would later learn that she was Suzu, the mansion's resident doctor. All you cared to see was the sickly old man lying in the bed. During the few times you'd managed to visit Uncle Bill since you'd moved away, you'd seen him looking sick before. This was on a level that broke your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the bed, he opened his eyes and said, \"Hello, little Gumdrop.\" You smiled despite yourself; it was a nickname he'd called you since you were little. You'd loved it as a little girl, hated it as a teenager, but now you wished he'd call you nothing but Gumdrop if it meant he'd live on for many years to come. The two of you spent some time, just talking. You told some stories about your travels in Europe, and he about some of funny things that had happened around the Mansion. Eventually, though, he was overcome by a coughing fit that Suzu used a syringe filled with some strange liquid to suppress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to hear you doing well,\" Bill said after the fit subsided. \"Now we need to get on to business. The reason I called you here... Let's just put it bluntly. I'm going to die. Very soon. And when I'm gone, I'm going to need someone to look after this place and everyone who works here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already knew where he was going with this, but let him continue. \"Could you do that for me, please? I can think of no one more suited to do so.\" With tears in your eyes, you accepted. \"Good. I thought you would. It's in my will, so that should be that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent a little more time talking with him, until he started to get sleepy. Suzu then quietly suggested that you should let him rest for the night. Wishing your Uncle Bill goodnight, you left and were guided by Anya and Kate to a guest room. That night, Bill passed away peacefully in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next week was a whirlwind. Ever the prepared one, Uncle Bill had made all the arrangements for his own funeral before he passed. It was a last gift of his you were grateful for; you weren't sure if you would have been able to handle that with the grief. The service itself was a fairly small affair, for one so affluent. You got to briefly reconnect with your family for a short time, before they had to head back to live their own lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning after they left, you found yourself waking up in the guest room that you'd been staying in ever since you got the mansion. You realized, as Anya came in to inform you that breakfast was ready in her usual trying-hard-to-be-emotionless manner, that you really had no idea who was working for you now that you had the mansion. You needed to fix that somehow.</span></div></div>",

But over time, she will warm up to you and possibly fall in love. Love with another girl will be confusing to her at first. Age: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi: Your new chef.

Suzu seems rather fond of teasing you like a plaything, but you may get through to the real her yet! She confirms her tastes in women right from the start. Age: 24<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate: Another maid that works with Anya. Kate never talks, Suzu explaining something traumatic silencing her. Kate is an albino with pale skin and white hair, and a little overweight yet still cute. She seems scared of you at first, but perhaps you may bring words to her lips once again. You're the first person she'd fall in love with, so she wouldn't notice something like your gender. Age: 21<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika: An over energetic and rather violent (in a playful matter) security guard. Mika is quite obese, yet she moves like she weighs nothing and is quite cute. Mika is almost always eating and acts like she's nine years old with her juvenile attitude and always needing to be scolded. You're often the victim of her horseplay, but that may just mean she like you...in light of being both girls. Age: 26<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does this begin?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You take a deep breath as you look ahead. In front of you is a massive elegant mansion, decorated with various statues and surrounded by fields of elegant of gardens. The mansion makes your apartment look like a mouse hole in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now it belonged to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found out recently that your uncle Lucas had recently passed away and left everything he had to you. Apparently he had no next of kin, but was close to your parents. His house and wealth were all yours now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and walk up to the door, opening it to see a row of women all waiting for you. Two of them were maids; one was a red head with a bit of a scary look to her face and the other was a somewhat plump albino girl with white. Next to them was a small girl dressed up in a chef's outfit with two black ponytails. She looked like a little girl, but something was a bit off. The two women next to them however made the three look small in comparision. One was an amazon of a woman, having somewhat built tanned body, dressed in a doctor's outfit. The other was a very fat girl with blonde hair, squeezed into a security guard type uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Mistress!\" shouted the girls in unison, as they bowed to you. You figured they must have been your house staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor lady walked over to you and smiled, \"My, your uncle didn't tell us you were so cute,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...thank you...?\" you blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Suzu. Your uncle's doctor. He insisted on having me around especially in his later years,\" explained the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mimi! Nice to meet you! I'll make you a yummy yummy meal that's sure to give you energy for whatever late night activites you have planned!\"  smiled the little chef girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay...what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mika!\" shouted the fat security girl, giving you a big squishy, yet somewhat crushing hug. \"You can depend on me to keep your home safe,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scary-looking red head then said, \"Hmmph...I'm Anya...I'll serve you as it is my job...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" went the albino girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's Kate. She's a mute, so she doesn't talk. It's a long story,\" answered Suzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and said, \"Well I guess my uncle definitely was a man...he had all such beautiful women around him. I don't even know what he looked like,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's him over the mantle,\" said Suzu, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and your jaw drops. WHOA!!!! That photo you saw was of the biggest, fattest man you ever had seen in your life. You wondered how much of him WASN'T in the photo. He had a big smile on his fat mustached face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my uncle? Wow...\" you sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It'll be a challenge meeting his requirements for the inheritance,\" Suzu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, didn't you know? You don't get to keep the inheritance unless you can gain 700 lbs over the next three years,\" said Suzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAY WHAT?!!!</span></div></div>",

Mimi, despite her stocky build, is quickly pulling you away with little effort towards what you assume is the kitchen, a smile formed on her childish face as you feel your heels drag across the floor, the heels of your shoes making a squeaking noise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry ma'am! I'll make you all kinds of yummy food and tasty treats! You'll probably get a million times bigger than you need to in three years~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder. Even if it is hyperbole, something about her words makes you hesitant to assume it's impossible she'd make you so absurdly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey hold on, at least let me give my answer first!\" You protest, kicking your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, the chef has already pulled you all the way into the dining hall with almost no sign of fatigue. The table stretches to an absurd degree, suggesting that it was made so in preparation for a large number of dinner guests. Mimi stops and tosses you effortlessly into the chair at the head of the table, a huge throne of mahogany and cedar with admittedly comfortable padding on it. Even with how massive your uncle was, looking at this chair gives you a feeling he, to put it lightly, thought ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold on a moment mistress. You may want to loosen that belt right now while I get your meal ready.\" Mimi said, her tone and mannerisms becoming more mature so suddenly you almost feel your head spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby chef soon left for the kitchen. You sigh to yourself, wondering if she's arm wrestling partners with that (what was her name again, Suzu?) Amazoness looking doctor woman. You feel a bit uncomfortable looking around. Sure, it's nice your uncle left you all this in lieu of not having any other blood relatives but it feels like it's a bit much. Not to mention the fact you have to get obese if you're even going to inherit it all! Sure, you had thoughts of...gaining weight, but they were mostly fleeting ones. And...the women did look cute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I thinking?!\" You mutter to yourself as you shake your head. The whole weight (pun unintended) of the situation feels like a bit much, but your uncle DID leave you all this in his passing. It wouldn't really be respectful to him to just pass this up...plus you admittedly do feel kind of famished.</span></div></div>",

Abrubtly, you are hoisted out of the limousine and tossed carelessly to the pavement. As you lay there, spooked out of your wits with a sore jaw, your eyes travel upward to meet the gaze of an older gentleman. Someone you immediately recognize: \"Uncle Lucas!\" you shout in a mixture of confusion and fear, wriggling about on the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a silent lookover, only to turn right back to the driver, \"Taiga, my boy?\" he states plainly, \"Was it really necessary to hogtie the child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to!\" your kidnapper grunts as he fiddles with the ropes holding back your wrists, \"I asked him to get in the car and he ran away!\" You arch your back to get delegate, \"I thought you were gonna do wierd sexual stuff to me, or mug me or something!!\" your voice is hoarse from all the screaming, \"And you gagged me- that doesn't help!!\" Taiga chuckles, \"While I <i>would</i> like to do some weird sexual stuff to you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taiga, that's enough.\" your uncle steps in, ouutstretching a friendly hand to help you off the ground, \"No need to frighten him.\" You can't help but add 'that's already been done' to his sentence. \"Yes, sir.\" he says nonchalantly, walking back over to the driver's side. \"Nephew, say hello to Taiga, my personal chauffer.\" Uncle Lucas chuckles. \"Hi... Taiga...\" you awkwardly wave to your former abductor, who winks flirtatiously and purses his lips in response, \"Let me know if you're up for any of that weird, sexual stuff you mentioned earlier.\" Taiga purrs as he hops back into the driver's seat and starts to park. While you are more than a little put off by his advances, your uncle merely chuckles, \"Oh he's a scamp, that one.\" Scamp.

He asks how your folks are, how living on your own was, and if his favorite nephew was getting married anytime soon (\"Come on now, Uncle, I'm still young!\") And in turn, you asked how he was holding up in his estate after retiring from a long life of working hard (\"Retirement, pheh.\") And after a few more cups of tea and a trip to the bathroom, your dear Uncle Lucas sprung quite a suprise on you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're moving to France?\" your voice cracks slightly from suprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, not moving my boy!\" he chuckles, \"Simply housesitting for an old friend, though if I like it I may pick up and move...\" you watch as your eccentric uncle loses his train of thought. \"And... you brought me here to tell me that you're going to France?\" your excitement grows at the thought of travelling abroad, simply sitting in first class on an airplane satisfy you. \"No, wrong again!\" he says, picking up his cup for one last sip of herbal tea, \"While I'm house sitting in Europe, I need <i>you</i> to stay here and keep things in order!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your heartbeat race, confusion ensuing yet again, you can't feel your toes; \"Wh-What?!\" you almost scream in your suprise. \"Yes, yes, while I'm gone I need you to stay here and take care of my affairs, don't worry I trust you!\" he chuckles gleefully, \"It has to beat living in that overpriced studio apartment.\" He <i>did</i> have a point there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well when are you leaving?!\" you ask, watching as the elderly man stands up. \"In about an hour or so.\" he says plainly, grabbing his hat from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twitch, \"Uncle Lucas, you're nuts.\" </span></div></div>",

Your jaw really hurt from were you ended up frenching the concrete like that. The possibility of a chipped tooth, or maybe worse, isn't that far off of a possibility. And one that you can't seem to keep tucked away in the back of your mind either, with every step you took up these stairs your jaw started to hurt a little more. \"Great.\" you grumble through your pinky finger and the intense throbbing pain experienced in your lower masticate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree flights of stairs and a state of total disbelief had done little to help your grumpiness. On top of getting abducted off the streets, you had been thrown head first into your uncle's driveway and then sexually harassed by your abductor. But on the other hand, you were handed a big mansion on a silver platter and a plane ticket. So things weren't <i>too</i> bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept telling that to yourself as you walked further down the hallway, mumbling to yourself that this was just like those extended stays with relatives around the holidays; \"Just without the relatives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour uncle's words repeat themselves over and over in your head, \"Go to my living quarters, feel free to make yourself at home!\" You couldn't help but notice the one problem with his statement- without anything to \"be at home\" with, just how exactly were you supposed to <b>do</b> that?! An exasperated sigh escapes your lips as you come to your room, er-rather, Uncle Lucas' room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrap your hands around the doorknob, still warm, and push on the heavy fixture. Your eyes widen slightly in acknowledgment of the room's layout. He seemed to be a fan of lilac, the soft color decorates his walls, his curtains, and even his bedsheets. The floor is tiled and kept pristine white, a color shared in the luxurious love seat laid out to face the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour uncle's choice of words hit home as you take a seat at the foot of your new comfortable bed, laying down with your feet still firmly planted on the floor. You release a contented sigh, closing your eyes for a second so you can breath. After all, if anyone deserved a breather, it would be you. What with the kidnapping and the gray hairs your uncle was surely going to give you. But then again, if everything was as nice and comfy as this bed, maybe this little vacation wouldn't be so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel the other side of the bed sink. After a cute little yawn, a voice says, \"Excuse me, I must have fallen asleep while I was waiting for you... that loveseat sure is comfortable.\" You can feel the foreign body inch closer to you, an arm stretching to touch your chest in hopes of a little nap time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shoot wide open to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nMimi: Your new chef. She is quite short and chubby, and her cute little babyface and lack of proportions would suggest she is the youngest. In reality, she is actuallly one of the older girls and talks in a mix of childish words and rather risque adult language. Mimi has two long black ponytails, usually wears her chef uniform, and comes up to just above your stomach when you stand next to her. Mimi is always cheerful, but may be hiding an inner pain that only you can help her with. Mimi has already become fond of you and often feels you up by accident, so a lesbian relationship isn't beyond her tastes. Age: 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai: A flamboyant and energetic young man who handles tailoring for you and your servants. He likes to dress like a girl at times and often tries to put you in cute outfits as well despite your objections. Sai is even skinnier than Keichi and could be mistaken for a girl at times. One wonder if there's something to to this. Age: 23<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzu: The house doctor and an amazon of a woman. She is tanned, somewhat muscular, and has an enormous bust of all your girls. Suzu is a brilliant doctor, far beyond her years and those of older doctors, curing several problems related to obesity. Suzu seems rather fond of teasing you like a plaything, but you may get through to the real her yet! As Suzu likes playing with you, its no wonder she'd be a lesbian. Age: 24<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyujin: A tall and a bit imtimidating man from China of little words, but a senstive side hidden within. He is your chef and has a fondness for the best ingredients. Age: 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumi: A rather cute and plump young man who looks like he could be an elementary school student, but is actually older than Keichi and Sai. (Think Hunny from Ouran). He is your gardener and often is playing on stuff like a kid. But why does he never let anyone in his room? Age: 24<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does this begin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You will now live in his mansion to take over his business and continue the family lineage. Among your inheritance is a wealth of servants of various personalities and such. But little did you know that there great weight gain involved...will it be yours or theirs? And just what kind of servants are you expecting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive is for all folks of sexual preferances, but do not try and change a storyline that has been set. This interactive will give you the choice of being a feeder of your servants, their feedee, or that you both gain as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo fat-haters or gay-bashers. If this is appauling you, then I must ask you to be mature and leave right now. For those remaining, enjoy. And may you find love among the walls of soft flesh you will encounter</td>",
