To be more specific, you were on the rug located in the office. It was vacant as of now, so you took some liberty to look around. There were the messy floorboards, cluttered files, worn darts, and a fancy entrance to a mouse hole. You bit your lip. You start making your way to the closest desk (Which was Max's) and you started to inch up. About halfway up, suddenly, the door to the office flung open, and the duo had arrived. Surprised by the sudden entrance of the bunny and canine, you almost lose your grip, but you manage to hang tight. They both sat at their desks, and you had a choice to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I go on Max's desk now that they are here? Or should I just get Max's attention here?</span></div></div>",

If nothing goes wrong, then you could simply get to the top of his desk and wave your arms around until he sees you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost at the top of the desk when Max ruined your entire plan with one simple move. Max, being as bored as he was, decided to stretch his legs, but when he did he tilted the desk. You were able to keep your grip on the desk while it was tilting. Then, the table slammed down into its original position quickly, knocking you off of your perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were free falling towards the wooden floor, ready for your death but... it never came. <br>\r\nYou were stuck between two soft surfaces in a hot area. You found that you couldn't move your arms as the two surfaces kept you wedged firmly in place. Did you dare open your eyes? The area was getting hotter by the second and you could feel a multiple strands of something rubbing against your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly opening your eyes, you see nothing but white fur. You're covered in sweat but it's not yours. Then it comes to you! Max must've moved his foot under you at the last second and now you're trapped in between two of his large furry toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's sweat dripped down the hairs of his paws until they dropped on your head. Max, not even feeling you, chooses to wiggle his toes. You are pushed deep into the damp walls of Max's fur and some of the dirt and sweat gets in your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to handle this anymore, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

It was just another normal day for Max and he couldn't help thinking to himself that he needed something to do..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was a standard day for Max, you couldn't exactly say the same for yourself. You were halfway up Max's desk before you had fallen of from shock. You were still discombobulated and needed something to lean on. You stumble around for a bit before your hand finally finds a surface to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, you thought that you were leaning against the desk but the surface was furry and let off an indescribable aroma. You pulled yourself together and looked at the object. It was a paw?! Your eyes tracked the fluffy paw up to the leg of an oddly human-esque rabbit. This wasn't just any paw it was the giant paw of an even more giant Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the fur on the paw and hoisted yourself up. You ran across the expansive foot and began to climb Max's leg. You didn't exactly have a plan but you thought that it shouldn't be too hard to get Max's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing the leg, you are now standing in between his two legs and resting your head on Max's stomach. You look up the rabbit's humongous body and...</span></div></div>",

You have no idea how you got there, nor why everything is so big. . .or you being SMALL rather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feel of the air was strange, your senses jumbled, the feeling of being the size of a common bug was a strange jump from your normal size. However, deciding to get some answers and trying to reverse this you crawl underneath the bottom of the door, just barely being able to fit under it. your chest pressed against the cold wood floor in order to squeeze through. After what feels like a half hour of squeezing and squirming through the tight space you finally make it out from under there, now standing and able to take a deep breath you then realize the grave situation your in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if no one sees you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if no cares?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the size of a bug? Who would pay attention to one your size? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts cycle through your mind, as you scan the environment. A flurry of movement catches your attention and you see a wall of brown fur crash down in front of you, inches away from your body (in your perspective). a large canine's foot had casually stepped in front of you, he was placing his hat on its rack and just as soon as the warm foot had landed in front of you it dissapeared, walking across the room to a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

As you began your long journey foward, something on the dog's desk had caught your eye. It was a little plaque with \"Sam\" written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be his name\" you thought to yourself as you finally reached the leg of his desk. You could see his foot resting only a few feet away from you. As you walked toward it, You looked up and noticed how the dog towered over you. Even at your normal size he would be taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were distracted by the giant canine, you accidentally walked face first into a wall of fur. The fur was warm and sweaty, yet oddly comfortable. You were too distracted to notice that you had walked right in between two of the canine's massive toes. They rose over you and covered you with their rotten yet earthly scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's time to do what you came here to do. Breathing in as much (slightly smelly) air as possible, you screamed at the top of your lungs <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>SAAAAAAM</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelled as loud as you could but Sam didn't even nudge. You wouldn't even know if he was awake if it wasn't for his finger tapping on his desk rhythmically. This couldn't cut it. You had to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed onto the fur in front of you and began to hoist yourself up. The foot was a little wet with Sam's sweat and the smell was starting to get to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had finally reached the top of Sam's massive foot and began to gather you (even more smelly now) air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SAAAAAAAAAAAM</b></span></div></div>",
