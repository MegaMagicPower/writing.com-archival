He was tired, already wanting go to home despite the shift being just over an hour old. He could only hope that his shift was uneventful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll day long there was an unshakable feeling in his gut. From the moment he woke up something just felt off. By the second it seemed to get worse and worse. In defiance of the air conditioning Jesse quickly became drenched in sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get back to my office.\" He thought to himself as a wave of lightheadedness swept over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step his condition worsened and it quickly became difficult to walk. His vision darkened as he dropped to his knees. Falling face first on the floor Jesse blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily stirring back awake Jesse noticed <br>\r\na rhythmic thudding reverberated through the ground. As he struggled to push back to his knees the thudding grew stronger. Finally able to sit up and look around Jesse's jaw dropped to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fucking way.\" He said in complete disbelieving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it seemed impossible Jesse was now only 1 cm tall. That terrifying realization led to another. The rhythmic thuds were actually footsteps, and they were growing louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing to his feet quickly Jesse turned around to see an absolutely gigantic person walking towards him. Jesse instantly recognized the giant as....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was rare that Rosie wore anything other than tennis shoes, but she had somewhere to be after work. Jesse and her had a good working relationship, and he knew that she would help him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosie! Help me!\" He called out as he jumped up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was practically on top of him before she suddenly stopped. Jesse was elated to see that she was looking straight down at him. \"Yes! It's me! Help me, I've been shrunk!\" He cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran towards her jumping up and down excitedly. Rosie brought her right foot into the air above him. \"No!\" He screamed as it dropped towards him mercilessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiving out of the way Jesse pushed back to his feet. Realizing that she thought he was a bug he decided to run away and fast as he could. He knew he would have to find a better way to be found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Rosie hadn't given up on squashing what she thought was a bug. Her foot slammed down again just behind Jesse sending him tumbling across the floor. Jesse rolled onto his back in time to see her moving above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Stop! Don't squish me!\" He screamed as her foot rose again. Suddenly Rosie....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Knowing there was no way she would miss Jesse opens his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up he sees Rosie pulling a napkin from her pocket. She began to kneel down towards him. Still panicked from the attempts to crush him Jesse pushes back to his feet. As fast as he could he ran towards a near by door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Rosie is able to catch up to him easily. His path is blocked by her foot once again. He falls down, and begins scurrying backwards. Rosie swings her foot over top of the tiny supervisor. \"No, please. Stop!\" He cries out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie lowers her foot until the sole of her sandal is pressing into Jesse. Unable to move Jesse is doesn't understand why he is still alive. \"What are you doing?\" He shouts out in desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer him Rosie's foot slowly tilts off of him. He sees an opening and begins to crawl out. Just as he exits from under the sandal the napkin falls around him. In one quick motion Rosie closes her hand and snatches Jesse up from the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld captive in her palm Jesse's heart raced wildly. He didn't understand what was happening, but was thankful not to be crushed. As he was carried, he decided to just relax, and wait to see what happens.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk was only a few minutes before Rosie returned to her office. Jesse felt the napkin shifting before he fell out. With a plop he landed in a open plastic container. A life was snapped in just as he looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell inside the container was strong. The floor was coated in a thick green liquid. Jesse groaned realizing he was in a left over sauce container from Rosie's lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse toppled over as the container was lifted into the air. Suddenly in front of him was one of Rosie's enormous brown eyes. She was staring right at him, but didn't seem to recognize that he wasn't a bug. \"Rosie! It's me! Jesse!\" He screamed, pounding on the plastic walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie responded by shaking the container around. Jesse was tossed violently inside, becoming coated in the green sauce. \"You're one weird ugly bug.\" Rosie said as she sat in her office chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set the container down, and returned to work. Jesse just sat against wall feeling defeated. He knew he had to find a way to escape, and prove he wasn't a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Jesse heard someone else come into the office. He recognized the person as Gladys, an older Hispanic woman, and friend of Rosie's. She was also one of the janitorial staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spoke for several minutes before Rosie pointed to the container Jesse was in. \"It's a strange bug, I found in building 3.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys leaned in looking closely at Jesse before carelessly tapping the top of the container. Each tap might as well have been a gunshot. Grimacing, Jesse covered his ears tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting. Why on earth did you catch it ?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie shrugged. \"Well.....</span></div></div>",

He knew that until someone let him out, he was trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched from his plastic prison as Rosie got caught up in work as usual. She hadn't so much as glanced his way in over an hour. She finally looked up at the clock and realized it was getting late. \"Shit!\" She said, in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing to her feet quickly she began to gather her things. She was nearly to the door before she turned back. Marching back to her desk she snatched the container up, sending Jesse slamming into the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enormous hand wrapped completely around the container as she made her way to Christine's office. Jesse was sloshed back and forth with every exaggerated sway of her arm. Unable to grasp hold of anything in the smooth container he was completely at her mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stopped in front of Christine's work area. She set the container down on her desk with a heavy thump. \"I found this is building 3.\" She said, and Jesse struggled to pick himself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine looked at her with confusion as she plucked the container into the air. \"A sauce cup ?\" She asked tilting the container back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's a big bug.\" Rosie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine peered inside spotting the sauce coated Jesse. \"Okay, so why are you bringing it to me ?\" She asked, still confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't seen one like it before. It's weird looking.\" Rosie explained. \"I was hoping you could schedule the exterminator this weekend ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA curious Christine slowly popped the top off of the container. \"Careful.\" Rosie warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse's heart raced as fresh air, and light poured in. \"Christine! Help me! It's Jesse!\" He screamed, and he waves his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine stared down studying his tiny form. \"It looks aggressive. Like it's challenging me, or something.\" She said, misreading Jesse's body language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It ran right at me!\" Rosie said, agreeing with Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" Jesse screamed. \"It's me Jesse! I need your help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine brought her phone up and snapped a picture of Jesse. The flash nearly blinded him, forcing him to cower away. \"Fuck!\" He yelled in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked back he saw the tip of a ballpoint pen hovering above him. Christine poked at him roughly. Slamming him against the side of the container. She used the pen to turn him every which way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I'll send the picture to the exterminator, and see what hey say.\" Christine said, pulling the pen away, and popping the lid back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. Let me know what he says.\" Rosie said, turning to leave. \"I've got to go I'm already running late. Do you mind taking care of that? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine grabs the container from her table and......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instantly she began to walk again, her purse held tightly under her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse realized the container was on its side, and quickly began to push against the lid. At his tiny size he might well have tried pushed over a brick wall. \"Damn it!\" He growled kicking the container repeatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his tantrum Rosie tossed her purse haphazardly into the passenger seat. Jesse slammed violent against the lid of the container. He slumped down in the green sauce and didn't bother to stand back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours past by as Rosie went about the rest of her day. Jesse was tossed around by her every careless movement. He was always thankful whenever she dropped her purse for extended periods of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jesse heard Rosie enter her home. He could tell by the sounds of her daughter, and granddaughter welcoming her. He heard the front door close before the purse swung through the air. It hit the wall before being hung on a hook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the giantesses walking away Jesse felt a lump forming in his throat. He realized that Rosie may have forgot about her tiny captive. A fact proven as the hours ticked by, and the house grew silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted Jesse decided to eat some of the green sauce, and try to sleep. He knew there was way he would survive this starving and sleep deprived. Leaning back against the curved wall of the container Jesse fell asleep surprisingly fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse was startled awake as the container began to move.

Peering out the side of the container Jesse saw Rosie's chubby barefeet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse realized that he was still in Rosie's house. With everything going on he forgot that yesterday was Friday. Now on a Saturday morning Rosie sat in her living room on her laptop, while watching the morning news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had set her purse in front of the couch, when it tipped over the container rolled under the edge of her coffee table. As She reached down to sit the purse back upright it was obvious she hadn't noticed the container. Jesse watched as she returned to work on her laptop without a second glance downward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooked around the container, that was balanced on its  side. To his shock he saw that in all the commotion the lid had popped off slightly. There was a small gap along one edge that he could fit his arm through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the giantess above Jesse quickly got to work on the lid. Through repeating prying, and pushing the gap grew larger. Eventually it looked large enough for Jesse to squirm through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation Jesse began to push through the opening. It was tight, but he was quickly halfway through. Sudden movement drew his attention back towards Rosie. His eyes went wide as her foot slid forward. \"Shit!\" He cursed loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he fell from the container Rosie's toes dropped onto it. He watched as the plastic buckled under the weight. The lid he worked so hard to barely budge, popped off effortlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie's foot quickly pulled back as she looked down to see what she hit. Jesse's eyes went wide as she saw him. \"Crap!\" She said remembering the insect she caught she day before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse turned to run away as fast as he could. Without looking back he heard the couch creak as Rosie pushed to her feet. Breathing heavily he hid behind the leg of the coffee table. Peeking around the corner he watched Rosie's bare feet as she moved around to see where he had went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie knelt down, looking under the coffee table. Jesse cowered in the corner hoping to remain out of sight. He yelped as her hand shot under the table, sweeping the floor to find him. \"Fuck!\" He whispered under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo fast for him to react Rosie's fingers knock him into the table leg. While he's disoriented her fingers easily pluck him into the air. Held in her unbreakable grip Jesse looks up at an extremely annoyed Rosie. \"Rosie! Stop! It's Jesse!\" He screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her grip tightened intending to crush him Jesse acts out of desperation. With all of his might he chomps down on Rosie's finger. The giantess winces and releases Jesse. The tiny supervisor finds himself falling quickly through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lands with a cushioned plop on the couch below. Rosie quickly spots him and resumes her attack. Jesse barely had time to react as her hand comes down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse feels extreme pressure on his entire body. Fortunately his tiny form, and the plush couch keep him from being obliterated. Though alive Jesse is barely conscious, and unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Rosie, Jesse looks dead, she lifts his limp body roughly between her thumb and forefinger.  The giantess leaves the living room to toss the tiny supervisor into....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When the container stopped it was sitting upright in front of Christine's sandal clad feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jesse could even react the giantess brought her foot down on the container. The plastic walls buckled under the pressure. Jesse cowered in the center of the cup, his tiny form saving his life. Even as Christine added pressure and twisted her foot she couldn't fully collapse the container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine's foot lifted off of the container setting back down beside it. With the pressure removed the plastic partially popped back in place. Jesse noticed the cup of the container was separated from the lid. Without hesitation he crawled through as the giantess knelt down to retrieve the crushed container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Christine growled spotting the escaping Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse narrowly avoids the first swipe of a giant hand. Then somehow even the second, but the third sends him to the ground. Christine's fingers slam down on top of him with force. Jesse tries to push them away, but he's no match for even her index finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggles desperately as Christine pulls him back into the open. Jesse frantically chomps down on her finger causing her to yelp. Absentmindedly Christine flicks her wrist sending the tiny supervisor flying through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe annoyed giantess scans the floor, and her desk for Jesse, but doesn't see him.

Stopping occasionally to sweep up anything she found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite only working for the company for a few days Jesse had seen how thoroughly she cleaned. He knew this was his best bet for being found. Rushing towards the giantess he began waving his arms. \"Yasmin! It's me Jesse!\" He screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected Jesse was quickly spotted. \"Yes!\" He called out as Yasmin looked down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin took a couple steps forward, quickly towering directly over Jesse. She leaned in closer only to quickly pull away. Jesse could barely react in time as she jabbed at him with the broom. Dozens of thick bristles knocked him to the ground. With a quick twist she brought the broom up again, before dropping it back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSore, but mostly uninjured Jesse groaned on the floor in pain. The massive opening of the dustpan appeared in front of him an instant before the bristles returned. This time they slung him roughly into the dark cavernous expanse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yasmin lifted the dustpan the head tilted back sending Jesse falling into a pile of dust, hair and other trash. He couldn't believe that she had mistaken him for a bug. It was humiliating, but he was thankful she didn't just step on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess carried on with her work, seeking out loose debris to sweep up.

Her heavyset build making her appear all the more enormous. Jesse watched in disbelief as she grew closer, and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse wrestled with indecision, unsure if he should run, or call up to the giantess. Unfortunately Jesse underestimated how quickly the Emily could cover ground. In only a few strides ahead was right on top of him. \"Fuck!\" He screamed falling backwards as her foot, clad in black sneaker slammed down in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny supervisor scurried backwards in panic. He craned his head upward, but couldn't see Emily's face past her bulging belly. The reality of being so tiny was setting in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Jesse tried to think rationally. Making a decision quickly Jesse ran back towards the massive shoe. With Emily stopped at an office door he began to climb up her shoe. He just pulled himself up to the laces when Emily began to walk again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding on tightly to the giant laces Jesse felt like he was on a roller coaster. One that was going to cause him to lose all of his lunch. Clenching his eyes closed Jesse focused on his breathing as Emily finished her rounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty minutes of the worst carnival ride ever Jesse was elated to see Emily walk into the security office. She mercifully sat back in her chair to watch the monitors. It took another five minutes for Jesse to even think about moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse looked up the length of Emily's leg as she sat relaxed in the chair. Taking a deep breath he prepared for the next part of his plan, to climb the giantess. He hoped that if he could get close enough she could hear his cries for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jesse could begin his climb......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Emily's feet lowered towards the desk her legs crossed at the ankles. Jesse was knocked off by the impact as her heels hit the desk. He fell onto the white desktop below with a small plop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an annoyed groan he pushed back to his feet. He realized that Emily's stretched out position would make it easier to climb her body. \"Well, I guess there's that at least.\" He sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocused on his original plan Jesse didn't notice how much he stood out on the on the desk top. Just as beloved back towards Emily's shoe it retreated off of the desk. \"What the fuck ?\" He asked in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to see Emily staring right at him. \"Emily! Help me!\" He called out to her as she leaned in closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's massive thumb and forefinger reached down, effortlessly picking Jesse up. She opened her hand letting him roll into her palm. \"I'm going crazy. There's no way this is a tiny person.\" She said, her blue eyes laser focused on Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse pushed back to his feet, feeling uneasy standing on the giant hand. \"It's really me! It's Jesse!\" He called out hoping she could hear his tiny voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily exhaled nervously, unintentionally knocking Jesse down with her hot, moist breath. The tiny supervisor was growing frustrated, and desperate. \"Emily! It's me damn it.\" He yells as loudly as he can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay.\" Emily began. \"You're really...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She breathed in and out slowly several times. After one last deep breath she sat back up, and looked closer at Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who are you ?\" She asked, narrowing her eyes. \"And, how the hell did you get so tiny ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse nearly fell as she raised her head to her eyes. The massive blue orbs focusing hard, trying to recognize a person at such a tiny size. \"I think I know you!\" Emily said, an excited crack in her voice. \"You're the housekeeping supervisor! Jesse!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been found, and recognized. Jesse literally jumped for joy on the giant palm. \"Yes! Yes! It's me!\" He yelled repeatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so freaky.\" Emily said. \"So how did you shrink ? Did someone shrink you? Maybe a shrink ray ?\" She shook her head at her own questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how, I just shrunk!\" Jesse yelled up, but she still couldn't hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily continued to look over Jesse with child like curiosity. \"Sorry little dude, I just can't hear you.\" She said apologetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse groaned at being called little dude, but ignored it. There really wasn't anything he could do about it. A thought that sent a shiver down his spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People don't just shrink randomly.\" Emily said perplexed. \"There has to be a reason why you're so itty bity.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Jesse realized he preferred being called little dude. \"Just call for help!\" He shouted up in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless of course,\" Emily continued, unaware of Jesse's frustration. \"You shrank yourself. Is that it little dude ? Living out some weird fantasies?\" She asked with a slight giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse groaned, suddenly wishing he'd been found by someone more helpful. \"No, I did not shrink myself.\" He said with a annoyed sigh. \"Will you please just call someone to help me!\" He screamed up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had a look of amusement on her face. \"Yeah, that's probably it.\" She said laughing. \"Giant chicks turn you on ?\" She asked with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse's heart sank like a rock. He took a step back without realizing it. \"What, that's insane! Please, this isn't a joke!\" He yelled, his voice uneasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your lucky day little dude,\" Emily said with a devious grin. \"I'm going to make all your dreams come true.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse barely had time to react before Emily....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the blink of an eye he was held under the gaping maw of the security supervisor. \"No, no, no, what are you doing?!\" He yelled panicked \"Stop, this isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's humid breath rolled over him like a thick blanket. Her plump lips pressed against her palm,  surrounding Jesse. He saw the flicker of movement before being struck. Without warning Jesse was held firmly in place by Emily's saliva coated tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" He gurgled, choking on the giantess's spit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive tongue began to work over Jesse's body with force, and surprising precision. Emily focused on his face, before working her way downward. To his shock, and embarrassment Jesse's body betrayed him to the heat and pressure of the writhing tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pulled away, leaving Jesse panting heavily. \"Did you know the tip of the tongue is the most sensitive part of your body ?\" She asked rhetorically. \"So, I know you're enjoying yourself little dude.\" She said with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse was too exhausted to react as Emily's finger dropped down on his spit soaked body. She drug her finger down his body. Her finger nail catching the buckle of his belt. With an effortless tug she ripped it, and his pants to shreds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her finger retreated Jesse tried to cover himself up. pulling together the tatters of his turn pants. \"Emily, stop this! Just call for help. I won't tell anyone.\" He pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lose the rest of the clothes little dude.\" Emily ordered firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse refused. \"No! This isn't happening!\" He shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily narrowed her eyes. \"C'mon little dude. I've been nice so far. I don't have to be.\" She said matter-of-factly. \"Maybe I was mistaken, and you are just a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jesse could move Emily brought her thumb down on his entire body. The giantess added more and more pressure. Jesse felt his joints pop, and tendons stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Emily raised her thumb off of Jesse before any permanent damage could occur. \"Off with the clothes.\" Emily ordered again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSore, and frightened Jesse began to strip away his remaining clothes. He felt uncomfortable with Emily staring down at him so intently. The amount of enjoyment she was getting from her power over him was terrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was naked Emily swept the clothes away with her finger. Without hesitation she lowered her mouth back over Jesse. Her powerful tongue went back to work, quickly getting his body to react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's tongue writhed up and down Jesse's penis until he was ready to explode. He pushed back against her tongue, but it was like holding back the tide. In a few short moment he came with force. His cum splattering against her tongue, before being quickly washed away in the saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pulled away with a satisfied smile. \"Now was that so bad little dude ?\" She asked, giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse lay splayed on her palm in a pool of the giantess's spit. He felt used, and humiliated, but most of all he felt powerless. He knew that he was completely at the mercy of Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I should really get back to work little dude,\" Emily said. \"But don't worry, I'm going to put you somewhere safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse was haphazardly lifted between the giantess's fingers. Looking out he saw Emily was going to put him.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
