I've heard about you, the people call you a walking, talking insect. I was intrigued by you, so I simply bought you for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bought me...? I... what in the world is that supposed to mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that I paid for your capture, and now I own you. You belong to me, isn't that a wonderful gift for you, my little pet?\" Devin winked as his mouth curved into a smug grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are you going to do with me?...\" </span></div></div>",

My royal duties are proving to be a bore so I'll need a pet to entertain me, and a cute one at that~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed despite the worry. \"H-how am I supposed to entertain...you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin smirked as he rose so his torso loomed over you.

Shifting his body, Devin laid his body down and rested his head on his bend arm that exposed his pit of blond hairs against the tan skin.

The appendage was long and had black pointed nails at the end, meaning that the demon stopped you with his foot. Another boom came behind you as the giant now had you between his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, a blush formed as the two maroon towers led to a dark area uncovered by the loincloth. From above the horned being looked over his pecs as he slyly smirked and scouted down to bring his hulking body lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come now I didn't even introduce myself yet!\", the demon said in a joking manner. \"I'm known as Dyon, I would give you my full title but it doesn't really have any meaning anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply stared as Dyon held his buff body over you. Fear gripped you as any moment he could lower himself furthur and crush you under his bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please just can I go!?\", you desperately cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDyon raised an eyebrow but simply grinned. \"Hmm, I'm hurt human. I don't really get any company and when an interesting human shows up you want to leave me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon chuckled and bounced his hairy pecs.\" Nahh, you and me are gonna spend some time together!

Now why would I want to do that? I just want to have a bit of fun with my new 'friend', is that so bad?\" Dyon asked with a playfully evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDyon sat down on top of a rock and held you in front of his bulging pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like my body, little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, you're really... really huge.\" You could imagine yourself being crushed into a pulp between the two humongous, hairy pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'd like to explore my muscles, hmmm? Or maybe I'll stuff you somewhere myself.\" Dyon licked his lips and pinched you between his giant fingers, rolling you around \"I have to say, you're quite cute for a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the comment, \"Thanks... you're handsome for a... demon.\" You said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDyon lifted his free arm and flexed his bicep, the muscle bulged and veins popped out as he cockily wiggled his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, which part of my body do you wish to see up close, little companion? Or shall I choose for you?\"</span></div></div>",

His cause of death remains unknown but the ghost is often mistaken as a yokai for how michivious he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had the appearance of his sixteen year old body with a lean muscle built under a blue yukata. However as a ghost his skin is chalk white as well as his spiky shoulder length hair and his eyes are a sharp blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItazu enjoys messing with any living beings that come through the forest.

While your father was carrying you feel out of his pocket and were stranded before the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking through the blades of tree height grass, you found a sickly looking tree stretching into the sky. Before you could observe furthur a chuckle rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe didn't know bugs could be ghosts~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, one of the branches now had someone sitting on it. A ghostly young boy was smirking while swinging his large feet. The ghost suddenly floated down and landed close enough to that you were between his feet. You took notice that the boy's feet had a stench even though he may be a ghost. You hurt your neck as you looked up at the smirking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um I-I'm not a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItazu's smirk turned toothy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if your not a bug.....</span></div></div>",
