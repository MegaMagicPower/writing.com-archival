Light and dark used their power together to create five essential powers, Earth, Fire, Water, Wind, and Phase, called the Hand. Each of these powers were given to a unique race of creature that would depend on the power for survival and if they would lose their power they would surely die. Each of these unique races were declaired a Lord, a power warrior and ruler whose power is almost divine, and a planet for them to rule. For countless centuries the lords lived in a long lasting peace under the two laws given to them by their creators, no Lord shall declare war against another lord and no lord shall kill another lord. This peace was disturbed by Darks lust for evil and started a war with the world of Water which slowly spread to the other worlds. For 21 years, this war waged on with no end until the lords discovered who started the war and decided to end it by making a pact with one another to stop Dark. The lords challenged the Lord of Darkness to a fianl battle against his massive and increadible army on a deserted waistland on his world. The battle lasted 50 days until the Lord of Fire, Lord Incenerate defeated the Lord of Darkness in a fair battle. As Lord Incenerate attempted to take the final strike to end the war, a bright lighted person who was not the Lord of Light, spared the Lord of Darkenss life by casting evey lord back to their respective worlds in the blink of an eye. The Lord of Darkness was spared, but it came at a price. He was stripped of his title lord and powers were sealed to only be used in a life or death situation that is not natural.</span></div></div>",

My cry of angony dispates and I open my eyes to find myself standing in a crater. Listening to the burning of the near by trees, I look upon this world with no knowledge of who I am. Looking at my right hand I find myself wearing a dark suit of armor with a long dark bladed sword that is strangly light. I feel heat from the sword coursing through my arm to the rest of my body. Glancing down, I notice a young boy standing at the edge of the crater staring at me with a sinister look of hatred in his eyes. The sounds of burning timbers moves from my mind as I look into this boys soul seeing a rage far greater than my own, but yet I suddenly move towards him. My face begins to smile and I swing my sword at the boy knowing he is out of my reach. My arm moves the blade so fast the air itself becomes a blade and cuts into the boys chest. The young boy falls back screaming in pain. I find myself uttering only a single phrase, \"In the name of the King!\" The boys blood quickly surrounds him as he lays helpless on the ground. I hover over him wielding the blade of my lightly weighted sword with bare finger tips over the young boys chest. The boys face is filled with fear, but yet he is prepared to die. I move my hand away and spare his life. Suddenly my body takes the sword and severs the boys head from his body in a single rapid motion. My body did not respond to my commands.</span></div></div>",
