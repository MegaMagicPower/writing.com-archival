Now... they live amongst humans, no longer a part of unseen nature or covert military operations. They live with humans, as friends, co-workers, employers, and sometimes they become presidents. However, that is if the world were perfect. Dragons are... looked down on, for it is natural for humans to dislike, or even attack, things that are better than them. That is why there are many dragons working on the underground, the black markets. Some are criminal overlords, while others are petty thieves. Out of all the nations, the Soviet Union seemed to have the most ones in their special forces, a total of 30. Now, the number of dragons in the civilized world is 100,000 , for they are allowed decent educations, and they excel in learning, for they adapt quicker, they are willing to learn. Most of them have adapted to walking on two legs, while some still walk on all fours. There were many species, but the humans did have a guide written on them, in terms of danger levels and such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith dragons, jobs weren't so high up. Long, winding staircases to reach high areas were no longer required when one could spread their wings on a good day and fly up there. But it was also easier to smuggle goods across boarders when you had the ability to prowl like a cat through a patrolled area. A whole new era of murders was upon the world, people would vanish, and a puddle of blood and a few scraps of meat were sometimes found later. It was chaos for law enforcement, as there would be very little evidence from the killer, besides a few drips of saliva, which were either in the blood(if any), or somewhere nearby. If they were lucky, the dragon would be nearby sleeping off its meal, and they wouldn't have to investigate deeply into it. There was chaos in the gangs, as there were occasionally dragons on both sides. Blood lined the streets in some places, and it wasn't uncommon for dragons to turn up with seemingly random objects in their stomachs, such as pistols and knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year into the introduction of dragons in society, there was an uproar. Some people tried hunting them, while some dragons had troubles not attacking injured humans. Both sides had problems. Both sides had their own fair share of supremacists, who believed that their race was the better. The human side were aided by their higher status, and knowledge of the cities. The dragon side was aided by powerful instincts, abilities such as various breath powers and some 'unusual' abilities. People turned up with no memories or not at all, while dragons turned up with no wings or not at all. Sometimes there would be shrunken humans in the black market.... Each side had weaknesses, and they had their strengths. Now... how will you survive in this world?</span></div></div>",

What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and rub your forehead, trying to relieve your aching head. After blinking the tears out of your eyes, you begin to take in your surroundings. You see cardboard, and it's everywhere, you're sitting in an entire room of it, and a small room at that. There are no doors or windows, the only light is coming in from a few holes poked into the wall. This is beginning to get surreal. You spring to your feet, starting to feel scared. This isn't a dream, is it? Wanting answers, you press your eye over one of the openings in the wall. What you see scares you even more. You see what seems to be an old dusty shed, the paint on the walls chipping, and holes in the ceiling. The whole room is filled with shelves, which are lined with cardboard boxes with holes in their sides. But thats not the worst part..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis room seems absolutely gigantic to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrendous memories of daytime talk shows suddenly flood your mind. People telling stories of barely managing to escape after being shrunken and kidnapped to be used as dragon food, or dragon sex toys. This is what happened to you!! You're dragon fodder now!! But you had a whole life ahead of you!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slap yourself in the face. \"Come on.. Calm down.. Calm down,\" you try to tell yourself, \"If they made it out alive, you can too and everything will be--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly a loud creak breaks the silence of the room, and you quickly shut your mouth. Looking though the peep hole again, you see that the door has opened and a harsh light has entered the room. It burns your eyes after being in the dark for so long, but you force yourself to keep them open. Who came in? A dragon or a person??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...It's a dragon. And a very large one too, with burnt orange scales and an admittedly nice complexion, but that doesn't matter right now. You're used to dragons being your size instead of godzilla sized, but you keep your cries of terror to yourself. The dragon looks around at the boxes lining the walls, seeming to be trying to pick one out. You shrink back to the opposite wall, mentally pleading 'Don't pick me up, don't pick me!'</span></div></div>",

You didn't get a lot of the ladies, but the fact that you knew magic made you valuable. The ability to use magic is rare for your kind, to maintain the arcane power of your non-anthro ancestors in this day and age was impressive. You knew no other dragons who had the ability to use magic, but that didn't really bother you. What mattered to you is how you used that magic. You used your magic for shrinking humans to sell as pets or toys, or even a good meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as long as you can remember humans picked on you for your race and size. They called you names, beat you up, and stole from you. You hated them for this and vowed that one day you would get your revenge and crush them like the insects they are. That day came near your high school graduation. Some humans decided to pick a fight with you when you and your friends were separated. They beat you to near death and nearly tore off one of your wings. Your not exactly sure what happened but you remember a bright flash of light then the human who had been pinning you to the side of the wall suddenly slackened his grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe and his friends screamed as they were enveloped in a light blue aura and started to shrink slowly. You were shocked the ones who had moments ago been beating you mercurially were now backing away from you terrified at what was happening to them. You got over your shock and imagined them getting smaller. They shrunk faster. You grinned and laughed. They figured you were behind this and quickly rushed you. You acted fast and instantly imagined them the size of bugs. They shrunk in mid-rush a slammed into your foot. After a few moments you estimated them to be about three inches tall. Overjoyed by this outcome you rose one of your feet and stepped on the nearest human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a satisfying crunch sound and when you lifted your foot there was a small pool of blood, guts and broken bones. You laughed again and before the other two humans could realize what had happened you stepped on them and crushed them as well. Grabbing a tissue out of your pocket you wiped up the remains and disposed of the evidence. You had murdered three humans in under a minute and cleaned up any signs of murder. Excited you jumped for joy and told your friends. They didn't believe you at first, but after a demonstration on a nearby human they were just as excited as you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you had a crazy idea. You would use your new found abilities to shrink the entire graduating class and sell them off as pets or toys to other dragons. Your friends who also were dragons and shared their hatred for the human race agreed to help you. Your plan succeeded without a hitch. You shrunk the human graduating class and made a killing. Since then you and your closest friends have gone into business together and are a huge success. Apparently the idea of owning a bug sized human to boss around or play with, is pretty appealing to the dragon community. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was going to be another great day. You'll shrink some humans, pick out the best ones, eat the rest and get a good night's sleep. Just then you heard a knock on the door. You went over looked through the peephole saw that it was one of your friends and opened the door. Standing in the doorway was...   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
