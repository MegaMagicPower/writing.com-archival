It was especially hard knowing that you were completely disposable cannon fodder, and were more likely to see yourself slain in whatever upcoming battle was next than live to see yourself grow old. They were a realm hopping group of trained soldiers yes, but that had long since lost it's luster. These were fears you lived with every day, but in time it all became habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough lately, you'd been having dreams. A woman would approach you and start to tell you something but you'd wake up before she could get into any details. But not this time, no, you remembered that dream today. The woman in the dream told you that she'd be bestowing a gift upon you, a gift that could change your life forever: you could now take any other life of your choosing. It sounded like a wild fantasy, but at this point you were willing to try just about anything. Why not? If you felt you were going to die anyway, what did you have to lose trusting some strange dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left now, was to choose your target.</span></div></div>",

After all, rumor was she was just some kind of time travel duplicate, so nobody would really miss her all that much, nor know all that much about her acting out of turn when you took her as your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night you laid yourself down and focused intently on your target, and your gaze darkened briefly before returning. \"Did it- what? My voice?\" You realize quickly this is NOT your tent, no, it's a room in the palace itself! Your spirit traveled all that way? You notice you are indeed now the princess of the kingdom, only half dressed now, no armor added to her leggings and tunic yet. \"Incredible, so it was real after all...\" You murmur, running your hands down your form. You lacked an ample chest, but you knew from observation that while Lucina's chest was only average, she had... other benefits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands grab your tight ass and squeeze, and you smile. \"Magnificent. To think she hides such a perfect peach under such simple garb~\" You coo in her lovely voice, satisfied wholly with your acquisition. \"And these... oh my, these...\" You run both hands up her toned and lovely legs, feeling her thighs through this wonderful fabric she wore. \"Tomboy princess, and yet still so nice and womanly underneath... I'll enjoy <b>being you</b> from here on out, Princess Lucina~\"</span></div></div>",

At last you see yourself in full, and it's... \"Glorious.\" You smirk, running a hand through that perfect dark blue mane of hair. It's soft to the touch, silky and wonderful like the finest fabrics, only better. You breathe in it's scent, and moan a husky breath. \"Mmmm...\" Was this what it was like to be royalty? To have even the simplest of life's comforts given to you with finest and utmost care? You could really learn to love this. Not only that, you felt strong. Toned, lean, muscular underneath this soft and delicately cared for skin you now inhabited. Under all this womanly charm, you had the body of a seasoned warrior princess. A smile crosses your lovely face, and you pull your tunic off and toss it to the side, only to see an undershirt that matched your leggings. Your breasts were a bit bigger and perkier than the tunic showed, not by much, but you wouldn't complain with some ample<i> B-Cups</i> at least. You put your hands to them, feel them, caress them with loving affection. Something about this body was really setting you off something fierce, you almost thought you were falling in love with your own reflection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft smile appears on your face, and you lean into your reflection and press a soft kiss to the glass, only to pull back and smile. \"Lovely lovely Lucina... I am going to<i> ravage </i>you like a wild beast.\" You laugh, pulling your shirt and leggings off finally and tossing them aside, leaving you in a tasteful set of a blue bra and panties. You turn around and crane your neck to get a look at your finely sculpted ass, easily the best feature you possessed now, and you smile something wicked and perverse, grabbing onto the taut cheeks and rubbing them with intense resolve. \"Or at least, I'm going to<i><b> get </b></i>ravaged like a wild beast... Find the perfect little perverted subject of mine... and have them take me with all their strength...\" You grin deeply at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think I know the perfect test subject...\" Quickly you redress in what you were already wearing, not bothering with full armored additions, just the basic clothes that you awoke in. You turn to look at your behind in the mirror once more, giving it a nice and hard SMACK that makes you moan and bite your lip with anticipation. You head out the door, time to find your <i>wild beast</i>...</span></span></span></div></div>",

You were the princess of this land now, destined to inherit it from Lucina's- rather your- father, Chrom. For now though, you'd take smug satisfaction be enough for you. It wasn't long before you spotted your target, the general herself that you enlisted under in your... former life, Alexia. Sweet sweet Alexia, strong as an ox and as graceful and fierce as a tiger... you'd enjoy having her service <i>you</i> for a change. As you approach, you spot your friend, Rodrick, as well. He seems upset, pointing out that 'Eric' hasn't woken up yet and may be comatose, but your kind loving general sends him away as she spots you, taking a knee. \"Lady Lucina, I'm sorry for that outburst, my men, they-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put a hand on her head to silence her, and meanwhile run your fingers through her hair. Not as fine a silky smooth as yours, but those red locks had captivated you for years... And what was the point of being in charge if you couldn't take what spoils you wished? \"L-lady Lucina?\" Alexia asked, seemingly flustered by your affectionate treatment of her hair. You smile. \"General Alexia, I wish to meet with you in private. Now.\" You demand of her, releasing her locks and letting them fall back down to her head. She looks up in confusion. \"M-my lady, is this urgent, I have to rally the troops-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said at once, didn't I?\" You ask her, gaze growing cold, a look very un-Lucina like, you admit to yourself, but watching this woman squirm was worth every moment of it. \"Y-yes, my lady...\" She responds, face beet red as she bows her head. You smile. \"Good. See yourself to the palace, and my quarters, at once.\" And you walk off, finding your way back to your room with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alexia finally arrived a few minutes later, she hesitantly opened the door a crack. \"My lady, what was it you- great gods!\" She covers her eyes, struck with the sight of you laying sprawled on your silken sheets, nothing more than a pair of lacy undergarments and some nice thigh highs that matched the fabric of your leggings. \"Alexia, come in.\" The warrior responded in turn, closing the door behind her, completely taken in by your appearance. You get up, and make your way over to your prize, the spoils of your new life, and drape your arms over her shoulders. You lean in to whisper in her ear... \"<i><b>Ravage</b> me like a savage beast, you fine slab of <b>woman</b>... <b>Take</b> me now, show me the pleasures you can bring your dear Princess...</i>\"</span></div></div>",

Does she take this risk and act upon her very obvious desire for the princess- for <b>you</b>- or does she question the sudden change in action her ruler has taken? She clearly didn't spend very long thinking on it, because only a moment later does she press her lips to yours and let out an impassioned moan. You respond in turn, pushing her head to drive her body closer to yours, to encourage her to kiss deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia moved her hands down your body, feeling you up with a perversity that's almost tender, worshiping you and the body you possessed. She grabs your ass and lifts you up, something that causes you to squeak slightly in surprise, but you respond by wrapping your legs around the woman's body. It was fitting that she carry you, you were now royalty after all. And how pleasing it was knowing that it was you acting this fantasy out. The very same person your former boss detested and called a slacker, and the one that spent countless nights thinking about all the pleasurable things you'd do to her... and now that was a reality, just not quite in the way you expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia pushes you up against a wall, indeed with the passion of a wild animal as you had so hoped. After a moment she broke off the kiss, panting. \"L-lady Lucina, I-\" You press your finger to her lips. \"Less talk, more... action.\" You reply with a smirk. She seems to get the message, turning and dropping you onto your bed. You smile with smug satisfaction as you watch the woman eagerly remove your panties and stare at your sopping wet womanhood. She hesitates a moment, but then takes to her new task like she had been <i>born</i> for it. You feel a shiver go up your spine immediately, and your back arches. \"Ooooooh...~\" You moan, feeling the woman's tongue explore all around your nether. Your toes curl, and legs wrap around her head. \"<i>Yes- yes- yesssss~</i>\" You cry out in a high pitch voice. You couldn't even believe you were capable of sounding so... feminine, yet here you were. And you weren't complaining about it either, in fact it only seemed to make you enjoy yourself more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl... so GOOD...~\" You moan out, digging your fingers into her hair, pushing her to dig deeper, go faster, make you feel even better! She responds in turn, finally getting to the clitoris and giving it the royal treatment it deserved. You feel yourself bask in the ripples of please being sent all through your body, as your teeth clench and you let out guttural moans of desire. You feel yourself finally nearing a climax, and it was shaping up to being the biggest one of your life. \"I'm- yes- HHHHNNNNNFFFGGHH~\" You lose all words as you finally reach it, and your body shakes as the pleasure finally erupts. Your eye twitches as you lose yourself in the sea of it all, finally settling just a mere moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there in your afterglow, panting slightly. You reach your hand down and pick up some juices with your fingers, bringing them to your face and licking them slightly. You sigh contently, sitting up a bit to see the other woman's face still red and attempting to calm herself down from the whole affair. You smile at her. \"Very good, Alexia... very very good.\"</span></div></div>",

Those short skirts and gartered boots... man, did it drive you wild. You thought for a moment to test your new powers on Sumia, the one that seemed to favor the Exalt himself, but she would be too... noticeable. Your target had to be chosen wisely. So what was the next best thing? Her supposed daughter from the future of course, and boy was she a cute one too. She may not have the completely womanly figure of her mother, but she was at the very least your age, and with some adorable pigtails and bubbly personality to boot. She always talked about being some valiant hero or something of the like, almost as if she was living out a personal fantasy day in and day out... well, you could relate. And who better to help you with that yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you went to bed that night, focused all your thoughts on that girl, letting every need and desire to escape this garbage fire of a life and take something better drive you... until you lose consciousness and pass out. The next thing you know, it's daylight, and your hand was on a door- wait... \"AAAAH!\" You scream out suddenly (notably more high pitch than you expected, which shocks you), noticing your hand was now small, gloved... and feminine. \"Wh- wha-\" Your hands reach up and grab your face, kneading and pulling and pinching at it as you realize the structure of it is totally unfamiliar to you. \"My face- my VOICE!\" You grab your throat, and by then you notice the pigtails that dangled into your vision, and you grab them both, giving a light tug. \"Ow-\" You say quietly, releasing them. \"By the gods...\" You mumble, staring down at your hands, putting them to the armor you now wore over your chest, noticeably cut for a <i>female</i> frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and see a mirror in this room you found yourself in, and rush over to it quickly, the face of a surprised girl about your age staring back at you. You make some faces, the girl does so too. You tug your pigtails, so does she. A smile of understanding appears on your face... and hers. \"It worked. By the gods, it WORKED!\" You look down at your hands, chuckling, then bring one up to tap your knuckles against the breastplate of your torso armor, giving out a distinct <i><b>clang clang</b></i>. \"Safe and sound then, eh girls?\" You say with a snicker. \"I can't believe this, it totally worked... Gods, thank you!\" You pump a fist, then go back to admiring this new face of yours. \"Hello there Cynthia... Oh me oh my, aren't I just a cute one? I could eat myself up... or out.

You peel off the gloves and put down your leg, now starting from your hips and explore up, cupping your breasts when you finally reach them. They weren't... huge, but you didn't mind that.

You brought Camilla's sweet lips to the mirror, leaving a behind a light smudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just so beautiful, Camilla!\" You say sweetly to the reflection, running a hand across your borrowed face, \"And now, I finally can see that beauty in its full potential!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the hand mirror down for a moment, now focusing on the undergarments restraining you from exploring this amazing body. The undergarments were sexy, but tasteful, made from a fine silky material. You removed the bra with some struggle, but felt instant relief when it fell to the floor, letting the massive breasts on this body free. You marvelled at the shear size or them, bouncing up and down lightly to feel just how heavy they were. You giggled at the sight of the breasts as they bounced up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took one boob in each hand caressing them with great care, as if they were prized jewels put into your protection. They were soft as humanly possible, earning a gasp from your borrowed mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So amazing!\" You moaned as your hands explored the entirety of your bosom. You began to get more adventurous, as you squeezed and kneaded the treasures bestowed upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands slowly ran down to Camilla'd lower half, trembling at what was to come. Quickly, you picked the mirror back up to get the best view you possibly could at your new rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnificent!\" You muttered to yourself, bringing a hand to your mouth, puckering your lips and laying a kiss onto it. The hand came down with what felt like enough force to shatter steel. A great moan escaped your mouth as you felt a shockwave of pleasure enter your body. It was incredible, this shouldn't be as pleasurable as it is, but everything you did in Camilla's body was a turn on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your attention to the deep red mark on your behind, there was a slight kiss mark from your hand on the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just so much to do that I have no idea with this body!\" You exclaimed as you groped your booty with one hand and rubbed at your nether regions with the other, \"But I do know I need to bring this body the best orgasm it's ever had or will have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the room to find something, anything to stick inside of you. Your eyes fell upon a sheath meant for a short sword. Perfect. You grabbed the thing and guided it to your entrance. Not only was your mouth watering, but your vagina was practically flooded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one thrust from your powerful arms, the sheath was already half way into your hole. A loud moan escaped your lips again from the immense pleasure entering your body. Your arms began to pump the sheath in and out of your body, going deeper and deeper. But it wasn't deep enough. You climbed onto your bed , lining the sheath up with a bed post. The bed post went into the sheath and you dropped your weight on top of it. Almost the entire sheath had pierced your insides, earning a shout that was most certainly gaining attention from the surrounding rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to repeatedly rise and drop on the bed post. Your hands were in a frenzy, going from your breasts, to your bottom, and all across your body, increasing the pleasure tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was happening. You felt a pressure build up that you just couldn't stop from coming. The intensity of your pleasure fest had almost caused you to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-I'm cumm-OOOOH!\" You shouted, echoing across your chambers. Juices sprayed the makeshift dildo you had created, dripping down to the floor. Your breath was heavy, your body shook as you climbed off from the contraption you made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Camilla!\" You whimpered to yourself, \"I love your body! I love being you!\" You dropped to the floor, falling unconscious from your masturbation session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes someone wake you up?</span></div></div>",

Since every day of a soldier's life in the monastery feels pretty much the same, this small different feeling of excitement is very noticable to you. \"Must have something to do with that dream\" you think to yourself. You shake the thought from you mind and put on the cold pieces of armor. Having your task schedule basically burned in your memory, you head out to the cathedral to take up your first guard post of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving guard duty in the cathedral is not as bad as some of the other posts. The air in the large building is rather cool and the choir is quite soothing. Additionally, it is a great place for checking out hot chicks. People like Manuela, Marianne and Mercedes regularly pray in the cathedral. Even archbishop Rhea can sometimes be seen in the early morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes on loction you are greeted with a kind smile of one of the regulars. \"Good morning\" Mercedes softly says as she walks by to the statue of the goddess to start her morning prayers. You stare as she makes it to the front of the cathedral. She has a great figure with curves in all the right places. Her butt is plump but not fat and her breasts are among the biggest you have seen on campus. Filling your head with lewd thoughts you think back to the dream you had the night before. \"How would such a thing even work? Do I just think about possessing someone while focussing on them or something vague like that?\" you ask yourself silently. </div></span></div></div>",

With a sigh you head to your next and least favorite post out of all of them: the library. Not only are you required to be silent, but the library is stuffy and smells funny. Besides, the monastery has almost no hot nerds or bookworms that come and sit in the library to study apart from when they have cleaning duty. The only two cute girls that caught your eye are Lysithea and Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving you hear a loud noise followed by a scream. As per usual you find the clumsy Annette buried under a pile of books. You help her up and put some of the fallen books back on their shelves. She thanks you with a red face and then scurries off with some books to the messy desk in the corner. \"Such energy...\" you think to yourself. Annette was small in many aspects but cute nonetheless. Apart from her and maybe one or two other students, the library was practically empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving missed the opportunity to try out if your recurring dream is real before and since there are not many people around, you wonder if you should test it out right now.</div></span></div></div>",

Enjoying the fresh air on your way to the hall, you hear the sound of swords and spears hitting wooden dummies in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hall a group of knights are seemingly occupied with a heated discussion while others are engrossed in more idle conversation. The sound you heard earlier comes from a knight who is instructing a few students. The students are all busy practicing their preferred weapon of choice on the wooden dummies in front of them. Closest to where you take up post is one of the monastery's top students: Ingrid. She moved gallantly and with ease as she swung her spear around. Despite the intense training, she looked beautiful with a gentle but stern expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you notice the group of students was finishing up. \"Are you going to get dinner too Ingrid?\" one of the other students asked. \"I think I'll head back to my dorm first\" she replied, \"this training has left me all sweaty\". While Ingrid prepares to leave, you think about how you would like to go home as well.

Finally you realized that you successfully possessed Ingrid, and now is just standing here giving \"her\" chest subtle squeezes from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling the sweat from her intense training you sat down at a nearby bench,  \"I can't believe it...\" you murmur, still in awe of your voice, putting your hand on your face with a smile.

Of course the perception others have of you isn't the only thing that changed. Even the walking process itself feels weird. With every step you take you can feel the braid in your hair sway on you back, the slight bounce to your chest and the cold air from underneath your skirt. With both all these differences combined you realized how exhilarating it is to be someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at  the dorms you realize the flaw in your original plan. \"Crap...in which dorm does Ingrid even live?\". Slightly annoyed that you didn't think this through earlier you feel a tap on your shoulder. \"Ingrid are you okay?\" a female student you don't know asks you, \"you look a bit spaced out\". \"ah no I'm fine!\" you reply with a forced smile, \"I was just heading home\". The student gives you a worried look. \"Alright if you say so\" \" you know you can always come by for some tea right?

You decide to go for the door to the right of the girl's dorm and take out the key. \"well... her goes nothing\". The key easily slides into the keyhole and you hear a clicking noise as you turn the key. \"Looks like luck is on my side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid's dorm is not too big. Most things including the walls and the floor are made out of dark brown wood.

You have a mysterious dream one night, where you are bestowed the power to possess the women of the FE realms. While you are possessing people, your body runs on auto pilot and you're given free reign to do whatever you like!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric - You, our main character. He's part of an army for hire that gets sold to whomever is willing to pay the highest. An average unassuming slacker who'd rather not be putting your life at risk. You're okay with a sword, but all you want to do is to try and not get yourself killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodrick - Your friend, who's been with you for years. A friendly guy in a harsh world. A good looking guy with short dark brown hair, a fairly muscular build, and excellent with a bow. He's joined you many times with your 'woman watching', and nearly as perverted as you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia - The General of the army, a strict and no-nonsense boss who is willing to work for anybody that pays hard enough. A fierce redheaded warrior woman with the physique to match. She's beautiful as she is tough as grit, and her skill with a sword is matched only by the beauty of her long red hair. She's not a big fan of you or Rodrick, finding you both to be slackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules of the story:<br>\r\n1. No killing off the MC.<br>\r\n2. You cannot possess the male characters or non human creatures.<br>\r\n3. Anything goes for sex.<br>\r\n4. Everybody in the story is at least 18 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add new chapters! I encourage it so I'm not just adding to it myself. Heck I might even give away some points for it! </td>",
