            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was it. This was Samantha's new life for the next few years. No matter how much she had protested and fought her parents, the fact was, she was here now. There was no going back. She didn't think that she'd be able to make it on her own, and her parents had been very clear that they wouldn't support her if she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd threatened to leave. To cut all ties with them. She'd cried and wept when she realized she couldn't win. None of her friends had been willing to help, willing to take her in. And so, she left. She'd left her old life behind, and made her way to the the ends of the Earth, destined to be forgotten. Or at least that's what it seemed like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere once her life had been filled with skyscrapers and concrete, now it held small buildings and forest in every direction. Her old school had held over a thousand students, and now she wasn't sure if there were a thousand people in this lonely village. She was probably exaggerating to herself about the size of the town, but still, the town might as well be empty for all she cared. None of her friends were here. None of the places she knew, or had grown up with. All for what? Because her dad had to get moved here for his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like he had an important job or anything. He could have easily found a better job. One with prestige. One where she wouldn't be forced to move to this forgotten land. Honestly, she didn't even know what her dad did. He had worked with a pharmacy company, but he had never really talked about what he did. Well, he still worked for them, but now it was in the middle of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a bell ringing caused Samantha to quicken her pace as she made her way up the lonely sidewalk towards a small, brick building with the words <i>Bountiful High School</i> in tarnished copper letters stuck to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had almost walked right past her new school, unused to something so small. Her last high school had been a massive, state-of-the-art building. This more reminded her of a small medical clinic in the horror movies she loved to watch. She was reminded even more of a horror movie as she made her way through the creaking front door, which echoed in the cold, empty hallways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering at how cold it was inside, she jumped slightly as the door slammed shut behind her with a loud crack. She glanced around, and let out a sigh of relief that no one had seen her jump. Catching her breath, she glanced around her new school with an obvious look of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was nothing more than a plain white tile, that merged seamlessly with matching colored walls. Though the paint was in desperate need of being repainted, and there were obvious cracks in the floor. The puke colored lockers didn't do much to break up how plain the inside of the building was, though she probably should've expected something like this with how run down the outside had appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out her phone, cursing under her breath as she noticed the time. At her old school she'd always been early to school. She'd been a model student that the teachers loved. Now, she couldn't even show up to class on time. Glancing back and forth, she began searching for her first class, hearing voices coming from many of the closed doors that broke up the rows of lockers. Finally, finding her class, she slowly opened the door, and stepped inside and offered a hasty apology to the plump teacher at the front of the room before taking a seat in one of the empty chairs next to a really overweight boy who looked like he was struggling to reach his desk because of how big he was. The teacher made a brief comment about her being a new student to the class, but she didn't really pay attention to what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did her best to pay attention to what the teacher was talking about, but just couldn't seem to stay focused on the lesson at hand. She let out a sigh of relief as the bell finally rang, dismissing them to go to their next class. She jumped up before anyone else, and quickly went to find her next class. She finally found it just before the bell rang and she took a seat in-between another couple of fat students. The next class went in much the same way as the first. And the third was almost identical to the first two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bell rang for lunch, and she jumped up, rushing past a girl who seemed so fat that Samantha was surprised she could even walk. She was one of the first ones to the lunch room, which surprised her. Usually, there was already a huge line at her old school. Hopefully, they would have good food here. That was one of her complaints about her old school, was that it always seemed like they were serving cardboard. On top of that, they never gave enough food and she always left lunch hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grabbed a tray and moved towards the serving area, where a couple of very large ladies were waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't recognize you. You must be the new girl.\" Said the first lady with a large smile as she heaped a massive portion of potatoes and gravy onto Sam's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Sam mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman chuckled as she loaded a huge portion of roast beef onto Sam's tray, \"Oh dearie, there's no need to be shy, we won't bite. If you ever need anything just let us know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam mumbled an okay and finished getting her food, feeling her tray growing noticeably heavier with each item. She couldn't believe how much food was on her tray, and just kept shaking her head as she plopped down at one of the tables in the corner, where she hopefully wouldn't be disturbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as the other students began arriving and lining up as she shoveled the delicious food into her eager mouth. She hadn't realized how hungry she'd been, but now that she was eating she couldn't stop herself despite the massive portions. Though, if this was the norm, it was no wonder why almost every kid in line was at least chubby, if not incredibly obese. She really was going to have to be careful or she very well might join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised when she discovered that she'd eaten the entire tray of food, and promised herself that she'd go for a run later that evening. Which reminded her that she still hadn't heard anything about any of the sports teams here. Though, now that she thought about it, she hadn't seen anything advertising any sports. She didn't recall seeing any trophies in any of the display cases, or fliers on the walls. She hadn't even seen a gym since arriving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffed. The school was probably too small to really warrant any activities like that, though from the look of the other students, it might not be a bad idea. Maybe she would have to talk with the principal about starting up a team or a club. The principal would probably be happy that she was showing some initiative to help the other students. Still, she was the new girl here, so it wasn't like she really knew much about this place yet. Maybe they did have a team. She resolved  herself to investigate it further once she was more settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the table seemed a little harder after her massive lunch, and she renewed her promise to go running after school so she wouldn't get fat. She tugged on her shorts as they felt like they were cutting into her bloated belly. She couldn't believe how much food she'd eaten. She'd have to tell the lunch ladies to take it easy in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was just about to leave the lunch room, she heard someone call her name. She glanced around curiously, and spotted a rather large woman in a billowing dress striding towards her, \"Samantha? Samantha Hatchins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nice to meet you!\" said the woman with a large smile as she thrust her hand out and gripped Sam's free hand tightly, \"I'm Mrs. Vee, the school nurse. If I can just have a moment of your time, it seems like some of your medical information is incomplete and I just need you to come to my office so we can fill in the gaps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Sam said, feeling like her arm had been yanked out of its socket as Mrs. Vee began practically dragging her down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I hope everything has been going well on your first day. I know we kinda threw you to the wolves, but I hope you've been able to find all your classes and everyone is making you feel welcome. We don't get many knew people in town, most people don't even know this place exists, but you'll find this is a very tight-knit community and we look after each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam struggled to keep up with Mrs. Vee's rapid speech as she seemed to go into detail about everything about the town before they made it to her office. Her head was spinning as Mrs. Vee half dragged her into a small room that looked like a cozy patients room, complete with a sunflower in a vase by the only bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat.\" Mrs. Vee said, gesturing to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam cautiously sat down on the side of the bed, facing Mrs. Vee as she sat down in a large chair and grabbed a clipboard. The next half hour went by rather quickly as Sam was forced to answer question after question about her medical history. Most of the questions were pretty easy, though there were a few that she found a little bit prying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think that's all my questions, but before you go, I need to give you a booster shot. It just has some vitamins and other nutrients to make sure you stay healthy.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam could hear the light ticking of a clock, as she glanced around the room trying to locate it. She'd already heard the first bell, signaling the end of lunch, which meant she probably had less than five minutes to get her shot and find her class. That really didn't leave a whole lot of time for questions if she wanted to be to class on time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip as she glanced from the door to Mrs. Vee, who was waiting patiently for Sam to respond. Normally she would like to ask more questions about this shot she was about to get, but she really didn't have time, and she was sure that refusing would probably waste more time than the questions. Besides, she had already been late to one of her classes, and she wasn't eager to be known as the girl who was always late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sighed, nodding her head as she lifted her left sleeve for the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't hurt a bit,\" Mrs. Vee said, pulling out a syringe filled with clear liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam instinctively looked away as the shot approached. It wasn't like she was afraid of shots, but she was positive that they hurt less if you didn't watch them. Though a moment later, she felt a sharp prick, followed by a burning sensation as the nurse injected her with whatever was in the syringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that wasn't so bad.\" Mrs Vee said, slapping a tan bandage onto the site of the shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam just shook her head as she grabbed her bag and stood up. She grimaced at the burning sensation in her arm as the weight of her bag made her shoulder feel a bit sore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Vee smiled as she hoisted her large body to her feet and moved to open the door for Sam, letting in the noise of people trying to get to class on time, \"Well, you better hurry if you don't want to be late for class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam just nodded before stepping out into the rapidly emptying hallway, still moving her arm as she tried to work out the burning sensation. She glanced over her shoulder as she heard the door close with a loud click behind her, and began making her way towards where she though her class was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how small the school was, she still got turned around a couple of times, before finding her next class. She hurried in to find everyone already at their seats, and plopped down in an empty chair right as the bell rang. Breathing a sigh of relief, she quickly forgot about the shot as she focused on paying attention in class. As the day went on, though, she found herself growing really hungry despite her large lunch, and by the time she took her seat in her last class it was almost all she could think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach let out a massive growl that was masked by the ringing of the final bell of the day. She blushed slightly, hoping that no one had noticed as she quickly gather her stuff. She was determined to get some food. Though, she probably should work out first, lest she end up like her fellow classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost to the door, when she felt someone tap her shoulder. She turned to see an extremely fat boy standing behind her, looking sheepishly at the ground, while he was obviously blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, was wondering if you wanted to maybe grab a bite to eat. I'd be happy to show you around town a little since, you're new. I know a really good buffet, though my mom makes really good food too.\" the boy stammered, obviously trying to be nice, despite being really nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was rather surprised that this was the first student to talk to her all day. Especially since he seemed like a bit of an outcast, even among his fellow students. Still, despite how large he was, there was a bit of a boyish cuteness to him, and she was sure he'd probably be one of the most handsome students if he lost a couple hundred pounds. On top of that, it wasn't like anyone else had really gone out of their way to befriend her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam glanced from the massive boy to the door, then back to the boy who was shifting uncomfortably as he awaited her response. Despite how fat the boy was, there was something about him that she was drawn to. Though it probably helped that she was starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds nice.\" she said, smiling as she watched his face light up with glee, \"I could definitely go or some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! You'll love it!\" the boy replied, as he began following her towards the door, \"Oh, I'm Stephen, by-the-way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha found it hard to walk at the slow pace that Stephen was setting, but it wasn't like she could blame him with how large he was. Though, she was finding herself wondering what it would be like to be as fat as him as they made their way through the small town. Despite how chilly the air was, Stephen seemed to be sweating before too long, though he had plenty of insulation on him to keep him warm. Especially since one of his arms was probably as thick as both her legs together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shivered, pulling her jacket tighter around herself as she kicked at some leaves on the ground, though she could still hear Stephen's panting over the crumpling of the leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there really isn't too much to this town except a few restaurants and a movie theater. Though, I guess if you like hiking, there are plenty of trails in the forest, though I generally just like to play video games since I don't have anyone to hang out with. Do you like video games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha chuckled, \"I used to play them a lot, but I guess I ended up on the opposite end as you. None of my friends wanted to play video game, so I ended up on a few of the sports teams. Though it was probably a good thing, since I was pretty chubby when I was a child. Are  there any teams at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. No one really is interested in sports here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Stephen's turn to chuckle, \"I don't know if you noticed, but everyone here isn't really what you call athlete material.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if they had a sports team or two, that would change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had one once, but no one would ever sign up for it. Actually, we might still have a team, but you'd probably have to talk to the principal. Though I don't think it would do you much good. Everyone in town is fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I noticed. You don't have any health nuts or anything here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a pretty small town, but it just ends up that everyone is fat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about people who move here, like me. I'm not fat. Though, the rest of my family probably would fit in pretty well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any siblings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a younger sister, she's 14. Then my mom and dad, obviously. Though you didn't really answer my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen kicked at a small pile of leaves as he plodded heavily along, \"Like I said. Everyone in town is fat. It's just how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't plan on getting fat.\" Sam said, though part of her wondered if she really meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true what she'd said to Stephen, she really had been pretty chubby as a child. Honestly, she hadn't really minded being on the heavier side, but once she started playing sports she'd been able to get in shape pretty quickly. However, even then she hadn't really cared if she was thin or not, it just kind of happened. On top of that, it was hard for her to deny the fact that she was getting aroused thinking about how fat everyone was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are.\" Said Stephen, placing a hand on Sam's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were standing outside a rather large restaurant with brownish brick that made it look pretty plain. Still, the crowd of people was hard to argue with. Sam's stomach let out a rumble as a delicious smell wafted to them on the cool breeze. Drawn almost on instinct, they found a seat and began eating. Sam couldn't believe how hungry she was as she went back for plate after plate of food, all the while talking and laughing with Stephen. There was just something about the delicious food and good company that let her cut loose and eat until she was absolutely stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back on the bench, looking at the pile of plates on the table, \"Whew, I had no idea I could eat so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm stuffed.\" Replied Stephen from the other side of the table. She was honestly surprised he could even fit at the booth as he almost took up the entire side to himself. Though, she found her thoughts wandering to what it would be like to be that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does anyone get so fat they can't leave their house?\" Sam suddenly blurted out, though she quickly felt her face go red at being so blunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, there's probably more people who are immobile than those who aren't. School even has a special program where they take homework to all the kids who can't make it to school because they're so big. I've, uh, actually considered signing up for it a couple of times, though if I had, I wouldn't have met you. Anyway, I guess I should probably let you get going so your family doesn't get worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few quick goodbyes, Sam began making her way home as Stephen waddled off in the opposite direction. It was definitely easy to see how people could get so fat after the meal that she'd just had. Though it was weird. Despite how full she was, she still wanted to eat more. Though if she wasn't careful, she would probably end up as fat as Stephen. Or fatter. Still, it was an interesting thought....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, she imagined what it would be like to be so fat she was immobile, and had to have people feed her in bed as she continued to grow and grow and grow. She was still fantasizing about it as she walked into her house and was greeted by a mouth-watering aroma coming from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sam, you're just in time.\" Her mother said, poking her head out of the dining room, \"I made a feast to celebrate you and your sister's first day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam glanced down at her swollen middle as it let out a growl of anticipation. Dropping her school supplies by the door, she rushed into the dining room where the rest of her family was already seated. She quickly took her seat and began devouring the meal like she hadn't eaten all day, until she finally leaned back in her seat, rubbing her very swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really didn't know what had come over her. Maybe it was just the stress of being in a new place, or maybe she just felt like she didn't have to keep up appearances since she didn't know anyone here really. However, she couldn't deny that part of her was enjoying the feeling of bingeing on all this food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was getting ready for bed, she noticed her sister's door was cracked slightly, and she thought she heard moaning. She creeped towards the door, trying to be careful not to make any noise as she peered into her sister's room. Her eyes went wide as she saw her sister on her bed surrounded by snacks as one hand rubbed her chubby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister had never really seemed to care that she was fat, but this almost looked like she was enjoying it. Still, there was part of Sam that had always been jealous of Heather. She had always been chubby, and she never really seemed to care what other's thought of her. Part of her had always wished that they could switch places, but she'd always been too scared to let herself indulge like her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't help watching her sister stuffing her belly on more snacks despite the large meal she'd just had, and she found herself leaning closer and closer to the crack in the door. Suddenly she lost her balance and fell forward, falling through the open door as her sister let out a small \"Eep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Heather asked, jumping to her feet, which caused her whole body to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, I noticed the door was open and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were spying on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I, uh, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather shook her head as she sat back down on her bed, \"Don't just lay there, close the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam closed the door behind her, watching her sister intently, \"So, um.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grabbed another cookie from a bag beside her, \"You're probably wondering what I was doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam just nodded as she moved to sit on the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather sighed, rubbing her flabby belly, \"I, um, I like being fat. And I've been so hungry today that I just couldn't help wanting to eat more. I've always wanted to be fatter than everyone else, but it was so hard to gain discretely back in our last city. But here, I don't really stick out. I want to get fatter, but you can't tell mom or dad. Who knows how they'd react. Please don't tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister couldn't keep the pleading tone from her voice with that last part, and she looked at Sam with a look of desperation. She honestly couldn't say she was surprised. Heather always seemed way to comfortable with her fat body, but Sam hadn't realized that she was trying to get fat on purpose. Though was that really much different than what she had been dreaming about all afternoon. If there was ever a place to indulge that fantasy, this was it. Still, she wasn't sure what would happen if she gave into this desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the other option was to get her fill by watching her sister blow up like a balloon, and she could probably help that along. She had to admit that she'd always enjoyed her sister's fat body and her sister was admitting that it wasn't going anywhere. Of course she wasn't convinced she was really into this whole fat thing anyway, so maybe she should try to distance herself as much as possible from it.</span></div></div>",

I figure it might be interesting to see what it's like. Though I don't think I'll get as fat as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather let out a sigh of relief, \"I was worried you'd think I was weird or something. Or even worse, tell mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grabbed another cookie, \"Us sisters have to look out for each other. Especially since we're the new kids on the block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather laid back on her bed, her chubby belly on clear display as she downed another cookie, \"That's kind of what I'm thinking. This is a fresh start for us. No time like the present, especially since currently we don't exactly fit in with everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shoved another cookie into her mouth, \"It's definitely weird. Everything here is almost completely opposite from our home. Well, our old home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam took a deep breath as she grabbed another cookie, though she couldn't help noticing the somber look on her sister's face either. It had been hard for both of them to move, and the more they talked about their old home, the more she missed it. And she knew her sister felt the same. Yet, despite the fact that they'd only been here a few days, there was almost a sense of normalcy coming to their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was their first day of school, and even though everyone in town was obese, it still felt like school. Their new home was bigger, but it still felt like a home. Even the town felt similar despite having nothing but restaurants and a movie theater. Although, Sam had never really had a place to go hiking, and from what Stephen said, the forest had a bunch of great trails. Not like she'd be able to find anyone to go with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of silence, Sam mentioned the movie theater in town, and the two of them began discussing what sort of movies would be playing in such a small town, and whether they'd be able to keep up on all the series they were used to. Eventually, the discussion changed to what other things they'd like to do in this new town, all while gorging themselves of the snacks Heather had snuck to her room. However, eventually Sam grew tired and decided to go back to her room so she could get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the night, she kept dreaming of getting fatter and fatter. She grew to epic proportions as she ate and ate and ate. And yet, it all seemed so familiar to her, like something that had been with her for a while, and yet she'd forgotten about. She was happy though, happier than she'd been in a long time, and eventually her dreams changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was young, probably 10 or 11, but it was hard to tell. She was in her room playing video games, her chubby belly protruding from her pajamas as she sat on the end of her bed. Morning light was streaming through the large window. Her friends had invited her to go hiking, but she didn't want to go. She just wanted to play video games on her day off. Still, her mother kept saying that was why she was gaining weight, and yet here she was, she was still playing video games, while she gorged herself on snacks. Honestly, she didn't really care. She actually kind of liked her soft belly. Besides, the rest of her family was fat too. Her mother. Her father. Even her sister were all fat. Though it wasn't like her mom really did much to force her to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at her door, which was slightly ajar. She could smell bacon cooking in the kitchen, and her mother singing off key to something on the radio. Despite the snacks she was eating, she was eager for a nice cooked breakfast. She smiled as she caught the sound of her sister snoring in the bed against the other wall, and she glanced over at the chubby girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped as a beeping sound filled the air, and she cast her eyes about trying to find the source. Everything was dark, and yet the beeping filled the air. Her eyes bolted open, and she let out a sigh as she turned off her alarm clock. A faint blue glow filled the room, signalling early morning as she rolled out of bed. However, she hadn't even gone 2 steps when her stomach let out a loud growl. She almost doubled over as a huge wave of hunger washed over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved in front of the stand-mirror in her room, half expecting to see a chubby 10-year-old, and yet, even though she knew the truth, she still felt disappointed as she saw her toned reflection staring back at her. She lifted up her pink shirt, looking at her flat belly in the mirror. She'd almost hoped she'd look fatter after all the food she'd eaten yesterday, but these things took time. Still, it almost seemed like her belly was a little softer than it had been the day before, but that was probably just wishful thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, she started getting ready for the day. After getting showered, she moved to the kitchen where her obese mother was just putting the finishing touches on a large breakfast. She couldn't help notice that even in her family, she was the odd one out. Where she was thin and athletic, the rest of them were definitely borderline huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was probably over 300 pounds, and loved to eat and cook. Which was good since her cooking was so delicious. Her dad was even bigger than her mother, and had always kind of reminded her of a young Santa Claus. Her sister had been one of the fattest girls in her class, though that wasn't too hard considering most of them had been pretty thin. Sam on the other hand, just didn't seem to fit in. That was going to change though. Starting today, she was going to work to put on weight and at least get chubby again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate as much as she could before she had to be leaving for school. However, she still had enough time she could stop and grab some fast food before she had to be to class. Though, just because she wanted to put on weight, didn't mean she had to completely stop exercising. Especially if she wanted to be able to carry her larger body. She had time she could go for a quick run. Finally, she could just go to school and see if she could find Stephen. There were a few things she wanted to ask him about that he'd mentioned the day before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her large breakfast, Sam couldn't deny that she was definitely still hungry. It was weird though how hungry she'd been lately. She'd never had this big an appetite before coming here. Though, it wasn't like she really had time to think about it if she wanted to grab some food before school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing getting ready, she stepped out into the cool morning air, as a  breeze rustled the few red and orange leaves that were clinging to the trees. Shivering slightly, she sunk deeper into her jacket as she stuck off towards one of the fast food places that were relatively on the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked she found herself chuckling slightly. This kind of reminded her of her old home, and how it used to be. Some mornings she'd leave early for school and stop at Henry's Coffee and pick up a doughnut and a hot cocoa on her way to class. Her friends would always tease her that she was going to get fat if she kept having doughnuts for breakfast, though she'd always reply that she was thinner than most of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a sigh as she kicked at a stray leaf in her path. It was hard to deny that she still missed her old life. Though, maybe that was why she was so determined to be a different person here. Back home, her friends had always been into the latest fashions or diets. They all wanted to be star athletes, or runway models. But Sam hadn't. She'd been more into video games and computers, but those didn't make people like you. Those didn't stop people from teasing you. Back home, people cared more about how you looked, than who you were. And so Sam had made looks, who she was. But she couldn't deny there had always been something there that made her different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued the rest of the journey, hardly paying attention to what was going on around her mind reminisced on her old life. Even ordering food was just a mindless task to her, though she eagerly began devouring the large quantity of food as she began moving towards her school. All the while, it was feeling like her shirt and jacket were getting tighter around her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at school, she could see a few students still making their way to class. She quickly joined them and made her way inside. Today went by much the same as it did the day before, though she made sure to go back for seconds at lunch, which left her feeling uncomfortably full. Still, it already felt like she was starting to get into a routine. The other change was that she decided to sit by Stephen during the classes they had together, which there were only a couple. He definitely seemed happy to have someone to talk to, and she was happy to have someone making her feel so welcome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the week went by in a blur, as she tried to get caught up on her lessons, and adjust to her new life. She found herself spending a lot of time eating as she studied, which was quite frequent given the amount of homework she needed to get caught up on since starting partway through the semester. She didn't really have any time to go jogging or work out either, but it wasn't like she had time to worry about that right now. Still, she was glad when the weekend finally came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly got out of bed, tugging on her shirt as it rode slightly up her middle. She was still fairly toned, but she couldn't deny that she was starting to seem a bit softer. However, it wasn't really enough for anyone else to tell yet. Now she needed to decide what to do after breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she wasn't sure what she should do. It was a nice day so she could go hiking. Maybe she could even drag Stephen along with her. Though, he was more likely to want to go get some food or play video games. However, it wasn't like she'd be opposed to either of those. Maybe she could even drag Heather along.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam twirled in front of the large mirror in her room, trying to ignore the smells of breakfast wafting from the kitchen. She was starving. Of course that seemed to be her default state lately. She couldn't believe how ravenous she'd been since arriving in Bountiful. Still, it did make it easier to achieve her new goal of putting on some weight. She had to admit, she was liking the results so far. Though, it was barely noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long black hair framed a beautiful face with bright green eyes. Her shirt barely bulged over her chest, reminding her of how much she was lacking in certain areas. Her gaze followed her shirt down to her middle, where she knew she was starting to show the most. She lifted up her shirt, revealing a relatively flat belly. However, she knew that she was losing definition in her abs beneath the thinnest layer of fat that was forming there, even if others didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at what she saw. She knew it was weird, but she couldn't help being proud of the progress she'd made in just one week. She was getting excited to see what she'd look like in another 30 or 40 pounds. She kept telling herself she didn't want to get as fat as most people  in town, but she definitely wanted to be unmistakably fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't resist anymore and tore her gaze away from the mirror, quickly making her way down to the kitchen where she knew her mother was preparing a large breakfast. She had to chuckle to herself; it seemed like her and her sister weren't the only ones more hungry lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was just setting a plate loaded with food at Sam's spot as she plopped down in her chair. Her stomach growled at the sight and smell of the hearty breakfast before her. She glanced across the table at her chubby sister who was already mostly through her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Sam said, swallowing a mouthful of food, \"I was wondering if you wanted to go get lunch with me today with a couple friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather glanced up from her meal just long enough to confirm that Sam was speaking to her, \"Sure. That sounds fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, It's so nice of you to be including your sister in things. I'm so proud of the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam found herself blushing as her mother pulled her into a side hug. Honestly, she'd completely forgot that her mother was even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Sam said, trying to pull away from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright, I'll leave the two of you alone.\" Her mother said, leaving the kitchen to finish getting ready for work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the large pay raise her father had gotten with his new job here, her mother had wanted to return to work. She claimed it was so she didn't get bored, but Sam wasn't entirely sure about that. Fortunately, she'd been able to get a job at a local diner as a cook, though Sam hadn't had the opportunity to try it yet. Maybe they'd have to hit it up for dinner since her mom was going to be working late tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Heather said, keeping her voice low, \"Do I finally get to meet this Stephen who you keep hanging out with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was thinking we could go to the buffet place with him. I was going to suggest a hike, but I don't really want to go alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, buffets are great!\" Heather said, patting her soft belly, \"They make it so easy to binge on all my favorite foods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled, admiring how tight Heather's shirt looked around her swollen middle. It seemed like Heather would need new clothes soon if she kept growing at the rate she was. She was like a bottomless stomach. Every time Sam saw her, she was eating. Still, she couldn't help admiring how cute and soft her sister was looking. She had nice round cheeks and a cute double chin which made her look almost like a 10-year-old, despite being 14. Her chest was also bigger than Sam's, which made an interesting contradiction with the apparent age of her face. Still, she couldn't deny that the biggest part of her sister was definitely her belly. It looked like someone had shoved a small tire into her shirt, though it was a lot more curvy than a tire, which made her look even more attractive. If she had to guess, her sister was probably close to, if not over, 200 pounds, which was significantly heavier than her own 130. Though now that she thought about it, she might be more now. She hadn't weighed herself since they'd arrived in Bountiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Heather finished their meal and went to get ready for the day. Fortunately, Stephen was up to having lunch and agreed to meet them at the buffet place. However, by the time she was finished getting ready for the day, Sam found she was already hungry again. She raided the snack cupboard, which was starting to look kind of bare, and retreated to Heather's room to play video games until it was time to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they met up with Stephen, and after introductions they began to feast on as much food as they could eat. Sam had been worried that Stephen and Heather wouldn't get along, but it seemed like she had nothing to worry about. They talked at length about video games, and the latest movies. Which fortunately, Sam was well versed in as well. Honestly, it was very freeing to be able to discuss her actual interests with someone without them thinking she was a geek or weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they'd all had their fill, they made their way to Stephen's house to try out a new game that had just released. His parents weren't home when they arrived, so he just grabbed a bunch of snacks for them, and instructed them to do the same. They spent the next few hours having fun and eating snacks to their heart's content, until it was finally time for Heather and Sam to be leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked to the diner where their mother worked, hoping to get a nice big meal. Finally they arrived outside what Sam would describe as a generic diner, though it seemed packed with the diner crowd. They found an empty booth and a server quickly took their order. The portion sizes were immense, but Heather and Sam were more than up to the challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night as Sam was laying in bed rubbing her swollen belly, trying to find a comfortable position, she thought she heard someone move downstairs. She glanced at the clock, which showed almost midnight. Part of her wondered if her sister had gotten hungry again and went to get some more snacks. Honestly, she was kind of tempted to do the same. Despite how full she was, she was still hungry. She really was becoming such a glutton. She kept pushing her belly to its limits, and it was definitely showing in her appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes as she heard the noise again. That sounded like it had come from below her room, not from the kitchen though. She was definitely curious to see who was up. Though her hunger was also calling to her. Though, she was tired enough that she was almost willing to ignore both and just go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Letting out a small sigh, Sam threw her covers off herself. She shivered as the cool air tickled her skin, and she almost changed her mind. Still, she was sure she wouldn't be able to get any sleep until she got something to eat. Carefully, she crept out of her room and down towards the kitchen. She stopped at her sister's door, opening it slightly, she could make out her sister's large form sleeping soundly in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently closed the door before continuing her trek to the kitchen. Finally, she made her way over to where her family kept the snacks and began gorging herself. Everything was so good, and yet it almost felt like a dream. She'd completely forgotten the noise she'd heard earlier as she stuffed herself with fatty foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her chubby belly as she glanced towards the entrance to the kitchen. Her parents had told her not to eat any more snacks after dinner, but she just couldn't help it. It seemed like she was always hungry, and these snacks were the only thing that made her feel better. She knew it was just making the problem worse, but she couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button on her pants had popped off during school, and everyone had started laughing at her. They called her a fat pig and other mean names, and yet the only thing that seemed to make it feel better was exactly what was causing it. She knew she was getting fat, but it didn't bug her. What hurt her was how the other kids treated her. Maybe she should work on losing weight. At least then they wouldn't keep bugging her. But it wasn't like being overweight bothered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her hands instinctively went to her side, sliding under her tight shirt to where she felt a little divot in her skin. It wasn't her first one, but it was her most recent. She'd had to look up what they were when her parents weren't around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam jumped as something cold crinkled under her belly. She glanced around, taking in her bedroom around her. She didn't even remember returning to bed last night, but it looked like she'd brought half the snacks in the house with her. There were empty wrappers all around her, though that would explain what she was laying on. However, she was almost starting to get used to waking up like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last couple of weeks she'd found herself sneaking down to the kitchen for snacks after everyone else had gone to bed, and more than once she'd woken up to find herself surrounded by wrappers. She couldn't help it. She just was always so hungry. Besides, she wasn't the only one who was snacking more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was like an eating machine. She was growing fatter almost daily as she devoured more and more food. Sam loved watching her sister's clothes growing tighter and tighter as her belly grew larger and larger. She wished she could gain as fast as Heather, but part of  her was glad she couldn't<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved the wrappers to the floor, laying on her back as she glanced at the clock. It was still pretty early, but later than she normally got up on a school day. Fortunately, today was Sunday so she didn't have to worry about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she threw her covers off herself, again letting the cool air envelope her as she shivered slightly. The rest of the house was still quiet meaning everyone else was probably still sleeping. Which meant it was a perfect opportunity to go soak in the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled herself out of bed, tugging at her shirt as it squeezed tightly at her middle. The fabric felt tight, though that was normal. It was supposed to conform to her body after all. Still, she couldn't deny that her pajama bottoms were starting to feel a little tighter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was gaining weight. She'd seen it herself. She hadn't expected to start gaining this quickly though, but she was actually kind of excited that she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she picked her way through her wrapper covered floor and opened her door. Sure enough, it seemed like everyone else was sleeping still. Even Heather. She moved across the hall and quietly closed the bathroom door behind her. She turned on the light before stripping her clothes and starting the water in the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped as she was raising her leg over the edge of the tub, spotting something in the mirror. She stepped back moving closer to the light as she turned her eyes towards her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small red mark was starting to form on her side, surrounded by the faded remains of other's of its kind. Something she hadn't seen or even thought about for a long time. Something from when she'd been younger and a lot less fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined herself in the mirror looking at the numerous red marks that were starting to form on her sides. She had looked it up, and figured out that they were called stretch marks. They formed when you put on weight so quickly that your skin couldn't keep up. The internet said they'd fade with time, but only if she stopped gaining weight. Otherwise, they'd just keep growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was getting fat, but she didn't realize that she could get fat too fast. Still, they almost looked kind of cute on her round belly. She hadn't shown anyone else since she didn't know how they'd react. However, she was sure she'd seen some on her sister's belly when they'd gone swimming last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's hand ran over the mark, a mixture of anxiety and glee filled her as she felt the slight divot in her skin. She couldn't believe she was starting to get a stretch mark. She knew she'd been gaining quickly, but she hadn't realized it had been that quickly. She wasn't sure how to feel. On the one hand, it definitely meant she was gaining weight. On the other it was something she hadn't been expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once tone abs were definitely starting to disappear behind a layer of fat as she looked at her pudgy belly. It was getting harder and harder to conceal the fact that she was fattening up. She wouldn't even really call herself chubby, but there was no denying that she was getting thicker. Even her breasts were starting to grow a little, which really made her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing she tore her gaze away from the mirror and stepped into the hot water, letting it wash over her soft body. She couldn't help thinking about how much weight she had gained in just under a month. She had jumped from 130 up to 145. That was fifteen pounds in less than a month. At this rate she would be chubby in just a couple more months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost an hour, she drained the tub and dried herself off, taking one last look at the newly forming stretch mark before putting her clothes back on. Her belly was starting to poke through between her bottoms and shirt, though it still looked really cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped out of the bathroom, she heard her father call from his bedroom, \"Sam. Could you come here for a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam bit her lip, trying to think about what he could want as she made her way into her parent's room. Her mother wasn't there, and her dad was sitting in the armchair in the corner of the room with a book resting on his large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed that you and your sister seem to have been eating a lot more lately and it's starting to show.\" He said matter-of-factly, causing Sam to glance at her exposed belly as she felt her face reddening, \"Now what you choose to do is up to you. I'm not going to stop you or tell you how to live your life. Heaven knows I don't have much room to talk, but I was wondering, have you been feeling unusually hungry lately? Like you don't have any control over it? I know that everyone in this town seems to be a bit heavier and sometimes it gets easy just to go with the flow, but do you feel like your hunger is abnormal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam bit her lip as she watched her father. He seemed to be watching her intently as she thought about how to answer.</span></div></div>",

She didn't want to admit to him that there were times she felt like she wasn't in control. This morning being one of them. Yet, it almost seemed like he had guessed it anyway. Still, she didn't necessarily want to admit that to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't really thought about it,\" Sam started, choosing her words carefully, \"but, now that you mention it, I guess I have been eating more since hanging out with Stephen. It's like you said, just going with the flow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched her father intently, waiting to see if he bought her half truth. It was true that she'd been eating more since hanging out with Stephen, but she knew that was only part of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Well as long as you're happy, I guess that's what matters. I'm sorry to spring this on you, but your mother asked me to talk with you about it. She's worried that you're going to end up like everyone else in this town. I told her not to worry so much, and that you were old enough to make your own decisions, but you know how she gets.\" You father chuckled, picking his book back up, \"Oh, and before I forget, I got called into the office today, and your mother has work so it will be just the two of you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam let out a quiet sigh of relief as she left her parents room. She knew her mother didn't really approve of her weight gain, but it seemed like she was trying to get her father to do the dirty work. She stomped towards the kitchen, not caring if she woke up her sister as she stormed past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like her mother had already left for work since she wasn't anywhere to be found, but Sam was okay with that. She didn't want to deal with her mother right now. She couldn't believe that she was trying to get her father involved in hounding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stormed to one of the cupboards and grabbed an armful of food, while shoving a cookie in her mouth. It made her so angry. She knew her mother didn't approve, but she always told her and her sister that it was their choice. She shoved another cookie into her mouth, as she began unwrapping a cupcake. The food was helping her to calm down, just like it did when she was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you shouldn't eat just because you're upset.\" Sam's mom said, standing with her hands on her hips as she watched her daughter try to stash the bag of chips behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it helps me feel better.\" replied the young, fat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her face go red as she struggled to resist putting another handful of chips into her mouth. Her shirt could no longer hide her growing belly, which rested heavily in her lap. The video game on the TV was paused, forgotten to her lust for food. She had recently gone from being just chubby to being fat. Still, she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam took a deep breath, savoring the fatty food as she shoved more and more of it into her face. Each bite seemed to take away a little of her frustration as she lounged on her bed, devouring the snacks she'd grabbed. When she'd been younger she'd had a problem with eating whenever she was stressed or sad. It had always made her feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had kind of repressed that part of her life though. She had honestly forgotten that she used to be really fat at one point. She hadn't really cared about her weight back then. It wasn't until she'd gotten into middle school that she'd really lost a lot of weight. She had actually been one of the fattest kids in school when she was in elementary and even the first part of middle school. Still, it wasn't the weight that had bothered her. It was the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there was no pressure to be thin or athletic. Honestly, the pressure was the other way now. She almost felt out of place by being skinny. Without that pressure to be thin though, it had definitely made it easier to go back to being that fat little child. She didn't really care if she was fat, honestly, she wanted that. Even as a child she'd enjoyed the feeling of having a soft body. That hadn't changed, and the bigger she got, the more she was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw the last empty bag to the floor. She felt quite a bit calmer, and yet, she still wanted more food. It just made her feel so good. Still, it wasn't like she'd been playing as many video games as she wanted, and she knew that Stephen had just picked up that new one that she wanted to try. The day was still early.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam glanced around her messy room at the numerous wrappers that littered every surface available. Rolling her eyes she went to the kitchen and grabbed a trash bag and another package of cookies before heading back to her room. She began cleaning up all the wrappers and made her bed while devouring the cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in satisfaction, she glanced around her room. It was tidy, though she wouldn't really say clean yet. At least her bed was made, and it didn't look like a complete slob lived there anymore. Still, there were a few clothes on the floor, and her desk was pretty cluttered, but that could wait until later. At least this way her mother wouldn't see all the snacks she'd eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked out a shirt, and threw it on. It clung tightly to her body, emphasizing the slight belly that was starting to protrude from her middle. This was made even more apparent by how her tight pants gave her a muffin top. She really would need to pick up some more clothes. Maybe she could do that with Heather later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her room, making her way downstairs she stopped just outside the kitchen to admire how big her sister was getting. Sam was almost jealous of how big her sister was getting, and with the way she was eating she wasn't going to stop anytime soon. Her belly rested heavily in her lap as it pressed slightly into the table. Heather's thick arms shoveled food into her mouth at an astonishing rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's clothes looked several sizes too small on  the obese girl. Her pants were undone, but still looked painfully tight around her wide waist. While her shirt didn't even cover her deep belly button, leaving quite a bit of her fat belly exposed. She had numerous stretchmarks on her soft skin, though Sam had to admit they looked good on her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a flutter of excitement, she tore her gaze away from her massive sister. She couldn't help feeling jealous of her as she wished that was her. She wished she could be the girl who did nothing but eat all the time as she grew fatter and fatter. She wondered if Heather would get fat enough to become immobile, though at the rate she was growing that seemed like a valid possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like anyone really was judging her sister negatively. If anything, she seemed to fit in better than Sam in this town. She was really starting to look like one of the normal residents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last look at the kitchen where she knew Heather was gorging herself, she stepped out into the cool morning air. It didn't take her long to walk to Stephen's house, though she was definitely chilly by the time she arrived. That would be one benefit of being fat. She would stay warmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on the door and waited. Finally, she heard the sounds of heavy footsteps coming from the other side of the door. A beaming face greeted her as the door opened, and the massive boy stepped aside to let her in, \"Hey Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Thought I might come over to try that new game out.\" Sam said, admiring the massive boy as he closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really just need to pick it up so we can play together,\" he chuckled, though he began leading her to his room, his footsteps sounding heavily through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt a flutter in her chest as she watched him laboring on. His massive body shaking and jiggling with each step as he made his way in front of her. He seemed even bigger than when they'd first met, though from how much food he ate, it wasn't a surprise. Still, she couldn't deny that there was something about how big he was that excited her. Taking a deep breath she followed him to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them played games for hours, while Stephen made sure they both stayed stocked up on snacks. He even went so far as to keep feeding her while her hands were occupied with the controller. She didn't care though. She was having too much fun. She wished it could just go on like this forever, though like all good things eventually it had to come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later than she had expected when she finally left, stepping into the cold of the night. Despite how much she'd eaten today, she had to admit that she was still hungry. She wasn't sure if there would be any dinner waiting for her when she got home. Especially if Heather got to it. Still, it was pretty late and she kind of just wanted to get to bed. Though, she'd probably be too hungry to go to bed if she didn't get anything.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam shivered slightly as she pulled her jacket closer to her. Despite how late it was, the low hanging clouds kept it fairly light outside as she began making her way down the short driveway towards the sidewalk. She let her feet guide her through the cold night, as her stomach let out the occasional growl of hunger. It was nights like this that really made her wish she had a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the city, it hadn't made much sense for her to have a car. They were expensive and there wasn't much parking, and what parking there was, was usually expensive. As such, she'd never really cared about getting a car despite the fact that she was 16. She had also been in better shape back then, and walking had just been an expected occurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled open the door to the restaurant, not even surprised by the size of the people inside. At first it had been weird to see so many fat people, but now it was almost normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam glanced down at her own belly which was well hidden by her jacket. Anyone that looked at her would think she was a twig. Though that wasn't the case anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around at the other people as she sat down with a massive tray of food. She didn't know why she'd ordered so much, but she eagerly began eating. She really didn't know what was coming over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't entirely true. Without the pressure of her friends and society, she was reverting to how she had been when she was younger. She was reverting to the obese girl that struggled just to climb a flight of stairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took in the people around her, admiring how confident they all seemed despite how fat they were. Her gaze stopped as she spied a girl in the corner of the lobby. She was about 11, and she was with a few friends who looked to be about the same age. The girl was gobbling up more food than Sam, while her friends were doing the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was very obese, with far too small clothes. Her large, exposed belly rested heavily in her lap, covered in stretchmarks. She was definitely the fattest of her group of friends by probably 50 pounds. If Sam had to guess, she'd say the girl was probably close to, if not over, 200 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam bit her lip as she watched the girl eating. There had been a time when she'd been that big. Maybe even bigger. Though she hadn't been nearly as happy as that girl looked. However, it wasn't her size that had really made her unhappy. It was the way people treated her. She wondered if she would've been as big as Stephen by now if she'd have grown up here. Here were no one seemed to care if you were fat, she probably wouldn't have felt any need to lose the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, she stood up and ordered another tray of food as she continued to watch the girl laughing and having fun with her friends. She didn't even seem to care that her obese body was on display for the whole world as she continued feeding her growing belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Sam probably would've fit in perfectly back when she was that girl's age. She probably would be even bigger than Stephen by now if she had grown up here. Food just made her feel so good. The feeling of being stuffed full was one of the best feelings she'd ever had. Food just made her feel so much better. She'd probably be immobile by now. Though apparently, even that wasn't frowned upon here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the kids got up and left. Sam watched the girl as she waddled after her friends, her belly swaying side-to-side as she walked. There was no doubt in Sam's mind that that girl was going to be huge in a couple years. She'd probably be immobile by the time she was Sam's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam finished the last of her feast, feeling how full she felt. She threw her garbage away and stepped outside into the cold. She let her mind wander to those years she'd tried to forget. To the times that seemed to be increasingly on her mind. A part of her regretted changing. Of losing the weight. She would've fit in so much better here if she hadn't. Still, part of her wished that she had grown up here. Wished that she could be that girl. Not even caring that she was growing fatter by the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still thinking about it when she got home. The smell of Lasagna wafted out from the kitchen, drawing her in. The rest of the house was dark, but the light above the sink was on, and she noticed a large plate of lasagna with her name on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still so full from her feast, but she didn't want to waste the food. She stuck it in the microwave for a minute, stopping it before the buzzer went off. She shoveled the food into her mouth with a ravenous hunger before finally going off to bed with an overstuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam huffed as she climbed the stairs to school. She could feel the weight of her body slowing her down as even the simplest movement seemed difficult. Despite all the teasing, she was still getting bigger. If anything, she was growing faster now with all her midnight snacks. She stopped at the top of the stairs, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was getting huge. She knew she was going to have an even harder time as she got fatter. It wasn't like she was trying to get fatter. It was just that food was so good. Still, most of the other kids were teasing her even more now, but that just lead to her eating more. It was a vicious circle. She knew she had to be the one to stop it, but it was just so hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd weighed herself that morning. She'd been about 210, though she wasn't very tall so she looked huge. She just kept growing and growing though. She was probably one of the fattest girl's her age, but she couldn't help it. She was struggling even to do some of the simplest things. Still, part of her loved the way it felt to be so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd often admire her growing body in the mirror in her room late at night. She'd imagine it growing bigger and bigger. She'd seen cartoons where the characters got so fat they couldn't move. Part of her wanted that. She couldn't deny it. Part of her wanted to be the girl who got so big she couldn't move. However, there was another part of her that wanted to fit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sighed as her alarm went off. Groggily she turned it off, laying back on her bed. She'd been dreaming about the fattest she'd ever been. Back then she hadn't really realized just how big she was. She knew she was fat, but she hadn't realized that her size was incredibly uncommon. She hadn't realized that she was probably fatter than ninety-nine percent of the girls her age. Still, it was shortly after that she'd started losing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled as the scent of breakfast wafted up from the kitchen. She could hear noises coming from her sister's room, which meant she was probably up too. Though that would make sense. They both had school today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rushed to get ready before heading down to breakfast. She ate as much as she could in the time allotted, though she grabbed a handful of bacon as she was walking out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to school, she sat down next to where Stephen usually sat, but by the time the first bell rang, he wasn't there. He wasn't in second period either. Or third. Finally it was time for lunch. She had long enough, she could probably go check and see if he was at home, though that would mean giving up her meal. Or she could go after school. The other option was just to wait until tomorrow. It was possible that he was just sick.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam was too hungry to even think about giving up her lunch. Even for her best friend. Besides, it wasn't like he was in trouble or immediate danger. If there was one thing she'd realized here, it was that despite everyone's size, the usual health consequences didn't seem to apply. Honestly, the people here seemed healthier than even back in her last city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school day went by without much event. It was fairly boring, but Sam was finding herself doing well on her school work. She had always been more on the intelligent side. Though it was definitely less enjoyable without Stephen here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last bell rang and Sam grabbed her bag and rushed out. The sound of heavy students moving around surrounded her as she rushed out into the cool autumn air. The sounds of the students quickly faded behind her as she quickly walked down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still wasn't used to how quiet this town was once she got away from  the school. Back at her last city, there was always the sound of traffic or people chatting. It was almost impossible to go more than a second without running into someone. Here, she could make the entire trek home without running into another person. There really weren't even that many cars. She might see five or ten cars on her whole trip home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked past her house, continuing down a couple more streets until she arrived in front of Stephen's house. She made her way up the driveway and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for a few minutes until she finally heard the sound of heavy footsteps making their way towards the door. Slowly the door opened and she saw Stephen smiling at her, \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped aside, letting Sam into the warmth of the house, \"Hey! You weren't at school today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't know if you can tell, but I've put on weight since you came to town, and it's getting too hard for me to keep going to school. I was planning on telling you yesterday, but it completely slipped my mind.\" He said, looking sheepishly at the ground, \"anyway we can talk about it more up in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to his room, they stopped in the kitchen to load up on snacks. Sam was so glad that his family kept so many snacks stocked up since she was already starving again. Stephen closed his door behind them as he moved to his bed. Sam took a seat on his large chair, breaking into a bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, yeah, I decided to join the immobile student program.\" He said through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're not immobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled, \"Yeah, not yet, but I know it will probably happen soon. Technically anyone can join it, even you could. It's more just like student initiated homeschooling, where the school still is involved in your education. Most kids use it when they get too fat to go to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked at him with shock, \"Wait! You mean I could just say that I want to join the program even though I'm super skinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they got in trouble for discriminating a while back, and so anyone who asks can join it. You don't have to attend any classes unless your grades start to slip, then you just get enrolled in online classes that you have to participate in at a set time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be nice.\" Sam said, crumpling up the empty bag and opening another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already forming a plan. It wasn't like she really knew anyone else at school besides Stephen, and if she could get permission to just hang out at his house all day and work on her school work there, it would be pretty nice. She really enjoyed hanging out with him. Honestly, she had to admit that she kind of had a crush on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her face going red as she glanced at the massive teen in front of her. She wasn't sure if he felt the same, and honestly she hadn't really even thought about it until today. Yet, now that she thought about it, she couldn't deny that she was really starting to like him as more than a friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began playing video games, while Stephen kept her fed. If she didn't know any better, she'd say he was trying to help her get fatter. Though, she had no idea why he would do that. Still, it was nice to just be able to eat and eat and eat without judgement. Her mother was really starting to annoy her, though, it wasn't like she had tried to stop Sam from enjoying herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ended up playing late into the night again, all the while Stephen made sure that Sam never stopped eating. On her way home she stopped and got some fast food. However, she found another large serving of food waiting for her when she got home. Not wanting her mom to get suspicious she shoved it into her already bloated belly before heading upstairs to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the week passed in much the same fashion. She'd get up and get ready, eat a big breakfast before heading to school, and head over to Stephen's after school where they'd play video games and eat late into the night. Then she'd head out for some fast food, before coming home and finding a large plate of food waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her appetite growing more and more with each day as she ate more and more. She knew she was losing control as she found it harder and harder to resist eating food. Food was becoming something that was constantly on her mind, though it wasn't like she was short on food. She just was enjoying it so much. It was so great just to be herself and indulge on delicious food to her heart's content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was starting to drop more and more hints about Sam's expanding waistline, and how she was worried about how she was starting to grow since she started hanging out with Stephen. Though, it wasn't like Sam was the only one growing. Heather was getting massive. She'd probably gained 100 lbs since they moved here, and she didn't really show any signs of stopping. Compared with her sister, Sam was still just a twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely gaining weight, Sam thought as she stood in front of the mirror in her room. It had been about a month since Stephen stopped coming to school, and she couldn't deny that she was tempted to join the program just to spend more time with him. Besides, she'd hardly call herself thin anymore. Maybe if she compared herself to everyone else, but not in the traditional sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged on her shirt, knowing that there was no way she could get it to cover her growing belly. She really needed to go shopping for new clothes, yet no one seemed to care that her chubby belly was starting to show. Though, it wasn't like it was an uncommon sight. Giving a twirl, she examined her new body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was starting to round out some, and she was getting a double chin. Her breasts had probably grown at least a cup size, maybe two. Though the most noticeable new feature was her chubby belly. Even with her jacket on, she couldn't hide the bulge in her middle. There was no hint of the tone abs that used to be there, and she was sporting several noticeable stretchmarks along the sides of her belly. Still, she was excited to be putting on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she didn't stand out as much, she thought as her eyes moved up and down her body. She wasn't a twig anymore, though she really wasn't what she'd call fat. She was definitely chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Saturday so she didn't have to worry about school. She had been planning on hanging out with Stephen today, but she was reconsidering after she failed to get her jeans buttoned up. She should go clothes shopping, though she was running out of money. She should probably consider getting a job if she was going to keep gaining weight. Maybe she could get a job at the fast food place she's always eating. Maybe getting a job would stop her mother from complaining about her just sitting around all the time, too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam took one last look at herself in the mirror before the smell of breakfast got the better of her. Despite how much her mother was complaining lately, it wasn't like she was trying to put her girl's on a diet. If anything, she was preparing enough food to keep up with their ever-growing appetites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tugged on her clothes, trying her best to get them to at least look decent on her, but there was only so much she could do. With a sigh, she followed her nose to the kitchen and plopped down across from her massive sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't seem to take her eyes off of Heather as she scarfed down all the food in front of her. She couldn't deny that there was a part of her that was jealous of the massive girl. A big part of her. Heather always looked so happy as she just ate and ate. She seemed so content with her huge body as she got fatter and fatter. She couldn't deny that she loved how soft and cuddly her sister was starting to look. However, it seemed like Heather was really starting to struggle to do even simple physical tasks now. Though, that just seemed to excite Sam even more. On top of that, Heather's shirt looked like nothing more than a glorified bra by this point, and it was hard to tell because her belly did a good job of hiding them, but she was wearing a pair of panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a last wistful look at heather, Sam began devouring her own large meal. She even went back for seconds when she was done with her first plate before putting her dirty dishes into the sink. She rushed upstairs and finished getting ready, doing her best to hide the fact she couldn't do up her pants from her mom as she bolted out the front door into the cool air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivered as a strong gust of wind raced past her and she hugged her jacket closer to her. She smiled, as she watched as a few multicolored leafs drifted past her. Still smiling, she began making her way towards the fast food restaurant near her home. She was still getting used to the feeling of actually having fat on her body as every step caused her chubby belly to jiggle ever so slightly. Though, it wasn't really an unwanted feeling. It was a good sign that she was actually putting on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad the restaurant was only about 10 minutes away. The cold wind was beginning to cut into her like a knife as she opened the door and made her way inside the warmth of the building. Her stomach let out a gurgle of anticipation as the delicious smells wafted out from behind the counter. Despite just having breakfast, she would probably end up getting more food here before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! What can I get for you?\" asked the extremely fat girl behind the counter as Sam approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pretty sure the girl was in a couple of her classes, though it wasn't like she'd really gotten to know anyone besides Stephen, \"I'm actually wondering if I can get an application.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You're in luck, we actually just had someone quit, so we do have an opening! If you want, I can get the manager for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that would be great!\" Sam said, smiling as the girl went into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a rather large man came out, followed by the obese girl, \"So, you're the one looking for a job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, Lydia here says that you're in her class at school, but don't worry, we can work around your schedule. If you want, you can start today and we can go over orientation, or you can start tomorrow if you already had plans today. Though, since it is short notice, we can start on Monday after school if you'd like, unless you're just looking for a weekend job.\"</span></div></div>",

Now, I know you haven't officially started yet, but one of the perks of working here is that you get free meals, so feel free to get as much food as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam jumped on that perk instantly, ordering a couple burgers which she began eating as she left the restaurant and began walking towards Stephen's house. He was extremely happy to see her when she arrived and suggested they go play some video games. He kept her well fed while they played, though he was a little disappointed when she told him that she'd gotten a job. Though he said he understood. On her way home, she made her normal stop at the restaurant where she got as much food as she could carry before heading home and feasting on the leftover diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning she rushed to get ready before heading off to work, stopping only momentarily to as she contemplated the need for new clothing. Still, it wasn't like she had time to worry about that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the restaurant, they gave her a quick rundown of how everything worked, and had her finish signing some paperwork before throwing her right into the job. Fortunately Lydia was there to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, looks like you're adjusting to life here,\" Lydia said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd been pretty slow so they'd had a lot of down time, but they hadn't really talked to much, \"Yeah. I didn't think I'd like it at first, but now I'm actually starting to enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia chuckled, \"Well from all the weight you've put on since getting here, I'd say you are. Don't worry, it's just a fact of life here. Even I've put on a lot of weight since you arrived. I had actually just started working here the week before, and I've probably put on over a hundred pounds, if not two hundred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly clicked. She knew she'd seen Lydia in class before, though she had been a lot thinner than she was now. She usually sat on the first row, and she had actually been one of the thinner girls when Sam had started school here. Not saying she was thin, but she wasn't the ball of fat she was now. Now, she was big enough that she could almost cover the width of the counter with her belly, which was where it sat most the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you weren't actually too much bigger than I am now. You sit on the front row. How did you gain weight so quickly?\" Sam said before realizing that probably wasn't an appropriate question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Lydia didn't really seem to take much offense to it, \"I actually started this job because I was tired of being the thin friend. I've been taking advantage of all the free food, and a few other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think it was even possible to put on a couple hundred pounds in just a couple of months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia blushed as she kneaded her large belly with her hands, \"When you live here, being thin kind of makes you an outcast. No one gets mad or shuns you though if you get super fat. I'm sure you've noticed. Still, I decided that it was time for me to fit in better, though now I'm not sure if I can stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam could understand that feeling. That had been how she'd felt back in the city. Though it had been the opposite there. Being fat made you a social outcast, and you had to be thin and athletic to fit in. Still, Lydia hadn't really answered her question, though she probably shouldn't press the matter right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed in a blur, though Sam found herself snacking almost constantly as she worked. When she was done, she went over to Stephen's where they played games late into the night before Sam decided she should probably head home. She followed her normal routine on the way home, enjoying the fact that the food was now free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled into bed after her massive feast, feeling her stuffed belly. Her head filled with thoughts as she turned off the lights. She wondered would have happened to her if she had been born here. She wondered if she would be immobile by now. Not like she'd ever get the chance to find out. She was here now though. Still, she couldn't deny that she was jealous of the kids who grew up here. If only she had that opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam huffed as she climbed the stairs to school. She could feel the weight of her body slowing her down as even the simplest movement seemed difficult. She knew if she kept this up she'd be immobile soon, but she just couldn't stop getting bigger. She'd been so hungry lately that she'd taken to eating tons of food after her family went to bed, which was just making her gain faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped at the top of the stairs, exhausted. She knew she was getting huge. She knew she was going to have an even harder time as she got fatter. It wasn't like she was trying to get fatter. It was just that food was so good. A lot of the other kids were starting to get jealous of how much she could eat, but that just lead her to want to eat more. She knew it was a vicious cycle, but she was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd weighed herself that morning. She'd been about 210, though she wasn't very tall so she looked huge. She just kept growing and growing. She wasn't the fattest girl her age yet, but she was definitely closing the gap. She couldn't help it, not like she wanted to stop. She was struggling even to do some of the simplest things. Still, part of her loved the way it felt to be so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd often admire her growing body in the mirror in her room late at night. She'd imagine it growing bigger and bigger. She'd seen some of her friends get so fat they couldn't move. She wanted that. She wanted to be one of the girls who got so fat they couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled to pull her shirt over her massive belly as she began waddling to class. One of her best friends wouldn't be here anymore. She'd gotten so fat that she couldn't get out of bed. Sam was extremely jealous. She wished that could be her, but she knew she had a long ways to go before she got to that point. Her friend was almost 500 pounds, which made her over twice as heavy as Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to catch her breath as she plopped down at her desk, watching the other kids file in and take their seats. There wasn't a single thin person among them, but that was normal. There were a few that were fatter than her, but not many. At least not many that still came to school. She'd been considering starting the work from home program since it was getting so hard just to walk the couple of blocks to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was insisting that she keep going to class as long as she could though. She could be so annoying sometimes. Her mom knew it was only a matter of time before Sam couldn't move, but she was acting like she should try not to gain weight. She wouldn't stop. She loved being fat too much. She loved food too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed without too much incident. Sam was careful to keep herself well fed throughout the day, adding to her already massive waistline. When she got home, she made a bee-line for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething smelled delicious as she entered the kitchen where her mother was just pulling something out of the over, \"Welcome home. I hope you're hungry, cause I made lasagna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam jumped as an alarm filled the air, and she quickly swatted out at her bedside table to silence it. Her room was still dark, with only the slightest glow of morning light. The air was cool, but filled with the delicious smell of breakfast coming from the kitchen. Sam pulled her blankets closer, trying to hold onto their warmth a moment longer. She smiled and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had dreamed she was a young girl again, though it was different than her normal dreams lately. This one wasn't so much a memory as something else. Something she longed for. She wished that girl could be her. It wasn't like she could go back in time though. She was stuck with what she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering her will, she threw the blankets off and crawled out of bed. She could feel the familiar feeling of her belly jiggling as she walked towards the mirror. She looked herself over, turning this way and that to get a better view of her body. There was no denying that she was starting to fatten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, wishing she didn't have to go to school today. She just wanted to go hang out with Stephen. Besides, it wasn't like missing a day would hurt her grades that much. She had straight A's and she knew she would be able to get caught up on anything she missed. She wasn't sure her mom would go for that, though it might be worth a try.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as she wanted to take a day off of school, she decided it would probably be better not to poke the bear right now. Her mom was already giving her a hard enough time about how <i>lazy</i> she'd been lately, and how she was starting to get fat. Though, it wasn't like she gave Heather a hard time anymore. Probably because she'd realized it wouldn't make a difference if she did. Heather was already huge, and there didn't seem to be anything that could change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her gaze away from the mirror, she left her room, tugging on her too-tight pajamas. She followed the smell of breakfast to the kitchen where Heather was already gorging herself, though her mother was oddly absent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's mom?\" Sam asked, plopping down at her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got called into work, so she had to leave early.\" Heather mumbled through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you enjoying being fat?\" Sam asked, admiring her massive sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather looked at Sam, cocking her head to one side, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just curious. I know you told me you wanted to get fatter, and obviously you have. How much bigger do you plan on getting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't plan on stopping anytime soon if that's what you're asking. I'm enjoying this way to much. Though it is getting really hard to do much of anything besides watch TV and play video games. Not that I'm complaining about that. And it seems like mom has finally stopped bugging me about it. Especially with how this town is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish she'd stop bugging me about it. It's not like I haven't been fat before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot about that! You were probably bigger than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that. You've definitely gotten huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. You were pretty big. Actually, that was one of the things that actually made me want to get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I used to admire how big you were. I would lay awake at night just dreaming I could be as big as you. You always seemed so happy when you were eating. That, and I loved watching how difficult it was for you to do even the most simple of tasks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean kinda like you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but then you lost all the weight. I was so disappointed. I wanted to see how big you were going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam glanced at her empty plate, frowning, \"Honestly, I kind of regret it now. Now I'm stuck watching you get fatter almost overnight, wishing that I could be that big again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Heather asked, leaning back in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I wish I could just go back in time and be that girl again. I loved the feeling of being that fat, and despite how much I've been eating lately, I haven't gained nearly as fast as you. I wish I had grown up here instead of in the city. I wish I had let myself get even fatter. Honestly, I kind of wish I could be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather bit her lip, \"That was kind of how I felt when you were fat. I would always watch you eating, and wish that I could be you. You just seemed to gain weight so easily, and I had to work so hard even to put on a pound. Though, since getting here, I've definitely been gaining a lot more quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sat in silence for a few minutes, before Sam finally excused herself to finish getting ready for school. She ended up sitting next to Lydia during class, and by the time the last bell rang for the day, she was sure she'd made a new friend. The two of them walked together to work, and spent most of the evening chatting and snacking between helping customers until their shifts were over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Sam made her way to Stephen's to hang out for a few hours. He was really starting to slow down, and Sam was sure he was almost getting to the point where he wouldn't be able to move anymore. Still, she was finding herself wanting him more and more. She was still a girl and he was a boy, and she was beginning to wonder if he would be a virgin his whole life once he got fat enough. She'd really grown to love him, if she was being honest. She wanted to spend all her time with him. She wanted to be there and keep feeding him when he got too fat, bu she wasn't sure he felt the same about her. She was determined to ask him tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh,\" Sam said, pausing the game she was playing, \"I, um, was wonder, uh, if, um, you liked me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen looked confused as he moved his hand away from her mouth, \"Of course. You're my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean. Do you <i>like</i> me?\" Sam asked, unable to resist any longer. She could feel herself growing more and more aroused, and part of her wanted to do it right that minute. Honestly, if he offered, she'd probably say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I, uh...\" Stephen trailed off, biting his lip before continuing, \"Honestly, I wished you were my girlfriend from the minute I saw you. I didn't think you were into me like that though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried about the same thing.\" Sam said, breathing a sigh of relief, \"Honestly, I've wanted to ask you for a while, but I've been too nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam bit her lip, admiring the massive boy beside her. She could feel her heart fluttering as she thought about how big he was. She'd repressed it a long time ago, but lately she couldn't deny that she wanted to be that fat. She wanted to be with someone that fat. She loved admiring ever roll of fat on his body, and imagining it on her. But that wasn't all. She wanted him to take her before he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do, uh, you want to be my boyfriend?\" She finally asked, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen looked shocked, but quickly responded with an excited, \"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel herself growing wetter and wetter, \"Well, if you're going to be my boyfriend. You're going to have to do a couple of things for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. What?\" Stephen said, heaving his heavy body closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, there's way too big of a weight difference between us, so you're going to have to work harder on fattening me up. I want to be fat enough that my mom will have no choice but to let me join the work from home program. Of course that also means doing a better job at keeping me fed. I've often been starving when I've left here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Really?\" Stephen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm not done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, I want to be the one to take care of you when you can't move anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" He asked with a large smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I want you to fill me with your seed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have any condoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you understand. I want you to fill me with your seed. I want to have a child with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Stephen asked, looking stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you don't want to that is. I've done a bit of research, and I'm sure that eventually that won't be an option once we get too fat. Hell, you might already be too fat, but this is something I really want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen answered by stripping off his massive shirt and beginning to work on his overlarge pants. Despite his early start, Sam was able to strip all her clothes faster, exposing her chubby body to the mound of fat. He was almost too fat, but they made it work as she savored the feeling of being filled. They went late into the night, switching between stuffing her with food and seed. Despite how full she felt on both ends, she still stopped at the fast food place on her way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, was almost the same as the day before, though she was careful not to let her mom know what her and Stephen had been up to. She was sure her mom would freak if she found out. Though maybe not. She'd always just told Sam to be careful, and choose carefully. And to take responsibility for whatever happened. Still, she wasn't sure if she was ready to admit that she was actually trying to get pregnant. Though, she did tell her mother that she had gotten a job, which made her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple months, Sam continued to go to school and work. She was becoming fast friends with Lydia, though she was surprised by how fast Lydia was growing. It probably wouldn't be too long before she couldn't even come to work anymore. However, she spent most of her free time over at Stephen's. After only a couple of weeks he became too fat for them to make it work anymore, so she had to hope that it had worked out. Fortunately, by the end of the first month she was starting to show signs of pregnancy. Over the next month she did her best to hide her symptoms from her family. Though, her other changes seemed to be doing a good job of hiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stretched, feeling her belly on the cold plastic of her laptop contrasted by the warmth of Stephen behind her. She tilted her head to make it easier for Stephen to stuff another cupcake into her waiting mouth. She knew it was about time to be going, but she just wanted to spend as much time as possible with Stephen. He was getting to the point where he didn't really leave his bed anymore except to let her in and grab them more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip as she glanced at how her belly folded over onto the laptop in her lap. She was having a hard time hiding her excitement as she packed on the pounds. Though she still wasn't gaining as fast as Heather or Lydia. Heather had gotten to the point where she had convinced their mother to let her do the work from home program. Ever since that, she'd been gaining even quicker, and it seemed like her mom was actually trying to help her get fatter faster. She was practically waiting on her hand and foot to make sure she was always eating. She couldn't deny she was jealous of her enormous sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved watching Heather struggle even to get out of bed. She was getting so fat that she couldn't go downstairs anymore because she didn't have the energy to get back up to her room. On top of that, she was almost always naked since she didn't see much point to getting clothes that would actually fit her anymore, since she would just outgrow them. Though Sam wasn't much better right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Stephen was naked, he never really got dressed anymore for the same reason as Heather, but Sam was still wearing a bra and some panties. Sighing, she moved her belly and closed the laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are starting to get fat.\" Stephen teased as she got up from the embrace of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you're one to talk.\" She shot back, slapping his flabby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he said, giving her a mock look of hurt, \"It was a compliment. Honestly, I think you look better like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not planning on staying like this. I'm still too thin.\" Sam said, glancing around for her clothes, \"Though, I do have to agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How heavy are you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think about 250... At least that's what I was a couple days ago. Still, I need to get a lot fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, have you told your mom that you're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not yet. Though, I'm not sure how much longer I can hide it. I think the baby is growing faster than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you going to tell her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want you to wait too long and regret it. Besides, she might be more willing to let you do the work from home program if she knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam finished getting dressed before heading out. She stopped at the fast food place on her way home, but she just couldn't deny that Stephen made a valid point. Maybe she should talk to her mom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam looked over her body in the dim light from her lamp. Her blinds glowed faintly with reflected light, though sunrise was probably at least an hour off. Despite the early hour, she could hear her mother working in the kitchen, preparing Heather's morning feast and Sam's breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's belly had grown exponentially since her and Stephen had made it official, though not all of its growth was fat. By her old cities standards, she was absolutely obese. By Bountiful's standards, she was still fairly thin. Her face was growing rounder by the day it seemed, and even her neck was growing thicker. Her once flat chest now sported two decent sized breasts. She wouldn't win any contests for size, but at least she was looking more like a girl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all the other changes were dwarfed by her expanding belly which had grown round and soft. Her once toned abs were long gone, as they were now covered by a thick layer of fat that was starting to droop towards the ground. Though, underneath that fat, Sam could feel a firmness growing too. Her shirt fit tightly around her swollen chest, not even coming close to covering her belly, while her pajama bottoms had been stretched so much that they had started to tear along the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam licked her lips as she imagined how much bigger she was going to get. Even if she didn't gain anymore fat, she was still going to grow as the baby inside her grew. Though at the rate she was putting on weight, she might be immobile in another 6 months. Not that that would be a bad thing. She loved watching her body growing. That was one of the reasons she hadn't gotten new pajamas yet despite having gotten an entirely new wardrobe to fit her growing body. She loved watching them strain to contain her expanding frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother hadn't been complaining about her weight since she'd confessed she was pregnant. Actually, it was almost the opposite, it was almost like she was trying to fatten her up now. She'd been making larger meals for Sam, though that could just be because of the shear amount of food she had to prepare to keep Heather happy. Still, compared to Heather, Sam was a twig. Though she definitely wasn't thin anymore considering she was about 300 lbs. She couldn't believe that she'd almost tripled her weight since moving here. Though, not having to actually go to school helped, since her mom had agreed to let her join the work from home program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a twirl, she tore her gaze away from the mirror and plodded into the hallway. Her stomach growled as the smell of breakfast almost over powered her. Her mouth was salivating as she instinctively made her way to the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was just setting a large plate of food at Sam's spot, and Heather was already at the table eating. She was spread across two chairs, since she'd discovered that one chair wasn't strong enough to support her weight anymore. Though, it wasn't like Heather came to the kitchen to eat very often. Usually it was just when she was especially hungry and didn't want to wait for her mother to deliver the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam plopped down in her chair and began ravenously stuffing the food into her mouth. She'd really given into her desires lately, and been an absolute glutton. Though compared with Heather's size and appetite, she was completely tame. Heather was easily over 500 lbs by now, and the fact that she could even walk anymore was absolutely astounding. Though Sam was sure that it wouldn't last much longer. Heather was covered in stretch marks all over her body flabby body. Her belly was truly massive as it extended over her knees. Sam couldn't deny how jealous she was of her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Sam finished getting ready, trying to decide what to do for the day. She loved spending time with Stephen, especially since he was immobile now. Though she kind of wanted to go hang out with Lydia too. Or even Heather. Of course, she also had some homework she needed to get done. Of course it was probably time to pick out some new clothes since she was starting to outgrown her most recent wardrobe. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam took another look at her expanding body in the mirror. Though tight, her clothes still fit, so she had a little bit of time before she needed to get new clothes. Though, not much. She grabbed her flabby belly in her hands, savoring the feel of her soft flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she grabbed her phone and shot Lydia a text asking if it was okay for Sam to come over. She'd been to Lydia's house a couple of times since she'd started working at the restaurant, but she wasn't comfortable coming over uninvited just yet. She only had to wait a moment for Lydia to respond, and a few minutes later Sam was making her way out into the cold winter morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shivered slightly as the cold wrapped around her, doing its best to sap her heat as she plodded through the fresh powder that had fallen overnight. The trees were bare, and few people were out in the cold, though the ones she did see, seemed almost unaffected by it. Their massive size providing ample insulation from the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she'd put on quite a bit of weight the last few months, she was still struggling with the cold. However, she was finding that it wasn't as bad as it used to be as she continued growing her own coat of fat. She'd talked to her mother about getting a car, but she refused to buy one for Sam since she didn't think she'd get to use it very long before she was immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam frowned as she walked. It was weird how her mother had done almost a complete 180 in the last month or so. She'd gone from being worried about Sam's weight, to accepting that she was probably going to be immobile at some point. Though she wasn't the only one acting weird. Her dad had seemed almost ecstatic when he'd found out she was pregnant. It seemed like he was always watching her now. Especially when she was eating. He kept insisting on keeping track of her weight. For the babies sake, he would say. Still, she didn't particularly mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the corner onto Lydia's street, and walked the last little bit to her house. It was an average sized house, though there were only a couple of vehicles in the driveway. Lydia's mother couldn't go anywhere since she'd become immobile shortly after Lydia was born, though apparently that was quite common for women in this town. Lydia had been freaking out about how fat Sam was going to get now that she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam knocked on the door, and waited a minute before it opened, revealing a fat girl, about 8-years-old, \"Hey Mia, I'm here to see Lydia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had a candy bar in one hand, and her shirt was really straining to contain the obese girl, \"She's upstairs in her room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stepped past the girl, jealous of her size, \"Is she still playing that game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Mia said, shutting the door behind Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam made her way upstairs, glancing into Lydia's mother's room as she passed. The woman didn't even look like a person anymore with how fat she was. Her body almost completely filled the room, carpeting it in her soft fleshy belly. Sam couldn't deny that a part of her wanted to be that big. She wanted to be so fat, that she could fill a whole house with her body. With a sigh, she tore her gaze away and walked into Lydia's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How's the mother to be? You really are starting to get big.\" Lydia said, pausing the game she was playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk. I don't even think you fit in that chair anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was definitely getting huge. She was camped out in a large armchair, though her belly was starting to flow over the sides. Numerous snacks and wrappers surrounded her, and she was using her belly as a table for what looked like a meal for 10 people. Her bra was straining to contain her large chest, and her belly was so big that Sam wasn't even sure if she was wearing underwear of not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you say that now, but I bet you'll end up bigger than me soon. Getting pregnant here changes you. Makes you super hungry all the time and you just end up blowing up like a balloon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you seem to be gaining faster than me. So are you pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia bit her lip, \"No, but I've definitely had help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Sam said, plopping down on the wooden chair at Lydia's desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia glanced out her door, lowering her voice to a whisper, \"Honestly, I actually tried this new experimental drug that was supposed to help me gain some weight. Though I haven't been able to stop since I took it. There was this girl in the restaurant one day, and she was eating a ton. More than I could've imagined. So I asked her about her big appetite, and she said her dad worked for the lab that's here in town and she'd found this drug in his briefcase. Said that there were some notes with it on how it could help people gain a lot of weight and still be healthy, so she took some of them and she said she'd been hungry ever since. She just couldn't get full, and she said that it had made it really easy to pack on the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I asked if she had anymore and she gave me a few. This is the result of taking one of them. I've been so hungry all the time, and sure enough, I've been able to pack on the pounds really easy. Too easy actually. I was hoping to at least be on par with some of my friends, but now I don't think I can stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Is something like that even possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me. If you want, I could give you the rest. Though, I think being pregnant will give you enough of a boost if you're looking to gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three. I don't want them anymore, but I didn't want to throw them away. They're yours if you want them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked </span></div></div>",
