            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh Malcolm Taylor. You're generally nice, but not a perfect angel. You're a fifth year Ravenclaw Hogwarts student. You're pretty bright, afterall, that's why you're in Ravenclaw. Throughout your studying, you noticed an annoying little flaw. There are two shrinking charms, Reducio and Diminuendo. But the problem is, Reducio only works as the counterpart to Engorgio, it can only shrink something back to normal size after it has been enlarged by Engorgio. And Diminuendo can shrink objects to smaller than their original size, but doesn't work on living things. You wanted to bridge this gap, and be credited for creating the most useful shrinking spell, far superior to the other two shrinking charms due to their limitations. But you're not simply <i>using</i> a spell, you're <i>creating</i> one. Sometimes using spells can be dangerous, as it can go awry. But you're dealing with untamed magic, forcing it to bend to your will and making it bound to a word (or words) of power. This is especially difficult and highly dangerous for inexperienced witches and wizards. And here you are, not even graduated from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, trying just that. Boy, for being a Ravenclaw sometimes you sure can do some idiotic things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whaddya know, in the midst of your first attempt, the magic surges, not ready to bend to your will so easily, and due to your inexperience with raw magic, it handles you easily. Your wand explodes from this surge of power, and the explosion of light shrinks anything near you...especially you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little woozy for a few moments, and when you look around everything is downright <i>massive</i>. You feel great joy at first, for the fact that even though you didn't actually succeed in creating the spell, for the fact that the magic shrunk things that means you were on the right track. But then you start to fully realize your predicament. Your wand exploded. You can't use magic. You're very tiny, maybe only an inch tall. And even if you can get someone to help you, Engorgio can't make something as small as you as big as you once were. You're completely, utterly, stuck like this. Now the question is...where did you perform this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were extremely nervous as you walked down the hall towards the new Headmistress's office, formerly headmaster Dumbledore's office. As you walked you couldn't help but wonder what it was that you were being called into her office for, as far as you knew you had not broken any of the new rules that she had set into place. You were suddenly worried wondering if a new rule had been added without your knowledge and you had somehow broken it. As the anxiety began to fester you came upon the gargoyle that signified the entrance to Headmistress Umbridge's office. \"Obedience\", you spoke softly to the gargoyle and then watched as the gargoyle moved revealing the secret staircase. You began to make your way  apprehensively towards her office door where you then knocked. \"Who is it?\" you heard her call out in that sickeningly sweet voice that she used. \"ummm.... Malcolm Taylor Mam\", you called back, \"ah yes, do come in.\" she replied.<br>\r\n                You timidly open the door and peak your head in, you see her sitting there behind her desk and as you looked at her you could not help but agree with what everyone was saying about how the Headmistress had an uncanny resemblance to a toad. \"Come in, come in Mister Taylor I don't have all day.\" you slowly entered the room and began to walk towards the chair located in-front of her desk. As you reached it you took a seat and marveled at how comfy the seat was, which helped ease your mind a little in regards to the situation that you were currently in. Just as you were getting comfortable the Headmistress mad a hemming noise to gain my attention which i just realized had been drawn away from her. \"Now Mister Taylor do you know why it is that I called you here tonight?\" She asked you as she calmly sipped some of her tea. \"No Mam, i don't. Have i done something wrong?\" You asked a little nervously as she seemed to be eyeing you up and down as if you were a bug that needed to be squished beneath her feet. \"Oh not at all my boy \" she said gaining a cheery look again, \"I have actually called you in here to see if you would be willing to help me with something.\" You breathed a sigh of relief as you realized that you were not actually in trouble, but pushing away that feeling you brought your attention back to the Headmistress and said, \"Of course Headmistress i would be more than happy to help you with anything that you might need.\" As the words left your mouth the Headmistresses eyes lit up in an untold amount of glee as she looked at you, Oh that's just wonderful, I'm so glad you said that i have been looking for a new butt cushion for ages, ever since my last one died my butt has been rather lonely without a little body underneath it keeping it company.\" You sat there gaping at her, \"Headmistress you can't be serious, I can't be your butt cushion, that's, that's crazy.\" you stuttered, standing up slowly about to bolt for the door. She watched you slowly stand up and just sighed, \"Why do they always think they can get away.\" she said solemnly as she watched you slowly back up towards the door. Just as you were about to turn and make a run for it the Headmistress raised her wand and called out \"Shrinko\". <br>\r\n           The next thing that you notice was that everything was dark and you seemed to be covered in some type of fabric. You began to stumble around trying to find a way out of wherever you were when suddenly you see a light, you made your way toward the light and as you exited from underneath the cloth you could only gape around in horror as you realized that the fabric tunnel you had been trapped in had actually been your robe and you had been reduced to maybe six inches in height. You watched in abject terror as you saw the giant, and you mean giant from of the Headmistress rise from her seat and step out from behind her desk. You could only stare in wonder at this giantess before you as she began to walk slowly toward you. The Headmistress's footsteps boomed in the distance and you noticed that her feet were clad only in a pair of nylons which looked like they had seen far to much use in there time, and as she walked closer the horrendous odor emanating from her nylon clad feet began to reach you and you could not help but gag and bend over as the smell penetrated deep inside you. When she reaches you she places both her feet on either side of you looking down at you from way above, this made you feel so humiliated as you were now nothing more than  a bug at this giant woman's disgusting smelling feet just waiting to be squished and become another stain on her worn nylons, however this was not to be your fate as she slowly reached down and grasped you in between her thumb and middle finger. \"<b>WELL DON'T YOU JUST LOOK PERFECT NOW DEARIE, IM SURE MY BUTT WILL BE VERY PLEASED TO SEE YOU AND I AM SURE TO FEEL A GREAT AMOUNT OF PLEASURE FROM SITTING ON YOUR WORTHLESS BODY, BUT I\"M AFRAID I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL BE GETTING ANY PLEASURE OUT OF THIS EXCHANGE SWEETIE, BUT BE GLAD BEFORE THIS YOU WERE JUST A REGULAR STUDENT WHO PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GONE ON TO GET SOME MEDIOCRE JOB, BUT NOW YOU GET THE HONOR OF BEING MY NEW BUTT CUSHION, WELL AT LEAST AS LONG AS YOU CAN SURVIVE THAT IS</b>.\" she intoned down to you as she spoke the words that doomed you to your fate of being this woman's butt cushion for the rest of your foreseeable short life.She walked back towards her desk and as she pulled out her chair she gently deposited you down in the center of the chair. AS you looked up you could only scream in terror as The Headmistress's giant butt slowly descended upon you. When it reached you you tried with all your might to somehow hold it up only to have your hope crushed as her giant butt squished you into the chair, amazing you somehow survived the ordeal but you think that that is only the case because you were currently located under her ass crack where there was the least about of weight. \"<b>YOU BE GOOD DOWN THERE LITTLE BOY AND BE SURE TO SHOW MY BEAUTIFUL HOW GRATEFUL YOU ARE THAT YOU WERE GIVEN THE HONOR OF BEING ITS CUSHION</b>.\" she called down to you wiggling slightly so as to get more comfortable. You could only hope that this torture would not last to long and hopefully she would get up soon and you could try to escape again.....</span></div></div>",

As you are pondering you feel her shake her plump bum, \"Like my little charm?\" She said giggling\"I made it myself, along with my shrinking spell.\"<br>\r\nYou're left dumbfounded by this revelation, \"How long has she been doing this?\" You thought to yourself.  She must be proficient at legilimency as well because she answers your thoughts immediately,\"Oh I've been doing this since my Fourth year at Hogwarts, you'll notice that the amount of disappearance at Hogwarts increasing after that point.\" You're left horrified at the idea of this old toad shrinking and subjecting her classmates to appeasing her desires.Once again reading your thoughts Umbridge clenched her cheeks together, forcing you closer to the musky hole that is going to torment you for the foreseeable future\"Now now,\" You hear her say,\"It's rude to insult your Headmistress like that.\" Her anus was centimeters (to you) away from your face, the smell was incredibly musky, almost as if she only cleans it when necessary, leaving it to absorb the smell of her sweat and gas. Although you found the smell disgusting, you were... drawn to it in a way, as if it was something you had been wanting but never quite knew what it was, You're woken from your stupor as you hear Umbridge giving a little cough and the surprised gasp of the troublemakers that Umbridge had to interrupt her work to chase down, you hear the sound of her wand petrifying the group aswell as her telling Finch to just give them regular detention because she had some \"unfinished business\" to attend to, which you can only assume to be her next session of tormenting you....</span></div></div>",

As they've settled in place, sealing you like a gigantic, sweaty tomb - all you could think of is that, if you didn't act fast, or god forbid, she would decide to scrunch her monolith toes or drag your tiny form across the stoney surface, you're done for.<br>\r\nAs the fear started sinking in, you did the only logical thing you could've done at that point - you started kicking and punching as hard as you could. You behaved like an animal.. well, a tiny animal at that. Started squirming all over the place, punching the fleshy walls that were the undersides of this gigantic magician's toes, doing anything you could think off to alert her to your presence - but to no avail. This foot had no plans on moving anywhere, and your oxygen was running out, and fast.<br>\r\nFearing the end, you just laid there. Staring at the cieling of flesh above you. Through the waves of heat and the sweaty air that has been burning your nostrils and making your eyes watery, it was quite an amazing sight, really. Barely any light from the room got in through the toes, who moved up and down in the tiniest of movements. Thinking that this tomb allowed a bit of air and light through, was quite an amazing sight to thi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween her toes!<br>\r\nGod, suddenly it hits you! Her skin was hard, calloused from years of walking barefoot in sneakers or even outdoors, but although the bottoms of her foot might not feel you - perhaps the skin between her petite toes might be different. You raise your upper body up, supporting yourself with one hand pressed up tightly against her second toe, as your other hand begins your journey in between those toes above you. As you reach in, it feels different, somehow - you feel the excessive sweat here, that hasn't had the chance to dry up yet, absorbing itself into your shirt and skin, making them stick to one another. It makes you retch in disgust, but you know you must push your hand further in.<br>\r\nAnd then, you feel something. It feels like a rubbery material of sorts. You try and squeeze it a bit, and eventually manage to tear some of it up. You take your hand out to take a look at it - and can't stop the reflex of vomiting upon sight. It's the cheese that has been accumulating between them, and as soon as you see it's yellowish color and it's smell starts hitting you in the face - you rub it against the young teen's vast sole in front of you.<br>\r\n\"This has to be some kind of nightmare\", you think to yourself. You imagined being underneath these canopies of flesh would not be the most pleasant experience - but this?<br>\r\nKnowing fully well what needs to be done, you start sobbing quietly, while pushing your hand further between your unaware captors second and third toes.<br>\r\nDigging your hand in, you continued digging in, making sure to rub the stinky, sweaty material upon the sole in front of you, while not looking. You dug, and dug, and dug - and at some point, thought this torture would never end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil it did.<br>\r\nYou felt something else. Beneath all these layers of cheese, finally, there was something else. Getting up on your knees, you pushed your head into the crevice, some leftover cheese sticking to your hair and clothes. But there, you saw it - a piece of skin, larger than your head. In contrast with the rest of the foot, this piece of skin had kind of a reddish color to it, making it obvious it was softer than the rest of Harmione's foot, since it was protected by all the cheese surrounding it. <br>\r\nReaching your hand towards it, you touch it. And start gently tickling it with your fingers, expecting some kind of response in return to your efforts. Your nimble fingers dug into the skin, rubbing faster, vaster motions.. Rubbing, rubbing, rubbing with all of your tiny strength..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the response never came.<br>\r\nYou tried rubbing again, and again. And tears started streaming down your eyes. All of your effort, the disgust you had to pull through, everything that has happened up to this point.. All, for nothing. \"This won't be my tomb, I won't let it end like this!\", you say in anger, but before you could even do something.. You feel a shift in position.<br>\r\nThe toes started to flatten against the stone tiles. The entire arch flattening against the cold floor, giving it a pinkish-whitish color instead of it's usual brown pink, making it obvious the giant magician has only one plan in mind.<br>\r\nFeeling the warmth radiating from her feet, she wants to rub them against the cold floor once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the ceiling of flesh suddenly dropping down on you, you understood you had very little time to decide. The gap between her toes was closing, and fast, it's piece of exposed skin waving you, and your chances of escape, goodbye.<br>\r\nYou had to act now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze yourself through her toes, and find you have no place for your hands in there. Only your torso could barely fit in, as it is. You look frantically in every direction, trying to think about a course of action as the toes close in for the kill, and understand you have no other choice.<br>\r\nReaching in with your face, you begin licking the soft skin with your tongue. At first, when you taste the skin, the sweat drops that has been forming all around it, the tiny bits of cheese that was left over, you had to keep yourself from throwing up. But knowing full well what stopping meant, it took every ounce of strength within you to continue.<br>\r\nThe toes continued to zoom in, every bit of light disappearing from up above. Oxygen levels reaching a new low, and don't get me even started on the heat that was forming all around you, but just before the end..<br>\r\nThe toes stop. The entire foot stops at once, and you stop licking as well. Looking up above you, you could barely see anyhing, other than the tomb of flesh that was trying to seal you. But you squeezed your eyes, and tried your best.<br>\r\nAnd there, from in between the petite toes - you could just make it: The gigantic face of your goddess, looking right at the crevice you've been molesting. Opening up your mouth, coughing and spluttering foot gunk, you yell at her: \"Harmione! Please! Down here!!!\". <br>\r\nWhen suddenly, the sky turn dark all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh...       </span></div></div>",

With a slight crinkle of her nose, however, she makes and embarrassing realization. <i>I can smell my feet from here!</i> She thinks, blushing a deep red as she looks around the library for anyone nearby.Luckily for her, and  Unluckily for you, there were no parties present to catch a whiff of the strong cheesy stench... except for you, who was about to get a front-row seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione quickly rubs her feet on the stone tiles one last time, and lifts her pale feet above the sneakers once more.

You shudder as Hermione's stale sweat beads up from the sneaker below to soak your back, but don't dare cry out for fear of the mess before you entering your mouth again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young witch adjusts her feet, entombing you in a dank, sweaty prison as the temperature rises, beads of perspiration already forming on her foot as she scrunches you into the sticky toes in the crippling darkness. She stamps her sole into the cobblestones below, pressing you down flush with the giving insole as her toes brush against the tip of her sneaker. Clearly you wouldn't be causing her much more discomfort, but she would be causing you plenty. As the young prodigies' sweat start to form on her toes above, you cry out in despair.

She leans down, saying, \"Oh? What's this? Did a bug crawl into my shoe?\" No, not a bug! You immediately start waving your arms, and yelling, \"I am not a bug!\" Her eyebrows raise. \"Did you just talk? You're not a bug, are you?\" She pulls out her wand and flicks it swiftly and masterfully, you rising in the air from her magic. To your relief, the smell stays in the shoe as you leave it. She brings you closer to her face, where she can see you properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! You're not a bug at all, you're a tiny person! How fascinating! What to do with you, though...\"</span></div></div>",

No, that's not it...Wait...you think you've heard of this one, it's a spell where you have the particles in a container automatically transmute themselves.

All you wanted was to deliver a simple \"Hello, I'm tiny, please help,\" and now to her you're a bug for spell practice. What, is Murphy's Law hanging around over your head like a black cloud? You take a seat (an uncomfortable one, at that) in your small glass prison while being rhythmically jostled up and down from her walking. It's positively irritating but there's nothing you can do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe ten or fifteen minutes later, you feel the walking stop and you are blinded by the light of the outside world.

That way, if I squash you, you'll live,\" she says, brown eyes staring intently, \"Not that I want you to live, but if I want to perform tests on you it wouldn't work out well if I accidentally killed you premature.\"<br>\r\nShe nods, then twirls her wand at you, a purple light engulfing you and making you feel tingly all over. Her eyes study you a moment, and she nods definitively.<br>\r\n\"There, that should be working. Let's try,\" she said before knocking you onto the floor with her wand. It was uncomfortable enough falling from the height to the floor, but you just about peed yourself when she brought her sneaker over you, blotting out the light overhead and her face. You had not even a moment to blink before the shoe crashed down upon your body, squashing you like...well like exactly what she thought you was--a bug. She grinded her foot on top of you, causing you intense pain, but not killing you. She made you practically invulnerable! You weren't positive, but you thought there was an easy way to take away your pain too, but of course she wouldn't do that. Sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will she try next?</span></div></div>",

It's really quite embarrassing, having a younger student forcing you to climb into her smelly flat and not even being able to do so under your own power. After several minutes of your pathetic attempts at trying to pull your diminutive weight over the ledge, Ginny giggles. \"Need some help, little guy?\" she asks, finding your struggles amusing. Your face immediately burns red as she asks you this. As if it wasn't bad enough that you were climbing into her rank shoe, but now she's decided you're not good enough to do it on your own and has to help you. Poor, helpless little Malcolm. You shake your head, positive you'll pull it off eventually. She lets out a puff of air and says, \"Oh don't be stubborn. Here, let me help.\" And with that, you see her black sock-clad foot glide over and hover above you. You hardly have time to marvel at how just her foot dwarfs you in size as her toes lower on top of you and smash you into the ground. Pushing you into the ground in order to get a better grip, her toes wrap around you as far as they can and squeeze you into the ball of foot. Deciding the worst part of the situation is difficult, whether it be the terrible smell emanating from her sock, the damp fabric that you know without a doubt is from sweat, or the fact that your tiny adventure has only managed to land you in the vice grip of a young student's toes. Satisfied that her toes have a good enough grip on you, she lifts her foot a little, making sure you won't fall. \"Gotcha, little guy. In you go!\" she says, almost cutely. Definitely not cute from her toe grip. Without further adieu, she slides her foot into her flat. Once it's all the way on, she lets her toes rest and drop you onto the insole. If you thought her sock smelled bad by itself, then you had another thing coming when it was inside her shoe. The air was musty, the floor was grimy and damp, and it was all just so humid and smelly. Her sock clad toes rest on top of you, lightly pushing you into her insole. Unable to resist her powerful appendages, you have no choice but to let her toes play with you in any such manner. From outside the shoe, Ginny smiles as her pet is in place.  </span></div></div>",

Once they took off there sweaty socks Hermione plucked you out of her shoe and with no hesitation they began to rub there bare sweaty feet on you and you began to cry heavier.

The second you hit the bottom, you can feel the humidity difference. It's so <i>muggy</i> in here. It's just awful. Oh, and the smell. There are not enough words to describe the horrid smell of Luna Lovegood's feet. Your eyes are continuing to water, and you're fighting viciously with your gag reflex. And now you yourself are sweating profusely from the moist environment.You look up the shaft that is the opening of Luna's converse and see her beautiful face looking down at you, smiling. \"Good little Zimboggler, keep breathing that in. Now you definitely won't give me nightmares! If you're lucky, instead of getting rid of you, I'll just let you live in there!\" the last part of this increased the smile on her face. As if she's doing <i>anyone</i> a favor. You try yelling up at her, hoping she'll realize who you are, \"Luna! Stop this! Your shoe is awful!\" but to no avail, as she obviously cannot hear you. \"Alright little Zimboggler, crawl to the front of my shoe, where you can befriend my toes. If you stay where you are my heel will squash you!\" she giggled. You sight in defeat, and walk to the toe-section of Luna's shoe. You dully notice that the further into the shoe that you venture, the worse the humidity and the smell become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you reach the disgusting toeprints in the front of her shoe, it shakes a bit and the light dims. Oh great, she's already putting it on. Her pale foot glides through the shoe, like a smelly ghost. You decided you didn't want to be pinned, so you position yourself between toe prints, rather than in them. And within moments, her slender toes surround either side of you, and squeeze you into their stinky embrace. You can faintly hear her tying the laces of her shoe above you, as if it were the sound of a jail cell locking.</span></div></div>",

The motion of walking is sickening (as if the smell wasn't bad enough), and you <i>really</i> wish she wouldn't shake her foot so much when she crosses her legs. But you are powerless in the confines of her shoe, imprisoned between her two unsocked toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself getting hungry, which must mean it's very close to noon, because your stomach is always right on time. Luna must have noticed the time too, because she leaned down and told you what you're allowed to eat. \"Hey little Zimboggler, it's lunch time! I bet you're super hungry. Okay, well, I hadn't mentioned this yet, but as my captive Zimboggler, you get a very unique diet. It's definitely not people food, because that would of course strengthen you, and possibly allow you to give me nightmares. So that's out of the question. I've decided that for the purpose of keeping you submitted, that the best diet for you is to drink my foot sweat and eat my toe jam. Oh and if you're lucky, you can eat some dead skin that flakes off my foot, isn't that great?\" she asks excitedly, and even though you can't see her through the shoe you can tell she's innocently smiling. If only she knew what she was doing to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, will you submit and eat your planned diet?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You tried to ignore the ultimatum Luna gave you (that being eat the crud from her foot or starve to death), but it seemed like fate was against you. Even in the grasp of her moist, writhing toes, surrounded by the horrid reek of unwashed feet, you felt your stomach growl. You'd think the stench would make you too nauseous to consider eating, but on the contrary, the potent, cheddary scent, though mixed in with other foul hints of worn leather and faded perfume, only deepened your hunger. Your metabolic clock, while often useful, has now become your worst enemy. You were practically starving! Not to mention that you were quite parched, too; what with the briny, salt-infused atmosphere sucking all the moisture out of your mouth. Sooner or later, you would have to nut up and bite the bullet\u2014or in this case, Luna's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luna went about her daily routine, you were made painfully aware of the dilapidated state of her converse. They were so worn down that, at one point, the lip of the shoe ripped just a tiny bit, barely allowing a bit of light into your shoe prison. Even though the light relieved you of sensory deprivation, you honestly preferred the darkness; at least there you weren't forced to gaze into the abyss that was the gunk-filled toe crevice in front of you. You look down, occasionally catching glances at your own body; your wizarding robes were in tatters, doused in sweat, and covered in grime. They're already falling apart at the seams; you shudder to think of how they'd hold up under much more of this kind of stress, and how long you've been in this truly revolting piece of footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as she sits down for a moment, you feel your thirst reach a fever pitch. Your lips are chapped to hell and back, your mouth is as dry as a desert, and you're sure above all else that if you didn't do something to relieve the ache in your throat right now, you would perish. You turn your head and regretfully crane your neck towards the side of the second toe, open your mouth, and suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, a sharp, salty tang washes over your mouth, the dreaded concoction coating your tongue completely as you lick the surface of the titanic toe. This is followed by a concentrated punch of flavor from the miniscule clumps of dirt, dead skin, and dried sweat that inevitably fell through your lips. The spells Luna used must have been very powerful, because you could feel fresh rivulets of the vile liquid pouring into your mouth just as quickly as you lapped it up. And lap it up you did; you really underestimated how thirsty this awful humidity made you. Despite your disgust, you downed the live-giving sweat like it was the nectar of the gods. It was as if you were put on auto-pilot. The taste was almost indescribable; you could barely hold back a gag. You told yourself that it was all for the sake of survival, but as the contents of your 'drink' trickle down your esophagus, never-ending, you can't help but think it's just another game you'll 'play' with Luna in the eternity you'll spend in her beat-up converse, being a play-toy for her sweaty, musky, and unbelievably grimy feet. The taste, though, was getting more tolerable, a thought that shocked you to your core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to justify it to yourself. Like with those films with people stranded on lifeless islands, you have to adapt to your environment, and come to view this awful torture as normal, and this terrible 'water' as a sign of hope. You were dehydrated, so naturally, any source of water would be enjoyable, even the days-old (or god-knows how long since she washed her damn feet) footsweat of a ditzy, dreamy witch-in-training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't say the same about your 'food', however; as you purse your lips around the toe flesh, chewing slightly, but not enough to hurt, slight flakes of dried sweat and dead toe skin scrape off into your mouth, renewing the potent smack all over again, every time it happens. As you continue this method, you eventually make your way towards the deep recesses of Luna's toe crevices. Your stomach still rumbling, you realize that you have no choice but to stick your face in and eat the toe jam straight from the source. The first bite makes everything you've experienced in this hellish shoe seem small in comparison; it was like some horrific, elaborately cooked meal\u2014there were tastes of dead grass, leather, and flesh, all thrown together in a sweat-based stock that complemented the other ingredients in a terrible symphony of feet. Still, you had to eat it; after all, there was nothing else in here you could subsist off of. And so, you bit off and swallowed down pieces of the gooey mass between the toes that squeezed you, sating your hunger\u2014not that you could tell, considering that it might just as well be nausea rather than the feeling of a full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout all this, Luna felt every little movement, lick, and bite that you made. She was content with your work as she finished off a delicious cauldron cake her father got for her from Qizilbash. It might've been a bit too much of a dessert to eat at lunchtime, but she felt pretty proud of herself for catching such a rare creature<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I don't have to be rid of this Zimboggler after all...he's a pretty useful toe-cleaner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then remembered the catchphrase on the package her sweet came in: \"Great for sharing!\" As she contemplated it, she felt a bit bad about the little thing in her shoes. Even if it was foul work it was doing, it might not deserve this much torture; but should she risk it getting out, just to feed it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tiny muggle? No, that's not right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true, that some students have smuggled in some tiny muggles to keep as pets. They're strictly forbidden, so they're kept a secret. Which isn't quite hard, considering their size. There have been some magical anomalies in different parts of the world that have caused hundreds of people to spontaneously shrink. The magical governments of the world did a great job at memory-replacing any muggles that knew about the shrunken people, but they have been unsuccessful at stopping the anomalies, and only partially successful at regrowing a select few muggles. It's quite a difficult and confusing process which appears to be different on a person-by-person basis. In fact, these anomalies are in part what you began your research into your spell on. Since the anomalies are so random and widespread, a lot of the tiny muggles are captured by others and kept before any governing entities can swoop in and save them. Which is exactly how so many find their way into the hands of students, if hidden well enough and paid a high enough price for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, being assumed to be a tiny muggle is much worse than being recognized as a shrunken student. It could put you right into the degrading lifestyle of being the pet or plaything of a student here. But shouldn't Luna know you're a student by your attire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, it's so cute how your owner dressed you in tiny Hogwarts robes. How adorable!\" she says, cooing over you. Well...shoot, that's that. You try yelling up to her, but she either can't hear you or has no interest in listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame someone lost you. I can't exactly put up 'found' posters, since you're contraband. Oh well,\" she says, her hand reaching down for you. Adrenaline kicks in and you're prepared to run for your life (as nice as Luna is, a giant hand reaching for you is terrifying no matter the circumstances), but it doesn't matter. Her fingers encase you before you make it as far as five steps. Being wrapped up in her fingers elicits a strange mix of feelings, both fearful and comforting. You're trapped, yet it is warm, and in the embrace of a person. You want free, but at the same time, her hand is so soft...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You seriously doubt you can get her attention from down here. So it looks like your only option is to climb. Your eyes drift up the entire monolithic form of Padma. Her sheer size simply astounds you. You have a hard time comprehending the position you're in. You're sure it'll be a little easier to fathom once you're used to it, but since Padma is the only person you've come across, it's hard not to think of her as a goddess uninterested in your mortal affairs. Which is why you'll have to try so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table legs don't seem apt for climbing, so they're out. You scope out Padma's legs. She's wearing jeans, so you're not really sure if you can climb her legs either. Then you eye her robe. A loose material, so you can definitely get a grip wherever. The only problem is it will take a lot of upper body strength. You miss your wand more than ever. You remember learning a sticky-hands charm just a few weeks ago that would make it a cinch to climb even the smooth table leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to Padma's robes, cascaded onto the ground since she's sitting. You look up at the black fabric wall, bracing yourself. You allow yourself a few deep breaths, and then begin your ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is tougher than you expected. Grabbing fistfuls of robe and then thrusting your opposite arm upwards to grab something higher, only to have to pull yourself up again and again. There are no footholds. This is all arm-work. You have to stop and dangle every once in a while, to let your arms rest a bit. But you can't dawdle too long, for fear of Padma getting up to leave at any moment. You pray she's still got a while here in the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're honestly not sure how long it takes, but for you it feels like an eternity. You finally reach height with the chair, and pull yourself from her robe onto the chair. You lie down and breathe, thankful for the rest. Your arms are screaming from the effort, and your fingers hurt from all the time clenching the robe, especially when you had to dangle for a \"rest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile laying down on the chair next to Padma, you once again take notice of how large she is to you. Now that you're just a couple of feet from her body, you can notice minute shifts in her positioning. You can see her breathing, which looks like an impressive feat for such a large being, though you know for her it's as natural as it is for you (though right now you're breathing pretty hard). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're feeling well enough to continue, you stand up on the chair and look up at Padma again. You can see her prefect badge on the outside of her robes, which is a comforting sight. It's your beacon of hope that tells you all this effort will be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide it's time to finish this. From here you can climb some wrinkles in her jeans to get on top of her leg. This was ten times easier than climbing her robe. Then you walk up her leg to her stomach. She's wearing a dark red sweater, with plenty of folds and wrinkles that look relatively easy to climb. No sweat. You proudly climb up her sweater, with renewed vigor. You can do this! Your goal is to reach her arm, so you can get on top and make your way to the table, which her arm is resting on. It will be dangerous, because her arm is likely to move, but you're determined now. You will get on that table and get her attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to ignore the redness in your face as you climb the obstacle that is Padma's breasts. It's definitely a lot harder than her stomach but you pull it off. A bit embarrassed the whole time, though. Thankfully she doesn't notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before you get on top of her arm. It's steady for now. You check her face. She's really very pretty. Her eyes are moving along horizontally. She's reading this book on the table. She seems very focused. You hope so, at least. If she notices you in her peripherals, it could be dangerous for you. You might be mistaken for a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou precariously meander down the length of her arm. Each step is cautious, and you're sure to crouch down to lower your center of gravity. You're prepared to drop on your stomach and cling to her sleeve at a moment's notice. Every subtle twitch puts you on edge as you inch your way down. You're on the arm where the hand holds the book, while the other turns the page, so you feel relatively safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you reach the edge of the table. You hop off her arm and feel a million times more safe. You walk the rest of the length of her arm and look up at her. She hasn't noticed you yet, but you're definitely in her peripheral now. It's time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your nerves return. You are about to try to get the attention of a literal giantess. Here goes nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave your arms over your head. It only takes a few seconds of this before you see her large brown eyes shift focus from the book up to you. Her expression turns from focus to confusion. Then to curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower your arms. Mission accomplished. Now the fear is joined by a self-conscious feeling. You can see the giant brown orbs looking you over, focusing on every little detail of you. Her face moves closer, her eyes studying every inch of you. Her face is now sitting on her hands, on top of her book. She's pretty close now, so to speak. Her face is scary at this distance. But no less beautiful. Finally, she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malcolm? Is that you?\" she asks. Watching her lips move to form these words is a breathtaking sight. Every movement any part of her makes is like watching a world-sized machine move hundreds of thousands of pounds of material to create human-like movement on a massive scale. And it's both paralyzing and haunting. But you must overcome your fear of the massive girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.</span></div></div>",

You tell her all about your aspirations with making your spell and how it went awry, what happened to your wand and you, and how you got up the table to get her help. Padma nods along, listening intently. As a fellow Ravenclaw, you can tell she was particularly intrigued hearing about all the work you put in on crafting your own spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it sounds like you're very close, you just couldn't control the power. If it weren't for your current predicament, I'd call it a near success,\" she mused. You nodded in response to the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. But anyway, since you're a prefect, I thought you might be especially suited to getting me help,\" you concluded. Padma smiled at your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'll help you, Malcolm. It's my job! As both a prefect and a friend. Though...as a friend...may I ask you for a favor, first?\" Padma asked you, shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what is it?\" you asked, more than ready to do whatever favor she wanted. After all, Padma is helping you out big time here, you'll owe her for life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, I'm really intrigued by your small stature and the effects of your spell backfiring. Before we get you some help, can I run some tests on you and check everything out? Besides, any data I gather might be helpful in figuring out a way to help return you to normal!\" she said, getting excited at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, you're a little nervous about being asked to be tested on, but you trust Padma. And it's like she said, it might be really helpful, especially for growing you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Consider me your little guinea pig,\" you joked. You and Padma shared a laugh. Padma slid her chair back and stood up. From the table, this was a breath-taking sight. Her height from your perspective practically doubled. She dwarfs you just as much as before in relative size, but seeing her stand at full height from the tabletop gives you a whole new perspective. You can only imagine what she looks like when both of you are on the floor. Padma puts her books away into a bag and scoots her chair in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna pick you up and take you to my dorm now, okay?\" Padma said, placing her hand flat on the table for you to climb onto. You nod and crawl up into her hand. Her palm is warm, soft, and inviting. Once you're seated in her palm, she lifts you up to her face and smiles. You smile back. She lets out a little giggle (little to her, surprisingly loud to you) then lets her fingers wrap around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't want anyone seeing you and giving us trouble,\" she says, assuring you. While the initial movement startles you, you find yourself strangely at peace being wrapped up in Padma's hand. The soft brown pillars were protecting you from the outside world, and giving you warmth and comfort as a bonus. You could spend all day like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, Padma reaches her dorm room, in which her roommates are currently away, thankfully. She gently sets you down on her desk and prepares some supplies. When she's finished, she approaches you, ready to begin.</span></div></div>",

As soon as you broke the surface, you were just in time to see Hermione\u2019s pants drop down, revealing pink panties fit snugly on her tight ass. She has no idea you\u2019re down there at all. You try shouting up at her, hoping she\u2019ll hear you but it\u2019s no use. You go silent as you see her slide her thumbs into the sides of her panties and pull down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your predicament, you marvel at her perfect ass. She bends her knees and sits down onto the toilet seat, momentarily leaving you in total darkness. In that blind moment, you hear her grunt quietly and then hear a sound you never wanted to hear. Like a sharp release of gas from a pipe, she releases a short but highly pressured fart. It stinks terribly for a few seconds but the smell dissipates as she spreads open her legs again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight spills into the toilet bowl and you can now clearly see her vagina and puckered anus above. A little bit of hair bristles around her vulva. Soon, you see her hand come down and start massaging her pussy. She runs her middle and ring finger through the quickly moistening slit of her pussy. She rubs her clit and clenches her legs again. A faint moan escapes her lips above as her fingers slide into those below. Another moan. Her legs unclench again and she withdraws her fingers, now slick with her spunk. Vaginal fluid sticks in strands to her fingers before dribbling back down her wet cunt and onto her anus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes at it again, her legs quivering this time, locking you in sudden darkness and bright light, accompanied by the sounds of her pleasing her wet orifice.. Then she adjusts her position on the toilet and more light pours in. You see how soaking wet her pussy is now. She must be coming close to climax; her legs are quivering open, her moans are more intense, she uses her other hand to silence herself. \u201cFuck me\u201d she whispers under her breath. \u201cOh Fleur, fuck my pussy\u201d She stifles a particularly powerful impulse to squeal in pleasure as her orgasm approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone knocks on the door. Hermione straightens up and adjusts herself defensively, annoyed. \u201cJust a minute\u201d she calls, short of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, sorry\u201d another girl\u2019s voice sounds from behind the door. \u201cI just really have to go\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck\u201d Hermione mutters under her breath. She diddles herself some more, this time with a veangance. She plunges her fingers into her slick vagina, digging for her G spot and massages her clit with her thumb. The other hand pinches  her nipples under her shirt. Finally she cums. Silently. She\u2019s taken aback by the intensity and convulses for a moment on the toilet seat. A brief squirt of ejaculate splashes into the toilet, then another. And another. Her orgasm subsided and she adjusts her ass on the toilet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \u201cOkay. Aaahhhhhhh\u201d she gasps, and spreads her cheeks apart against the seat, finding a preferred position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, you think, looking up. Suddenly a hot stream of piss sprays out of her and blasts you under the water. It bubbles and foams up the whole toilet bowl. When you return to the surface, you look up and see Hermione\u2019s anus flexing. A low grumble sounds in her gut. You knew you were screwed at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Hermione, stop! For the love of-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPppppfffft pppooofffr  anther heavy fart escapes her tight ass and fills the bowl with a preview stench of what is to come. Her ass hole flexes again, widening even further. The giant girl grunts one final time and then the tip of a huge brown turd slides into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slithers out of her ass hole and dangles above you for a moment. Hermione pushes again and it slides closer. You swim out of the way as fast as you can before she  clenches her anus and pinches the turd off. It splashes into the water next to you and throws you to the other side of the bowl. The next turd shoots out quickly and curls against the bottom of the bowl, emerging out of the water below you and taking you up with it. You\u2019re sitting on a huge pile of Hermione\u2019s shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Great, you think. I thought it would be a good idea to try to get help from the smartest girl in school and now she\u2019s just taken a shit all over me. Just great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne final chunk of shit presses out of Hermione\u2019s ass. With a dainty grunt, the girl expels the last of her waste from her body. The shit plops  into the toilet, sending you and the other chunks of her poop floating around messily in the now golden water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t do much else but look up, betrayed, disgusted, and strangely turned on by all this. A giant hand comes down with some toilet paper as Hermione wipes her ass clean of shit. She takes more power to wiper her wet pussy too, then tosses it into the toilet. She stands up, surveying the bowl, not seeing you despite your best efforts to climb onto the wad of toilet paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s almost too  late. You watch as her eyes move unaware over you and she turns her head and then her body away from you. She pulls up her panties and then her pants over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a trail of toilet paper dangling out of the toilet, stuck to a wet spot on the seat. You begin desperately trying to climb out of the toilet bowl up that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe zips up her pants and fastens her belt again, about ready to leave. She\u2019s about to reach for the flusher...</span></div></div>",

Hermione semed to be lost in thought as she stood there infront of your, former ccompartment. While you stood yhere gawking at her Hermione began to tap her feet obviously becoming frustrated from her current train of thought. This tapping brought your attention immediatly down to her giant feet and realise how dangerous they co uld be to you at thi size. As the tappjng continued you began to notice a horendous odor emenating from Hermione's slippered feet, as you stood there the smell became stronger and stronger until you were coughing as the odpr started to penetrate your lungs, you knew that you could'nt take anymore and just as you were about to bend over and empty the contents of the your stomach onto the floor Hermione's slipper clad feet rose slowly before taking a step, and then another, and before long she was striding down the hall with a look of determination etched on her face. As she strode away you realised you had lost your chance to contact her but you were also grateful to be awaya from those foul smelling feet of hers.<br>\r\n     Now with Hermione gone you had to think of another way to get help, at your diminutive size there werent many options, you could either chase after Hermione in hopes of finding her and getting her help, smelly feet be damned or you could wait here in hopes that either she return or someone else stops by the open compartment either way the situation didn't seem to good to you.</span></div></div>",

You decided to instead wait where you were in hopes that another person would hopefully stop by your compartment who you could then hopefully contact and would be able to help you. You sat there for around 30 minutes, actually dozing off slightly due to the boredom of it all before in the distance you heard the distinct thuds of footfalls as someone was walking toward you. You looked to your left but all you saw was an empty corridor so you turned to your right. What you saw made your heart stop for a second because right next to you was another giant foot similar to Hermione's except with one small difference, the smell emanating from this new person's foot was oddly pleasant and smelled of lilacs, this person obviously took great care of  there feet. You stared for a few seconds before shaking your head slightly and looked up to see who this new person who stopped by your compartment was</span></div></div>",

What had you done to make her want to cause you such pain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden she let you out, parting her feet letting you fall to the seat cushion. Full of adrenaline you jump up and were about to start chewing her out... only for you mouth to drop to the floor, she had unbuttoned her shirt revealing her breasts, she had always had a good sized chest (about a C-Cup) and at the moment she had them exposed to the world (she still had her bra on though). \"What's the matter Malcy?\" she said mockingly, \"Never seen breasts before?\" You hadn't noticed her hand reaching for you and she snatched you up once more, holding you right above her cleavage she looked at you once more \"I never took you for a perv Malcy!\" she said, feigning shock.\"W-what do you mean?' You stammered. She dropped you, letting you fall snugly between her breasts as she started groping and squeezing her boobs,<br>\r\nloving the embarrassed look on your face, \"I saw your little boner earlier Malcy, you loved my feet and you love my boobs, don'tcha?\" While Lilith was a reasonably attractive young woman, you couldn't take her relentless taunting any longer. \"LET ME GO YOU BIG, STUPID CUNT!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped squeezing her breasts and stopped talking, you knew that you had made a big mistake by insulting her. You looked up, thinking that she would be angry or sad, but instead she was grinning from ear to ear, as if Christmas had come early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A big cunt eh? I'll show you a big cunt!\" She grabbed you from her cleavage with one hand, and unbuttoned her pants with the other, you look at her about to start begging but before you could open your mouth she licked you, dragging your face down her tongue, coating you in her saliva. You tried to wipe the stuff from your face only to have more applied to it. Then after she had slid her pants off, she picked up her wand and cast a silencing charm on the compartment, to make sure no one heard her. Dropping her wand, she ripped off your clothes, robes and all, leaving you exposed to the world. \"Whatddya know,\" she said,\"I always knew you weren't that big down there.\" Once again you were furious at how she spoke to you but before you could protest she dropped you in between her legs, face to face with her huge cameltoe, the musk and humid air radiating from it created a sort of very thick mist around it. you tried to turn and run but her fingers pushed you into the crevice that was Lilith's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were being smothered by her pussy, it's slimy juices covering you, making you wish for the foot sweat from her socks, you would rather chug that sweat from a milk carton than ever go near that slime again. She started grinding your face into her lips faster and faster moaning as she goes, she stops though, and starts panting, \"Ha...ha... you want to know something Taylor?\" she looks at you with a jubilant look in her eye, like she was about to tell you her biggest secret. <br>\r\n\"I've always ____ you\"    </span></div></div>",

While you didn't hate anyone for being dumber than you, you don't talk or interact with them unless you absolutely had to, but was that bad enough for you to be punished for it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I heard that you were experimenting with some spell, I knew that it would be the best opportunity to teach you a lesson, so I hexed your wand to explode when you first tried the spell.\" This surprised you immensely. You knew she was smart, but smart enough to make someones wand explode? That was impressively terrifying. \"Scum like you are no better than Voldemort or his Death Eaters.\" You flinched horribly at the name of the most evil wizard in history, Lilith was one of the few students that wasn't afraid of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or his followers. Her rubbing was getting faster and faster, coating you in her juices before taking her panties off and forcing your face into her clit. \"Ohhh.... Malcolm you don't know just how great this feels.\" She said, moaning in pleasure. she then forced you to deepthroat her clit, shoving it in your mouth and moving your head back and forth. It tasted disgusting, like she hadn't washed it in weeks and you were pretty sure that your jaw had been dislocated, looks like your invincibility doesn't stop dislocations. It was like a penis was facefucking you, going in and out, faster and faster, you tried to scream but your voice only vibrated her clit causing her more pleasure.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then shoved your lower body into her vagina, fingering her self whilst raping your mouth with her clitoris. The inside of her vagina was like an oven, making your legs feel like they were melting. Every now and then she would flick the back of your head with her juice soaked fingers, giving you an incredibly bad headache and making you dizzy. The smell of her pussy was worse than ever and you were pretty sure that she used magic to create a fog of musk around it just to torture you. Combining the gross smell with the oral rape and you couldn't stop gagging. The squelching noise her vagina made as it happily \"chewed\" on your legs like you were some sort of human sex toy gave you chills up your spine as you thought about what would happen if your whole body was in there, melting under the heat of her body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe finally came all over the compartment seat, her vaginal muscles squeezing your legs until they felt like they were about to break. She then dropped you while she tried to find her breath. \"Well Taylor, if you weren't such a piece of shit I might've considered you a good partner.\"  You were lying in a pool of her cum, to tired to move. \"Welp, it looks like we've reached our destination Taylor, I better put you somewhere \"safe\" until we get home huh?\" The Hogwarts Express had reached Kings Cross and students were already spilling out of the train. She put you at the back of her panties and pulled them up, sticking you firmly between her cheeks. \"Now that's better, an ass like you deserves to be in one, right?\" She said while pushing you further up her crack with her finger, placing you right in front of her anus.......</span></div></div>",

You felt a shiver of fear as you worried about being unknowingly under the beautiful witch you'd been crushing on, hoping she noticed you if you came up or at least took off her boots as you were sure you could survive being stepped on bare footed (or at the very least more likely to survive underfoot than under her boots).<br>\r\nAfter hearing the thundering of her bouncing up the stairs, once again calling out for you until she reached your half open bedroom door. At the threshold to your room she kicks off her boots, the left one nearly crushing you as it flies past while the right stops right in front of you. The smell is intense as Dora was most often barefoot but not unpleasant. Tonks then stepped in, eyes roaming your room wondering where you were before sighing and sitting down on your bed. You noticed from the floor that her toenails were the same shade of purple as her hair, her toes twitching from her hyperactive personality.<br>\r\nSeeing this as possibly your only chance you run up to her foot and began pounding on it, trying to get the metamorph's attention. It did luckily as you were quickly plucked from the floor and brought up to her eye line, which widened almost comically after getting a proper look at you 'Malcolm! What happened to you?' you quickly stammer out a response while Tonks sat with a widening grin on her face 'So you shrunk yourself, and now you want little old me to help. I don't know' Tonks hmmed as she tapped the fingers of her other hand against her extra pouty lips 'Ah fuck it, you look so cute I just can't resist' she smiled and brought you to her lips, their combined mass enveloping your entire body.<br>\r\nAs you left their embrace you knew you had a really stupid grin on your face but how could you not, you've just been kissed by the lovely Nymphadora Tonks and she was a giantess to boot. Your brain kicked back into gear when you heard her giggling 'Bet you wanted that for a long time eh Mal?' she smiles at your shock expression 'Oh don't look so surprised, you haven't exactly been discrete in your staring, my nipples practically harden under your gaze' you blush and look away, you can't help it you've always been short, not as small as Harry who gets tits to the face from younger years like Weaseltte and Vale but still short, add to that the age (and size) gap between yourself and Tonks and you realise you've always had to look at then past the meta's (usually DD or larger) breasts to see her face, it had just become your default (especially as up a couple of months ago they actually were at eye level). 'Don't worry Malcolm I like it, and now you're little you can be <b>MY</b> little man' Dora says kissing you again, her lips parting, coating you in her saliva. When she finally lets you come up for air she turns her hand so you can sit in her palm 'So am I..' 'I wouldn't kiss just anyone Mal, not even you. So yes you are' you smile happily 'And you'll help me fix this?' 'Yep, just need to go get some extra help' 'G-o?' you stutter worried about what could happen to you if you left the house<br>\r\n'Don't worry, I'll keep my little boytoy safe while I figure out what to do with him' Dora says cheerfully before she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While there you had a strange feeling that you where being watched,  turning around  you saw her. You decided to be polite and introduce yourself.  So you walked over.<br>\r\n\"HI im Malcolm Taylor, but you can call me Malcolm .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed and fidgeted <br>\r\n\"Ello Monsieur Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and said <br>\r\nPlease you can call me Malcolm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed harder  and ran out the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on  you would see her staring at  you whenever she was near.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Your name is Malcolm Taylor. You're not a very well known student at Hogwarts, and the main reason you're so behind-the-scenes is because you're just not the greatest at making friends. You're in Ravenclaw and you <i>love</i> magic. You're trying to invent your own spell, because you noticed that the shrinking charm Reducio can only be used to return an enlarged object (from Engorgio) back to its original size and Diminuendo cannot be used on living things, so you wanted to bridge that gap with a spell of your own, that could shrink anything. But you run into a bit of Neville-style bad luck and all this tempering with untamed magic causes your wand to explode, and it shrinks you and all the objects around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Rules: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease, make an honest-to-God attempt at typing correctly. Typos happen, I know that, but some people type like they've never been to Elementary school. If I see typos I can try to fix it for you, but if you type so horribly that I can't comprehend what it is you were trying to say then I will either revise the chapter myself or, if I'm particularly lazy, delete it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't be offensive. It's not hard to be not offensive. Malcolm isn't racist, sexist, etc. So don't try to make him that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nType in Second Person. (You do this, you do that. You're Malcolm Taylor, you suck at making spells. Etc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to always give choices. I hate chapters where at the end it just says \"Continue\" as the only option. That takes the fun out of an interactive.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now, feet is preferred, but you don't HAVE to write feet chapters. Butt, breasts, armpits, I don't care. I'm just telling you I personally like feet and would love to see some feet chapters in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should be about it.
