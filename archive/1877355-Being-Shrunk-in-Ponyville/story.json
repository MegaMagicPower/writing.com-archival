You look behind you and you look in horror as you see a long wall of giant blades of grass.<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!!\" you say in shock. \"I'M SHRUNK!\"<br>\r\nThen you look at the grass then you, as you estimate you are no bigger then a half an inch. How did this happen? You can't remember a thing. You try to look even higher then the grass to see what is over it. And to your amazement, you see that you are not on earth anymore. You are in ponyville, half an inch tall, in ponyville. You begin to cry a little being you've always wanted to go there someday. But you don't think like this.

The illustrious owner of the Ponyville Library herself. She walks, or rather, to you, stomps inside the library humming to herself. Her voice was loud and echoed, but still retained it's feminine pitch like it usually did. Upon closer hearing you can assume that she's humming the Winter Wrap-Up song happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that you need to grab her attention. After all, she's the only one here, and you're not exactly sure as to how you wound up in Equestria in the first place, let alone on a desk in Twilight Sparkle's library. You run up to the edge of the desk and begin to wave your arms up as Twilight approaches the desk, still humming. It seems that as you flail your limbs about and shout up at her, she can't exactly hear you, so you decide to try to grab her attention another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you find a small needle, possibly one for sewing, that Rarity may have left behind in a previous visit of this place as it was white and quite polished. You pick the needle up in one hand (it really isn't that heavy, even at this size, and it was about the size of a longsword for you) and quickly stab Twilight's fur in one area. The tactic seemed to have worked as Twilight squeaks with minor pain from the small prick she just felt and she immediately looks down in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes don't seem to change as she looks down on your tiny form. She just tilts her head and smiled sweetly down at you. However, your nerves were getting the better of yourself. After all, having a being that is no less that 800 feet tall by your standards stare down at you isn't good for one's nerves. You began to shake a bit and breathe faster, an obvious reaction of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled and got a little closer and moved her head down to the desk, and spoke in a softer voice...</span></div></div>",

I'll be back in a bit!\" with that, she disappeared from your view, presumably into her kitchen to make the tea. You decide to sit down and just wait. Hopefully she wouldn't be too long, as the silence that permeated the air of the library around you made you feel a little ill at ease. You cast your wandering eyes all around yourself, and gaze in awe at the surroundings. Sure, the Library was a pretty aethetically pleasing place, being all organized properly, but at your size, it made it seem as though it had all the knowledge about everything in the entire universe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a few times as you hear the stomping hoofsteps again. Twilight must be coming back with the tea it seemed, and go figure, you were correct. Twilight Sparkle quickly rounded the corner, using her magic to levitate two small cups of fresh steaming tea. She appeared to still be smiling sweetly and humming to herself as she approached the desk. Upon her arrival, she quickly sets them both down and smiles at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, lemme shrink your cup a bit for you. I don't want you to burn yourself in the tea,\" She looked down at your teacup and quickly casts a small magic spell on it, causing it to shrink until it was about the average size of one of Earth's teacups. You quickly pick it up and drink it, enjoying it's very sweet taste, but you couldn't help but feel that you've tasted this kind of tea before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the feeling off you and Twilight both finish your tea together, and you let out a small sigh of relaxation. Wow, that tea really hit the spot. It relaxed you so much. Twilight returned your teacup to it's original size and giggled at your lethargy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you humans are just too cute when you're tired!\" she reached her head down and nuzzled your form before turning around and leaving you alone while she goes and cleans the teacups out in her kitchen. It was then that the realization hit you, and you sit upright in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just referred to you as a human! The thought that Twilight even knew what humans were in the first place was astonishing, but the fact that she doesn't seem at all phased by your appearance in her LIbrary was just mind-blowing. Suddenly, there's a knock on the front door of Twilight's library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it!\" Twilight's voice boomed out as she called to the door. She quickly rushed out and opened the door with her magic, revealing...</span></div></div>",

You decide it's for the best if you remain hidden for Dash's visit, and instinctively hide under the saucer with Twilight's tea cup. Fortunately, so does Twilight. You can hear her conversation with Dash from where you are sitting, and so far she hasn't even mentioned you - maybe she has plans later? Maybe she wants her own little Human companion? Or maybe she just thinks introducing you to her friends in your state of up and down emotions isn't a good idea. Whatever the reason, you were thankful...for the time being. You could still hear them talking from the other side of the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Rainbow, I told you!

She must be really anticipate that book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can try reading something else?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Maybe I could borrow out a few I borrowed previously?\" Rainbow asked. \"No offence Twilight, but I'd rather stick with one book series for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Twilight groan - clearly getting Rainbow to have a diverse range of books she liked was harder than it sounded. Then things started going badly - for you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight left the room, going to find Dash her books no doubt. This left you and Dash alone in the room together.

Your desk, and more importantly, your hiding space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes practically bugged out, and your shaking at this point caused the saucer to shake slightly as well as Rainbow Dash approached, making small clattering noises against the hardwood surface.

I didn't know humans had the capacity for such intelligence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Thank you, Twilight.\" You looked up near a clock in Twilight's room, checking the time. Twilight saw this and turned to the clock as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about... 3 in the afternoon. And since we're just about done here... how's about we...\"</span></div></div>",

Still, it's not like she would go out of her way to hurt you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow nods, giggling. \"Yep! We don't know how long Twilight will be gone, and she asked me to watch ya 'till then.\" Suddenly, she roughly flops onto her stomach, resting her head on crossed forelegs. The impact is enough to stagger you, and you barely manage to avoid falling on your rear. You throw an annoyed glare up at Rainbow, and she responds with a chuckle. \"Now, I'm not one to sit around and twiddle my hooves, but I know I can't leave you here--too dangerous--and taking you into town with me just makes more problems.\" Smirking, she swiftly rises to her hooves and stands on her bed, towering over you once more. \"Sooo, that leaves us with one option: kill time 'till Twilight gets back!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gently--but without warning--Rainbow scoops you up in a hoof and brings you up to her face. \"And I've got a prefect idea for the first game: a little something I call 'Keep-Away!'\" She lowers you to the floor--oddly firm for something made of clouds--and hops off her bed, landing in front of you... A little <i>too</i> closely for your liking: there's almost no danger of getting crushed, but Rainbow's size and impact are enough to cause an instinctual fear to surface. You yelp and flinch back, never taking your eyes off the huge pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, don't be afraid.

When you calm down, she snaps back to her playful mood. \"Now, the rules of Keep-Away are simple: you just have to avoid me, in any way you can: run, hide, dodge, anything.\" She was leaning down at you, putting her massive muzzle not that far from your face. It gets in your personal space a bit, but it's not as intimidating as just towering over you and looking down. <br>\r\nThen Rainbow adopts a new posture: crouching low, forelegs locked at angle as if ready to pounce. She's at roughly eye-level with you now, which gives you a <b>great</b> view of her smirk.<br>\r\nSuddenly, you wish you'd stayed with Twilight.<br>\r\n\"As for me,\" Rainbow concludes, swishing her tail through the air behind her, \"<i>I</i> have to try to catch ya! Since we're inside, I can't do much fancy flying, though. So I'm hoofing it!\" She crouches even lower, her smirk widening. \"Just keep away from me as long as you can...

Zero... Ready or not here I come!\" Her voice echoes through the house. You look to your right and notice a line of cabinets, and one of them was slightly open. You decide to go for it as you feel the ground shake a little as Rainbow Dash starts running down the hallway. You hear a door open and take a quick glance over your shoulder. \"Whew... \" you let out a sigh of relief as you realize she must have went into that first room you decided against. Shaking you head to regain you concentration you turn to the cabinet and squeeze through, closing the door behind you, and waiting in the dark, listening. After about a minute you hear her come out of the room and the vibrations going through the floor pick up as she continues down the hallway, towards your location. There is a loud creak as the door to the kitchen is opens, your heart starts to beat a little fast and you start heading toward the back of the cabinet, our the side, you lost all sense of direction, but mainly you were walking away from the noise of her walking. You run into what feel like cardboard boxes, you feel your way around and behind them trying your best to get as far away from that cabinet door as possible. After making some progress you hear a cabinet door open and take a quick look behind you, still pitch black. You come across another box that seems to be opened, you slowly put you hand in into it, not sure what you expect to feel. Pretty soon you are touching the bottom of the box, the box is empty! With that thought you jump in and pull the flaps together, not completely closed, but cracked enough so you can see what is going on. After a couple more seconds you hear the cabinet door close and then your world is flooded with light as Rainbow Dash opens the cabinet you are hiding in. She starts to pull boxes of what appear to be different pantry items, like cookies, cereal, some oatmeal look a like. Eventually there are only a couple of boxes left and she has to put her head in the cabinet so she has enough arm length to pick up the remaining boxes, unfortunately the first box she reaches for is yours and you can feel you heart beating faster and faster until you are sure you hear it drumming in you ears. You feel the box slide forward as she pulls it toward her until she gets her hoof under it to bring it up to her face for inspection, about half way up you jump out of the box and make a diving leap out of the cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Gotcha!\" Rainbow shouts as she backs her head out of the cabinet so she can grab you. You meanwhile are sprinting as fast as your little legs can carry you, adrenaline coursing through your veins as you fear what would happen if Rainbow Dash accidentally crushes you. You feel the ground beneath you start to shake as she gets closer, and soon you can even hear her breathing. You get running full speed ahead, right for the patio. Then the unexpected happens, you trip, you start falling forward and you look behind you as you fall, Rainbow Dash only a couple of paces behind you. You hit the floor and turn around to see Rainbow Dash slam on the brakes, all four hooves on the ground, she even opens her wings to aid in slowing herself down. You let out a small yelp as she finally stops, her front to hooves within a human arm length from your body. You body starts shaking as you realize how close you just came to becoming a smear. Rainbow Dash, oblivious to your shaking reaches down and picks you up saying \"You did better than I thought you would, but what was that? Can't even keep your balance?\" She then brings you back up to your face and begins to nuzzle you again, calming you down, and you start to pet you soft cyan colored fur.

You try to catch your breath and relax, but dizziness and lingering fear prevent that. <i>Woah... that was *intense,*</i> goes through your head as Rainbow continues nuzzling you. You idly wonder if she knows how close she came to splattering you over the floor just now. At least you're safe now, though. <i>Relatively speaking, that is.

Not one for stamina, are you?\" She announces, smirking a little (though there's a spark of concern in her eyes). You throw an annoyed glare up at her...but, your sudden yawn ruins any chance of it being intimidating. Rainbow just chuckles again and gently puts you on top of her head and trots over to a sofa, where none other than her pet tortoise Tank is longing, using a newspaper as an impromptu blanket. As Rainbow hops onto the sofa with a quick, fluid motion, you realize that Tank isn't sleeping with the paper, he's <i>reading</i> it! The sight of the little amphibian engrossed in the paper is enough to cut through your lethargy and get a laugh out of you...which just prompts yet another yawn. Rainbow giggles at you, then addresses Tank. \"Mind if I borrow that paper? Twilight's human is tired, and we're taking a break... I'll give it back later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tank shrugs--an impressive feat for a creature lacking shoulders--and slowly rolls the newspaper off of his shell, revealing his flight suit--a small rotar-blade on top of his shell, connected to a harness wrapped around his body. With a stacatto buzz, he starts the engine (pulling a small lever on the harness with his mouth) and lifts into the air. The tortoise spares you a glance before lazily hovering away, and you can't help but smile at the spectacle. <i>I wonder if Twilight could build *me* something like that,</i> you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You must have said that out loud, because Rainbow chortles, \"Ha!

Rainbow gives you a quick smile, but you both adopt tense expressions as you read the article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Sightings of Humans More Common? Probable Causes/What To Do</b></div><br>\r\n<i>Our fair Equestria seems to have become a magnet for strange, new creatures.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange and new?\" That was odd. Twilight knew what you were, and that you were from a different world, so the ponies had encountered humans before, or at least knew of them. But whoever wrote this was acting like humans' presence here just started recently. Shaking the thoughts aside, you continue reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>First, it was the dark swarm of Changelings that revealed themselves. The despicable insects came out of nowhere and nearly seized Canterlot just a few months ago--indeed, some of the damage still awaits repairs. The shape-shifters were defeated, (thanks to the good Captain Armour and his bride) but now something new appears yet again: in the past few weeks, sightings of Humans have been increasing almost exponentially. Indeed, what was once a fanciful tale for the taverns has been told across Equestria, from Stalliongrad to Las Pegasus. There have been reports and sightings of the small bipeds almost all over our great nation... and yet to this reporter's knowledge, none have been captured and most trails have gone cold. Even more worrisome, almost nothing seems to be known about these small, mysterious creatures, especially why they are coming in such great numbers to our world. Word on the street ranges from random dimensional shifts, to something as drastic as an invasion. I will not theorize on the cause, because although most layponies are in the dark, there are undoubtedly those who may be more knowledgeable on humans than I. Perhaps musical prodigy Lyra Heartstrings of Ponyville is correct when she says that Humans are no threat to us.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut consider this, readers: Recall the Changelings. Yes, they were soundly defeated; their hive waved the white flag rather than fight us. But even now we are still making new and shocking discoveries about this previously-unknown race. We also know little of humans, it seems. So, will *they* also prove dangerous? That, like them, is unknown.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It gets worse from there: the sensationalist tone never letting up, the writer (you don't want to think of anypony who writes this kind of fear-mongering garbage as a reporter), giving \"tips\" on how to catch and trap humans--even a net is recommended, which makes you feel sick--and through the whole rag, there are those odd comparisons to the Changelings. By the time you're done reading, Rainbow has already thrown the paper against the wall in disgust; she even wipes her hooves on the couch like she'd held something filthy. \"Ugh! I should have recognized that writing,\" Rainbow snarls. She sounds oddly... angry, like that tabloid personally offended her. \"I don't know how Saber Rattler ever got a job with <i>Equestrian Voice</i>, they're a classy newspaper!

Especially since the Wedding! Almost every day, she would be wailing about how 'our security is paper-thin!' or 'is the Royal Guard really up to the task?'. Hardly any truth to it, just blowing up the story for shock! And you know what's worse? After we finally found the Changelings' hive and they surrendered, she just changed her tune like nothing happened! Now, she's been going off about how Celestia should just throw the whole hive into the sun, and all the Changelings with it--even the kids!\" Now Rainbow's temper flares even more, and she angrily kicks a pillow off the couch. You can't blame her; you feel disgusted yourself. Sleazy tabloid types are nothing new, but to just change their story like that when they were proved wrong? That was just cowardly. And then there was the bit about destroying the Changeling hive--it was transparent fear-mongering, nothing more. Sabre Rattler definitely lived up to her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, I'm no fan of the hack,\" you announce, making Rainbow chuckle. \"But still, she did name-drop Lyra--\" <i>And apparently she IS a human fan!</i> \"--so maybe we have a lead there. Turns out her tabloid <i>is</i> useful.\" You can't help but smile as Rainbow's good mood returns, and she takes you off her head for a quick nuzzle. As she puts you on her shoulder, you think of something. \"Hey, what's with all the Changeling name-dropping? The article was about..well, me, kinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow laughs. \"Ha! Well, Ms. Rattler had a little run-in with the Changelings back at the wedding. To get away from 'em, she hid in a tank of ink, and ended up getting stuck, for hours... the hack had black stains all over her for a week! Left a trail when she walked, too!\" You both burst into laughter at the image of a blackened, ink-stained hack tabloidist. Suddenly there's a knock at the door, and Rainbow slips you back onto her head as she trots over, and opens the door to reveal...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The same question was in both your minds. *How'd she know about Humans?* \"Oh I-I bet your confused as to why I know about humans.

So you have to press your way through giant blades of grass to get to this tree. Huh, you're about as small as those kids from that one movie, what was it, eh..... OH YEAH, \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\". Great movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour long trip, you are starting to get tired, and you haven't even traveled 6 feet. \"Oh my GOD, how long is this gonna take?\" Just then, you aren't looking when you hit something. \"OUCH!\" You look and see a huge red wall. It loomed over you like a hospital. With further investigation, you see it's..... an apple!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! This can really help you now. \"If this is an apple, then....\" You look up to the top of the tree and see more apples in the tree. \".... this is an apple tree. And where's the only place in ponyville where they grow apple trees?\" (Shouldn't be too hard to guess) \"SWEET APPLE ACRES! Home of the apple family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, applejack could help you. She is nice enough to help you. You are so full of hope and are giddy with glee. You could finally meet Applejack, THE Applejack! Not only the most dependable and most honest of ponies, but also your personal favorite. She has always had your eye since she first spoke in that western accent in the very first episode. (And between us, you really have a crush on her too. I know, weird, but who cares?) You always wished to be her friend, and it might come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by your stomach growling, and you realize you need to eat and gain strength before you try to get any of the giant ponies attention. \"I guess..... HEY! Here's an apple, I'll just eat some of this.\" It's extremely hard to bite through the giant red wall of the apple, but you manage to bite through, and get your nom on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour, you stop eating. \"Now, to get some help. But from who?\" With that thought, you feel slight tremors in the ground. \"hmmm, that's odd. Wait, that's stupid, of course it isn't, cause you are so tiny. Anyone walking, or in this case, trotting in the distance will feel like this.\" After that thought, the tremors get more violent, and soon, you can't even keep your balance. You try to see, but the grass blocks your view. Then, who should ever loom over the grass, like a moving mountain, was.........</span></div></div>",

Luckily you moved enough so her hoof didn't hit you. The ground boomed and shook. \"Little pest, stay still.\" she boomed as she raised it again. You jump out of the way again as her hoof lands next to you again. You had a steeper fall this time. You look around you and you see you landed in a crater, to you. In reality, it was Applejacks hoof print you were standing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE! STOP!\" you beg on the verge of tears. She looked at you in disgust and aggravation. A look you never wanted to see given to you. Its a face everyone home gave you, and it always made you sad when no one would comfort you.

BOOM!</b> \"YER ALL OUTTA PLACES TA RUN.\" she boomed as she stomped closer to you. <b>BOOM! BOOM!</b> She finally stopped in front of you, only a few tiny feet away.

You curled up and cried as you looked up one last time at your favorite pony. \"I love you Applejack.\" you say as your last words. Her expression didn't change at all.

Ah shouldn't be doing this, this isn't like me at all.\" You heard this and look up at the titaness. She was looking at you with more of concern now.

She leans closer to you to get a better look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets enough of an image of you. She could see that you had been trembling at her threatening sight. \"Awww, yer trembling. And it's all because of me. Ah'm so sorry little guy.\" She then reaches very slowly for you. You see this and are still very skiddish about her getting close to you. You whimper and cower back a little, but she still can't hear you. \"It's okay, don't be scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then picked you up with one hoof, and brought you gently to her face. Her breathe from her nose was blowing through you. A tear then falls from your cheek and fell on her hoof. She saw that and her eyes changed drastically. They went from confused, to deeply concerned. \"Ooooh.\" she said before doing something you've always wanted to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered you down to her chest and very gently pushed you against it. You could feel how furry her body actually is, compared to what it looks like in the show. She was giving you a hug, and you enjoyed this. It was so warm and soft and so loving, that you bursted into tears again. You have never been held like this before (obviously) and never wanted this to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she raised you up, past her face, and up to her ear. \"Ah'm sorry if it ain't clear in there, but ah think I can hear you better in there if ya'll can speak.\" Her hoof got close enough to her ear to where you could just hop in. Once you did, her ear was actually quite clear of the wax. \"Can you hear me now?\" you say with a choked up voice. \"OH YES, NOW AH CAN. LIKE AH SAID BEFORE, AH'M SO SO SORRY FER SCARING YA LIKE THAT....... AND MAKIN YA CRY.\" She sounded very sorry, and you forgave her. I mean, how could you not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her about what happened while she trotted back inside and listened to every word. \"Oh, ah'm really sorry for all  of that.

Then the ground started lightly quaking again. \"Wh-Whats happening?\" you asked as the wind grew more fierce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened closer and noticed something weird about the wind. It didn't feel like it was blowing, but more like sucking in. another thing that seemed odd. Being so small, you couldn't tell at first, but the wind, had a large panting sound too. the grass around you fell and sounded like trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to your horror, you saw it.......... or her........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a pair of eyes and ears looming over just searching for something. But closer to you, and more dangerous, was the maw with a giant vacuum nose. It was Applejacks faithful pooch, Winona. She was sniffing the ground, and heading your way. You start to move, when the grass in front of you were pushed away by the gargantuan nose. The quakes and wind were so strong, you needed to run, NOW!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start running for your life, and Winona's doggie winds of hell sucking you back make it very difficult to run. She was very easily catching up to you. \"PL-PLEASE, D-DOWN GIRL!\" You knew dogs have great ears, but you weren't sure if she'd listen to a tiny bug like you. Even though it's AJ's dog, she was a dog, and you are only a little bigger than a flea to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you trip on a tiny rock and fall on your face. You roll over on your back to see nothing but black. She was right above you and just looking at you. \"Pl-Please, don't hurt me\" you say fearfully and tearfully. Then she began to smell you, and the force of her nose nearly pulls you into the black abyss. You close your eyes and whimper and wait for Winona to finish you. She analyzed you very closely, and she continued sniffing. \"Tell Applejack, I wanted to be her friend, and I love her\" you say as your last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the sniffing stopped, and she brought her head up. She looked down to you panting and tongue hanging out. She then took two steps toward you, and the earth shook around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WOOF! WOOF!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears were ringing badly. But she didn't care, she was all happy and wagging her tail.

You are shaken up, literally. Then she plants her hoof next to you. The ground quakes violently, and you look up into Pinkizilla's big blue eyes.

You stand straight up and flail your arms around to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOO~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's voice echos and down to you. \"Who left this juicy looking apple here?

If you climb the apple, then she could see you better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up the apple, even though pretty steep, and make it to the top. \"Wow, who knew trying to talk to Pinkie would be so hard. I mean, it is anyway, but not THIS hard.\" Just then, the apple starts moving. As you try to keep your balance, you realize why it's moving. Pinkie was picking it, with you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess i'll eat this now. Wouldn't want it getting nasty for AJ now. hehe\", boomed Pinkie. Then she began bringing the apple to her massive maw. The sight was scary. when her mouth opened, her breath felt like an oven. Even worse, her mouth was coming to you. You can only let out one more scream for help. \"PINKIIIIEEE!!!!!!

Apparently this isn't quite your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though it seems you do have <i>some</i> fortune: your jump has enough forward momentum to put Pinkie's mane in easy reach!

You grab on as tight as you can as soon as you feel Pinkie's poofy mane touch your fingers. The fall must have been faster than it felt, because your arms shriek in protest at the sudden loss of motion, and it takes all your willpower to not let go on reflex due to the pain. Shaking off the last of your adrenaline, you look back at the pink tataness, to find her still happily munching on the apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Okay, no danger of getting eaten now... what do I do now?</i> Even from here, the fall is still too long to get on the ground, so that's out of the question. You can't just keep hanging onto Pinkie's mane,either; so staying put is also out. You decide your only option is to climb up to Pinkie's head. From there, you can try to get her attention again, or just ride, rest, and hope to get off somewhere safer. Hopefully somewhere where you won't get eaten by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that motivation, you start your ascent up Pinkie's curls to her pink cranium. Not far into the climb, you hear a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>*munch-munch-munch, GULP!*</i> \"Ahh, so good! Maybe I should use more apples in my next batch of treats!\" Pinkie starts trotting again, happily mumbling about various apple-related baked goods. The recipes might have sounded delicious if you weren't currently holding onto her mane for dear life. <i>This is going to be a long day...</i> You give a martyred sigh, then resume climbing, trying to compensate for the added motion of Pinkie trotting along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue your slow ascent, you can't help but wonder: <i>So, what happens if she notices me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She put you in the picnic basket and closes it, it was fairly empty so you just sat down \"just yell if you need me too slow down\" she says \"ok\" you say, not sure if she heard you. she takes off running, the ride was a little bumpy but you weren't hurt too bad. You arrive at sugarcube corner and pinkie take's you out of the basket with her mouth. she sets you on a counter, \"wait here\" she says \" I have something that may make you feel a little better\" she runs into another room.

You cover your ear and say \"ya, why wouldnt i be?\" you reply, pretending not to know whats going on. \"well Twilight which is one of my friends you havent met yet just said that everything tiny has disapeared and your tiny so i thought mabye something happened to you too\" she says really fast. \"Oh well i guess im the only thing that hasnt\" you say. \"well thats good, wait right here\" she says and then goes back too the door. \"Hey twilight can you come in i have something too show you\" Pinkie says. \"Well i guess i can but its not just me who came\" Twilight says \"oh, well i have room for everyone\" Pinkie says smiling and gestures for everyone too come in. Twilight, Spike, Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy,and Rainbowdash come into Sugarcube Corner, \"What did you want too show us?\" Twilight asks, well it over here, Pinkie pie walks over too you. All of the 5 other ponies look at you \"Is that a human? I didnt know they were so tiny, I always hear Lyra talking about them but i didnt think they existed\". You pretend you dont know who she is, you cover your ears because she did not whisper at all and say \"well usually im not this tiny, well atleast i dont think i am, i dont remember anything\" you yell. \"well how did you get here?\" Rainbow says a little quieter still hurting your ears \"Well how did you get here with Pinkie?\" you look down and say \" well she almost squished me until she dropped her picnic basket, she saw me, and offered to take me back here\". \"Well this is no time for telling stories, we have a crisis on our hooves!\" Twilight says. You look at her appoligeticly and stop talking. \"Okay girls we need to figure out who has caused everything in ponyville to disapear\" Twilight said, \"Well what if its not just in ponyville where everything tiny has banished?\" Pinkie says. \"Spike take a letter, Dear Princes Celestia, Everything tiny in ponyville has dissapeared, how are things in Canterlot?\" Twilight said, Spike wrote everything down and sent the letter. 5 minutes passed and you got one back it read \"Dear Twilight, Everything tiny has disapeared here too, I need you too come down to canterlot right away to sort thing's out\". \"Well girls it looks like we are going to canterlot, Celestia should send us-\" before Twilight could finish her sentence Spike burped up 6 train tickets. \"Wait!\" Pinkie says \"what about him?\" Pinkie pie points at you. \"He's going to have to stay here\" twilight says you give her a sad look. \" I understand\" you say. \"Can he pleeeeease come?\" Pinkie pleaded, \"He doesnt have a ticket\" Twilight argues back \"oh who will notice? hes so tiny nobody will care\" Pinkie says. Twilight had a blank look on her face, she sighed and said \"Fine, but we have to leave now\". Pinkie pie jumps in cheer and you just smile. <br>\r\nYou, and the other ponies bored the train with you hiding in Pinkies mane, you hear her say \"you can come out now\" you crawl out of her mane and onto a table that was in the train car. \"So you dont have any memory do ya?\" Applejack asked. \"No i dont\" you say \"well im glad we have something tiny\" Applejack says smiling, Twilight just rolled her eyes. \"Well i guess its time for bed\" Twilight says \"where is he going to sleep?\". \"well i can just sleep on the ground i guess.\" you say. Fluttershy interupts \"well hes an animal and i am special with animals, he could sleep in my mane if he wants too\" \"Yes!\" you say trying not to sound too eager. Fluttershy smiles. Everypony lays down in there bed and you in Fluttershies mane. You wake up to fluttershy walking off the train, forgetting you were in her mane. you just decide to lay back down, pretty soon you hear Twilight and Celestia talking. \"well we have no clue what happend but there is nothing tiny anymore, we need to find out what happend and who did it, and i think i know who...\"</span></div></div>",

It was so beautiful and peaceful, or at least it would be peaceful if the sounds of propeller blades wasn't ringing in your ears. \"Whoa! Hit the deck!\" you say as you duck and cover. The sound passes over you. You see they are bees just gathering nectar. \"Hehe never seen a bee this close before. Well, I've never been this small before either.\" All of these ants and ladybugs and crickets started crawling out. It felt like you were on the set of \"A Bug's Life\". That or \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\", considering how small you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA colorful shadow fell over you. You look up and see the source. It's a ginormous butterfly gliding over top of you. It was the most beautiful sight you've ever seen. After it passed over, in the distance, there was a cozy little cottage on a hill. You could see a cat in the window and just by looking at the structure, you knew exactly what it was, and who it belonged to. \"That's Fluttershy's cottage right?\" you ask a ladybug, and being a cartoon, it nods. Yes, Fluttershy can help you. She is the kindest and most gentle pony in Ponyville. It would feel so nice to meet her, even if she was currently a giant to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, all the bugs started getting scared. \"Hey, what's wrong guys?\" They all ran away into the grassy forests. \"Oh dear, something big is coming.\" Then you hear a crash and the ground quakes. You turn in horror and see a bird towering over you. It was looking at you with hungry eyes. It chirped a bit, then made a horrible hiss. \"QUEEQUEE! QUEEQUEE!\" you say remembering Bug's Life again. After that, you turned and bolted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon-sized bird had no trouble catching up to you. It crashed down in front of you and blocked every path you tried to take. You really are scared now. And this bird was so fast, one peck could split you in half in one quick sweep. You look around and think quick. Luckily, you find a little hole in the ground. Maybe it's a worm hole. Either way, no second thought, you dove into the hole and took refuge. In good time too, for the bird pecked the ground. It felt like a bottle rocket was set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king sized canary was persistent. It tried to get you in the hole, by trying to peck its way in. It was like a nightmare for you, after it was so peaceful and beautiful. The bird clawed and pecked after you. It hissed and screamed like a demon. You were curled up tearfully shivering. It almost got you, but then something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an earthquake that was growing larger. The bird then flew away in its own fear. This was good and bad. Good because the bird is gone, bad because now something WAY bigger was coming. It was getting too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM! BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done for.\" you say as a shadow covered the outside. Then something huge finally touched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOOOOOM!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out and see......</span></div></div>",

You look outside to investigate the source of all this, and you look up in complete awe. It was the very pony who you wanted to see. The very gentle, very kind, very beautiful, Fluttershy. Yes, you always thought that she was very beautiful, naturally. Fluttershy was definitely one of the best ponies that anyone would ever want to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there and gawk at the fact that Fluttershy was standing in front of you, that you forget that she was towering above you, probably about two hundred feet at least. She was smiling, and looking everywhere, except down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FLUTTERSHY! HEY! I NEED YOUR HELP! HEY!!\" you scream. She didn't even look to see what was making the noise, she couldn't hear you. She then began to raise her hoof to take another step. But unfortunately, her hoof is starting to head your way. You scream and ran for cover. You jump out of the way, just in time too, for her hoof came crashing down where you previously stood. The earth below her quaked and shook hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so ironic, that a creature so gentle like Fluttershy, could be so massive and powerful to little bugs, like you at the moment. She didn't see or hear you down there, and she almost killed you. You sit there and watch her continue taking quaking stomps forward. 'She must be heading back to her cottage' you thought. This might be your only chance to get to some sort of safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for a way to follow, or at least keep up with her, you see a massive hairy pink material dragging the ground. It's her tail. 'Of course, I'll climb her tail, and see if I can get up to her ear, maybe then she'll hear me' you thought. You make no second thoughts, and make a leap for it. You grab a hold of her tail, and get a good grip as she continued to stomp forward. You remember that picture of Fluttershy, \"I watch it for the plot.\", and you had a very clear, massive view of her plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fantasies can wait until you're at least safe. Right now, you need to get her attention. So, with no second thought, you begin scaling her tail. It was so soft and smelled of fresh daisies. You couldn't help but rub it against you as you climbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climb....................</span></div></div>",

She brings her tail around to her front, and grabs you out of the tangle.<br>\r\nGrabbing quickly, but gently, as Fluttershy does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings you round to her face, and you rapidly get a grasp of just how tiny you really are. Her face looks like a skyline, an inch to her seems ten yards to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've never seen anything like you before!\" she whispers, \"What're you called, I wonder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft and sweet voice caresses you to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... a human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!

Oh, this is great! I- did you say... a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing you closer to her face, she says, before you can answer \"But I thought that humans were on the other side of the crystal mirror, and any that passed through would look like us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's the thing, I'm not... that kind of human.

In any case, she tucks you in her mane, and is about to fly off to one of the two places when she mutters regretfully \"Oh, how rude of me. this decision should be based on your priorities! So, what do you think, talk to Twilight to see if we can get an information on your world, or talk to Zecora and see if we can get you big again!\"</span></div></div>",

The one and only Rarity! Unfortunately, you don't have any more time to oggle the titanic unicorn, because one of her back hooves is coming your way as she continues walking.

Rarity gives a yelp of \"Wha-HA-HA!\" as she flinches back, looking behind her. However, her reaction is sudden and fast enough to dislodge you from her tail and throw you to the ground, knocking the wind out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When you clear the stars from your vision, you are greeted with the sight of the gargantuan Rarity leaning down towards you and looking you over. <br>\r\n<i>Well, I have her attention, at least...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To your slight surprise, Rarity is the first to react, saying.....</span></div></div>",
