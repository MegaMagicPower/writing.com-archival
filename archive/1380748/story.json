Of course, he was only battling him because Ichigo had nothing better to do.  Mayuri was the only one that could come to the world of the living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, now that I think about it, you'd make the excellent test subject for my new formula.  What do you say, boy?  Wanna try it out?\" Ichigo just looked at Mayuri.  \"Uh, no thanks.\" Mayuri just frowned. \"Oh well, I'll just have to apply it by force.\" Using flash step, Mayuri appeared behind Ichigo and jabbed a needle in his side. \"I'll observe from soul society, tata for now boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo groaned and held his side.  \"Wonder what the fuck that was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later....</span></div></div>",

He tried and tried, and he just ended up getting the same result.  \"Dammit all, they must have shrunk in the wash!\" Ichigo said as he threw the pants at his wall.  Clad now only in his briefs, Ichigo searched his closet for something else to wear.  Unbeknownst to Ichigo, he did not have his old rock hard abs.  His stomach had protruded outward, and his pecs were starting to change into boy breasts.  Though, if he looked in a mirror, all he would see was his old self, muscular and proud.  \"Aha, found a bigger pair!\"  Ichigo exclaimed as he pulled out a new pair of pants.  They were a joke gift from Keigo, for reasons Ichigo couldn't fathom.  Ichigo found that the bigger pair fit him perfectly, though he didn't question why.  Letting out a sigh of relief, Ichigo put on his shirt, which was just a little tighter on him than usual.  \"Man, I'm starving..\" Ichigo said as his stomach gurgled.  \"Might as well go out to eat...\"</span></div></div>",

This store had such a unrisitable scent that caught his nose so he went inside to be seated. There was a lot of food like Ramen, Curry, Barbecue, rice cakes, rice balls, etc. He first went for the big and heavy meals of about 4 plates each which almost made a total number of 16 plates.\"Wow I ate all that\" said Ichigo in surprised matter.

His belly was no longer small, in fact he had to weight at least 250 pounds by now.  But, Ichigo still hadn't noticed his rapid change in physique.  Whenever he looked in any mirror, or himself for that matter, he still saw his trim muscular self.  None of his shirts fit right anymore, riding up his belly and showing off his bigger boy breasts.  Jeans were also out of the question, seeing as he couldn't button any of them up anymore.  He now wore sweat pants everywhere, and he usually just wore his briefs when he was at home.  Ichigo also took to doing his own laundry, seeing as he thought all of his clothes were shrinking in the wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous night, Ichigo had a 2 hour pig out at the Karakura Buffet, coming home and going straight to bed.  He had stuffed his gut so much and left euphoric.  Getting up, however, Ichigo wasn't that happy.  He was having problems shifting his gut and getting off the bed. \"God dammit, why is this so hard!\"  with one final grunt, Ichigo managed to roll off of the bed and hit the floor with a thud.  \"Ow!  That hurt!\"  pushing himself up he went towards his closet and pulled out a pair of track pants and yanked them on.  \"Man, my clothes must still be shrinking.  I wonder why though..?\"  Ichigo shook his head and pulled out a rather big shirt and pulled it over his head.  It rode up like the rest of his shirt and Ichigo sighed.  He would worry about his clothes later, he was hungry...</span></div></div>",

Walking to the kitchen Ichigo found his dad in front of the oven cooking up a storm.  Ichigo also noticed that the kitchen table was already filed with food.  His dad had cooked almost every breakfast food imaginable.  He began to drool at the thought of feasting himself on such excellent homemade food.  It was then that Isshin finally turned around and saw his sons drooling face.  \"Good morning son!  Go ahead, eat up, it's all for you anyways!\"  Ichigo quickly turned his head and looked at his father.  \"You're not serious, are you?\"  Isshin smiled.  \"Hell yeah I'm serious, now go on eat.  I still have a bit more to cook.\"  Excited, Ichigo sat down, and began to chow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken him a half hour, but Ichigo was dangling the last piece of bacon over his mouth.  Opening wide, he dropped it in, swallowed, and let out an enormous belch.  \"Mmm, that was the best breakfast ever.\"  Ichigo said as he rubbed his distended, bloated gut.  His shirt had came off halfway through the breakfast feast, so he was currently shirtless.  \"C'mon Ichigo, let's go watch some television together.\"  Ichigo looked up at his dad and nodded.  Television after his breakfast binge sounded great.  He stood up, and automatically felt and extreme tightness around his waist.  His track pants were digging into his side uncomfortably, and he tried to rearrange them so they wouldn't.  Isshin laughed at his son's antics.  \"Just take them off Ichigo, you know I don't if you walk around in your underwear.\"  Blushing, Ichigo nodded.  Stepping out of his track pants, he was left only with his white briefs on.  They were tight, and stretched to the max on his frame, but he didn't care.  Though, he still didn't understand WHY they were tight in the first place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLATER...</span></div></div>",

Looking down, he saw that his dad was rubbing his skinny (to him) stomach. Ichigo blushed when he realized he was still in his underwear and his dad was giving him a belly rub. \"Uh, thanks dad.\" All of Isshin's rubbing caused Ichigo to let out a big belch, which caused Ichigo's big belly to wobble in his dads hands. Isshin laughed and gave Ichigo's bely a few more pats before stopping. \"How was your nap, you were out of it for a few hours.\" Ichigo couldnt believe it, that breakfast must have been heavy. \"Uh yeah, it was great-\" Ichigo was cut off my his stomach growling again. Isshin just laughed while Ichigo blushed. \"I figured you would be hungry again when you woke up, so I ordered you lunch.\" Isshin headed to the kitchen and returned with 4 large pizzas. \"I didn't know how hungry you'd be, but I figured this would be good.\" He placed the boxes beside Ichigo on the couch and flipped on the TV. \"Well, eat up.\" Ichigo didn't need to be told twice. He began eating the pizza while watching TV. He fell into a sort of mindless rhythm, grabbing and watching. His belly wobbled and surged forward in lap obscuring his breifs from view a little more.</span></div></div>",

Perfect for Kurotsuchi's formula to work its 'magic' over the course of two months.  One week after the Kurotsuchi incident found Ichigo in this situation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was sprawled out on his couch in his pajama's, as he had been for the past week, shoving greasy potato chips into his gaping mouth.  He stopped briefly to raise his leg and release loud fart, which resonated throughout the empty house.  Ichigo smiled gleefully as he farted, sniffing his 'masculine' odor.  Fart over, he continued to stuff chips into his mouth.  Since he hadn't really changed clothes since the night after his run in with Kurotsuchi, his shirt had multiple stains and crumbs on it, which Ichigo seemed proud of.  A small gut was starting to make itself known on Ichigo, which he also seemed proud of.  His mind had been 'taken over', per say, by Kurotsuchi's formula.  Ichigo was still there, but the formula made everything Ichigo was now doing seem normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house, or rather the living room and kitchen. was a mess of food wrappers because Ichigo was too lazy to clean up.  Not that he cared of course, he was becoming a slob.  But, as he was on the couch, someone came to the door...</span></div></div>",

He didn't wanna get up and stop eating, but he figured who ever was here, wouldn't leave until he let them in.  Getting up, and farting while he did so, Ichigo made his way to the door and opened it.  \"Hey Ichigo!  What's shaking?\"  There stood Renji Abarai in all of his idiotic glory.  \"Oh, hey Renji, come on in.\"  Ichigo let Renji in and went back to the couch and stuffing his face.  As Renji came in he immediately covered his nose.  \"Dude, it stinks in here, what the hell.\"  Ichigo just shrugged at his statement and continued to shove his latest bag of food into his mouth, which happened to be pork rinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji uncovered his nose, deciding that he would just have to deal with the smell.  Turning to Ichigo, Renji actually looked at him.  This wasn't the Ichigo he had hung out with last week.  Something had happened, but he wasn't sure what.  \"Hey Ichigo, what's wrong with you?\"  Ichigo stopped stuffing pork rinds into his mouth and looked at Renji.  \"What do you mean what's wrong?  Nothings wrong with me.\"  Ichigo's sentence ended, and in its place a huge fart erupted which Ichigo smiled proudly at.  Renji however, just covered his nose.  \"No wonder why it fucking stinks in here.  Do you just let those off all the time?\"  Ichigo looked at Renji like he had grown a second head.  \"Well, yeah.  I don't see what's wrong with it though.  The more rank a fart, the more masculine I am.\"  Renji shook his head.  This was definitely not Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm gonna figure out what happened to you!\"  Renji exclaimed, and went to inspect Ichigo's house.</span></div></div>",

While the room didn't stink as much as the living room, and did have a lingering scent that made Renji cover his nose a little. \"Damn, it looks like a bomb went off in here.\"  Ichigo's room was not in the pristine condition that it had been in last week.  The bed was unmade, the closet door was open and had a small pile of clothes coming out of it.  On the desk he noticed a few bowls and glasses, some of which still had food and drink in them. He looked up and spotted a pair of briefs on the fan.  Renji couldn't fathom how the even got up there and decided to jump and grab them.  Looking at them he became disgusted at the brown skid and threw them across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem like there was any evidence in the room, except for the fact that his friend had become quite the slob.  Turning to leave the room, Renji noticed something sparkling under the bed.  Reaching his hand under the bed he grabbed the object and took a closer look.  It was a syringe that still had a little bit of liquid still left in it.  \"I wonder where this came from?  I doubt Ichigo's taking drugs...\"  Just then a loud noise from downstairs startled Renji, who accidentaly drove the syringe into his hand.  \"Oh man, I don't even know what that stuff was.  I hope I'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Soul Society Mayuri sighed.  When the first dose did not activate right away, he had gone back and gave the human boy a stronger dose.  He never thought he would leave the syringe behind by accident.  \"Oh well, it's the idiots own fault.  Though I wonder what a small dose like that would do to someone...\"</span></div></div>",

Ichigo was becoming a total slob, and he couldn't have been prouder of his friend.  \"Wait.  Wasn't I disgusted by that a few minutes ago...?\"  Renji shook his head.  Why would be be disgusted that his friend was turning into a slob?  The pungent odor of farts, the loudness of burps, stuffing ones face, not showering; it was all so wonderful he wished he could become one himself.  But, with his job as a shinigami, he couldn't descend into those pleasures, except with some burps and farts here and there.  Seeing Ichigo like this, it was almost like himself becoming one.  If he couldn't become one, why not watch someone else?  \"N-No.  This can't be right.  Can it?\"  shaking his head once again, Renji tried to clear his head and search for what was true.  Everything pointed toward slob, so he went with that being the truth and smiled as he continued downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji almost got a hard-on when he saw Ichigo.  His gut had gotten bigger and his shirt, which was more yellowish than white now, was riding up.  A bit of drool was coming out the side of his mouth, as he stuffed some cookies into his mouth, which slid down his fatter neck and was absorbed by the shirt.  The was a more powerful scent in the air and Renji deduced that it hadn't come from Ichigo's farts, but from his pits.  But, Renji didn't have to wait long for a fart, as Ichigo let one loose without a care in the world.  Renji sniffed, and was impressed with its stink.  \"Hey Ichigo.  Stinky as always!\"  Ichigo lazily turned his head toward Renji and gave him a lopsided smile.  \"You know it, dude!\"  Renji laughed.  \"Hey, you want anything?  I can go out for you if you want.\"  Ichigo thought about that and replied:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I feel like crap.\u201d Renji slowly sat up in Ichigo\u2019s bed and noticed that something felt a little off. It felt as if something was between his stomach and his lap. Moving his hand to the area where he felt the obstruction, he was met with warm skin. Looking down Renji started to freak out. \u201cWhat the fuck, I\u2019ve become a fatty!\u201d It seemed that serum was what had turned Ichigo into a slob of a teenager.  He noticed that he wasn\u2019t as big as Ichigo was, but he was still quite chubby. He estimated that Ichigo had a good 60lbs over him now. He assumed that put him somewhere around the 200 mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji noticed that his new weight wasn't the only change that had happened to him. He was also quite furry now as well. Before he had passed out, Renji was confident that his body was completely hairless. Now he had a thick layer of red fuzz that covered his entire body. It made it hard to see some of his tattoos in places. He noticed that his armpits seemed quite bushy, and he could see tufts of red pit hair coming from his arm hole. \"Man, I hate body hair. I was hairless for a reason! I think I hate this more than the goddamn weight!\" Renji pulled at a few stray body hairs in irritation, wincing when he tugged too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji sighed. \"Oh well, I guess his room was a total bust, I mean look what happened to me.\" He was about to leave the room for a second time when he stopped. It felt like he needed to do something. He scratched his head in confusion. \"I did what I came up here to do, though.\" He took a quick scan around the room just to make sure. His gaze stopped on Ichigo's clothes hamper for some odd reason. Once he saw it he began moving towards it almost on autopilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell did I come over here, it's just Ichigo's dirty clothes.\" There were more clothes around the hamper than in, but that didn't stop Renji from beginning to rummage through the clothes. He found his prize and held them up to his face: a used pair of Ichigo's briefs. He turned them around to look at the seat of them. There were a lot of skid marks and the seat looked kind of worn. Considering these were at the bottom of the hamper, they must have been from before Ichigo became like this. \"Geeze Ichigo, who knew you were such a dirty guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Renji did next surprised even him. He put the briefs over his head, seat facing nose, and took a deep whiff. \"What, what the heel am I doing!?\" He took another long whiff. \"I can't fucking stop, they smell too good!\" He inhaled a few more times, almost moaning a few times he did so. \"Fuck, Ichigo. Your ass is amazing.\" After sniffing a few more times, he reluctantly took Ichigo's underwear from his head. He was going to put them back in the hamper, but Renji shoved them in his back pocket instead. \"What the fuck, I've become an underwear sniffer. Is this some form of the slob transformation? Shit, I better check up on Ichigo now!\" He finally left Ichigo's room, and headed downstairs.</span></div></div>",

He went to the strange thing they called school with Ichgo, Chad and the Quincy, but it wasn't really that interesting.

Another misfortune.  He was a terrible cook and he was broke.  But Ichigo wasn't.  Renji knew Ichigo was the school, helping out as some event, so he went up to his room.  He had to search around a bit before he found Ichigo's wallet.  Inside was a very large wad of cash that made Renji very happy.  He was going to eat good today.

Renji glanced over the remaining burgers and thought about how he was going to finish them all. He really did want those three months of free food and if this was how he was going to get them he needed to think of a solution fast. First though he needed to take a break and to unzip his pants. His belly had bloated to an uncomfortable degree and needed the space to breathe.<br>\r\n\"If only my gigai were able to hold more food, I mean I can't eat way more back in Soul Society and not have to worry about this full feeling right away.\"<br>\r\nThat's when it hit him.

Looking into the kitchen he sighed. \"I hope he plans on coming back and finishing the rest of these burgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji ran as fast as he could. Why did he not think of this idea before? If it was his gigai that was limiting him then he would just get a new one that better suited his current needs and the one place he knew where to get one was from Kisuke Urahara.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Shuuhei was walking through town he noticed an ad up for a new hot spring. It seems they were running a promotion where you got bonuses on top of the admission prices. It seemed one of the bonuses was a massage at no extra cost. \u201cMan that would be awesome. I\u2019m still a little sore from that hollow fight.\u201d But then he remembered the little predicament that was happening with his midsection. If the hot springs were busy, then everyone would see his new belly. But that massage sounded so good. He was in quite the pickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hollow he had fought had been stronger than usual. He wondered if it might have been one of Aizen\u2019s rejects from way back in the day. If it was, then that would provide an explanation for what he was experiencing right now. \u201cAha, that\u2019s it! I\u2019ll just tell people this was done by an Aizen hollow and R&amp;D is looking into it!\u201d This would allow him to save face if he was questioned about his body. He really did need to go to R&amp;D eventually to have the scientists look at him, but that could wait. \u201cOh man! I\u2019m so excited for that massage! My aching body needs it!\u201d With a huge smile Shuuhei went in the direction the ad told him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at the hot springs Shuuhei was honestly expecting a little more. For being a new hot spring, this place looked very modest in every way. Shuuhei shrugged, as long as he got his massage he didn\u2019t care what the place looked like. The receptionist greeted him when he entered with a smile. \u201cWelcome to Lazy Days Hot Spring! Are you here for the promotion we\u2019re currently putting on?\u201d Shuuhei nodded.\u201dThat massage sounds too good to pass up!\u201d The receptionist smiled in response. \u201cWe\u2019re also doing a free lunch as well as the massage, so today is your lucky day! But price of admission is 20 dollars.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShuuhei paid the meager fee and followed the receptionist\u2019s directions to the change room. It seemed he was the only one in the change room right now. He picked a corner and began to strip off his clothes. Before tying the towel around his waist, Shuuhei inspected his new belly. It had gotten a little bigger, but not by much. If he had to guess, Shuuhei would say he gained maybe 20lbs. He gave the small belly a tiny shake and frowned to himself. \u201cYou are so annoying. I\u2019m a lieutenant with a beer gut. How disgraceful.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShuuhei tied the towel around his waist and proceeded to head out towards the spring. The way his towel was tied it made his belly a tad more prominent as it sort of overhung on the towels edge. The first thing Shuuhei noticed was that this hot spring was rather steamy. It seemed the water gave off a natural steam which has surrounded the entire area. \u201cUh hey, is there anyone here?\u201d There was no response to Shuuhei\u2019s query. With a grin Shuuhei felt a bit mischievous. He undid the towel from around his waist and sat in the spring buck naked. \u201cMan, this feels so good.\u201d This water and steam was making him feel more relaxed than he\u2019d ever felt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShuuhei\u2019s hands absentmindedly went to his new gut as he began to rub it, the hot spring making all his worries fade away for the time being. He didn\u2019t even notice that he gained a little bit more weight while he was rubbing his belly. He was content to just sit here for the time being.</span></div></div>",

But he guessed that with him being so smelly, enemies wouldn't want to fight him, giving him the advantage.  He still didn't like the fact that he, himself, had to deal with it.

He shoved full burgers into his drooling mouth, bits of food dropping everywhere. He had honestly never tasted anything so good in his life, he needed to eat all of it now. He continued on shoving full burgers into his mouth, occasionally letting out a fart here and there. Honestly, you probably wouldn't realize it was Grimmjow if you looked at the sight. When Grimmjow was finished, he let loud a very loud belch and patted his belly. Huh, wait, he could have sworn that it was bigger. Glancing down at his food covered belly, it was indeed bigger. Somehow he had managed to gain even more weight. He had to guess it was due to that serum he was injected with. Grimmjow grumbled to himself.

Though Aizen often found it bothersome, he couldn't help but to think Gin's bed hogging was somehow cute. After a few moments Aizen brought his attention back to the mirror. His eyes traveled down to his hip bones. Once again he had noticed a slight bruising of the area, bruising that he knew came from the bony ass of his lieutenant and partner, Gin Ichimaru. <br>\r\n\tBeing cadaverous, Gin was both pale and thin, which one he was more of, Aizen was not too sure. He had always found the younger man attractive, and admire his skills and abilities. The most dearing part about him is that Aizen knew Gin would follow him until the sands of Hueco Mundo were lost in the wind.<br>\r\n\tA smirk grew on Aizens face as he felt the skeletal arms of his awoken lover around his waist.\"Ain't ya coming back to bed Aizen Sama?\" Gin asked as his gaze locked on to where Sosukes' hands were. \"heh, don't tell me some bruising is enough to keep Aizen Sama out of commission.\" Gin's smile grew as he enjoyed some kind of sadistic pleasure from the sensual power he had over his captain. \"ya know we could'a stop anytime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gin...\" Aizen shot the smiling man a quick glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGin lowered himself to his knees and softly bit the tissue on Aizen's hip bone, he then gave it a quick peck. \"But I guess Cap'n Aizen wouldn't want that, now would he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Aizen pulled himself away from gin and walked towards the doors of his chambers grabbing a robe along the way. As he opened the door he turned back and said \"I have something to work on, I suggest you not follow me this time around. I'll shall see you in the morning.\" and with that Aizen shut the door and was on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGin stood himself up and was both pleased and confused. Aizen was bothered by something Gin had done but still wanted to have their morning tea together. This was the pleasing part. however, what confused Gin is that he was instructed not to follow. Normally Aizen would simply have wandered off knowing it was useless to try and tell Gin to stay put. Could this mean Aizen was working on something even he could not know about? Perhaps he would tell him in the morning? The only thing Gin was sure of is that he'd best not bother the man and his work, not tonight anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((I wonder what awaits Gin in the morning ;P))<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the morning Gin made his way to the private planning room of Aizen, which was often used for their morning tea sessions. Morning tea sessions had been something Aizen had introduced Gin to when he entered the Gotei 13. Though Gin had liked tea he never really had any interest in ceremonies or sessions, if he wanted tea he would drink it when ever he wanted and how ever he liked it. However Gin had been interested in Aizen and wanted to be around him as often as possible when he was younger. Now it had become second nature for the two men to engage in a morning tea session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGin open the door to the room and poked his head in. He scanned the room and smiled. As expected the tea was already prepared and waiting on the ivory white table across the room. But where was Aizen, Gin wondered as he walked in. Gin approached the table and took his usual spot. When he did that he heard Aizen Sosuke's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Good Morning Gin. Tell me, how was your sleep last night?\" the man asked as he joined the younger man. <br>\r\n\"s'alright Captain.\" Gin replied<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\" Aizen began to pour a coup of tea, when finished he handed it to Gin. \"Gin, I want you to try that tea and tell me how it taste.\"<br>\r\n\"oh? is it new?\" Gin asked.<br>\r\n\"yes it is, I made it last night. Go on, try it.\" Aizen leaned in and placed his chin on his hands and smiled as he watched Gin place the cup to his lips and sip the tea. <br>\r\nA moment later and Gin placed the empty cup down on the table. Gin was blown away, What he just drank had to have been the best tea he had ever had. It was warm, not too hot nor too cool, and had a very smooth feel to it as it dived down his throat. His favorite part though was the flavor. <br>\r\n\"Persimmons,\" Aizen said. \"I know they are your favorite so I decided to make this tea.\"<br>\r\nGin blushed, this was something only Aizen could make happen, and even then only once in a while.<br>\r\n\"D'aww, Just for little ol' me? I'm flattered That Captain Aizen knows me so well and would do something so thoughtful.\" Gin teased, He made it sound as if Aizen were normally a cold lover, Aizen however was the opposite. He was very thoughtful and caring... towards Gin anyways. Though he had to admit it was for his own selfish reasons. He had Gin, who was a very skilled and even frightening opponent for anyone, emotionally attached to him. He also had his own desires that everyone else had, and it just so happened that Gin fulfilled them. Aizen could not believe how amazing sex was with Gin and how skillful the silver haired man had been with his tongue. The only downside was how thin gin was, Aizen would not have minded a bit more meat on his lieutenant in bed. <br>\r\nThankfully during the night Aizen was able to formulate a concoction that he hopes will put a few pounds on his skeletal lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGin had just finished drinking his second cup of tea. He really did enjoy it and could not resist the taste of his favorite fruit. He sat back in his chair and stared at the man in front of him. He wasn't to sure, but he knew that this act of kindness, just like in the past, would lead up to something that Aizen wanted, he just didn't know what.</span></div></div>",

He lay on the bed stretched out staring at the ceiling. He was waiting for Aizen to finish off some trivial experiments with Tousen. He normally loved to watch Aizen at work but had no desire to do so while Tousen was there getting in the way, especially if they were doing something that was minor in comparison to what Captain Aizen could actually do. Gin Also had an odd feeling in his stomach. He was hungry, but more so than usual, it was actually starting to hurt. He did nothing to rid himself of his hunger though, there was no reason too. After all him and his beloved were schedule for lunch in the human world and he did not wish to ruin the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter about an hour Aizen had returned to his chambers and changed into something fitting for the human world. He wore black dress pants and a white dress top. Around his neck was a scarf, a deep red, that was tucked nicely into his shirt. He quickly grabbed a brown leather blazer and head to Gin's chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen Aizen arrived he found Gin sporting a pair of black jeans, dark brown lugz, a white muscle top and a blue buttoned down blouse. Aizen took a moment to check the man out, he couldn't wait for his tea to start taking effect. What Gin didn't know is that Aizen had planned on making this lunch into a whole trip. One that Aizen was going to enjoy very much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the two arrived into the human world it was around 12:15. The sun was bright and many people were out and about. \"Sure are a lot of people out today, wouldn't ya say captain Aizen?\"<br>\r\n\tAizen didn't answer, instead he looked down at his wrist. The watch he was wearing told him they were late for their reservations at the restaurant Aizen had initially planned on eating. This didn't bother him, in fact this was the perfect time to test out his little experiment on Gin. The older man quickly turned around and signaled for Gin to follow.<br>\r\n\"Wow weee! This sure is the perfect place for yer plan captain Aizen, a lot of people with spiritual strength,\" Gin paused for a moment \"though it sure is at a pathetic level. By the way, Where are we going Captain Aizen, I thought our reservations were that a way?\"<br>\r\n\"It seems we were late for our reservations.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my, and your not just going to demand a table?\"<br>\r\n\"That place was not adequate for what I'm currently interested in Gin, right now I want something... of simplicity.\"<br>\r\nThough he sported his usual facial expression and plastered on Grin, Gin was a bit confused. Normally the power nazi would never have settled for less then what he felt he deserved, though it was just a restaurant so Gin decided not to question the decision, still curious though he asked again \"So then where are we going?\"<br>\r\nAizen continued forward down the street. Without looking back he replied \"I hear there's a really good place not too far from here that serves quality food for a decent price. Besides, I've decided that our trip here will be more than a couple of days, I want to see what kind of further potential this town has, so we can always come back later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((A slow start, but I think things are finally on there way. :p))</span></div></div>",

Why can't you test it out on him?\"  Shuuhei shook his head.  \"I am the one the Head Captain sent to see of the kido actually works, and you're the one the Head Captain chose as the test subject.\"  Ikkaku sighed and resigned.  \"Fine, I give up.\"  Renji grinned and started to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humanite Hypnos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash of light Ikkaku slumped forward.

Nothing makes you happier, or more proud of your masculinity, then letting loose a big, rank fart.

He grabbed his garbage pail and began to empty it's contents around the small living room/kitchen area.  Satisfied with that area, he went into his room.  All the robes in his closet were thrown about and he unmade his bed.  That being all he could do he moved to the bathroom.  Looking at it, he decided to leave it for now, knowing full well the disaster area it would become in the coming days.

Each day he had changed into a different set of robes so he could mess all of them up.  Ikkaku smiled.  He loved the way he was living his life.  Grabbing a handful of chips, he stuffed them into his mouth.  Following the swallow, Ikkaku let out a huge burp and patted his belly.  \"That was a great burp.\"  His ass, not to be outdone by his mouth, let out a fart that was a little bit wet.  \"Ah, that was beautifully rank!\"  He was interrupted from his pigdom by a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku got up and answered the door to find that it was Renji.  \"Hey dude! What's sha-urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrp-king?\"  Renji just smiled and let himself in.  \"So dude, want some chips or something?\"  Ikkaku asked, but Renji just shook his head.  \"Naw, I'd rather humiliate you.\"  with that Ikkaku's body slumped slightly forward and his eyes fogged over.  \"Heh, with you like that, it's time to look over your progress!\"  Renji walked a circle around Ikkaku nodding at his smelly and slightly fatter body.  He went into the bedroom and smiled.  Clothes and food everywhere.  Next was the washroom.  He had to cover his nose.  It looked like Ikkaku hadn't flushed the toilet the last time he used it,  Renji was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to Ikkaku, Renji decided it was time for a few more changes.  \"Now Ikkaku, whatever I tell you is completely true, alright...?\"  Ikkaku nodded his head.  \"Alright.  Now, whenever you battle you now incorporate your stench as you think it makes a valuable weapon.\"  Ikkaku nodded. \"Stench a weapon..\"  Renji continued.  \"Whenever you're hungry you start drooling.  Drooling enough that you're chin, neck and the front of you're robes are covered.\"  Ikkaku nodded.  \"Lastly, the next time you have a training session with grunts, you're going to bring me along.\"  Ikkaku agreed. \"Bring you..\"  Renji grinned.  \"Now on the count of three, you'll awaken, thinking I just came over to say hi.

Knocking on Ikkaku's door, he waited awhile and noone let him in. Shrugging, he tried opening the door to find that he could walk right in. When he stepped in he saw why Ikkaku wouldn't come to the door. Ikkaku was laying on the couch, bags of treats surrounding him. He must have eaten himself into a food nap. Renji grinned, Ikkaku' gut was distended and straining his now very messy robes. Ikkaku let off a huge fart and it actually woke him up.  \"Oh hey Renji, didja let yourself -burrrrrrp- in?' Renji grinned. \"Yeah, I just came by to say I hope I didn't humiliate you earlier.\" And with that Ikkaku's eyes went dull and he slumped over. \"I forgot to give you some more instruction earlier, so listen up.\" Ikkaku nodded listlessly. \"You hate physical activity. You never like to train and would rather just sit around and eat.\" Ikkaku mumbled an agreement and seemed to slump further into the couch. \"That's it for right now, so you can wake up.\" Ikkaku's eyes returned to normal and he seemed to perk up a little. Ikkaku let out another huge fart. \"That was a nice chat we had? I can't seem to remember it\" Ikkaku let out a burp after his sentence. \"It was nothing special, don't worry about it. I need to get going though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Renji was moving towards the door he remembered something else that he wanted to do to Ikkaku. \"Hey Ikkaku, on second thought I still want to humiliate you some more\" Ikkaku just looked at Renji strangely. His eyes didnt go blank. \"Why would you want to -burrrrrrrrp- humiliate me, bro?\" Renji scratched his head. The trigger must only work once. Sighing Renji moved his hands into the kido formation and began to concentrate, \"Humanite Hypnos!\" Just as the force flew toward Ikkaku, he noticed some food on the ground and bent over to pick it up. The force flew past Ikkaku, hit the window and bounced back towards Renji. The force hit Renji and his eyes went dull and his shoulders slumped. With his bag of chips in hand Ikkaku got back up and looked at Renji. \"Hey, are you -burrrrp- okay?\" Renji nodded slowly. \"Huh, wonder what's up with him. Looks like he's hypnotized.\" And it clicked. \"Heh heh, let's have some fun, shall we.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although he knew he could probably could go out and have some fun, maybe flirt with some people, Ichigo would literally kill him if something went wrong.  Hell, Kon hoped Ichigo would never find out about the \"Karakura-Riser\" incident.  Speaking of that, the shopkeeper hadn't bugged him in awhile either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I'm complaining, I mean all he brings me is trouble and pain.\"  Kon yawned and got up, scratching \"his\" ass in the progress.  What he wasn't expecting though, as something to fly through the window and hitting his head.  \"What the fuck!?\"  Kon yelled as he looked down at the little box.  It was just a small gift box wrapped with a bow.  Scratching his head, he picked it up and opened in.  Along with two different coloured pills (an orange and pink one to be exact), there appeared to be a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Kon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease accept the shopkeepers apologies about the whole Karakura-Riser fiasco.

They weren't from that shopkeeper, so they were at least somewhat safe.  But, he couldn't decide which pill to take first.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo sighed and snuck another look at his father. Isshin was currently in an animated conversation with one of his daughters over something or another. Looking at him like this, it was hard to believe that his dad used to be a captain of the 13 Court Guard Squads. Of course, with him being banished that no longer stood, but Ichigo had witnessed his power first hand so it was hard to write off. It frustrated him that his dad had hidden this from him for so long. He understood why his father did what he did, but that didn't mean that he had to like it. If it involved his mom, he should have known dammit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just wished, now more than ever, that his dad could be a normal dad. Isshin had never really fit the mould of what a father should be or look like, according to Ichigo. According to several different types of people, Isshin was what you would call a \u2018hot dad.\u2019 The girls at Ichigo\u2019s high school would constantly ask to come home with him, just to catch a glimpse of his dad. Hell, even a few boys had asked as well. He would get stopped on the street by several women, them asking if his dad was currently open to dating. It was pretty ridiculous to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo never saw the hot dad aspect of his father. Sure, he understood why people thought he was hot, but he himself never saw it. Dads should be normal, average, and more mild-mannered. Not boisterous and excitable like his dad was. They shouldn\u2019t be \u2018muscled sex gods\u2019 either. Also, dads shouldn\u2019t keep such serious secrets from their kids. Ichigo wished he could just make his dad normal. Also, if he had to have a hot dad, why couldn\u2019t Isshin be Ichigo\u2019s type of hot dad! It wasn\u2019t fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo blushed, what he wouldn\u2019t give for his dad to be his type of hot dad. Isshin was already halfway there too. He had the scruff and the hairy body, Isshin just had way too many muscles to go with them. If he just shed his ripped stomach and put on a nice dad gut, then Ichigo would enjoy staring at his dad for hours. Maybe if his dad acted more like a dad, then his body would follow suit. Isshin had a tremendous amount of energy, which is what allows him to look the way he does. Without that, Isshin would not have the motivation to constantly keep his body in tiptop shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fools errand though. How would he get his dad to lose the majority of his energy. There was also the fact that Isshin\u2019s entire life and personality would have to be changed around as well. Ichigo sighed, it was nice to think about these things at least. There\u2019s no way that it could actually happen.</span></div></div>",

He said he knew about Ichigo's inner desires and he knew how to make them come true. Deciding to humour the man, Ichigo went to the stand to check things out. The shopkeep placed a gold pendant into Ichigo's hands. \"You know how to use it and what it is for. Yourn father will never see it coming.\"  Ichigo looked at the man flabbergasted. How had he known of his secret desires? He was about to question the shopkeeper but when he looked up he was gone. Ichigo was very confused. Aw well, he might as well try it, it couldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIchigo reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, golden pendant, one he had just gotten along a back alley at the marketplace earlier that day. The seller, whom Ichigo was sure was an unproclaimed witch doctor, had assured him that the pendant in his hand had some mystical properties, ones that Ichigo was itching to take advantage of. \u201cWhatcha got there, son?\u201d Isshin suddenly said interrupting Ichigo\u2019s train of thought; now was his chance. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I got at the market today,\u201d Ichigo said casually, holding the pendant up to show his father like nothing was out of the ordinary. Ichigo began to swing the pendant gently back and forth. \u201cHey, keep it still so I can see it,\u201d Isshin said, following the pendant back and forth. When after a few seconds Ichigo had still not stopped rocking his new find back and forth, Isshin opened his mouth to reprimand his boy, but the words only bubbled out as an incoherent stammer. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the pendant, and the more in rocked back and forth, the less anything else seemed to matter around him. His arms slowly slide down to his sides, as he felt his breathing slowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, father, keep staring,\u201d Ichigo said in a calming tone despite the devilish grin spreading wide across his face. Isshin felt his jaw slacken and his vision narrow, allowing him to only see one thing; the pendant. A blackness fell over his thoughts with the pendant acting as a beacon, illuminating the emptiness of his head. Suddenly, a voice cut through to his mind, one that he didn\u2019t just want to listen to, but one that he needed to listen to. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d Ichigo said, seeing the blank stare on his father as he continued to swing the pendant back and forth. He had been a little skeptical of the proclaimed hypnotic powers of the charm, as you always had to make a leap to trust a witch doctor, but apparently, he had been told the truth. Now his father stood before him like a moldable piece of clay, ready to heed and act on anything suggestion or command that he gave him. Ichigo grinned; he knew exactly what to say: \u201cIsshin, you will no longer be a polite, stick of a man. You despise being thin and you despise good table manners because you love food. You love eating food to the point that you can\u2019t physically eat more, yet you still do. You eat to get bigger, you eat to get larger, you eat to get fatter. You want nothing more than to pack as much fat onto your slobby frame as possible. You will give up your warrior lifestyle and instead simply laze around on your rump eating all day every day. You live for food and love the fat that it packs onto your body.\u201d Isshin merely stared ahead as Ichigo spoke, absorbing every word his son spoke like it was the gospel from an all-powerful deity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDo you understand?\u201d Ichigo asked, pleased to see his father nod his head up and down. \u201cGood.\u201d</span></div></div>",

So Sajin was slowly becoming more social around people feeling more secure to show himself to the public as he sometimes went to the village himself he still gets the odd look every know and than but no were as much as he used to<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut but today Sajin was worried because of how fat he's gotten in the last few months people will notice him more plus he was practically naked besides the mawashi he was wearing but Sajin had courage he loved the festival and being massively fat and near nude wouldn't stop him now Sajin walked into the village market people tried to hide there amazement at the hugely fat half naked wolf man walking down to the food market<br>\r\nSajin blushed as he walked throw town there were lots of people looking at him Sajin was scared they were judging him as he went throw town to the market but as he walked throw with his butt moobs and belly jiggling up and down he noticed something strange when he heard the towns folk whispering he heard things like he \"Do you think he's going to win? or \"Wow look at the size of his ass\" or \"Now that I can see how fat he is I bet I'm going to win\" he heard them saying stuff like this everywhere he went Sajin wondered why everyone was acting so excited it sounded like they were betting on him but betting on what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a bunch of kids and teens ran up to him \"Hey its Sajin! they shouted making Sajin confused<br>\r\nHe than saw that a lot of theys kids were the ones he payed to do his chores around his dojo Sajin smiled he was happy to see them but it was odd that they were so excited about him he wondered why?  \"Glad to see you all\"  he said<br>\r\nHe than heard the bunch talk a girl said \"Wow my little brother was right he is huge\" and another girl said \"damn hes kind of cute looking\"  witch made Sajin blush. One of the kids smile and hugged Sajin fat belly making Sajin jiggle \"wow his so soft\" the kid said happily<br>\r\nSajin was so confused at everyone acting so kind to him.. most people were either scared of him or just acted normal to him. But a lot of people in town seemed to really like just how fat and huge Sajin was now he heard a lot of women call him hot or others call him cute <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Sajin asked the bunch of kids and teens \"Hey what is going on why is everyone treating me like I'm famous or something? suddenly the village mayor came up to Sajin and said hey Sajin  were all glad you made it were just about to start the contest a lot of people betted on you he than smiled as he looked at Sajin and said \"I can see why too my goodness you mite be the fattest wolfman I've ever seen its very impressive\" Sajin blushed hearing all this stuff Sajin than asked the kids \"What's going on tell me...\" the kids smiled \"Oh sorry Sajin we forgot to tell you we ad a lot of other towns folk decided to put you into a contest because we think you can win it\" Sajin gulped what is it? the kid smiled \"its...\"   </span></div></div>",
