The spiky haired blond had just come back from a mission that took much longer than expected. As a result he had eaten barely anything the last few days and was starving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I need some grub.\u201d Naruto told himself as he touched his growling belly with one hand. His blue eyes glanced around for a place to eat. As he looked slightly behind him he noticed his favorite restaurant: Ramen Ichiraku. \u201cOh wow! I wasn\u2019t paying attention and almost walked by Ichiraku!\u201d Naruto mentally slapped himself for the near mistake and hurried toward the small shop; the smell of ramen pulling him toward it by his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto! I thought I heard your stomach growling out there!\u201d Teuchi greeted the young ninja as he appeared through the sliding door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe.\u201d Naruto chuckled as he blushed and scratched the hair on the back of his head. The orange ninja took a seat on one of the stools in front of him before speaking to the older man. \u201cWell I\u2019m starving! Get me something really filling, Teuchi!\u201d Naruto barked in his usual hyperactive voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFilling, eh?\u201d the chef scratched his chin before smiling. \u201cWell, that\u2019d be most of your usuals, but I have something special for you today!\u201d the restaurant owner turned away from Naruto and started preparing his favorite customer\u2019s meal. Naruto blinked in curiosity; wondering what the man had planned. It was Ayame who spoke up moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA friend of father\u2019s stopped by not long ago,\u201d the girl stated to explain. \u201cHe gave us a very strange herb that\u2019s apparently really good in ramen dishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Teuchi cut in as he stood over a boiling pot. \u201cSee, he\u2019s also in the ramen business and he says this stuff\u2019s been making him a fortune. It\u2019s supposed to shrink your hunger right down!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh\u2026\u201d Naruto watched as the older man prepared the ramen; his mouth already drooling and his ears only listening to half of what he was saying. He was just too famished to care where the delicious smelling ramen came from. After a few more minutes Teuchi carried over a steaming bowl of ramen and placed it in front of Naruto. The blond teen stared at the bowl of goodness with pure joy, though he didn\u2019t recognize any difference compared to a normal bowl of pork ramen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, he only gave me enough for one bowl. You\u2019ll have to decide whether I go ask him if he can sell me any of the stuff!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it smells the same\u2026\u201d Naruto muttered as he separated his chopsticks. \u201cBut it\u2019s the taste that matters! Ikadakimasu!\u201d The sixteen year-old genin immediately got to work scarfing down the ramen. Teuchi and Ayame both watched as their #1 customer consumed the contents of the bowl as if he inhaled the meats and noodles. It was a sight they were very used to and in just five minutes Naruto was already picking up the bowl and pouring the last of the broth down his throat. \u201cWow!\u201d Naruto shouted as he slammed the bowl down upon the counter. He leaned back and gave his stomach a few pats. \u201cThat was great! Your friend was right, I\u2019m really-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, the young teenager disappeared in a cloud of white smoke. The two ramen chefs stared in disbelief as the smoke dissipated and revealed an empty stool where Naruto once sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot again\u2026\u201d the older chef said with a sigh as he recalled the last time Naruto had vanished like this in his restaurant. \u201cNow how am I supposed to know if these herbs are worth buying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, father. He\u2019ll be back soon like last time.\u201d Ayame replied as she gathered up Naruto\u2019s bowl and chopsticks and brought them to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unbeknownst to the father and daughter, Naruto was still very much among them this time. For you see, Teuchi\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d was actually a bitter rival of his who harbored a deep hatred for him and his successful ramen shop. The rival had thus given Teuchi a dangerous herb that spelt doom for whoever consumed it. The bitter rival knew the tainted ramen would be prepared only for Teuchi\u2019s best customer. Without their best customer, Ichiraku\u2019s business would surely dwindle. Speaking of dwindle\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d Naruto stuttered, blinking in confusion. He was still seated like he was seconds ago, but this time he was sitting on a strange green landscape. No longer was he looking into the faces of his two favorite ramen chefs; they had just vanished. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?! Did you summon me away again, Fukasaku?!\u201d Naruto shouted for the toad sage as he leaped to his feet, but he saw no sign of him\u2026or anyone for that matter. \u201cWhere am I?!\u201d Right after shouting this, the Leaf ninja went wide eyed and looked down at the green \u201cland\u201d below him. Slowly he bent down and touched it; the texture, while thicker, was much like the seats of Ichiraku! \u201cN-No way\u2026that\u2019s impossible.\u201d Naruto fell back onto his butt as his body shook in fright. He was STILL in Ichiraku\u2026but his seat was now enormous! For it to be mistaken for a whole other landscape he had to be ant sized\u2026maybe even smaller! \u201cT-This has to be a dream\u2026Teuchi wouldn\u2019t give me a ramen that-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could finish reassuring himself, he heard a loud sound behind him. The blue eyed, shrunken ninja turned his head around to see that someone had slid open the door to Ichiraku and stepped in. Naruto craned his neck and gaped as the titanic figure of a fellow ninja stood before him; his shadow surrounding him. Naruto recognized the titan\u2019s clothes, face, and soon his voice. It was none other than\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The young, mountainous figure that towered over Naruto was Konohamaru Sarutobi. Naruto couldn\u2019t believe it was the same spiky haired genin he knew, however. The kid he knew was a whole head shorter than him, but this Konohamaru\u2026he was bigger than anything Naruto thought could exist in this world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, old man!\u201d Konohamaru greeted; his youthful, child-like voice booming in Naruto\u2019s eardrums. The young teenager closed the sliding door behind him and glanced over the empty row of stools in front of him. \u201cNo one else here today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you just missed Naruto.\u201d Ayame replied to the young shinobi as she washed Naruto\u2019s bowl in a sink; any remnants of that mysterious herb disappearing down the drain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, boss just left?\u201d Konohamaru asked as he took a step further into the small shop. The whole time Naruto was staring up at the looming kid; his neck craned back just to see his face. The miniscule blood stood there paralyzed, his mouth gaped open in shock and his fingers twitching. Unintelligible sounds came from the ramen lover\u2019s throat; he was just unable to come up with a word to describe his situation. That one step brought the titanic Konohamaru so close to Naruto that the older male fell onto his butt trying to keep his eyes on the boy\u2019s face. For a moment the fox boy\u2019s vision was completely taken up by the pale green of Konohamaru\u2019s jacket. A second later the young genin swung a leg over Naruto\u2019s head and the tiny boy\u2019s eyes grew even wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d Naruto cursed loudly as he looked up and saw nothing but the gray clad butt of his rival/apprentice. Konohamaru was about to sit down\u2026right on top of him! Not a thought of escape crossed Naruto\u2019s mind in the following milliseconds. He didn\u2019t even move, for he knew there was no point. There was no way he could escape something so massive; not even if he was ten times faster. He would need a space/time jutsu, and even then he wouldn\u2019t have enough time to use it. The only thing the gnat of a ninja could do was brace himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a THUMP Konohamaru sat himself down on the stool; unknowingly pinning Naruto under his bigger body. Naruto was smashed between the seat and the giant kid\u2019s butt; flat on his back and totally helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Teuchi replied to the young customer\u2019s question. \u201cSo, what\u2019ll it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Konohamaru thought for a moment before answering. \u201cI\u2019ll have something with beans in it! I have an odd craving for some\u2026\u201d Konohamaru giggled as he licked his lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeans, eh? Coming right up!\u201d The Ichiraku owner nodded before starting on the order. Meanwhile, by some miracle, Naruto was not a pasty stain under Konohamaru\u2019s rump (at least not yet\u2026). The poor orange-clad ninja had been caught right between the giant boy\u2019s butt cheeks and temporarily saved from a humiliating end. He still felt the heavy, unforgiving weight of the giant boy, however, as it slowly crushed him into the cushioned stool. The shrunken blond could barely move at all; in fact the only thing he could move was his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026t-this can\u2019t be happening!\u201d Naruto exclaimed to himself as he tried his best to squirm underneath the sitting titan, but to no avail. \u201cKonohamaru!! Get off me!!\u201d The tiny ninja put all his strength into his struggling, but made no progress whatsoever. The giant brat was just too impossibly big; all Naruto could do was wait and hope he stood up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd wait he did. It doesn\u2019t take particularly long for Teuchi to prepare a bowl of ramen, but for Naruto the wait was unbearable. Every second was spent enduring the unbelievable weight of the giant above him. Within the first ten seconds Naruto\u2019s face became covered in sweat due to the immense heat collecting underneath Konohamaru\u2019s rump. The teenage shinobi laid there panting and trying to understand how a typical visit to Ichiraku has suddenly turned into a life or death situation. He was alive right now, but he couldn\u2019t help imagining Konohamaru adjusting his position on the stool. These stools weren\u2019t exactly Grade A after all and the simplest movement on Konohamaru\u2019s part would spell instantaneous doom for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are, kiddo!\u201d Teuchi called as he placed a steaming bowl of ramen in front of the scarf wearing teenager. A line of drool dripped down Konohamaru\u2019s mouth as he gazed at the bean sauce topped noodle bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm! Smells great!\u201d the brown haired boy shouted as he grabbed his chopsticks, picked up the bowl, and dug in. He wasn\u2019t as fast as Naruto, but after watching the older ninja eat ramen so much he tried his best to mimic his boss. While Konohamaru stuffed his boyish face he was unaware of Naruto\u2019s suffering underneath him. The blond fox boy grunted as he felt his ribs start to creak from the pressure the giant of a boy was putting on him. It made him understand how fragile he was at this size; the mere twist of the butt or even a slide to the right would obliterate his tiny frame. The worst part, however, was that Naruto was consumed in complete darkness and silence. The massive ass flattening him blocked out any and all light and sound. He would never see his demise coming and that made him tremble in fear. </span></div></div>",

This was really happening: he was being crushed to death under his own friend! The godly boy had no clue either! \u201cI-I can\u2019t die\u2026not like this!\u201d the blond ninja spat as a trickle of blood dripped from his mouth. Things were quickly accelerating to a gruesome end; at this rate Naruto would burst like a grape no matter what Konohamaru did! The great Naruto, hero of the village, fated to end his ninja career under the ass of someone not even half as strong as him. As Naruto\u2019s face was pinned onto its side and it became difficult to speak, the teenage genin started hyperventilating for a few seconds. However, the shrunken young man suddenly took a deep breath of the musky, hot air and calmed himself down. He couldn\u2019t lose it now; he had to believe in the boy he shared a brotherly bond with! Konohamaru would never kill him; not even unintentionally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026dying here\u2026\u201d Naruto mumbled as he sported his signature smug smirk. \u201cBecause I\u2019m Naruto Uzumaki, the-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*squish*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhh, delicious!\u201d shouted Konohamaru as he finished drinking the broth out of the bowl and slammed it down on the counter. His cute face blushed with delight as the young shinobi slid back on the stool and rubbed his belly happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fast! Almost as fast as Naruto.\u201d Teuchi spoke as he took the empty ramen bowl from Konohamaru. \u201cYou\u2019re one of his rivals, right? Are you aiming to be my second best customer, kiddo?\u201d The older man chuckled amusingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d Konohamaru raised an eyebrow as he removed a bit of money from his wallet. \u201cWell\u2026Naruto\u2019s going to be the Sixth Hokage one day and then he won\u2019t have as much time to eat here. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll be your Number 1 customer, old man!\u201d the spiky haired kid paid for his meal and gave the chef a thumbs up. He then hopped out of his seat and left the small restaurant; leaving Teuchi and his daughter to laugh. As Konohamaru walked down the crowded streets of the Leaf Village, none of his passersby noticed the dark, speck-sized smudge on his pants.</span></div></div>",

The 17 year-old had promised his father he would spar with him today, but he had taken five minutes longer to change that usual. Not wanting to make his dad wait any longer Gohan hurried down the stairs. As he did he heard some giggling coming from the nearby living room. It sounded like Goten and Trunks and Gohan was going to just ignore them when suddenly there was a <i>zap</i> sound followed by a bright flash of green. A second later he heard Trunks\u2019 voice shouting excitingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, it worked!\u201d cried Trunks, laughing with joy. \u201cNow it\u2019s my turn!\u201d Gohan hurried toward the room to see what was going on, but before he got there another <i>zap</i> was heard and then another flash of green light. Gohan entered the living room a second later and discovered\u2026nothing. The room was completely empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d the teenage half-Saiyan walked further into the room as he looked around with his black eyes. He definitely heard Goten and Trunks in here. After taking a few more steps away from the doorway, Gohan\u2019s foot bumped into something and it slid away a couple feet. He glanced down and spotted what looked like a toy gun on the floor. Curious, Gohan picked it up and examined it in his hands. \u201cThat Goten\u2026you\u2019d think he\u2019d of learned by now how angry mom gets when he leaves his toys around.\u201d Gohan looked up from the gun and glanced around the room sternly. \u201cGoten! I know you\u2019re in here!\u201d Gohan waited for his younger brother to come out of hiding, but there was no sign of him. Gohan went back to observing the toy gun and noticed the Capsule Corporation\u2019s logo on it. \u201cSo it\u2019s not a toy\u2026don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s some kind of invisibility ray.\u201d Gohan pointed the gun at himself and pulled the trigger as he said this. At the time he didn\u2019t think much of the action, but it would prove to be one of his biggest mistakes. The gun lit up in his hands and with a <i>zap</i> it fired a green beam that hit Gohan square in his chest. Gohan was blinded by the resulting flash of light for only a second, but when his vision returned he noticed two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the gun was no longer in his hands, but on the floor in front of him. Second, it was HUGE. What had once looked like a toy gun now looked like a gigantic contraption before him. Gohan gaped up at the huge mechanism before spinning around and looking at the rest of the room. His living room now looked impossibly huge as if it was a whole other world. The cracks in the wooden floor now looked like he could squeeze through them and the furniture around him went up for miles. Gohan estimated he was only a centimeter in height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay\u2026not an invisibility ray.\u201d Gohan mumbled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Gohan joined us!\u201d came the familiar, childish voice of Goten. Gohan looked to his right to see his brother and Trunks running toward him. Both were shrunken like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, watch where you\u2019re stepping, Gohan!\u201d Trunks shouted as they reached him. \u201cYou almost stepped on us a few times back there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did?\u201d Gohan realized the two kids really were in the room and he simply hadn\u2019t noticed. He was glad they were both unhurt, but\u2026 \u201cWould one if you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you figure it out?\u201d Goten asked, smiling widely as he laced his arms behind his head. \u201cTrunks brought a real-life shrink ray from home! Now we have all this space to play in! Isn\u2019t it awesome?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome? Are you joking? Goten, this-\u201d But the two demi-Saiyans didn\u2019t seem to want to stick around since they both started to take off into the air while Gohan was still talking. The spiky haired teen thought fast and quickly grabbed one of the kids\u2019 short legs in each hand before pulling them back down to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea?!\u201d Trunk\u2019s asked as he glared at the older male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, you two! You don\u2019t seem to understand how dangerous this is! We\u2019re the size of flies! What does mom do when she sees a fly?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-She\u2026swats it.\u201d Goten answered with a gulp, but returned Gohan\u2019s stern gaze with his own. \u201cBut mom isn\u2019t home right now! She and Trunks\u2019 mom went on some vacation together. The only one home is dad.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make this any less dangerous!\u201d Gohan shouted back; getting frustrated. He couldn\u2019t believe he had accidentally shrunk himself\u2026but then again if he hadn\u2019t he or someone else might of stepped on the two tiny kids. \u201cListen\u2026we need to get back to normal. Lets try to find an undo switch on the shrink ray and-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gohan could finish he was interrupted by a loud BOOMing noise. It was quickly followed by another BOOM\u2026then another\u2026then another. The booms were getting closer and the floor started to tremble with each one. The three boys realized the sound was footsteps and they all fearfully turned their heads toward the living room\u2019s entryway. A few BOOMs later and someone entered the living room. It was\u2026</span></div></div>",

The hulking man\u2019s dark blue boots hit the floor with such force that the tiny trio thought he was stomping into the room; but actually he was simply walking normally. Goku stopped in front of the living room entrance and glanced around the empty room confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGohan? You in here?\u201d Goku asked in a slightly raised voice. The Saiyan scratched the back of his head when he saw no signs of his son and heard no reply. \u201cCould of sworn I heard him yelling\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoooaa\u2026Goten, your dad is HUGE!\u201d Trunks remarked, gazing up at the behemoth that had entered the room. Trunks was used to looking up at the adults, but never like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d Goten replied, unable to say anything but an agreement to his friend. He was too busy staring up in awe at his titan-sized dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-He sure is a sight,\u201d said Gohan, chuckling nervously as he craned his neck to look up at Goku\u2019s clueless face. The older male then turned his attention to the two younger ones. \u201cWhy are you two so surprised? You saw me like this a few minutes ago. Wasn\u2019t I-?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gohan could finish he was interrupted by the floor shaking under his feet and the loud booming noise of Goku\u2019s footsteps returning. The giant man was on the move again; this time heading right for the shrunken gang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-He\u2019s c-coming t-this w-way!\u201d Trunks shouted, stuttering due to the floor vibrating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Move!\u201d Gohan ordered and the three boys scattered just as a shadow engulfed them. One of Goku\u2019s blue boots hanged overhead and was about to come down on them without mercy. They flew as fast as they could and managed to escape the impact zone just as Goku stepped down, but little Goten was hit by the following wind pressure and sent flying back several feet. \u201cGoten!\u201d Gohan rushed to his little brother\u2019s side and helped him up. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d Goten replied while rubbing his forehead. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was sent flying that easily\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cause you\u2019re so weak, Goten!\u201d Trunks joked as he appeared at Goten\u2019s side. The messy haired boy gave Trunks a glare in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, we need to get dad\u2019s attention before that happens again.\u201d Gohan said before the two kids could start arguing. \u201cOr worse, he finds the shrink ray and shrinks like us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s this?\u201d came Goku\u2019s booming voice. Gohan looked back at his giant father to see him crouching down to pick up the shrink ray. The teenager cursed as Goku picked up the gun and examined it in his hand. \u201cOne of Goten\u2019s toys? Heh, he sure is forgetful sometimes.\u201d Goku chuckled before, to Gohan\u2019s relief, pocketing the shrink ray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww man, it would have been funny if he shrunk himself too.\u201d noted Trunks as he grinned. Gohan ignored him and kept his gazed fixed on his father. Now that he had the shrink ray they had no choice but to get his attention if they wanted to return to normal. However, Goku had already inadvertently showed how dangerous he was to be around and Gohan didn\u2019t want to put the children in any unnecessary danger. Could he get his oblivious dad\u2019s attention by himself, however?</span></div></div>",

Gohan should of known better than assume he was going to follow his directions without complaint. \u201cWhy do we have to stay here and do nothing while you have all the fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to have <i>fun</i>.\u201d replied Gohan as he glared down at the lavender haired boy. \u201cDid you forget how we were almost stepped on like bugs a minute ago? Was that <i>fun</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026\u201d Trunks folded his arms across his chest and looked away. He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but he really thought for a second they were going to be crushed back there\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Unless you want to put yourself in more danger like that you\u2019ll stay here.\u201d The teenager than turned his attention to his brother. \u201cThe same goes for you, Goten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Gohan.\u201d Goten replied easily. He was disappointed that shrinking hadn\u2019t been as fun as he thought it would be, but knew his brother was right about the danger. \u201cBe careful, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sweat!\u201d Gohan smiled as he stared to hover off the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve survived tones of tough battles; there\u2019s no way I\u2019m being done in by my own dad.\u201d Gohan gave the duo a wave before zipping off into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, I guess no one\u2019s here.\u201d Goku said to himself as he glanced around the room one last time. \u201cI suppose Goten dragged him off on some adventure of something.\u201d Goku laughed and started making his way toward the door. Gohan, not wanting his giant father to get to far, increased his speed so he could fly up to Goku\u2019s face faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Over here!\u201d Gohan yelled while he zipped around the left side of Goku\u2019s face. However, he was just too small for his voice to reach Goku\u2019s ears. He continued to yell anyway, but the reaction h got wasn\u2019t what he was hoping. Goku seemed to have noticed the tiny speck near his face since one of his big hands came up to swat it away. Gohan just narrowly managed to avoid the hand as it flew past him. \u201cHey, watch it! It\u2019s me, dad! Gohan!\u201d The tiny teen flew over Goku\u2019s right side and repeated his attempts to get Goku\u2019s help. Again, without even looking at the little pest, Goku swung his hand at it. This time Gohan wasn\u2019t able to dodge completely and got struck by one of his dad\u2019s knuckles. Goku barely felt anything, but Gohan was hit so hard that he was flung halfway across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother!\u201d Goten yelled as he watched his dad swat his shrunken son away. Gohan grunted and managed to stop himself from crashing into anything. He winced in pain and rubbed his chest where the knuckle had hit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, that smarts\u2026\u201d Gohan muttered before glaring back at Goku with annoyance. Before Gohan reached the living room doorway, Gohan shot through the air at sonic speed and stopped right between his giant, hulking father and the exit. Goku once again noticed the \u201cfly\u201d which had stopped fight in front of his face. His huge eyes focused on Gohan and the tiny Saiyan believed he had finally succeeded. \u201cDad! You gotta help; the kids and I were shrunken by that device you found and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SLAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan was cut off when his titanic dad slammed his hands together on him. The two meaty hands came together with a loud SLAP and it appeared as if Gohan vanished between them. From the floor, Trunks\u2019 and Goten\u2019s mouths gaped in shock at this happening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure are a persistent fly,\u201d Goku said to the bug between his palms. \u201cI was trying to give you a chance, but now you leave me no choice. Chi-Chi told me to crush any bugs I find in the house and I really don\u2019t want to disobey her, so\u2026sorry about this.\u201d Goku started to his press his hands together harder, since he could still feel a tiny bit of resistance between his palms. He was completely unaware that it was his son\u2019s struggles as he was desperately pushing against the massive hands to avoid being totally sandwiched between them. The black haired teen had managed to throw up his hands just in the nick of time and was now using every ounce of his strength to keep his dad\u2019s hands from closing completely. As blood vessels popped in his head and arms Gohan knew he couldn\u2019t keep this up for very long. Goku was just far too strong at this size; the giant man was in a totally different league than him now. The only reason he hadn\u2019t been crushed already was because Goku was only using less than one percent of his strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta\u2026get out of here\u2026before it\u2019s too late!\u201d Gohan told himself as he looked around for some way out. All he could see was the sweaty flesh of his dad\u2019s palms all around him. The moment he let go to try and slip out would be the moment he\u2019d die. Things looked bleak; his two muscular arms were already starting to strain. \u201cS-Shit\u2026shit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the floor, Goten and Trunks couldn\u2019t take their eyes off the scene before them. Things had taken a dramatic turn for the worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Goten, at this rate your dad\u2019s\u2026going to mash Gohan into pulp!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-We gotta save him, Trunks!\u201d Goten turned to his older friend; a look of desperation and fear on his face. Tears were already starting to swell up in the boy\u2019s eyes as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know. Just let me think\u2026\u201d Trunks stared up at Goku; his mind racing. If he didn\u2019t think of something in the next few seconds; Gohan was doomed!</span></div></div>",

The teen was finding it harder and harder to breathe within the small, enclosed space between Goku\u2019s palms. To make things worse the heat radiating off of Goku\u2019s sweaty palms was intense; causing his shrunken son to sweat profoundly. Gohan grunted with pain as the space he was in shrank a little; his arms beginning to fail him. It was only a matter of time before Goku succeeded in crushing him into oblivion; Gohan had to do something before then! He had drained too much energy to go Super Saiyan; so there was only one hope left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Dad\u2026s-stop!\u201d Gohan cried as he closed his eyes and focused <i>ki</i> into the hands that were between him and death. In his fatigued state all Gohan could muster was enough <i>ki</i> for two small energy blasts. He prayed that it would be enough to make his dad separate his hands; if just for a second. That\u2019s all he needed to escape. With a shout the demi-Saiyan unleashed two energy blasts from his palms into Goku\u2019s massive ones. At his pathetic size all Gohan could hope for was giving his father a tiny sting; but maybe that would be enough\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Goku question as he raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou biting me? You\u2019ve got a pretty strong bite too; I actually felt that. Still\u2026with a bite that strong you\u2019re way too dangerous to remain in this house. Sorry, but it\u2019s time to end this.\u201d With that said Goku closed his eyes and was silent for a moment. The air around Goku started to twist and grow hotter. Gohan felt it more than anyone; his pupils dilated as realized Goku\u2019s power level was rising dramatically. Fear overtook him at this point and he screamed for his dad to stop. Not able to hear his miniscule son\u2019s pleas; Goku\u2019s eyes shot open and he released a booming shout. The man\u2019s black hair lit up gold and an aura of super hot <i>ki</i> engulfed his form. The unbelievable heat consumed Gohan; but thankfully the young man was only exposed to it for a millisecond. With Goku\u2019s strength multiplying, Gohan didn\u2019t stand a chance. His arms snapped like twigs and in the same moment his body was completely and utterly smashed between Goku\u2019s hands; a visible distortion rippling the space around the hands as they met. \u201cYou were a worthy opponent, bug.\u201d stated Goku as he powered down and rubbed his palms together. What remained of the once all powerful Gohan was smeared across his dad\u2019s muscular hands and became nothing more than a couple tiny red spots. Goku then took his hands and wiped them off on his gi; erasing any evidence of his son from existence. The giant man then continued out of the room; leaving behind two stunned and speechless kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-O-Overkill\u2026\u201d was all Trunks could say after witnessing that. Next to him Goten fell to his knees while his watery eyes stared at his massive father until he disappeared from view. Tears rolled down his cheeks and the younger boy began bawling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGohaaaan!!!\u201d he cried. \u201cT-This can\u2019t be happening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Goten!\u201d Trunks knelt down and placed his hands on his friend\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou can\u2019t break down on me now! We\u2019ve gotta get that shrink ray from your dad and return to normal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s all our fault, Trunks! We never should of shrunk ourselves! G-Gohan told us how dangerous it was, b-but we weren\u2019t listening! N-Now he\u2019s\u2026now he\u2019s\u2026\u201d Goten covered his eyes with his hands and continued to sob. Trunks bit his lip; this really sucked. All he wanted was to have fun and now Gohan was dead and Goten was drowning in despair. He knew they needed to get that shrink ray back\u2026but Goten wasn\u2019t going anywhere in this state. Was there any way to snap Goten out of it? Or would he have to leave him behind and try to get the shrink ray alone?</span></div></div>",

With an annoyed groan Soul woke up and his red eyes fluttered open. He glanced over at the digital clock next to his bed and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, why does Maka have to be so protective?\u201d Soul said to himself as he sat up in his bed and looked down at himself. Yesterday the two of them had been ambushed by a couple witches on their way back from a mission. It was pretty hairy, but both of them escaped unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell\u2026almost unscathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul lifted up his yellow and black jacket and glared at the black symbol decorating his belly. One of the witches had hit him with a spell while in scythe form. While relatively unharmed, it had left him with his odd fly-shaped mark. The moment they got back to Death City Maka had insisted that Soul stay at home while she searched for any info on the spell at Shibusen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnowing her she\u2019ll be in that  library all day.\u201d Soul muttered to himself as he let himself fall back on the bed with his arms laced behind his head (which he turned away from the window). \u201cIf it didn\u2019t do anything then it isn\u2019t going to do anything now.\u201d Soul told himself before going back to sleep a minute later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes passed before Soul was awoken once again. This time it wasn\u2019t because of the sunlight, however, but because of the terrible pain coming from his stomach. Soul shot up and hugged his gut with both arms while his face twisted with pain. It felt like he had suddenly been decked in the stomach by Black Star\u2026using BOTH his fists!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell is this?\u201d Soul grunted as he slowly got out of bed and wobbled out of his bedroom. He made his way toward the bathroom, but something told him he wasn\u2019t going to make it that  far. His vision was getting blurry and it was difficult to walk straight. Soul smacked into the right wall and slid to his knees. The world seemed to melt around him before he lost consciousness and collapsed in the middle of the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul didn\u2019t know how much time had passed before he woke up. As he sat up he held his head and hissed in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026if this is what a hangover feels like I\u2019m never drinking.\u201d Soul joked to himself as he shook the dizziness away and made his way to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026at least he would of if the sight before he hadn\u2019t frozen him in his tracks. Soul\u2019s jaw dropped as he gazed up at the MASSIVE hallway he was in. The doors on either side of him stretched up like skyscrapers; it was unbelievable. Next to him were a couple misplaced books and magazines, but Soul mistook them for buildings! This wasn\u2019t his apartment! This was the apartment\u2026of a giant! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Where the hell am I?\u201d Soul took a few steps backwards. His foot got caught in something and he fell back with a yelp; slamming his back against the hard wooden floor. Soul winced and rubbed his back while he looked down at his foot. His shoe had gotten caught in a hole\u2026and then it dawned on Soul. He knew this hole\u2026it was one of many that dotted his apartment. They were common in such a cheap place like his. But this was impossible; he couldn\u2019t fit his fingernail through those holes yet it looked like he could squeeze both his legs through this one! \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Soul stood up again and took a minute to clear his head. He thought for a moment before lifting his jacket up and noting that the weird mark was gone. \u201cDamn it! That thing must if shrunk me!\u201d Soul cursed as he let his jacket fall back into place before returning his gaze to the giant apartment\u2026HIS giant apartment. \u201cMaka was right. If this had happened out in public\u2026\u201d Soul shuddered at the thought. It was a good thing he was alone. He just had to find a safe place before-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, anyone home?\u201d came another voice out of the blue. Soul\u2019s eyes widened as he heard a door open and close, followed by the sound of someone walking around the apartment. Their footsteps sounded like explosions in the distance to the minuscule Soul. Someone had just invited themselves into his home\u2026and judging by their voice Soul knew exactly who it was!</span></div></div>",

Black Star now really look like the god he always said he would surpass. Judging by how Soul hardly came up to the toe end of Star's enormous shoe in front of him, he must've been quite small indeed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Black Star would get such a power trip from this if he saw himself right now.\" The stunned Soul said as his friend's feet soared over his head as B*S leapt onto the couch, butt first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groaning of the couch springs as soon as his muscular ass made contact with the cushion was like nails on a chalkboard to tiny Soul. He grit his teeth and cried out as he covered his ears. \"Dammit Black Star! Sigh....okay, I need to get his attention....lets hope he doesn't get too full of himself once he sees me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing himself to rush at B*S's shoe and begin the long trek up his best friend's leg, Soul jogged in place and did some warmup exercises. When he was finally ready, he rushed the black and silver shoe only to have it lifted up right before him, he ran right under the couch skidding to a stop before he got too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking out from underneath it, he saw Black Star removing his shoes, obviously making himself quite at home. The shoes were removed, one kicked across the room, the other falling right towards him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!!!\" Soul tried to get away, but he was just in the wrong spot at the wrong time, luckily.....or unluckily, for him, the shoe landed in a way that the opening was right on top of him, he lurched forward and found himself in the upside down toe section of the shoe that Sta wore everyday without socks. \"Oh man! This is so gross, it reeks in here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Black Star sighing in comfort above him as he placed his big sweating feet on the coffee table. \"Maka would kill him if she knew what he was doing right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then....</span></div></div>",

Then the voice of his meister caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul! I\u2019m back!\u201d Maka called as she walked into the living room holding a folder filled with papers in his hand. She promptly froze in place when her eyes fell upon Black Star sitting on the couch; bare feet resting on the coffee table. The blue haired assassin had his eyes closed and arms resting behind his head. He had heard Maka come in, but kept his eyes closed in a relaxed state. Maka\u2019s face slowly twisted with disgust and anger as she squeezed the folder in her hand. \u201cBlack Star! What the hell are you doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo.\u201d Black Star replied simply, giving Maka a casual wave. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up? WHAT\u2019S UP?!\u201d Maka stomped over to Black Star, rolling up the folder in her hands and using it to whack one of the teen\u2019s feet hard. Black Star hissed in pain as he took his feet off the coffee table and rubbed the one that had been whacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?!\u201d Black Star shouted, glaring at the pissed off girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?! Soul needs to rest and I need to go over these documents. The last thing we need is for your DISGUSTING feet to stink up the place. Get out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul\u2019s here?\u201d Black Star asked, surprised. \u201cI thought no one else was here; I\u2019ll go say hi!\u201d Black Star got to his feet, but before he could head towards Soul\u2019s room Maka picked up one of his black shoes (the one Soul wasn\u2019t in) and tossed it at the boy\u2019s face. Black Star caught it with one hand as it came within inches of his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t! You\u2019re gonna put your filthy shoes on and get your ass out of here! NOW!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay! Crazy bitch\u2026\u201d Black Star cursed under his breath as he slipped on the shoe in his hands. He then reached down and turned the upside-down shoe right side up. The tiny Soul screamed as his entire world shifted upside-down. He fell from the top of the toe section to the bottom; groaning as he picked himself up. He noticed light was flooding into the shoe and turned around to watch as the light was quickly blocked by something else. Soul\u2019s eyes dilated and he gaped as he watched Black Star\u2019s huge, sweating foot slip into the shoe and rush toward him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No! Black Star, stop!\u201d Soul cried, but Black Star had no idea there was anything in his shoe. Soul tried to run, but the foot was just too huge and where would he go? Before he could take a second step the foot hit him and forced him deeper into the shoe. Soul pulled the shoe on nice and tight before making his way to the door. Apparently he wasn\u2019t going fast enough since Maka angrily pushed him out the rest of the way. When Black Star turned around to face her she slammed the door in his face. The athletic meister stood there staring at the door for a moment; grinding his teeth together. That girl really got on his nerves sometimes, but he knew Soul would get angry at him of he ever retaliated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Black Star muttered as he laced his muscled arms behind his head and went back the way he came. Meanwhile, inside his right shoe, Soul was still very much alive, but trying to figure out where he was. The albino teen was laying on his stomach; his face pressed against the hot, moist material of Black Star\u2019s insole. On either side of him was a wall of flesh that occasionally shifted. All a round him he could hear and feel booms and with each boom came a jolt of pain in his legs. The ant sized weapon tried to move, but was unable to move an inch. He looked behind him and saw his entire lower half was hidden under Black Star\u2019s foot. It took Soul a few minutes to fully understand his position; mainly because the fumes and constant motion were making him ill. He must be between two of Black Star\u2019s toes with half of him pinned under the foot itself. Each time the titan of a boy took a step his godly weight would come down on Soul\u2019s legs. Luckily the skin between the toes was soft or else Soul\u2019s legs would be paste by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so uncool.\u201d Soul complained, unsticking his face from the bottom of the shoe with a little effort. <br>\r\nHe tried to get his legs free, but it was useless. He would have better luck just pulling them off. There was nothing the shrunken teenager could do but lay there within the hot, smelly confines of Black Star\u2019s shoe until a chance of getting out presented itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder why Soul\u2019s resting\u2026\u201d Black Star wondered to himself as he looked up at the blue sky. \u201cThis sucks; I wanted to hang out with him today! Now what am I gonna do\u2026?\u201d Black Star made his way down the sidewalk; unaware that Soul and he were already \u201changing out\u201d together. </span></div></div>",

Or maybe Tsubaki has bought some food and she\u2019s cooking something delicious. That\u2019d be great. Tsubaki knows how to nourish the person who will become superior to Gods.\u201d The young Meister was talking alone, drooling, as he continues walking down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside his shoe, the white haired weapon could hear muffled sentences with his friend\u2019s intonation without know what he was planning. Each step only made him moan with pain as waves of stench invaded his nose when a bit of air circulated each time Black Star lifted his humongous foot. \u201cDamn! This is not cool crying for help, but this is starting to be even more disgusting! Agh!\u201d Soul felt the pressure of the giant\u2019s whole body against his body again as the perspiration on Black\u2019s feet rose due to the heat and the lack of ventilation. Strands of liquid sweat ran over his face and mixed with his own. The smell in there was unbearable; it was almost impossible to breathe. He only wished to reach some place that made his best friend stop walking to avoid, at least, the pain of the pressure crushing his minuscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running upstairs to reach his house and making Soul endure the worst seconds in his whole life due to the strength used in each step, Black Star reached the door of his house. Under him, he found the doormat, and recalling what Maka said about his feet, he brushed his feet against it. Then, he knocked the door which seemed to be opened. \u201cWhops! It seems I forgot to close the door when I left the house, hehe.\u201d Inside his shoe, the tiny was wriggling in pain under the meaty surface. The wriggle made the blue haired guy think that his toes were itching, so suddenly he started to scrub the sole of his shoe against the doormat trying to get some relief. This made the tiny bug trapped between the foot and the sole of the shoe to scream in pain, feeling the friction of the whole mass of muscle over him falling on every part of his hurt body. After doing this, the young boy smiled and entered the house shouting, \u201cI\u2019m back!!\u201d He walked a little around the place trying to see if Tsubaki was home, but did not discover any clue of her presence. \u201cNow that Tsubaki isn\u2019t around I can do whatever I want!\u201d And saying this, he ran towards the fridge; opening it and finding that it was full of food\u2026 and a note. The energetic kid grabbed it and read it loud: \u201cDon\u2019t touch the food. Tsubaki. Smiling face\u2026\u201d The ninja meister crumpled the little note with his hand and threw it against the floor. He then stomped it violently, luckily for Soul, with the foot without his friend, letting him hear loud booming hits against the floor. \u201cDamn Tsubaki! How dare to do this to me! To the guy who shines even more than the sun! Not fair!\u201d Then the guy calmed down and saw some cans of what looked like soda. \u201cHey! She didn\u2019t say anything about these cans.\u201d The guy said grabbing one and lifting it into the sky and laughed loud and naughtily. Then, without taking care to close the door of the fridge, he ran towards the sofa and jumped over it. He sat on it in with his arms and legs extended. \u201cLet\u2019s have a relaxing time! You agree, right?\u201d Black said to the can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was waiting for an opportunity like this for what seemed like hours to him. Finally, his so active friend stopped for a little while and his world seemed to rise again. In fact, after spending the whole time lying down, now he was in a vertical position. He could see as his friend wriggled his toes inside the shoe and stretched them. That was a good sign. It looked like he was going to remove his shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the sofa, Black Star stretched his whole body and suddenly started to remove his sleeveless shirt; making him bare-chested. He passed the cold can over his pectorals and abdominals feeling a chilling sensation along his whole body. The guy was looking really relaxed as he started to remove one of his shoes, the one containing his little friend, using his other foot as he started to open the can. When he felt his shoe wasn\u2019t encasing his foot he moved his leg violently and sent the shoe flying. He then opened the can; spilling some soda over his belly accidentally. He forgot he had to wait a bit because he ran toward the sofa shaking the can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smelled as the odor inside the shoe started to mix with Black\u2019s house smell. Some light was filtering into the footwear and suddenly an intense shaking sent his foul smelling prison and himself spiraling across the room. Everything started to spin around, but the force of gravity caused him to slip from the shoe before it crashed somewhere. He was falling until he reached\u2026</span></div></div>",

He had no clue where he was going, but knew he was most likely going to end up a stain on Black Star\u2019s floor. The young Weapon braced himself for the inevitable impact, when suddenly\u2026*SPLASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of going splat on some hard surface, Soul had landed in a pool of some kind of cold liquid. It tickled his nose and prickled his skin; upon sitting up in the waist-deep pool Soul confusingly rubbed the back of his head and sniffed his soaked arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Soul pondered as he winced at the pain in the back of his head. The landing hadn\u2019t exactly been soft, but this odd brownish liquid had probably saved him. It was only upon licking his fingers that Soul realized what he was sitting in. \u201cThis is\u2026soda? That kind Black Star likes. Coke or Pepsi or something.\u201d Soul wondered what a pool of the stuff was doing here when suddenly the \u201cground\u201d he was sitting on started to shake. The itty-bitty teen heard some humming behind him and looked behind him to get the sight of his life. Past a landscape of youthful muscles was Black Star\u2019s face; smiling as he sipped from a can of soda. His adam\u2019s apple bobbed as he chugged the soda before gasping for breath and belching loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, this is the life~\u201d the blue haired Meister exclaimed as he rubbed his bare back against the sofa cushion; an action that once again made the \u201cground\u201d tremble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, not cool!\u201d Soul muttered, eyes wide as he realized he was sitting on top of his giant friend. Judging by the view he had of the rest of his friend\u2019s massive torso, Soul estimated he was on his belly. He also just noticed the gaping hole behind him; Black Star\u2019s navel. \u201cThat oaf must of spilt soda on himself and didn\u2019t bother to clean it up.\u201d Soul grumbled to himself and stood up; his shoes still submerged in the pool of soda. What was nothing but an insignificant puddle of soda to Black Star was like a large kiddie pool to Soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s on!\u201d Black Star shouted to himself before snatching up the TV remote on the floor nearby and powering on the television. Soul watched as the shirtless giant aimlessly clicked through the channels\u2019 occasionally sipping from the soda can in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t too bad\u2026\u201d Soul mumbled to himself as he glanced around. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll move for awhile, so it gives me some time to get up there and get him to notice me. \u201c The albino Weapon started to move, but upon taking the third step he suddenly slipped and lost his balance for a moment. He quickly regained his composure and sighed. \u201cDamn, this soda\u2019s really made his abs slippery. If I\u2019m not careful I\u2019ll slip and slide right into\u2026that.\u201d Soul\u2019s crimson eyes glanced at the wide bellybutton behind him. \u201cIf I fall in there I might not get out!\u201d The teenage Shibusen student took a moment to calm himself before slowly making his way through the pool of chilly soda. Unfortunately, upon taking that third step again\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star finally found a channel worth watching and, suddenly, the \u2018ground\u2019 below Soul started rumbling. His foot slipped on the puddle of soda and he fell backwards, his butt landing with a splotch in the brown liquid, soaking his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhahahaha!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star\u2019s laughing voice was booming from above, laughing at the TV. Whatever that blue-haired loudmouth was watching, it was apparently very funny. However, Soul was not all amused by the current situation right now. <br>\r\nHe felt himself slipping further down, and flailed his arms in a desperate attempt to catch hold of something\u2026 anything. His fingers brushed against one of the downy hairs on Black Star\u2019s stomach, and he managed to grab hold of it. He skid over on his stomach and reached out for another hair with his other hand. He kept holding on, his stomach to Black Star\u2019s and his clothes getting soaked by the sugary soda, as the tremors slowly subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving a sigh of relief, Soul looked back. He had slid down precariously close to the wide bellybutton, and a thin trail of soda was slowly flowing down towards it. Just when he was about to pull himself up again and get out of this awkward position, Black Star started laughing again, even louder, and his whole belly shook along with it.<br>\r\nSoul tightened his grip on the hairs as he tried to withstand the tremors of the stomach and avoid slipping down any further. His arms felt like they were at their limit, but he gritted his teeth as he kept struggling to stay where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Black Star was obviously enjoying the show \u2013 some kind of stand-up comedy thing by the sound of it, although Black Star\u2019s boisterous laughing drowned out most of the sound coming from the TV. In fact, he was enjoying the show so much that he started slapping the side of his stomach in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time that Soul really started hating his friend\u2019s animated, overexcited personality, for the vibrations being caused by Black Star\u2019s hand slapping the side of his stomach \u2013 which sounded much like a series of bombardments \u2013 made him bounce up in the air and loose his grip on Black Star\u2019s stomach hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another wet \u2018splotch\u2019 he fell back down into the puddle and bounced along. He tried to get some kind of hold anywhere, but his hands were so thoroughly covered with the fizzy brown liquid that he couldn\u2019t get a grip. And, much to his dismay, he started sliding downwards \u2013 flailing his limbs \u2013 along the trail of soda into Black Star\u2019s bellybutton.<br>\r\nHe fell face forward into the navel, and rubbed his head, trying to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, crap. Not cool, not cool.\u201d<br>\r\nHe looked up at his surroundings, and it was like he had fallen down a deep pit. Some soda was seeping in from above, and although the navel was only about two or three times his height, with his soda-covered state and the slick feel of Black Star\u2019s skin, he doubted he could scale up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArghh\u2026 what\u2019s that smell!?\u201d<br>\r\nA sharp, pungent smell invaded his senses, and when he looked around Soul realized that, from all the gathered lint and dirt he could see, Black Star hadn\u2019t cleaned his bellybutton in a long time. It wasn\u2019t as bad as being under his feet had been, but being gathered here and unable to get out \u2013 much like the bellybutton lint surrounding him \u2013 made him feel all the more insignificant.<br>\r\nAs the soda trickled down and pooled around him, and every now and then his world seemed to shake as Black Star laughed at another joke, Soul pondered on what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul thought about attempting an immediate escape from this damp pit, but he quickly dismissed the idea when another rumbling laugh from Black Star sent him off his feet and face first into a mound of wet navel lint. The albino weapon gagged as he picked himself up and wiped the black filth from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIck, not cool!\u201d Soul exclaimed as he wiped his face with his hands and sat down with a slight \u201csplash\u201d. The small pool of soda on the giant\u2019s stomach was continuing to drip into the navel; forming another pool at the bottom that mixed with he giant\u2019s sweat and bellybutton lint. It was completely repulsive, but Soul had no choice but to sit in it. Trying to climb out now would probably just end in another face full of smelly lint. \u201cNo choice\u2026guess I just have to wait for it to dry.\u201d Soul sighed as he leaned against the slick flesh behind him and tried to ignore the obnoxious laughing coming from outside and the musky smell coming from all around him. Instead he focused on the sounds that were coming from all around him; behind Black Star\u2019s strong stomach muscles were his noisy innards that somehow seemed to soothe Soul. Even as the shrunken pianist sweated in his friend\u2019s body heat and droplets of soda dampened his white hair, he was somehow able to close him crimson eyes and drift off into sleep. Perhaps the fatigue he had collected from almost getting crushed several times in one day had something to do with it\u2026  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul didn\u2019t know how long he slept. It could have been an hour, two hours, or just thirty minutes. When his eyes fluttered open, it wasn\u2019t to the sound of Black Star\u2019s booming laughter, but to another obnoxious sound that he was capable of making: snoring. The television was still blasting nearby, but Soul could clearly hear the sound of his ninja friend\u2019s snoring mixed in with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat muscle head must of fell asleep. He can sure be lazy sometimes\u2026\u201d Soul mumbled to himself as he stood up. As his shoes set down upon the soft bottom of the titan\u2019s bellybutton, the shrunken teen noticed the soda was gone. The smell still lingered in the air and on his clothes, but the liquid had been completely absorbed by the giant\u2019s skin. \u201cAlright, now\u2019s my chance!\u201d Soul craned his neck and looked up through the hole above him. He wanted to get out before the giant started moving again, so he quickly grabbed onto one of the fleshy walls and started climbing. Black Star\u2019s bellybutton wasn\u2019t very deep, so it didn\u2019t take long before he was pulling himself over the edge and back onto his giant buddy\u2019s abs. The unlucky Weapon laid down on the giant Meister\u2019s stomach and breathed in the (relatively) fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad to be out of there\u2026\u201d Soul said to himself between breaths. While still laying down on his back, Soul looked behind him toward Black Star\u2019s upside-down face and saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was your typical, noisy day at the Fairy Tail guild house. Lunch was being served and Natsu Dragneel was busy chowing down on some beef and mashed potatoes. Seated around him were his friends whom he chatted with; usually with a mouthful of grub. All of a sudden\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, big bro!\u201d came a youthful, loud voice. Natsu turned his head just as a young, black haired boy leaped onto the table he was sitting at. The youngster of Macao , Romeo Conbolt,  stood atop the wooden table with his hands on his hips and eyes focused down on Natsu. \u201cBig bro; fight me!\u201d Romeo exclaimed, pointing a finger at the rosy haired Dragon Slayer. The demand shocked almost everyone in the guild; even Natsu just blinked at him. In seconds, however, that blank stare turned into a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright!\u201d Natsu replied, putting on his usual \u201cI\u2019m getting fired up!\u201d look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Natsu-!\u201d Lucy tried to stop him, but Natsu had already gotten out of his seat. A similar grin decorated Romeo\u2019s face as he leaped down from the table and faced the older teen. Natsu just folded his arms over his muscular chest and watched to see what the boy would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna give it my all, big bro, so watch out!\u201d Romeo announced before wrapping his right fist in a bright, purple flame. The young Fairy Tail mage cried out as he charged at Natsu; rearing the fist back and plunging it right into Natsu\u2019s stomach. Romeo\u2019s smile twitched as he tried to ignore the pain in his knuckles, but the smile went away completely when he heard the older fire mage laugh above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome! I won\u2019t hold back either!\u201d Natsu replied, unfazed by Romeo\u2019s punch. The smaller male could only watch frighteningly as Natsu wrapped his own fist in a blazing red flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Romeo was sent hurtling into another (thankfully empty) table. The wooden table snapped in half by the impact; leaving Romeo twitching on the broken planks. His cheek was swollen and some blood trickled down his chin. Natsu shouted in victory as he pumped his fist into the air. It was short lived, however, as a certain red haired woman grabbed him by the ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, Natsu?!\u201d Erza asked, tugging on the pink haired teen\u2019s ear. \u201cRomeo\u2019s just a kid; don\u2019t use your full strength!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw ow ow ow! What\u2019s the problem, Erza?! He was the one who asked for a fight, plus Gildarts never went easy on me when I was his age!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill\u2026\u201d the female knight grumbled, knowing Natsu was right. \u201cAlright then, what about the table?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-The table?\u201d Natsu looked at the broken piece of furniture before chuckling nervously. \u201cAh\u2026well\u2026you see\u2026\u201d Before Natsu could come up with an excuse he was already being dragged away by Erza; screaming the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRomeo, are you okay?!\u201d came Macao\u2019s voice as the older, blue haired man ran over to his son. Romeo grunted as he sat up and rubbed his puffy, slightly burnt cheek. It was a miracle he hadn\u2019t lost any teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, dad.\u201d replied the black haired teen as he wiped away the blood that was coming from his lip. \u201cBig bro is really strong, but one day I\u2019ll definitely pay him back for that. Tenfold!\" Macao stared at his son for a moment before smiling at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t appreciate someone slugging my son like that.\u201d Macao stated as he helped Romeo to his feet. \u201cWhat do you say we pay him back now instead of later?\u201d Macro smirked while Romeo was left staring at his father and wondering what his plan was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwhile later, Natsu was alone in the Fairy Tail storage room. And busy stacking what seemed like an endless amount of wooden crates and boxes. The Salamander groaned to himself as he realized how much more he still had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, this is going to take me all day!\u201d Natsu complained as he ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m being punished for breaking one little table. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time either\u2026I wonder if I can sneak out the back.\u201d Before Natsu could think about this a little more he heard someone enter the storage room. He turned around to set eyes upon Romeo again, who looked good for someone who had just been sent flying into a table. The swelling in his cheek had also all but vanished; this was most likely Wendy\u2019s doing. What Natsu noticed the most, however, was the strange ball of gray flames in the boy\u2019s palm. \u201cHey, Romeo, what are you doing here? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re angry about the beating I gave you\u2026or do you want a rematch already?\u201d Natsu chuckled and crackled his knuckles; he was always raring to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Huh? Oh, no! I came to\u2026reward you for defeating me.\u201d Romeo offered the gray fireball to Natsu. \u201cThis is a really special flame I made just for you, big bro! It\u2019s meant for you too eat; it tastes really sweet!\u201d Romeo explained, mentally chuckling in his mind. If his father was right, this flame would drastically weaken Natsu both in strength and magical power once it was consumed. Then he would have a much better chance at defeating him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Heh, you didn\u2019t have to do this, Romeo. Beating you wasn\u2019t that much trouble\u2026\u201d replied Natsu as he transferred the gray flame from Romeo\u2019s hand to his own. He was a little suspicious of the flame, but a quick sniff revealed it didn\u2019t stink to high heavens like his Yellow Fire, which was enough for Natsu to assume it was safe. \u201cOh well, itadakimasu!\u201d Natsu opened his maw and sucked in the gray flame. Romeo watched Natsu\u2019s cheeks fill up before he \u201cchewed\u201d the flame and swallowed. \u201cHey, what\u2019s the big idea? That didn\u2019t taste sweet at all! If anything it makes me feel kind of funny\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, success!\u201d shouted the younger male before moving into a battle stance. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for some payback, big bro!\u201d Romeo grinned and lit both of fists up with purplish flames. Natsu just raised an eyebrow and watched Romeo punch him in the gut once again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026which, once again, didn\u2019t make the Dragon Slayer budge an inch. Romeo instantly backed up and rubbed his sore knuckles. \u201cI-I don\u2019t understand! That should of hurt you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Natsu looked at Romeo with a confused stare before quickly grinning at him. \u201cOh I see\u2026that flame was supposed to cripple me somehow, right? Haha, looks like I need to teach you there\u2019s only one kind of flame that matters!\u201d Natsu clenched his own fist, which burst into a raging flame. Romeo\u2019s face went pale as he watched the older Fairy Tail mage rear his fist back again. He squeezed his eyes shut and prepared himself for the pain\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several seconds for Romeo to realize something was off. He hadn\u2019t been punched through the door yet and he couldn\u2019t even sense Natsu\u2019s presence in front of him anymore. Sure enough, Romeo opened his eyes to see that Natsu was gone. He glanced around to make sure he wasn\u2019t planning a sneak attack, but the Dragon Slayer was no where to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026hell happened?!\u201d Natsu exclaimed as he craned his neck all the way back just to look at Romeo\u2019s face far, far above him. Just seconds ago the weaker flame mage had only stood below his chest, but now he towered over him like some kind of young god! Judging by the boy\u2019s titanic, brown boot directly in front of him, Natsu guessed he wasn\u2019t even an inch in comparison to the giant of a kid. He was mere millimeters! \u201cHey! Hey, Romeo! What the hell did you do to me?!\u201d Natsu screamed up at the junior guild member, but Romeo wasn\u2019t even looking down at him. In fact, the boy seemed just as confused as he was. It would seem Romeo hadn\u2019t planned on this happening, but that didn\u2019t quell Natsu\u2019s rage in the slightest. Needless to say, the mighty Salamander was NOT happy about being shrunken to the size of a mere speck. </span></div></div>",

Look at me when I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d Natsu shouted up at the titan of a boy; clearly pissed off as he waved his fists up at the young teen and blew fire from his mouth. Like before, Romeo gave no indication he noticed Natsu\u2019s efforts in the slightest. The Dragon Slayer\u2019s voice simply couldn\u2019t reach his ears so high above. Instead of trying a third time, Natsu moved onto the only other solution he knew: violence. The young fire mage gave his usual battle cry before charging at Romeo\u2019s left boot; both of his fists igniting behind him. Once he reached the brown wall that was Romeo\u2019s foot, he delivered a devastating, explosive punch to it. The strength behind it was enough to take out your average wizard, but the giant didn\u2019t even flinch. While Natsu had barely felt anything from Romeo\u2019s punches, Romeo hadn\u2019t felt a thing from Natsu\u2019s. Getting further agitated, the pink haired Salamander unleashed a barrage of those mighty punches, each one as powerful as the last. When mere punches didn\u2019t seem to have any effect, Natsu resorted to more powerful attacks\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire Dragon\u2019s Claw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire Dragon\u2019s Iron Fist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire Dragon\u2019s Wing Attack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu preformed three of his signature moves in quick secession before stepping back for a breather. Even after all of those powerful blows, the towering Romeo still saw no reason to look down. In addition, the fiery attacks had barely made a scorch mark on the front of the boy\u2019s boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn you, Romeo!\u201d Natsu cursed, gritting his sharp teeth. \u201cIf attacking from here is useless, then\u2026\u201d The Dragon Slayer once again charged at the boot, but this time he leaped up mid-run. Even with his superhuman jumping capabilities, Natsu wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the top of Romeo\u2019s boot with them alone. The boy\u2019s foot was just too massive in size. To make up for the distance, Natsu used his fire magic and create thrusters on the bottom of his feet that rocketed him up further. With this he easily made it to the top of the boot where he landed with an \u201coof\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuccess!\u201d Natsu exclaimed, but his victory was short lived as he was suddenly knocked off his feet. Romeo had decided he had enough of standing around in an empty room and started making his way out. Natsu laid on his stomach and gripped onto the rough material of Romero\u2019s boot with both hands. What was simple walking on Romeo\u2019s part was like the moving of Earthland on Natsu\u2019s. If he didn\u2019t hold on he would probably roll off from the boy\u2019s constant motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrrr! Stand still so I can hit you some more!\u201d Natsu shouted in frustration as he raised a flaming fist above his head. Before he could slam it down, however, something came over the rosy haired teen. His gut felt like it was doing the tango and his face suddenly turned a sickish green. The hand instead covered Natsu\u2019s mouth as he groaned horribly. \u201cN-No way\u2026I\u2019m being carried on top of his boot. This is\u2026transportation!\u201d Natsu gripped onto the top of the boot with both hands as he buried his sickly face into the slightly musky material of Romeo\u2019s footwear. His cheeks seemed to inflate like balloons and he could feel the need to puke coming on. He was completely helpless. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cRomeo, where are you off to?\u201d Macao asked his son as the boy started heading out the guild\u2019s front entrance. He looked pretty down, which surprised the blue haired elder. Had that flame he\u2019d given Romeo not worked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna head home for a bit.\u201d Romeo answered his father without turning to look at him. After being humiliated by Natsu in in front of the whole guild and possibly allowing him to escape his punishment, Romeo decided it may be wise to take some time away from the guild. As the spiky haired wizard made his way down the dirt path to Magnolia Town, he was oblivious to the pint-sized passenger that clung to his boot. Natsu was watching through sickly eyes as the world around him sped by as Romeo walked. The giant teenager was going at a normal pace, but Natsu felt like he was moving faster than ever before. The booming quakes that came with each footstep rang in Natsu\u2019s ears and shook his very being. The shrunken Salamander felt the contents of his stomach toss around like a blender and his face turned a darker green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUghhh, I\u2019m gonna hurl!\u201d Natsu exclaimed as he gripped onto the boot\u2019s material harder and forced his face into the brownish footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, Romeo arrived inside his bedroom. The young fire mage stood in front of his door with is hands on his hips and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like shit.\u201d Romeo said to himself as he scratched he back of his neck. He had made such a fool of himself in front of Natsu not once, but twice. The older mage probably thought he was nothing but a nuisance now. He just wanted to collapse on his bed and sleep. As Romeo made his way toward his bed, the mini-Natsu on his boot had reached his limit. He was just too weak to hang on anymore. When next the giant kid lifted his foot to take a step; Natsu\u2019s tiny form slid off the brown boot and fell to the wooden floor below. It was a long drop and any normal person would have been a broken mess upon landing, but Natsu was thankfully much more durable and got away with only a few bruises. Moments after his body hit the floor, Romeo\u2019s massive foot followed and slammed down nearby. The loud thoom so close to Natsu rendered the smaller male temporarily deaf and he covered his ears in pain. A few more thooms later and Romeo was on the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u2026well, that wasn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Natsu said to himself as he sat up and rubbed his throbbing head. Now that he was no longer on Romeo, he was starting to feel a lot better. \u201cI only vomited five times!\u201d The rosy haired male got to his feet and took a glance around Romeo\u2019s room. It looked like the room of your average young boy, but many posters of Fairy Tail decorated the walls. There were even a few of him. When Natsu turned back to Romeo, he saw the younger boy standing by his bed. Despite only taking a few steps away from Natsu, the titan seemed to be miles away now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026ya know, there\u2019s nothing like some healthy exercise to beat depression!\u201d Romeo exclaimed to himself, grinning and pumping his fists into the air. Natsu watched from the floor below as the giant boy began untying his orange scarf and light-colored sash. When both were folded on the ground nearby Romeo slipped off his long jacket; leaving him in just his brown boots and green pants. Natsu was still shocked to see how much Romeo had grown in his seven-year absence. No longer was he the scrawny kid he used to know; he was now very fit for his age. The training the boy put himself through to obtain his current physique must have been hard on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I doing?!\u201d Natsu asked himself as he slapped his cheeks. This was no time to be admiring Romeo\u2019s progress; he had to get the boy\u2019s attention and get back to normal! Plus, he still hadn\u2019t forgiven the brat for putting him in this jam in the first place! As the angry, fully recovered, Dragon Slayer dashed toward the bare chested behemoth, Romeo began his exercising\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Natsu ran across the seemingly endless landscape of Romeo\u2019s room he heard a series of booms in the distance. The young titan was lowering himself to the floor and getting into a prone position. Once ready, Romeo started to do push ups; raising and lowering his fit body off the floor at a quick pace. Natsu didn\u2019t think much of this at first; he was too busy trying to reach the giant before he moved again. Natsu ran as fast as he could (which was pretty darn fast), but Romeo seemed to remain miles away no matter the distance he covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaaaarrhh!! This sucks!\u201d Natsu growled in frustration as he pumped his leg muscles as much as he could. He hated being so small; so insignificant and weak. The Dragon Slayer continued to roar in anger and frustration the entire time he ran. By the time Natsu finally reached the mountainous boy he was already past three hundred push-ups. His body was just now starting to sweat; salty dew forming on his face and torso. He wasn\u2019t the only one sweating; Natsu was forced to take a breather after running what seemed like the length of a couple cities. \u201cF-Finally made it.\u201d Natsu mumbled as he wiped off his sweating face and looked up at the godly mage before him. \u201cAlright\u2026this is good. With his torso so close like this I have a better shot at getting his attention.\u201d The flame mage grinned toothily and lit one of his fists ablaze. \u201cGet ready to really feel the burn, Romeo!\u201d Natsu exclaimed as he ran directly underneath the exercising behemoth. While the heaving chest of the titan came close to the floor each time he lowered; it didn\u2019t touch it and thus allowed plenty of room for the minuscule Natsu to move around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was underneath Romeo\u2019s midsection Natsu got to work. The rosy haired mage formed a large fireball in his hand and threw it up at the giant. The tiny speck of fire slightly illuminated the shadowed space under Romeo\u2026but that\u2019s all it did. Natsu\u2019s flames never made it to Romeo\u2019s skin; the fireball was extinguished via the thin layer of sweat that had formed across his body. Natsu wasn\u2019t aware of this, however, and lobbed a few more at random places. Each one was as ineffective as the last; snuffed out by the younger boy\u2019s perspiration. Natsu\u2019s aggravation grew with each failed attempt, but he refused to give up. As Natsu tossed fireball after fireball at Romeo\u2019s abs and pectorals, Romeo was unintentionally fighting back. As the boy reached four hundred push-ups his body sweated ever more; droplets of that sweat fell from his skin and hit the wooden floor below. To Natsu these mere drops of fluid were like bombs; exploding on impact and splashing the area with a hot wetness. Natsu leaped to dodge these explosions; but a few times he wasn\u2019t quick enough and got doused. Soon Natsu\u2019s pink hair had turned damp and flat and his clothes were so soaked they clung to his own muscled torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had it!\u201d cried Natsu as he got to his feet after being drenched in another helping of Romeo\u2019s fragrant body fluid. The shrunken wizard glared up at Romeo\u2019s torso and clenched his fists. \u201cFire Dragon\u2019s\u2026\u201d Natsu\u2019s cheeks started to inflate as he filled them with fire. He pointed his mouth straight up and then\u2026\u201dROAR!!\u201d Natsu opened his maw and released a massive beam of scorching flames into the air. In actuality; the beam was terribly thin compared to Romeo\u2019s size, but it was still powerful enough to make it past the teen\u2019s \u201cbarrier\u201d of sweat. As powerful as the attack was, however, it left not but a mark on Romeo\u2019s young figure. The only reaction the titan had was a quick scratch to the area Natsu had hit; Romeo hadn\u2019t even paused in his exercising. Once again Natsu roared in anger as he fell to his knees and slammed his fists against the hard floor. \u201cNothing\u2019s working! None of my attacks even register with him!\u201d The older teen knew he had even stronger spells in his arsenal, but the truth of the matter was he was low on magical power. He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but perhaps the best thing to do now was find a place to hide and wait for\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by a strange sound in the air. The tiny wizard gazed up at Romeo\u2019s face and noticed the young teenager was breathing much louder. His push-ups were also getting significantly slower. At that precise moment Natsu\u2019s eyes widened in horror and he finally realized the danger he was in at this puny size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap! Crap crap crap!!\u201d Natsu, completely forgetting his fatigue, stood up and raced in a random direction. He needed to get out of the shadow Romeo was casting NOW. Unfortunately, the Fire Dragon Slayer was much too late. He simply wasn\u2019t covering enough ground no matter how hard he pushed himself. The humongous Romeo lifted himself off the ground one more time before reaching his limit. His toned arms stopped supporting him and he let his body collapse to the ground. Natsu, no where near safety, looked up just in time to see Romeo\u2019s _____ falling upon him.</span></div></div>",

One moment Romeo\u2019s chest hanged above him at a safe distance, the next it was descending upon him without mercy. It was like an entire mountain was being dropped on him; a living, breathing mountain of youthful muscle. As the area around Natsu darkened all he could see was the smooth, perfect skin of Romeo\u2019s chest and the moisture that leaked from the countless pores. He could smell the younger male\u2019s B.O. all around him. He could feel the body heat of the mage as he closed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRo-\u201d Natsu attempted to say something, but barely had time to utter the first syllable of Romeo\u2019s name. The wall of muscle that was one of Romeo\u2019s pecs touched Natsu\u2019s lips\u2026and that was the last thing he tasted. Romeo\u2019s form hit the floor with all of its heavy power and the Dragon Slayer known as Natsu Dragneel simply popped. Romeo felt nothing out of the ordinary; did not feel the body of his hero get obliterated underneath him. For a minute Romeo just laid on the floor; panting for air and resting with a smile on his boyish face. Eventually he picked himself off the ground, but only wobbled backwards before collapsing onto his bed. The black haired fire mage laid there with his arms laced behind his head; his sweaty, chiseled chest lifting and falling with each big breath. Soon he started to calm down and is eyelids closed; welcoming sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second!\u201d Romeo\u2019s eyes flew open without warning and his face displayed an expression of annoyance. \u201cI\u2019ll never get as big and strong as big bro if I just rest all the time!\u201d With that said, the young Conbolt ignored his screaming muscles and instantly started on some sit-ups. His body ached and begged for rest, but Romeo would have none of that. He wanted to get stronger and stronger until he could prove to Natsu he was a capable wizard! As the boy worked his abdominals, his body sweated even more from the workout. One of the many droplets of perspiration that decorated his left pec slid over a tiny red dot; effectively washing it away. Any evidence of the mighty Salamander had now disappeared without a trace. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natsu Dragneel walked into his house with a big, toothily grin on his face. The Fire Dragon Slayer was just coming from the Fairy Tail Building after getting into another fight with his rival, Gray Fullbuster. This fight, however, had a very satisfying conclusion. Whether it was a lucky shot or the ice mage was having a bad day, Natsu had succeeded in delivering a devastating uppercut that launched Gray into the ceiling of the building. The smug Natsu then walked out; leaving Gray with his head stuck in the roof and the rest of the guild laughing hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, that perverted stripper deserved it!\u201d Natsu said to himself as he slammed his fist into his palm. \u201cAfter a victory like that I think I deserve some relaxation! The rosy haired teen walked away from his front door and was about slump onto one of the nearby couches when he heard a pounding on his door. Startled, Natsu looked back at the wooden door as someone banged on it again. \u201cGeez, who could that be? Can\u2019t a Dragon Slayer just relax?\u201d Natsu grumbled as he made his way back to the door and opened it while saying, \u201cYeah? What do you-?\u201d However, he could not finish the sentence, seeing as it\u2019s quite difficult to speak when an ice-coated fist is buried into your mouth. The blow sent Natsu flying backwards; his body soaring over his rectangular table and landing with a \u201cthump\u201d on one of the sofas. The force of the impact almost tipped the couch backwards. \u201cThe hell?!\u201d Natsu covered his aching mouth with his hands and glared back at the person who had punched him. The black-haired, muscular form of Gray stepped into Natsu\u2019s house. He stared at Natsu with the most hateful of looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatsuuuu!\u201d Gray growled, cracking his knuckles and causing the ice that coated one fist to crumble. \u201cDid you think we\u2019re finished? Did you think you could just walk away?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Natsu responded; removing his hands from his mouth. A normal person would of lost most of their teeth after a hit like that; but Natsu was made of sturdier stuff. \u201cI beat you fair and square. Do you want me to kick your ass here in my house too?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a lucky punch,\u201d replied the shirtless wizard as cold air started to swirl around his fists. \u201cbut when I turn you into an ice sculpture and stash you in your own fridge; that WON\u2019T be luck!\u201d Upon giving Natsu his threat the Ice-Make Mage charged toward is fellow Fairy Tail wizard. Natsu, upon instinct, lit his fists aflame and was about to kick his table toward the incoming Gray when a light bulb lit up in his head. The two of them were alone in the privacy of his home; no other guild members to interfere with them. This was the perfect chance for Natsu to try out a new magic he had been practicing all month. A magic the Master would surely punish him for using on a fellow guild mate\u2026if he knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, too bad for you, Gray.\u201d Natsu spoke as the flames around his fists went out and he stretched out a hand toward Gray.  \u201cYou just made things a whole lot worse for yourself!\u201d The Dragon Slayer coiled his hand into a fist and a white magic seal formed at the tip of his knuckles. \u201cReduction Magic!\u201d A moment later the stampeding Gray was consumed in a cloud of white smoke. When the cloud dissipated a second later, Gray was gone. Natsu\u2019s toothily grin returned as he hopped off the couch and stomped over to where Gray had been. As he approached where Gray once was the pink haired male\u2019s grin slowly vanished. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?!\u201d Natsu looked down at the floor, but saw no signs of a shrunken Gray. The spell should of reduced Gray to a miniature size like it did the objects and animals Natsu had practiced on, but instead Gray was simply\u2026gone. He tried to sniff the air to catch a hint of Gray\u2019s scent, but to no avail. \u201cStupid piece of shit magic! It wasn\u2019t supposed to teleport him somewhere!\u201d Natsu angrily clenched his teeth before sighing with disappointment and turning around. \u201cOh well\u2026maybe if I\u2019m lucky I sent him halfway across the world. Then he wouldn\u2019t be around here for awhile, hehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Seconds before~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray was rushing toward the seated Natsu when he noticed the scarf-wearing teen make a strange magic seal he had never seen before. He was surprised to see Natsu use another magic besides Fire Magic, but was even more surprised when his vision was overtaken by a screen of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, a smokescreen? What an amateur magic!\u201d Gray shouted before he emerged from the smoke cloud. As he did he immediately noticed two things were off. First, his feet were no long touching the floor. In fact he was what seemed to be miles above the ground as if he had just ran off a cliff. Second, the Natsu that sat before him was no longer the Natsu he knew. He was now soaring toward a massive, titanic version of the flame eater! \u201cWhat the-?!\u201d Before he could end his sentence the tiny Gray smacked right into Natsu\u2019s bare chest. It felt as if he had hit a wall of solid iron, however. \u201cH-How\u2026?\u201d Gray mumbled as his shrunken form slipped off of the giant\u2019s chiseled chest. Before he fell too far Gray reached out and grabbed onto Natsu\u2019s black waistcoat. The tiny wizard was now hanging from Natsu\u2019s clothes as the bigger teen moved. The rosy haired mage had no idea Gray was there; not expecting the Ice-Make Mage to shrink so small. He expected Gray to shrink to around six inches like everything else he used the spell on, but instead Gray shrunk to mere millimeters in height! He was now just a tiny speck barely noticeable on Natsu\u2019s torso. \u201cThis\u2026this is not good.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As he recalled, the fight between Gray and him broke out just before he was going to sit down to have some grub. He hadn\u2019t eaten anything since breakfast and he was starving! \u201cAlright, lunchtime!\u201d Natsu marched over to the \u201ckitchen\u201d, a small corner of his house that was decorated with several kitchen supplies. The Fairy Tail mage approached his small refrigerator and took a peek inside. As he was doing this, the tiny shrunken Gray was busy scaling up Natsu\u2019s black waistcoat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this happened,\u201d Gray whispered under his breath as he grabbed handful after handful of the thick black material that made up Natsu\u2019s clothing. \u201cWhat was that fool thinking using such a dangerous magic?!\u201d Gray took a deep breath and tried not to let himself panic. Sure, Natsu had shrunken him to a pathetically small size and humiliated him even more. Sure, Natsu was oblivious to him and could probably crush him without even realizing it. However, Gray was not a quitter! He would not let himself be overcome with fear and hopelessness. His chances may be small, but if Gray could just get the giant hot head\u2019s notice then maybe he could get back to normal. It was far more likely Natsu would take advantage of the situation and do terrible, TERRIBLE things to him, but at least he wouldn\u2019t purposely kill him. Without knowing he was there, however, was a completely different story\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d Natsu began fishing through the clustered fridge looking for something to eat. \u201cSpoiled milk, rotten vegetables, fish bones, fish bones, fish bones\u2026\u201d Natsu sighed, thinking he wasn\u2019t going to find anything. He would have to head back to town for lunch. Right before he was about to close the fridge, the pink haired teenager noticed a plate wrapped up with plastic. Natsu took out the plate and pulled back the plastic to reveal a mound of spaghetti. Natsu gazed at the pasta hungrily as some drool trickled down his lips. \u201cThis is\u2026!\u201d It was some of the spaghetti Lucy had brought over yesterday! She must of put the leftovers in the refrigerator after Happy and him got full. \u201cThis is perfect!\u201d Natsu closed the fridge and carried the plate of spaghetti toward the sofas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the physically fit Gray was making great progress in his climb up the fire spitting titan. Without being able to put his hands together, Gray was unable to use Ice-Make Magic, but that hadn\u2019t stopped the shrunken teen. He had made it to Natsu\u2019s scarf and was quickly making his way up the white, checkered piece of cloth. Soon he reached the end and threw himself on top of the thick, white scarf. Gray was so tiny that he could rest his entire body on the rim of the scarf as if was a solid floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026climbing a frickin mountain.\u201d the exhausted Grey groaned. As he rested he watched the world go by as the titan he was riding walked on over to the middle of his home. Soon he came to a stop when he seated himself on one of the couches; the same couch Gray had knocked him into minutes before. The barechested ice wizard glanced over at Natsu\u2019s massive, boyish face next to him as the giant looked down at something in his hands. Gray, however, could not see what it was from here. \u201cGoddammit, Natsu. Look over here!\u201d Gray cursed as he got to his feet and peeked inside the scarf where Natsu\u2019s neck was. Preparing himself, Gray leapt toward Natsu\u2019s normally hidden neck and placed his hands together in midair. \u201cIce-Make: Battle Axe!\u201d A solid axe of ice appeared in Gray\u2019s hands as he descended toward Natsu\u2019s neck. When he was close enough the ice mage swung the axe down upon the giant\u2019s flesh. The axe, which was smaller than a toothpick, shattered instantly upon connecting with Natsu\u2019s skin. As the thousands of ice particles fell around Gray, the gnat-sized mage touched down on Natsu\u2019s smooth neck and waited to see if their was any reaction.</span></div></div>",

Surely the giant must of felt SOMETHING from his attack. He did not have to wait very long. Without the expression on his face changing a bit; Natsu reached a hand behind his scarf. Gray gaped in amazement as Natsu\u2019s huge, god-like hand came into view. Each one of muscular, manly fingers was as thick as a tree trunk. Gray couldn\u2019t help but feel a little intimidated as he imagined what one wrong move from one of those digits could do to him. Thinking Natsu was reaching for him, Gray didn\u2019t move a muscle. By the time he realized Natsu still didn\u2019t have a clue he was there it was too late. Natsu\u2019s fingers touched his neck and he began to scratch. One of those giant fingers caught Gray underneath it; pinning the bug-sized wizard between it and Natsu\u2019s neck. Gray grunted in pain as the digit rubbed him over Natsu\u2019s slightly moist skin; threatening to pop him like a tiny berry. Thankfully Natsu itched for only a second before his hand retreated back to its original spot. Gray, however, remained stuck to the finger pad via the perspiration that coated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fuck!\u201d Gray swore, struggling to free himself from Natsu\u2019s finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is gonna hit the spot!\u201d Natsu announced to the empty house before placing the plate of pasta on the wooden table in front of him. The fire mage then hovered a hand over the spaghetti; fingers spread wide. At this precise moment Gray peeled off of Natsu\u2019s fingertip and fell into the plate of pasta. The half-naked teen coughed as he picked himself up after the soft landing; his face and torso covered in red sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Gray pondered as he stood up at the peak of the pasta mound. He ran his tongue over his lips to taste the red stuff he was covered in. \u201c\u2026marinara sauce? But that must mean\u2026\u201d Gray\u2019s blue eyes widened in horror and he looked back down at what he was standing on. Noodles\u2026he was standing on a mountain of noodles! Now Gray started to get scared, but things were only beginning to go downhill. The shrunken Fairy Tail wizard noticed the air around him start to twist and the heat level slowly rise. The frozen, hardened sauce covering the spaghetti began to soften and bubble a bit. The thick noodles themselves softened under Gray\u2019s feet as they grew warmer and warmer. Gray, puzzled, craned his neck and looked up. The titan that was Natsu was holding his palm out over the pasta; his hand lit by a raging flame. Natsu was directing heat down onto the pasta; heating it up! \u201cN-No! Natsu, stop!\u201d Gray called, but there was no way Natsu was going to hear his voice. The heat rose and rose as Gray started sweating profoundly. He tried to move through the pasta mound; but his feet sank deeper into the spaghetti and there was just too much of it. Gray couldn\u2019t even see the end of the pasta; it was like a valley of red sauce and spaghetti to him. The extreme heat started taking its toll on Gray as he collapsed to his knees and his mouth went dry. All around him the pasta was popping and sizzling under the heat the fire giant was giving it. The mini-mage weakly put his fist into his palm and attempted to use Ice-Make Magic. \u201cI-Ice-Make\u2026\u201d It was hopeless; the ice particles around his hands quickly melted and evaporated into steam. His magic was useless in this heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Natsu\u2026y-you, idiot\u2026\u201d Gray fell onto his stomach; wincing as the bubbling hot marinara sauce singed his skin. It was so hot that his sweat started to evaporate off his reddening skin. Gray could just lay there and whimper under the fearsome heat while waiting for his blood to boil. Before that could happen, Natsu retracted his hand and the heat stopped increasing. Still, Gray was too weak to move a muscle and simply rested there in the warm noodles; thick steam all around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, looks delicious!\u201d Natsu licked his lips hungrily as he took out a fork he had also brought along. Using the fork the giant rose head began stirring the spaghetti and sauce around. He did not notice the little Gray in his food as his body was swept underneath the pasta and buried under several tons of spaghetti and several gallons of red tomato sauce. \u201cTime to eat!\u201d exclaimed Natsu as he twirled the fork and spun himself a large ball of red smeared spaghetti. He then brought the ball of pasta to his mouth, opened wide, and slurped all of it right off the fork. The Dragon Slayer made content sounds as he chewed loudly a few times (much less than normally needed) and swallowed his first bite down. It formed a thick lump in his throat that traveled down the inside before disappearing into his toned chest. \u201cAhhhh, it tastes great!\u201d Natsu grinned happily and went for another bite; unaware of the little extra addition to his meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hungry Dragon Slayer consumed forkful after forkful of the delicious pasta; each one masticated only barely before being sent down the teen\u2019s gullet. Not once did Natsu come close to choking; his powerful inner muscles did their job well and made sure each mouthful was carried down to where it belonged. As he ate, Natsu didn\u2019t know that a certain rival of his was fighting for his life within the mound of pasta in front of him. Gray, able to hear what Natsu was doing far above him, crawled for his life to escape the mess he had gotten into. In his disoriented and weakened state, however, Gray was not doing a very good job at escaping his fate. Within the maze of marinara sauce and thick strings of spaghetti Gray could not tell that he was merely crawling around in circles. Nor did he know that his erratic movements were saving him from certain doom. Several times Natsu had rolled up a ball of pasta made from an area Gray had just been in. Luck seemed to be on Gray\u2019s side, but that luck was about to run out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, so full.\u201d moaned the teenage mage as he laid back on his sofa and gave his firm abs a few pats. His black eyes glanced down at the plate on the table and he saw one small heap of pasta left. Natsu stared at the remaining food for a moment before smirking. \u201cI guess one more bite won\u2019t hurt.\u201d The wizard sat back up, aimed his fork at the last of his lunch, and brought it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside that heap of pasta was Gray; still digging through noodles and sauce for a glimpse at freedom. No matter how many strings of spaghetti he seemed to push aside there would always be more behind them. Gray started to think he\u2019d never get out; he didn\u2019t hear Natsu\u2019s loud chewing and swallowing outside either. Would he be lost in this maze of pasta for as long as it took Natsu to throw it into the trash? Was that his ultimate fate? Soon after thinking this, Gray pushed himself past some more noodles and saw a glimpse of the outside world. Desperately he clawed his way toward it and pulled half his body out into the open. Despite his body screaming at him for a rest, a smile formed on Gray\u2019s face. He had made it out; he wasn\u2019t going to end up a meal for that fire breathing iguana! All he had to do was pull the rest of himself out and then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could advance any further, Gray\u2019s luck went dry. Natsu plunged the fork into the last heap of pasta on his plate and spun it around. The noodles tangled around Gray\u2019s lower half started to move and he was pulled with them. He gave a panicked scream as his speck-sized body was yanked away from freedom and firmly held between the noodles that closed in around him. Once Natsu had spun up his last ball of spaghetti he raised it up from the plate and held it in front of his huge face. He eyed the last of the pasta and ran his tongue over his lips once more. He didn\u2019t see Gray on the outside of the ball; held in place by several noodles not much smaller than himself. Gray, however, saw him. He saw Natsu\u2019s youthful face as it looked at him hungrily and he saw as his huge lips parted to reveal his saliva drenched maw. Gray stared into the dark cavern of Natsu\u2019s mouth and fruitlessly pulled at the spaghetti that bound him to the fork. A look of unspeakable horror was glued to his face as the fork sped toward Natsu\u2019s open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! NATSU! YOU\u2019RE GONNA EAT ME!\u201d Gray cried out with anguish, but it went unheard as the fork disappeared between Natsu\u2019s lips. Natsu closed his eyes and savored the last bite as he slipped the clean fork out of his mouth. Inside the hot cavern Gray was tossed around the mouth and lost all sense of direction. He screamed, but couldn\u2019t even hear his own voice over the sound of the titan chewing and reducing the pasta around him to mush with his pearly whites. With most of the noodles still whole Natsu tilted his head back and gulped powerfully. He was none the wiser to the little ice mage that was swept into his esophagus as well and pulled down to his awaiting belly. Natsu dropped the fork onto the empty plate and leaned back on his sofa; both hands patting his gurgling stomach. Behind those hard abs, Gray fell into the hot chamber that was the Dragon Slayer\u2019s stomach. He landed with a plop into a mound of chewed up and whole noodles; remarkably less than there should have been. For Natsu\u2019s digestive acids were like lava; quickly breaking down anything and everything the fire mage ate. Gray resumed his struggles within his new confinement; but it was short-lived. The mound of pasta slowly sank into the gastric lake at the bottom of Natsu\u2019s stomach and Gray along with it. The frantic Ice-Make Mage\u2019s muffled screams were completely drowned out by the churning and squelching of Natsu\u2019s belly, and eventually they just\u2026stopped. The mighty Fire Dragon Slayer gave his abs one last slap before opening his mouth and belching loudly. He then smacked his lips and laced his arms behind his head; eyes fixated on his gurgling belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, not bad! Now if only I had the chance to do to Gray what my stomach\u2019s doing to that pasta!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Fortunately for him, the sharp pain faded after a few seconds. The iron dragon slayer got to his feet and shook his head, trying to remember why his head ached so bad. All he remembered was sitting at a table in the guild's hall and suddenly, he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something must have hit me behind the head... urgh!\" He muttered, looking around to see if anybody decided to go all smart-ass on him. \"What the...?\" He then realized; something was off... way off. The tables and chairs around him were huge! Or rather, he was minuscule! Even a mere chair leg was around ten times wider than him. The whole thing being so surreal and so sudden, Gajeel felt a little light-headed, tumbling around as his brain tried to assimilate the learned information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... no use standing here. Gotta find a way to get back to normal. I won't accept being that puny for much longer.\" He was about to move in any direction when the ground started trembling. At first it was quite faint, but it quickly gained in intensity. So much that Gajeel ended up falling on his butt, then bounced up and down on the hard wooden floor of the hall. \"Damnit! What's all this ruckus?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as suddenly as they started, the quakes came to an end. The iron dragon slayer got back to his feet once again to look around, and he spots something. For the first time since he woke up, he sees another living person. Sure, they were huge, but it was better than nobody at all. \"Hmm, now to get his attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel thought that he should see who it is first, as looking at their feet won't tell everything. He looks up and sees none other than...</span></div></div>",

The iron dragon slayer waved, but Pantherlily wasn't noticing him. Even in his chibi form, the panther was still humongous compared to the puny half-inch tall Gajeel. He ran towards him, hoping to get his attention once he got closer, but his partner advanced towards him right as he was only a few feet away. His eyes opened wide once he realized that his friend might just crush him where he stood if his steps had a right timing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe iron muncher turned in a ninety degrees angle and dashed to the side, but Lily's tiny squeaky steps got dangerously closer to him. A shadow covered the iron dragon slayer, he looked up to see that white furred sole come down on him at an alarming speed. He tried to dodge it, but Pantherlily's size was way too important for him to avoid the paw entirely. Even though it was heavy, the foot was quite soft when it slammed on Gajeel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the foot lifted up, the young man found himself stuck to the sole quite tightly, tucked in white fuzz. \"Urrgh!\" Gajeel whined as the foot repeatedly got up and down on him as Pantherlily walked. He thanked his iron scales for protecting him from a crushing fate, but he was still quite uncomfortable each time the hard wooden floor came up on his front. \"LILY!!!\" He screamed out of his lungs, but to no avail. Even his cat wouldn't hear him at this size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter interminable seconds, the footsteps stopped, and Gajeel found himself muffled by the ground. After a few seconds of breath-taking torture, the foot goes up and doesn't come down.</span></div></div>",

He sighed in relief, unable to take any more crushing against the hard floor. He immediately tried to pray himself off the furry white sole, but he was sank in Pantherlily's flesh pretty hard. As he pushes against the soft and musky surface, he can hear some talking from above. He stops an instant to listen, he can hear Lily and Mirajane's voice. \"Oh, hello, Lily! Would you like something to eat?\" Mirajane asked with her soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please. I would like to try nachos, I've never eaten any.\" The black Exceed replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away. I'm sure you'll enjoy them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe iron dragon slayer felt relieved, this meant that Pantherlily would stay at the bar for a while, which would give him plenty of time to get off from under his foot and try to get his attention. With a sudden spurt of will and strength, the iron muncher finally teared himself from the fuzzy paw. He hanged unto the fur and swung to the tip of his toes. He panted a little, pulling himself on top of the now black foot, reaching the ankle and catching his breath. He hoped his cat wouldn't move his legs too much as he grabbed the fur of the shin and started climbing, helping himself with the slightly sinking flesh to keep his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Lily was in his small form; he was MUCH shorter like this, and Gajeel reached his waist rather quickly. He was getting quite tired though, it still required a lot of effort even if he had all that fur to get a good grip on. But he kept on, the top of the table was near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirajane came back with a plate filled with nachos, a delicious, thick cheese sauce copiously covering the chips. \"There you go. Bon app\u00e9tit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really does look good, thank you, Mirajane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waitress got back to serve someone on the other side of the bar, Lily got up to have a better look at the plate. He was quite tiny, and he got frustrated when he noticed he could barely touch the plate. He picked the closest nacho and pulled it closer to him, sniffing it. His mouth spread into a smile; the panther found the nacho's smell quite enticing. He opened wide a took a bite of it. He instantly fell in love with the cheesy goodness, devouring the rest of the nacho quite quickly. But then, he realized that it would take him ages to eat that generous serving at his size. He looked around, and then decided to change into his battle form. He expanded rather fast, his bulk greatly increasing, his palms and soles turning black just like the rest of his body and his face morphing into a more mature figure. He grinned, this time he would be able to eat much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel was up to Pantherlily's chest, able to perceive the huge plate of food, when the black Exceed started growing. The huge burst of magic took him by surprise, expelling him from the huge body. He was thrown quite high in the air, falling down right in the nachos. Covered in hot cheese, he squirmed madly, getting back to the surface before drowning in it. He gasped and looked around, realizing he had fallen in quite a bad place. A shadow covered his sight, and he looked up to see Lily's huge, now human-like, hand come down towards him. He gasped and quickly moved away as the panther's thumb and index pinched the tip of a nacho, pulling it off with a sticky bit of cheese. He hoped he had the time to get away more, because the sickening crunching noises he heard behind him weren't reassuring at all. He did not want to hear them from any closer.</span></div></div>",

So he turned and began to make his way away form Lily as the crunching sound turned to chewing then finally an audible gulp, sending shivers down his spine. As Gajeel attempted to wade his way through the thick cheese and around the large nachos he could see the shadow of Lily's hand come close and grab the next chip right beside him. The nacho was slowly pulled from the pile, a long sting of cheese still connected to the plate, as a pleasurable purr could be heard from Lily who was greatly enjoying his savoury treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel turned just in time to see his partners maw open revealing the slimy pink insides as the whole chip was placed inside then disappear, closed eyes as another loud crunch was heard. He was in awe as he watched the jaw worked to turn the once crunchy nacho into mush for easy swallowing then a large bump go down Lily's neck with a loud gulp. If he didn't get off this plate soon that might be him going down to meet the same fate as the rest of the plate. Lily looked back down at the plate before him and licked his lips, nearly half the plate already devoured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel thought this might be his chance to be seen and rescued from this minuscule size so he began to wave his arms and shout for Lily's attention. His idea seemed to be working as Lily looked closely at the plate and leaned in a bit closer, a paw moving right over to where Gajeel stood. Little did he know that being covered in cheese did him no favours in revealing his true self and Lily's paw went right over him to grab the nacho right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tipping of the chip caused a wave of melted cheese to take Gajeel for a ride as the nacho was pulled away from the plate and towards the hungry maw of his partner. Still half buried in the cheese Gajeel was pulled along by the stretchy sticky string of cheese attached to the chip as it was placed in his partners waiting mouth. He heard the first crunch as he dangled from the strand of cheese dangerously close to the humid muzzle. A quick lick brought half the sting of cheese in to join the rest of the nacho as Gajeel began to yell for his friends attention and struggle to get out the sticky and deadly cheese.</span></div></div>",

This peace was accomplished largely by the Elric brothers and their heroic efforts. Things had returned mostly to normal for Edward and Alphonse, but life in Amestris was still very interesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward Elric was in a very bad mood. Just over a year ago, he was excited about finally growing taller, but now he realized that he was somehow getting shorter in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is this even possible!\u201d Edward yelled furiously, holding a measuring stick in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Ed?\u201d Winry called from a nearby room. She and Ed had finally moved in together after several months of awkward interactions. While they were not officially married, they had plans for a wedding in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I was 5 foot 8 last year, and now I\u2019m 5 foot 5!\u201d Ed exclaimed. \u201cSomehow I shrunk, and I blame it on that asshole Truth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably just imagining that because you can\u2019t accept being shorter than me,\u201d Winry responded, unaware of her mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am NOT short!\u201d Edward screamed in reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Ed?\u201d Alphonse asked as he entered the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeight problems,\u201d Winry told him. \u201cNot that you\u2019d understand.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, like Winry, was taller than Ed, but he towered over his brother by nearly a foot. After the Promised Day, Al, to Ed\u2019s irritation, had a major growth spurt and quickly grew much larger than Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you only drank your milk, this would never have happened,\u201d the 6 foot 4 Al told Ed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with milk!\u201d Ed yelled. \u201cI\u2019m shrinking! I\u2019m 3 inches shorter than I was last year!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you haven\u2019t always been this height?\u201d Al asked, cockily placing his large hand on Edward\u2019s<br>\r\nhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd pushed Al\u2019s hand away and sprinted out of the room angrily. Why don\u2019t they believe me? He wondered to himself. Suddenly, Edward felt a strange sensation, almost as if his body was being compressed. He immediately fell unconscious for several seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ed opened his eyes, he was surrounded by an enormous room. He quickly recognized his house, but he realized that it was a giant version of it. Is this a dream? He thought. At that moment, Ed felt a rumble and noticed an unbelievably massive figure approaching him. This giant was ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he didn't pry, figuring the boys would have a hard enough time ahead of them already. Something had been growing on his mind lately, he needed to visit the archive room at HQ. Leaving a note on the table, he put on his work uniform and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Central HQ Archive Room***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liore, these endless uprisings, Philosophers Stone, human sacrifices, and the outright genocide of the Ishvalan people...\" Lieutenant Colonel Hughes muttered to himself as he circled each point on the map. When each point was connected, it became something so horrifying that Hughes couldn't have begun to imagine it in his wildest nightmares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This means.....how could this even happen!? Who could've orchestrated something as terrible as this? I've gotta tell the Fuhrer right away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe open door to the archive room closed, and the figure of a woman stood between him and the only exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Lieutenant Colonel, its nice to meet you. Well...hello really isn't the word I'm looking for.\" The woman said in her seductive voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaes saw the Ouroboros tattoo centered above her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool tattoo.\" Maes pulled one of his push knives from his sleeve and threw it just as the woman's elongated claws pierced through his shoulder, throwing him against the wall <br>\r\nLust jerked her claws out from Hughes' shoulder, and aimed for his head, \"Enough!\" a tall man from the shadows held up his hand and Lust's deadly blades stopped inches from Maes' neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall black man emerged from the shadows and Lust backed away, retracting her claws. \"Captain Fokker? Don't tell me you're involved with this!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh I'm sorry, I'm still incognito aren't I? Hehe, just a sec.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed light shone everywhere about the room and soon Fokker was gone and before Maes stood a skinny boy with long black hair with a greenish tint to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father wants us to do things a little differently this time, he's found a new use for the Philosopher's Stone!\" Envy held up a vial full of red liquid, he uncorked it and held the struggling and wide eyed Maes down. \"This'll only hurt a lot. Hehehehe!\" Envy laughed as he poured the solidifying stone into Maes' wound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaes Hughes felt an excruciating pain for a little over a minute, and then blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHughes rubbed his eyes and yawned, thinking the entire previous occurrence was nothing but a bizarre dream. That was when his vision began to clear and he saw where he was. He was in fact, on the floor of the train at the feet of Alphonse and Edward Elric as they rode through the night toward Winry's house. He began to overhear bits of their conversation, \"Its really sad about Lieutenant Colonel Hughes disappearance isn't it Ed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hope they find him safe soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHughes couldn't believe it, how long had he been out?! His family must be worried sick! \"First things first,\" Hughes told himself, \"I have to get these two's attention.\"</span></div></div>",

He had seen giant monster films before; this earthquake he felt wasn\u2019t being caused by seismic waves, it was being caused by giant footsteps! Most likely they belonged to whoever\u2019s room this was and Joey didn\u2019t want to be out in the open when that door opened. Joey wasn\u2019t taking into account his pathetically small size, however. Even if he stayed where he was he probably wouldn\u2019t be noticed right away. Then again, Joey wasn\u2019t thinking very calmly right now, shown more apparent when he hops into the nearby pair of used underwear! Sure, it was closer than the sock, but still\u2026it was a pair of used underwear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, already regretting this decision.\u201d Joey mumbled to himself as he plugged his nose to keep out the rank smell of the used undergarment. The ant sized teen was hidden among the folds of the white fabric, but it smelled so bad that Joey wondered if he had the time to give the sock a try instead. That plan was quickly shot down when the door to the bedroom swung open; triggering Joey to quickly lay down on his stomach and keep perfectly still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnter Rex Raptor; the Dinosaur duelist. Rex had just come from the shower; his brown and purple hair still a little damp. His torso, which was not as muscular as the taller Joey\u2019s but still toned, also glistened with wetness. The teenage duelist was wearing nothing but a towel around his waste, and upon entering the privacy of his room and closing the door he let the towel fall to the floor. The now nude giant proceeded to his dresser; stepping right over Joey and his hiding place. The frightened little man glanced up and saw the huge shadow of the giant pass over him. It was just his silhouette, but Joey could already tell how massive he was compared to himself. Once at the dresser Rex started fishing out some clean clothes to wear and tossed them onto his bed. When he reached his underwear draw, however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, out of underwear.\u201d Rex cursed under his breath; his voice too low for Joey to hear and identify him. The long haired duelist spun around and gave his room a quick glance-around. His purple-blue eyes locked onto Joey\u2019s hiding spot. It was the same underwear he was wearing before hopping into the shower. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to do.\u201d The naked teen stomped over to the underwear and, without knowing of its little passenger, slipped his bare and moist feet into them. This startled Joey, who only saw two walls of flesh appear within his dingy and stained hiding place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he already find me?!\u201d Joey wondered out loud as he tried to scramble out of the underwear. It was no use, however, as Rex had already reached down and gripped the rim of the undergarment. He swiftly pulled up; the underwear riding up his legs and speeding toward his groin. Joey\u2019s hysterical screams went unheard as he looked up and saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

Get over here for a minute, will ya?\" It was the sound of the demonic quarterback himself, Hiruma Yoichi. Sena, known by his fans as Eyeshield, ran towards Hiruma and followed him into the quarterback's personal office. As soon as Sena walked in the doors, Hiruma slammed the door shut and locked it, \"Now that the football season is over until next fall, I've got some special endurance training just for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSena blinked. He was incredibly afraid of what Hiruma would propose as a part of his training, but Hiruma was never wrong. It was then that the demonic quarterback pulled out a vial of strange, glowing liquid, \"Drink this.\" Sena looked at it, \"Uhh... what is it?\" Hiruma grinned widely, \"That's a secret. Just drink it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing the quarterback, he nodded and drank the contents of the vial. Hiruma could only laugh as he watched Sena shrink down until he was only an inch tall, \"Now then, my little buggy Eyeshield, you're gonna be getting close to one of your fellow teammates. VERY close. Your training is to live out your entire summer inside of the clothing of this particular teammate. Food and drink shouldn't be a problem, but you will constantly have to keep on the move in order to survive the perils of being an insect. And because I'm so generous, I'll let you choose which teammate you get to stay with.\" All of a sudden, Hiruma pops off one of his football cleats and, placing Sena on the ground, places his foot on top of the little running back, \"HOWEVER! If you should leave your assigned teammate OR your assigned teammate finds out that you've been shrunken down, I'll take you for myself.\" Hiruma applies pressure to Sena's body under his smelly foot, \"And trust me, my feet are the absolute least of your worries, GOT IT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSena screams out \"I GOT IT, I GOT IT! PLEASE LET ME GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiruma removes his foot from Sena and slams it next to him, \"Good, now I made sure everyone else would be gone for a few minutes longer, so you'll have some time to choose whose clothes you'll be inhabiting for your entire summer.\" Sena gulped and then made his decision. \"I want to stay with...\"</span></div></div>",

Too afraid to get that close to your buddy?\u201d Hiruma chuckled mockingly at Sena. \u201cOh well, not my problem. You have all summer to find yourself in there anyway! That is, assuming you don\u2019t get crushed on the way home!\u201d The demonic teen cackled evilly before tossing the underwear back into the locker. Before the tiny running back could even think about changing his answer, Hiruma held him above the sock\u2019s opening with his slender fingers and dropped him inside. Sena itty-bitty Sena screamed as he fell into the white sock; barely hitting the bottom before he was also tossed into the pile of clothes within Monta\u2019s locker. The spiky haired blond was about to shut the locker door when Sena shouted at him from within the sock. His voice was so soft and muffled at that size that no one would of usually heard him; but Hiruma had the advantage of knowing the tiny high schooler\u2019s predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Hiruma! Isn\u2019t this\u2026isn\u2019t this really dangerous?!\u201d Sena shouted as he pressed himself against the cotton wall that separated him and the one who had put him in this situation. \u201cWhat if Monta really does crush me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? That\u2019s a fucking stupid question.\u201d Hiruma answered with a look as if Sena had just asked him what color the sky was. \u201cIf you get crushed then you get crushed; simple as that! No one will ever know a thing and I\u2019ll just tell them you quit and moved to another country or something. Anyway, good luck Eyeshield, you\u2019ll need it.\u201d Hiruma chuckled one last time before slamming the locker shut; consuming Sena in darkness. The shrunken male sat there in the slightly musky sock and shook nervously. He wanted to believe the quarterback wouldn\u2019t really put him in such a dangerous position, but he knew the opposite was totally fitting for his personality. Sena had no choice but to tackle this challenge head on and come out of it stronger than ever! The petit athlete nodded to himself and clenched his fists; preparing himself for what was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t have to wait long at all. Mere minutes after Hiruma had left him the sound of a stampede started outside. From experience Sena knew it was the sound of his teammates stomping into the locker room. Sena could make out booming chatter far away, but was unable to tell which voices belonged to who. Soon the chatter was accompanied by the rummaging of clothes as the Deimon Devil Bats changed out of their sweaty, dirty uniforms. This reminded Sena that he was still in his football gear, minus the helmet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll give me a little more protection.\u201d Sena said to himself as he tapped his hard shoulder pads. Still, he wasn\u2019t very enthusiastic about spending the entire summer in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Hiruma, where\u2019s Sena?\u201d came a loud, clear voice that Sena quickly recognized as Monta\u2019s. His theory was quickly confirmed as the locker opened and the inside was flooded with light. Sena couldn\u2019t see his friend through the thick material of the sock, but he could make out a very monkey-like shadow. Monta\u2019s gargantuan hands snatched up articles of clothing one by one as he put them on; seemingly saving his socks for last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably on a jet to Italy by now! I set him up with a very special training program; don\u2019t expect to see him at all this summer.\u201d came Hiruma\u2019s response, followed by a snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! No way!\u201d replied the skilled receiver as he grabbed his socks out of the locker. Sena yelped and grabbed handfuls of his white, dingy prison  to keep him from fumbling around inside. Raimon sat down on a bench and tugged his left sock on; followed by his right. The shrunken, spiky haired boy watched as Monta\u2019s big, plump toes appeared at the top of the sock. They were quickly joined by the rest of his huge foot and Sena\u2019s eyes widened at the sheer size of what was coming down toward him. He had time to wonder if perhaps he was biting off more than he could chew before the sweaty, tanned sole of his best friend slammed into him. The wind was knocked out of tiny Sena\u2019s lungs as he was securely pinned between the sock and Monta\u2019s steamy hot foot. In seconds the monkey boy slipped on his sneakers as well and stood up; turning Sena\u2019s groans of discomfort into groans of agony as unbelievable weight was put on his miniature form. \u201cI was really looking forward to hanging out with him! This sucks MAX!\u201d Monta pouted before saying goodbye to Kurita and the others and heading out the door. Once Raimon was gone Hiruma couldn\u2019t help but grin devilishly. Little did the energetic monkey know Sena would be hanging out with him all summer long. </span></div></div>",

We we're gonna finally hit the beach!\" With each step, Monta's feet started to build up more and more oily, musky sweat only to be absorbed by his best friend and unaware insole, Sena. Sena was having a very hard time breathing. Even though Monta's sneaker was breathable, the foot odor blocked any chance of Sena getting any fresh air. Not to mention that his prison was moving up and down in a somewhat rapid motion, making him feel slightly ill. Sena wished he wasn't tricked by Hiruma into this situation, <i>I'm not sure I'm going to last the entire summer like this. But if I let Monta know I'm in here, Hiruma will keep me like this forever!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud blaring noise comes from Monta's pocket, <b>*Kanjita you ni yattetai na, taishitamon ja nai ze right now! Kankiwamatte kazashita my hands, kanshou babe be survivor!*</b> Monta pulled out his cell phone and answered it glumly, \"Hello?\" The voice on the other line spoke, but it was hard to hear to everyone except Monta, \"Oh hey! I just found out Sena was going to be training overseas, so I won't be able to hang out with him. Really sucks!\" Then the voice spoke again and Monta's eyes lit up and he started to blush a little, \"H-hehehe, I guess we could do that instead, I didn't think about that! J-just remember. It's a secret! If anyone on the team found out, especially Hiruma, both of our lives would be over!\" The voice spoke once more, with Monta's grin widening and his face turning even redder, \"Then I'll see you then, babe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Monta hung up the phone, he squatted down and did a backflip in pure happiness, \"Turnabout MAX! This is gonna be so awesome! While Sena's off training, I get to go hang out with the person of my dreams!\" As Monta does this backflip, Sena slides across Monta's slippery sole and ends up between his best friend's toes upside-down, his face buried in the underside of Monta's toes. Monta then starts sprinting towards his destination, a nice, secluded spot that even Hiruma might not know about. After waiting for ten minutes, Monta hears footsteps from behind him and he turns around. Seeing the person coming towards him, he starts grinning widely, \"It's so awesome to see you again, babe! We hardly never get to see eachother anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is this person that has stolen the heart of Sena's best (and biggest) friend?</span></div></div>",

Then after a moment or two, Ash rotated Max so Max's dick was inside Ash's mouth and Ash's dick was in Max's mouth. Then they both proceeded to suck each other off while still moaning. This didn't last for very long when both of them at the same time came in each others mouths. The spray was so overwhelming that some of each others seed spilled out of their mouths. Then Max slowly rotated back above Ash's face and locked lips with him as they exchanged each others seed and saliva at the same time. Not long after that, they drank the mixture down in a single gulp and Max rested his head on Ash's chest as they both fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning--</span></div></div>",

The guys were having another game that day, their team vs. TK's again, to whom Davis was ready to prove himself to the blonde (after having been defeated countless times by him before) once and for all. He wanted more than anything to win now. The boy quickly threw Davis the ball before the other team could steal it, and Davis caught it, dribbling it up toward the net, heart pounding. He was closing in on making the winning score, no one up front to stop him for once. He could imagine himself leaping into the air and straight down slam dunking the ball ever so gracefully into the net, impressing everyone in the stadium. At least, that's how he would've liked for it to have happened... had he not tripped on his suddenly undone shoelaces and fell face forward into the pole of the basketball net, knocking him clear unconscious, ball bouncing off in the opposite direction somewhere as everyone just stood there and stared in a confused daze. The last thing he remembered were people calling out his name, \"Davis!\" then everything going fuzzy and blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he awoke groggily, a slight headache on him, sweat clinging in beads to his forehead. \"Wha...what happened?\" he asked to no one in particular, looking around to what appeared to be the familiar sight of the boy's locker room... only now 20 times bigger? \"Huh?\" he suddenly gawked aloud, looking around the now massive room and seemingly skyscraper tall lockers. \"Wha?? How-how did this happen?!\" he cried out, getting up from the floor and looking around frantically. He suddenly heard massive steps far off that were getting closer, nearing the corner where he was at. He eeped and quickly scurried beneath a bench like a little mouse, as he then watched two massive basketball shoe'd feet stomp past him, shaking the floor a bit beneath him like a mini earthquake. He couldn't believe this was happening. Everything was so large now... Could he be dreaming all of this? Anyway, his curiosity getting the better of him, he poked his little head out past the bench's leg and looked up to see that the giant shoes belonged to none other than TK himself. And it looked like the blonde-haired boy was talking on his cell phone. He listened... \"Yeah, I'm sure he'll be all right... It was just a minor concussion, they said... Yeah, I was shocked, honestly, though. It just happened all so quick...\" As he continued listening, he could obviously tell that the conversation was about him. He felt so embarrassed... tripping on his own shoelaces and knocking himself unconscious on the basketball net's pole. No one would ever let that down for him. And now to make matters even worse, he was only about 1 inch tall somehow. He cursed out loud to himself, as he continued to listen. TK was wrapping up the conversation with whoever he was talking to (probably Kari) and hung up. He then started to change back into his normal clothes that were in his locker there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis wanted to get his attention, but was slightly nervous at the same time... What would TK do when he found him? Possibly think he was a bug and squish him? He contemplated this as TK was taking off his shoes, then started reaching for his gym socks, just as Davis decided to move forward. As Davis crept up, an odd smell suddenly stung his nose like a wasp... He smelled the horrible stench of TK's sweaty barefeet slapping the ground, as the blonde-haired boy from above placed his shoes and socks into his gym bag. His feet on the ground, sweat visibly rolling down in streams off the pink, ripened skin from the hectic game. The Takaishi boy sighed, wiggling his lint-caked toes as he enjoyed the coolness of the floor on his hot soles. \"Aw man, TK, that's nasty!\" Davis shouted up to him. TK suddenly looked up, \"Huh?\" hearing the tiny voice as a little peep. \"I'm down here!\" Davis shouted again. TK just looked around cluelessly. Davis growled underneath his breath as he then began to approach the blonde's feet closer, much to his disgust, and got near enough to where he could actually touch the side of TK's foot. Reaching out, he did, as he began petting the steamy, sweaty flesh, which made him want to puke. Still, he hoped TK would feel it and notice him. TK, who had shrugged off the noises and was putting on his signature white \"Gilligan's\" hat, felt a tickling by his foot. He looked down and blinked, noticing that by his foot what looked like to be...</span></div></div>",

In uttermost horror, he cried out, \"TK, I SWEAR, IF I EVER GET BACK TO NORMAL, I'M GONNA-MMMPH!\" He was cut off by having his entire body shoved in between the crevice between TK's big and second toe. Light was then completely shut off and TK wiggled his greasy toes that held Davis's frame between them like a plaything, sweat molding around his face and plastering his body that was held firmly to the skin, the massive digits perspiring within the stingy article of clothing. Microscopic droplets of sweat formed beads from the sweat glands that began to secrete them, due to the rising heat of the horrible environment. TK, from the outside, made sure his toes felt nice and comfy as he wiggled them and smiled, then placed his feet into his usual pair of shoes, giving them a nice kick to make sure they were nice and tight. Satisfied, he began walking. Now things were really getting hot and dark in the sock, as sweat was literally glazing over Davis's entire form and soaking into his clothes and bleaching his hair; Davis would gasp for breath, only to have his mouth filled with the salty fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt sick to his stomach and was about to throw up all over TK's toes, as the motion of TK walking and stomping his feet was also helping with that, but then, due to all the slippery sweat that was buttering up his inch-tall frame, he slid downward even moreso until his whole body was completely buried and actually hugging the flesh in between TK's big and second toe, where a large pocket of toe jam coated along the sides and center of it, consisting of sweat, lint, dead skin cells, and just plain caught up gunk made up of who knows what.. Davis was really freaking out now, as he was literally becoming concealed in this nasty grime of junk and filth, the cheesy-like substance pasting up his sweat-soaked clothes nicely and entrenching his arms within as he would try and pull away. He reached out to the sides of him in a vain attempt to reel himself out by using the sides of TK's toes for support, but the glossy sweat that had built up and run along the skin made it slick and his hands slid off of them. The whool inside and around the foot was becoming heavier and thicker with perspiration, as it had been soaking it up, and the heat was only continually rising within. Davis was getting so hot now, he had started to take off his shirt, just to relieve himself if only even a little bit of the terrible heat. His body was shining in the darkness from both TK's sweat and his own, with the creamy-like toe filling encasing the lower-half of his body and abdomen densely. He was panting hard, his nauseousness beginning to fade, oddly, even after having just ingested entire globs of sweat and crud. He just coughed and hacked a bit, though, feeling his chest heave in and out, as he had stopped fighting and just lay motionless in the dark now, completely tired out. The room itself had stopped moving, 'cept for the occasional toe wiggle and flex here and there, as Davis had now guessed that TK was in a classroom, sitting down at a desk. After that, though, he would be heading home, which would mean he would be walking it, as TK never took the bus... Davis groaned just thinking about it. He held out his shirt in front of him and wrung it out of the salty sweat, watching it poor down from the fabric like a faucet. He couldn't believe a boy like TK, whom he had always thought to be of uttermost hygiene when compared to everyone else in the school, would ever be capable of all of \"this\" that he just gone through. He didn't think TK would care enough to pamper his feet or anything, but even so, this was just ridiculous... And after waiting a little while longer in the same position he was in, he then felt his whole beginning to shift once again as the faint sound of the school bell going off could be heard. \"Great... Just great,\" Davis thought. So here was TK heading now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After say goodbye to his friends T.K. gathered up his things and made his way out of the school building. As he left the school gates he passed several kids boarding the busses. Just as Davis feared, the hat-wearing boy ignored them and continued on foot. In his right hand was his gym bag; filled with dirty and sweaty clothes that would need washing. Strapped to his shoulders was his backpack; filled with books and other accessories. With all the extra weight most people would jump for the bus; but not Takeru. T.K. enjoyed the exercise, plus there would be plenty of time for rest in his own home. As the blond opened up his cell phone and scrolled through his new emails and texts concerning Davis he was completely unaware that the very boy everyone was worried about was currently suffering inside his sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUghh\u2026damn you, T.K.\u201d Davis mumbled to the towering giant above him as he felt the nauseousness return as soon as the giant DigiDestined made it to the sidewalk. Each step Takeru took made Davis\u2019s entire world lift up and down\u2026up and down\u2026up and down. As the tiny, shrunken kid pressed himself against the filthy flesh he squeezed his eyes shut and used all his mental control to prevent him from getting sick. Sure, perhaps vomiting over the giant\u2019s toes would get him to notice him, but it was more likely he would just cover himself in more filth than what already drenched his body! This situation was hellish already; no need to make it worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes of walking later, Davis had pretty much gotten used to the stomach tossing motion of T.K.\u2019s footfalls. He hadn\u2019t, however, gotten used to the foul odor that surrounded him. Nor had he gotten used to the sweat and toe gunk that covered his body; several times he had almost gotten sick again because that disgusting stuff had made it into his mouth. Worse of all, however, was the heat. It was so ungodly hot inside his sock prison that his body shined with almost as much of his own sweat as Takeru\u2019s. Davis\u2019s bare, smooth chest rose up and down as he gasped for air. His vision was getting blurry (not that he could see much anyway) and his body was so tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026I can\u2019t keep my eyes open.\u201d Davis said to himself; barely able to hear his own voice over the THOOMing being caused outside each time T.K. stomped down. His eyelids felt heavy and they slowly slid over his foggy eyes. Before losing consciousness Davis imagined himself dying in here\u2026dying under the foot of his rival who would never know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later Davis was awoken by the sound of a door being shut down where in the distance. For the first second upon opening his eyes Davis thought he had dreamed the whole thing; a weird nightmare brought on by a concussion. Then he looked at his sweat drenched chest and the peach colored toes that belonged to his unknowing captor and he snapped back to reality. He sighed, wishing he had stayed asleep, but then noticed something different. While it was still dark as night inside the sock; Davis could make out a little more of his surroundings. The increase in light could only mean that T.K. was taking his shoes off, which means he was finally home. If some god out there loved him at all he would soon take off his socks as well. While waiting for that moment Davis noticed his hands were empty; his shirt was missing. It must of slipped out of his hand while he slept and was now somewhere underneath T.K.\u2019s huge foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI liked that shirt\u2026\u201d Davis complained to himself as T.K. left his shoes at the front door and made his way into his house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I\u2019m home!\u201d T.K. called, but got no reply. It dawned on him that his mother sent him an email during lunch explaining how she wouldn\u2019t be home when he got back. T.K. had only skimmed through the email and couldn\u2019t remember where she had gone and for how long. No matter; it meant he had the entire place to himself! The first thing the blond did was head to his room and drop his gym bag and backpack. With those burdens gone T.K. sat on his bed and proceeded to strip his feet of their socks. Once both of his baked feet were free the young man leaned back and wiggled and flexed his toes. A sigh of comfort escaped his lips as he felt the cool air brush against his bare feet and between his toes. As he spread and clenched those sore toes he said to himself, \u201cMaybe I should think about taking the bus every now and then. My feet would probably thank me, haha.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs T.K. relaxed, Davis\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Davis gasped loudly, finally being able to breathe in some fresh air after having been trapped within his blonde rival's steamy, rotten socks for whoever knows how long, though yet, much to his discontent and horror, he was still glued in between the youngest Takaishi boy's toes from all the sticky, slowly drying sweat built up in there! He was really starting to get frustrated, as he then began batting the sides of T.K.'s two biggest toes (the ones he was trapped within) with his arms, but in a once again vain attempt to get noticed, as T.K., just like before, did not feel anything the inch-tall boy did, much thanks to his very now diminished stature and thanks to all the sweat and gunk that had accumulated deep within those toes, acting almost as a barrier, which protected the skin from such tiny feels as the ones Davis had made. Takeru sighed, still wiggling his toes and feeling the cool air run in between them. He could see how shiny his feet were with sweat and little flecks of graying lint decorating the tops and bottoms of his soles, with huge mounds of them wedged up between his thin toes. Just how they looked every time he had gotten home after Basketball days, he thought. As he wiggled and flexed his toes there, Davis was getting the whole show of it, up close and personal. He felt as if he was in a washing machine, with the gargantuan mammoth toes ramming into his sides and rubbing all over and along his body, coating him in more perspiration and dead skin cells. Heaps of toe jam and sock fuzz stuffing into his face and sliding all around his naked chest, greasing the small boy up from head to toe, as he looked up in anger (and a curious bit of envy) and cursed once more at the the giant blonde-haired, blue-eyed teen from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about another minuet of this treatment, T.K. finally swung over his legs up on the bed and layed his head back on the pillow, taking off his white hat and lazily tossing it over the side of his bed. With his whole body laying flat now, his feet were sat propped up on their bare heels, and Davis, who had been coughing up slimy crud and wiping off more of T.K.'s perspiration and his own off of his face, looked up and signed a bit to himself in relief. Takeru had finally settled down now and was just laying there in bed, his eyes closed as he breathed softly in and out. Davis, all sweaty and trembling, looked down from his perch from between the Takaishi boy's toes, ironically hugging on to the second toe for dear life. It looked like a long way down to him, but if he could slide himself down the slightly slanted top of the foot easily, he should be okay, he thought to himself. As he was about to place one reluctant foot on some flesh below, he suddenly heard an obnoxiously high-pitched voice calling out. \"T.K.!! T.K.!!!\" Oh no, Davis realized... It was Patamon, the blonde-haired boy's digimon partner. Patamon came flying into the room and landed on T.K.'s chest. \"Hi, T.K.!\" Patamon chirped happily. Takeru opened his eyes and smiled softly at his little friend, \"Hey, Patamon...\" \"So, how was your day at school?\" the orange creature asked, his big blue eyes shining into his partner's with enthusiasm. \"Well, Davis got hurt pretty badly today in our basketball match, actually... He got a minor concussion after running into the basketball pole on accident.\" \"Wow, really? How'd he manage that?\" \"Well, he actually tripped over his own shoelaces and did it,\" T.K. said, chuckling a bit at the thought. \"Well, I hope Veemon isn't too worried about him, then...\" \"He'll be just fine. He should be back within one day tops, maybe. It was just minor, really.\" T.K. said, stroking the soft fur on his digimon's back. Davis, listening to the whole conversation, only wished it could've been true... Little did Takeru and everyone else know, including his own family, that he was only one inch tall now and captive to this blonde-haired teen's toes, and probably never to return to normal size again! He just wanted to cry thinking about it, but in his mind, even at this point, he still had trouble even registering all of this to be real/reality...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So other than what happened to Davis, did you have a nice day?\" Patamon asked, enjoying the warm strokes on his back that his partner was giving to him. \"Yeah, I'm just really tired out right now and my feet are killing me...\" T.K. said, sighing. \"Hmm...\" Patamon looked over at the Takaishi boy's feet at the foot of the bed and waddled up to them. He then smelt the foul air around them and his little face grimaced. \"Pee yew, T.K., you should really wash your stinky feetsies now!\" the orange-furred creature giggled. T.K. grinned mischievously at this, \"Hey, how about instead of you acting like my mother and telling me what to do, you massage them for me?\" the boy chuckled, lifting his foot up a bit (the one with Davis still in between the toes) and bringing it over to the bat-winged animal. \"Hey, get your smelly piggies away from me!\" the digimon laughed jokingly, plowing his little hands into T.K.'s sweaty sole, trying to push it away. \"Ah, that feels good, keep doing that,\" the blonde remarked playfully, laughing to himself as well and trying to push his bare foot even closer to the little digimon's face, in a fun manner. Patamon laughed, falling down flat against the bed as the sole had pushed him off his feet; he then used his little legs to try and kick it away. \"You can't make me!\" he squealed delightfully, giggling like a little kid. As the two played this little game innocently with each other, Davis, who had now once again felt like he was being thrown back and forth and all about, felt sick and nauseated. \"Ugh... What did I do to deserve this?\" he groaned, stifling himself from throwing up. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Davis groaned in sheer disgust as T.K.\u2019s foot moved around atop Patamon. His face started to take on a green hue as he did his best to hold back getting sick. Just when he thought he couldn\u2019t take anymore the movements finally stopped. The shrunken Japanese teen panted between his rival\u2019s toes as the giant feet came to a rest on the bedroom floor. Through blurry vision he could make out T.K. touching his stomach high above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could go for a snack,\u201d T.K. said to Patamon. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of lunch, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Patamon flipped himself off his back and looked at the larger human. \u201cBut, T.K., it\u2019s not snack time yet! You know your mom doesn\u2019t like it when you sneak snacks; you\u2019ll get fat!\u201d The small, winged Digimon puffed up his cheeks in an angry way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, come on, Patamon.\u201d T.K. replied with a chuckle as he stood up and looked down at his partner with his hands on his hips. \u201cMom isn\u2019t here right now, and if you don\u2019t tell her I\u2019ll give you some~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026really?\u201d Patamon\u2019s eyes lit up with joy. \u201cAlright, fine! Just this once!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAtta boy.\u201d Takeru smiled and walked out of his room. Down below, Davis grimaced that his rest was over and once again endured the constant up and down movements as the giant blond walked through his home. With nothing else to do the grimy, sweaty teen just stared up at the titan that loomed above him. His eyes were filled with anger and envy as he glared upon the titanic blond. Why did this have to happen to him? Not once did he ever feel inferior to T.K., but now he could hardly call himself an equal. HE should be the one walking around his house while a small and helpless T.K. suffered between his toes. HE deserved to be the bigger one; this was just too unfair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh man\u2026this is just too much.\u201d Davis complained as he closed his eyes so he didn\u2019t have to look at his huge captor. \u201cI could really go for a snack myself right about now\u2026and maybe a cool drink.\u201d The red head wiped some sweat from his forehead; unsure if it belonged to him or T.K. anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the kitchen T.K. grabbed himself a bag of popcorn and tossed it into the microwave. While the bag was popping the DigiDestined grabbed a bottle of water from the refrigerator. He took a few gulps from it before sighing contently and placing the bottle on the kitchen counter. The young boy then stood in front of the microwave and watched the popcorn bag inflate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear popcorn!\u201d came Patamon\u2019s voice before he leaped onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, be careful!\u201d T.K. exclaimed, but it was too late. The Digimon\u2019s chubby body bumped into the water bottle and tipped it. T.K. managed to stop it from completely spilling over, but a small amount splashed onto his bare foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, sorry.\u201d Patamon apologized with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t think any got on the floor.\u201d the Digimon\u2019s partner replied as he gave Patamon a pat. Unknown to either of them, that small bit of water had fallen right onto Davis and utterly soaked his half naked body. At first the shrunken teenager shuddered at the chilly liquid, but quickly became relaxed as it cooled his baked form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose that\u2019s one wish granted.\u201d Davis said to himself as he licked some water off his lips. What the little, wet teen didn\u2019t know was now only did the spilt water soak his body, but it also wet the area between T.K.\u2019s toes. The crusty toe gunk that held him firmly in place begun to soften. Before he could realize this, however, the microwave buzzer went off above him and T.K. was once again on the move with a bag of fresh popcorn in one hand and a bottle of water in the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, T.K., if we have popcorn does that mean\u2026?\u201d Patamon started to ask as he flew next to his slim partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! What do you say about watching a movie?\u201d Takeru asked as he watched Patamon smile gleefully and land on his head of blond hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds fun! What are we gonna watch? A funny movie?\u201d Patamon looked down at his partner\u2019s youthful face with his big blue eyes. T.K. smirked and returned the gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I borrowed a horror film from Matt a few days ago. How about we watch that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A what?\u201d Patamon covered his eyes with his bat-like wings. \u201cT.K., you know I don\u2019t like scary movies\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a baby, Patamon. I heard Gabumon couldn\u2019t make it through the entire film. Don\u2019t you want to prove you\u2019re braver than him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t? Hmmm\u2026\u201d The little Digimon\u2019s wings returned to their normal positions and a smirk appeared on his cute face. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it! I can\u2019t wait to see the look on Gabumon\u2019s face, hehe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled the duo got set up in the living room. Both seated themselves on the couch in front of the television. Takeru clicked on the TV and DVD player before opening up the popcorn and relaxing back with his Digimon friend. Meanwhile, Davis also relaxed in a less comfortable position, thankful that T.K. had stopped moving. Since he was watching a movie he would hopefully sit still for the next hour or two and give Davis some time to think up an escape plan. The giant occasionally rubbing his toes together and squeezing his little form between those musky toes wasn\u2019t helping, however\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>T.K.'s foot suddenly jolted up and sent Davis free-flying through the air... Davis was still shocked from the unexpected throw like that when he had landed deep into a sea of green (and what appeared to be made of a cotton or fabric of some sort) softness. As Davis then lay there motionlessly on his back and staring up at the ceiling, wide-eyed with horror and his heart audibly thumping loudly through his chest, he finally got up (albeit shakily) and saw that Takeru had just lifted up his feet to put them on a pillow. Just that single act alone had launched him up in the air like that, he thought... That really diminished what little was left of his ego there. Luckily, though, he had landed on something soft, so he just sighed to himself in relief of that and then began scanning the area around him... He had obviously landed on T.K.'s belly, he realized, what with the greenness of the usual shirt the boy would wear all the time, and with the odd \"organic\" noises he could make out with his keen little ears coming from deep below the material he was perched upon there. He heard T.K.'s body gurgling and growling, as if almost letting the tiny human know that the giant boy he was on top of was indeed alive, perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takeru from far back was chewing and swallowing his popcorn by the handful, wet and strenuous gulps could also be made out from afar by Davis, listening and then turning to watch the food pass down the blond boy's throat in a probably large, mashed up quantity, given by the size of the descending lump that was traveling downward through the boy's chest, making its way right to where inch-tall form was sitting over. Davis could feel the ground below him rising higher and higher with the more the teen he was on top of consumed and could even feel the muscles below him work to contract over and help process the meal being digested and made into nutrients underneath the fleshy outward exterior. He almost shuddered a bit at the thought, realizing just how easily he could now fit inside his rival's gut at the size he was and help to become part of his body as well, but shook it off to remember that he, too, was hungry, just as his own stomach so noisily let him know. He was glad to have gotten a nice sip of that water from before (thanks to Patamon's shenanigans), but now after that, he wanted something to eat a little of at least to go along with it. He looked on past T.K.'s chest, watching the mammoth hand of the massive digidestined raise what would be a ton of popcorn to him above his mouth and dumping it in carelessly and slobbily, just as any teenage boy who wouldn't have particularly cared about his neatness there would. And thanks to that bit of recklessness, Davis felt his heart drop when a kernel unnoticeably dropped from between the blond's fingers and tumbled on downward to his chest. Davis gulped, feeling himself beginning to salivate as he looked onward, realizing that this was his perfect chance. Even at this size, he knew he had to get something eventually to eat to sustain himself... So as he thought it out there a bit for a minuet or so, he finally decided and said aloud to himself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAh, what\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d Davis said out loud while smiling to himself. He hoped, in the back of his mind, that those weren\u2019t his famous last words. The growling sounds coming from his bare stomach told him he wouldn\u2019t last much longer without some kind of food. So what if he managed to climb down to the floor? He would probably collapse from hunger before ending up underneath T.K.\u2019s foot the next time he got up! \u201cDon\u2019t worry, stomach, you\u2019ll have your food soon!\u201d Davis told his belly as he placed a hand against it. He focused his eyes on that single, delicious looking popcorn kernel before beginning his dash toward it. Meanwhile, the giant blond would continue his movie watching, unaware of the tiny trekking across his body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Davis ran full speed toward his food, he occasionally looked up at the young DigiDestined\u2019s face to see what he was doing. His eyes were always locked onto the television; a handful of popcorn occasionally being shoved into his mouth where it was chewed up loudly. Sometimes the handful would go to Patamon instead; who would happily munch on the snack food. Sadly, no more loose kernels fell from the teen\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took longer for the inch sized DigiDestined to get to the kernel than he would of liked. As the young teen stood on his rival\u2019s chest, he could feel it raise and lower with each breath. It was like standing on a living hill. Since he was so close to T.K.\u2019s face now, the sounds of the giant chewing, slurping, and swallowing were almost deafening to him. If Davis didn\u2019t know he was atop his friend, he would of thought these sounds came from some sort of devouring Digimon. Davis was entranced by it all before his hungry eyes fell upon the popcorn kernel a few feet away. Davis licked his lips and drool dripped down his chin as he approached the steamy, warm piece of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh yeah. Come to Davis~\u201d the shrunken teen mumbled as he picked up the crunchy snack of buttery goodness. At a size bigger than his head, this single kernel of popcorn was like an entire meal to him! \u201cThis is gonna be so good!\u201d Davis licked his lips one last time before plunging his face into the white kernel. The tiny boy nibbled on it a bit before swallowing and making a loud sound of content. His face was covered in melted butter and white dust, but he barely stopped to breath before going back for another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to him, T.K. had happened to glance at his chest and spot the fallen popcorn kernel. The glance only lasted a millisecond before his eyes returned to the TV screen. Then, without bothering to look down, T.K. pinched the popcorn kernel between his fingers. By the time Davis noticed him and the kernel get pinched between those two finger pads it was too late. His first thought was that T.K. had finally noticed him; that this nightmare would soon be over. Those hopes came crashing down when T.K. brought Davis to his mouth and parted his lips. The red haired boy\u2019s face was struck with absolute horror as he gazed into the dark cavern of his friend\u2019s mouth; strings of saliva connecting his teeth together. Davis had just enough time to begin a shriek before T.K. thoughtlessly tossed him inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, NO!\u201d Davis chanted as he landed on T.K.\u2019s huge, wet tongue. He still clung to the popcorn kernel as it was flicked to the right side of T.K.\u2019s mouth; right under a white molar. Davis\u2019s body seemed to move itself as he instantly let go of the kernel and rolled off the teeth just as T.K. clamped down and decimated the popcorn kernel. If Davis had been a moment slower it would have been him being ground up into paste by those pearly whites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta get out gotta get out!\u201d Davis repeated in a panic as he landed back on the slick tongue and looked around. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a way out of here!\u201d The athletic teen got to his feet (which sank into the soft tongue of his rival) and tried his best to wobble toward where he was tossed in. The lips were already closed, but Davis wasn\u2019t known for giving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, even if T.K.\u2019s mouth had been wide open, Davis had no chance of escape. It barely took any effort at all on T.K.\u2019s part to chew up that single kernel of popcorn, so once it was reduced to a fine paste it was tossed back onto the tongue and then flicked to the back of the throat; Davis included. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, NO! Stop, T.K.! Don\u2019t swallow me!!\u201d Davis screamed as loud as he could, but his screams were utterly drowned out by a single, powerful sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP*</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The little red-haired boy was readily tossed back by the motioning of the tongue, along with mashed up popcorn bits, back toward the very end of the cavernous room he was in. Davis' vision was blurred in pink, as he was sent in headfirst into the opening of the pharynx, which greedily opened up to allow his inch-tall body, along with the popcorn, in. The uvula, dangling above almost tauntingly, rose and let the back of the throat expand to slimily swallow him and the grounded yellow mush up. The last bit of light Davis saw before being swallowed was it coming out slightly from between TK's lips and teeth, which were just beginning to part again to accept another handful of popcorn in, having just about swallowed the batch (and him) in. Davis being saliva-ridden and all made him slick and was easily thrusted and slid downward, with the popcorn paste keeping him company by surrounding him on the start of this journey, and he could feel the pharynx closing behind his feet; hundreds of fleshy, wet muscles then grasping at him rigorously and shoving him down forth, to where it was almost painful for him getting swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, it all happened so fast that Davis' mind actually went blank. In one moment he was in the jaws of his friend and fellow digidestined, standing on top of the tongue and trying to run up along it, looking to escape. Then within a matter of milliseconds later, he had been pushed back instantaneously and gulped down like that. He didn't even have time to register it or think at all. He just sort of understood it all from a physical viewpoint, being tossed around and about and back and forth all so suddenly, and now spiraling downward to the belly of the beast below. He felt his body, arms, legs, and everything being constricted downward in a snake-like motion. His body passing down through TK's throat, with it visibly from the outside creating a larger-than-before lump that was going down slightly slower than normal, due to him still being decently-sized for an actual single swallow. TK even felt it a bit after having just swallowed the petty digidestined, unbeknownst to him, and placed his fingers up to his throat, drumming it along to feel the large bulge being effortlessly, yet slightly painfully, dragged down. He swallowed again, so as to help to push down the uncomfortable mass quicker and gasped for air after, relieved to feel his throat empty out. He then looked down and patted the walls of his chest with the back of his fist, so as to make sure there wouldn't any further obstructions. \"Must've swallowed a seed or something...\" the blond-haired boy thought to himself, then continued his focus on the movie, not giving it another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Davis was struggling and trying to grasp at the sides of the esophagus with his arms, so as to maybe slow the process down some, but the rhythmic flow was just to strong, and the sliminess of the constricting tube also hindered him from doing so. Saliva-drenched popcorn muck was being forced into his face on the way down, rubbing up along his sides and mixing beside his bare body and clothes, staining it with buttery, saliva-y tang. He tried to even open his eyes, but the popcorn around him would prevent him from doing so, being shuffled along with him. Even with his eyes closed, though, he could tell that it was getting darker and darker as he passed on downward, as well as the climate itself changing, getting hotter and hotter as he went in. He passed by the larynx, which closed so as not to allow him or the popcorn make its way into the lungs, and then passed by the heart, which he could hear the beating of through the alive walls. Though after having passed the heart and hearing its beats fade away into the outside world, the sound of gurgles, gargles, and growling was erupting closer and closer from the depths below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his head reached the very end of the esophagus in his short-lived journey, he felt a ring of harder flesh, which was the cardiac orifice, open up to accept and squeeze his body through, again in a snake-like motion, along with the popcorn bits, with the muscles in the back pushing his legs and feet in after him and shoving him down forth. He was just lazily and greedily dumped onto the flabby, fleshy stomach floor, being treated as no more than another piece of meat for Takeru's body to process. He instantly got up from the slimy, shallow-with-bile and popcorn mush-covered ground, disgusted and absolutely horrified. He wiped the popcorn stuff off his eyes and opened them up... completely pitch black, though he could vaguely make out the shining of slimy mucus on some of the walls around him, in which he could also make out tiny ridges along the stomach lining, which were to help to break down food particles mechanically, once the digestion process got going. Luckily for the tiny boy inside this belly, though, the stomach had just now been receiving content and being filled with food (which Davis was just so rudely reminded of, as the cardiac orifice above his head opened up again to empty out more popcorn grime on top of him), so it wasn't in the process just yet. Though Davis knew he had to react fast and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling himself start to tear up, as the full realization of having just been entirely swallowed alive, by his own dear friend (and yet, rival) for that matter, was further sinking in. He could feel the vicinity around him, smell the decaying scent of popcorn and faded aromas of past foods ingested at earlier times, and hear the horrible, wet, slushy, organic noises echoing around him, within the room and outside of the room, even hearing blood flow around the stomach. It all really sent him into an instinctive, primal-driven madness to escape, just as any animal would have in that given situation. With all his instincts telling him to survive, he ran up to the stomach walls, shoes splashing in the bile and unidentified mixture of juices below, and began banging on them with all his might, crying out, \"TAKERU, NO! You gotta let me out! Please!!\" he screamed at the top of his voice, even using TK's full name, \"Let me out!!!\" Takeru from the outside, however, simply felt almost a \"bubbling\" coming from within his belly, in which he just merely shrugged it off with much thought. He even placed his hand on his stomach afterward, feeling it and rubbing it, in unison of all the delicious popcorn he had just consumed. Davis felt TK's hand place against the wall from the outside and was even pushed back a bit from the knock-back. He was beginning to sweat profusely from the humidity within the youngest Takaishi boy's tummy and even began panting from it, too, but also from having used up a lot of what little energy he had left in his small, now unstable body (also from not having eaten much of anything to eat at all as well).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood there, shivering in complete exasperation and eyes widened with grief in finding it hard to fully comprehend the current role he served, which was to end his life as Takeru's snack, inescapable memories suddenly starting flooding to him. He remembered the first time he had ever even met Takeru, in which the blond's first words to him were: \"You look familiar\" (having thought of him as a Tai look-a-like back then), and he remembered how the rivalry between them even all started. It was mainly because of Kari, the girl he liked. He then starting feeling small waves of the fluid sunk below his feet start to splash up against the sides of his legs and him. He looked around the room, noticing a subtle change within the darkness of the mucus-coated organ. Piles of grinded popcorn were being motioned back and forth, and Davis could feel himself being brought into the movement as well. Digestive peristaltic contractions were beginning, which were essentially to help break down the food that was about. Davis tried to maintain his stance, but was then thrown into the waters with a splash. He tried to get up, gasping and pleaing for help, but all to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGastric glands lining the walls began secreting the hydrochloric acid and enzymes, along with mucus to lubricate and protect the stomach walls themselves, that would help to break down the food in the room into the liquid below, in which Davis began feeling a slight tingling on his body, especially along his chest and back (as he was not wearing a shirt anymore). He couldn't even find himself being able to get up anymore, due to lack of energy and the actual toxic atmosphere around him, physically weakening him more and more by the moment. Piles of popcorn being flown around in the cramped room like a washing machine, along with the flow of stomach juices, mixing it all together in a big, soup-like mixture. Davis' eyes were beginning to slowly close in on him, as the tossing and turning of the digestive process within the belly itself was alone lethal to his frail, delicate frame. Realizing there was no escape, he lost all will to continue and only sighed softly now. If only Takeru had known, he thought. Still, at least he was giving up his life for a friend, even if it wasn't much he was giving... Perhaps a tiny bit of energy more than what Takeru would've gained without him in the popcorn, but he still accepted it as it was. Finally letting nature take its course and closing his eyes, he feel into a deep, deep sleep, as he and the food would be soon mixed into the bath of acid, bile, etc., and, over time, developed into chyme, which would later pass through TK's small intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru, from the outside, continued to watch his movie, a hand etched over his flat belly, which gurgled noisily to the food it was processing. TK felt a bubble rise up to his throat and he burped loudly. Patamon looked up and threw a kernel at him. \"Hey, that's gross!\" Patamon snickered. TK laughed, \"Sorry, must've been something I ate...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright and sunny day in the town of Namimori. The sky was clear, the birds were chirping, and the humidity was just right. All in all it was an overall excellent day to be alive. On this perfect day, Takeshi Yamamoto walked down the sidewalk with a big smile on his face. The black haired teen was dressed in a white buttoned-up shirt over a plain red t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans held up by a black belt, and a pair of black sandals. Slung over his left shoulder was his backpack; a wooden baseball bat poking out of it. The middle schooler was having a pretty decent day; he had aced two tests at school and his baseball team had won a game by an impressive margin. As he headed for Tsuna\u2019s house to hang out with his friends, he wondered how this day could get any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know, his great day was about to do a one eighty and go right down the gutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? What\u2019s that?\u201d Yamamoto suddenly mumbled after taking a sip of milk from a plastic bottle in his right hand. To his left, across the street, was a group of three high school students talking in an alleyway. Two of them seemed to be grouped around the third, but Yamamoto didn\u2019t have a good line of sight to see why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, careful where you point that! It\u2019s a gun, you know!\u201d one of them \u201cwhispered\u201d, though Yamamoto could hear him perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it even loaded? Why was it just lying on the ground here?\u201d another one asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow should I know? I doubt it\u2019s even real\u2026I mean look it at!\u201d responded the third person. Upon overhearing their conversation, Yamamoto considered facing the trio of older boys. Judging by their rambling, one of them was holding a gun and that\u2019s NOT something one should be carrying on the streets. However, when two of the young men stepped away from the gun holder, the Rain Ring Guardian\u2019s expression quickly changed into a goofy smile. The \u201cgun\u201d the three were looking at was a shiny red and decorated with yellow bulbs and wires. It didn\u2019t take perfect vision to realize it was just a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, a little old to be playing with toy guns\u2026\u201d Yamamoto said under his breath before chuckling and continuing his walk to Tsuna\u2019s residence. After taking just two steps, however, the trigger on the gun was pushed and it fired. A glowing red bullet, but still a very real bullet, was shot out of the gun\u2019s barrel and hit the fourteen year-old right in the side of the head. His bottle of milk fell to the ground and spilt just as Yamamoto smacked into the fence he was walking by and slumped to the ground; apparently dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit! I think you just killed that guy, dude!\u201d one of the older teens cried before he broke out into a run. His two friends followed in a similar panic; leaving both the red gun and Yamamoto behind. No one else was around and thus no one bore witness to what happened next. The wound in Yamamoto\u2019s head glowed crimson and the glow spread around his entire being. Once his entire unconscious body was glowing, it started to reduce in size. Smaller and smaller the young teenager shrank until the glow faded and he was only a mere centimeter in height; barely an insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What happened\u2026?\u201d Yamamoto mumbled to himself as he awoke moments later, sitting up and touching the place he had felt a bullet hit. When he looked at his palm, however, he saw no blood at all. \u201cI swore I got shot\u2026what\u2026?\u201d The baseball nut\u2019s brown eyes widened in shock when he got a look around. No longer was he standing on a sidewalk, but a landscape of concrete! The chain fence next to him rose for miles into the sky and the blades of grass the poked out of the chipped concrete loomed over him like trees. As the shrunken Vongola was still getting his fill of the breathtaking sight, his ears picked up the sound of rushing water. Looking straight ahead, Takeshi spotted his now massive (and empty) bottle of milk a ways away. The cold, white liquid was still leaking out of it and created a small trail of milk to a crack in the sidewalk. To the speck-sized Yamamoto, however, the trail seemed like a river and the crack a ditch he would need to leap over to cross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026I\u2019m REALLY tiny.\u201d The Japanese boy chuckled and scratched the back of his head. \u201cThis could be a problem\u2026at least no one\u2019s around.\u201d Soon after saying those words, he had jinxed them. The concrete dust (looked more like pebbles to him) started to hop up and down as slight tremors were sent through the ground. Yamamoto\u2019s brown orbs gazed into the distance and he spotted a figure approaching him. They were still far in the distance according to the athlete\u2019s perspective, but they were quickly approaching and would be on top of him in under a minute. Most importantly, this figure was\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Ryohei Sasagawa, the 10th Vongola Sun Guardian and upperclassman to Yamamoto and his friends, strolled down the sidewalk. The approaching teen appeared to be having a good day as well as he waltzed along in his tan V-neck shirt and black jeans. Buried in his ears was a pair of headphones jacked into an iPod hidden in his pocket. The middle school student appeared very carefree; his eyes partially closed as his lips mouthed the lyrics to the song he was listening to. Occasionally he would even voice his favorite lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock \u2018em down, Mess \u2018em up! Send them packing with your trump!\u201d Ryohei chanted as he stomped his white sneakers against the ground to the beat and swung his bandaged hands in front of him as if fighting someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Senpai! What a coincidence!\u201d Yamamoto exclaimed, happy to see a familer face\u2026even though that familer face was now a giant to him. Ryohei was walking in the opposite direction Yamamoto had been going; the two of them probably would have passed each other if the young baseball player hadn\u2019t shrunk, but now Ryohei had no idea he was even there. \u201cSENPAI! DOWN HERE!\u201d Yamamoto shouted as loud as he could as he waved his arms over his head. The larger Guardian took no notice, however, and just kept on walking toward the shrunken Rain Guardian. The tiny boy continued to shout, but his cries slowly trailed off into silence. He had stopped not only because his efforts were proving futile, but every second he wasted brought Ryohei closer and closer to him. The centimeter-tall Yamamoto started craning his neck back as he realized how unbelievably huge his upperclassman really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gray haired male was like a titan pulled straight out of a Greek myth. He towered larger than Yamamoto like some kind of higher being and the smaller male couldn\u2019t help but feel a little intimidated by the approaching behemoth. His white sneakers sent tremors through the sidewalk and made the tiny, younger boy wobble. These were just his normal footsteps too! Every now and then the muscular boxer would stomp his feet in unison with the beat of his music and send even stronger quakes through the concrete; quakes that only someone as itty-bitty as Yamamoto could feel. The last mighty stomp sent Yamamoto off his balance and he fell onto his rump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026wow, it\u2019s like Senpai isn\u2019t even a human being anymore!\u201d Yamamoto noted as he rubbed his butt through his jeans. A moment later one of Ryohei\u2019s massive shoes came down on Yamamoto\u2019s empty milk bottle; crushing it flat without the fifteen year-old noticing. The black haired micro winced at the loud sound of crunching plastic and made note not to end up underneath one of those lethal stompers. However, as he thought this, he failed to realize this action meant the looming giant was just a couple steps away from him! When he DID realize the living mountain was dangerously close, he was just one step away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-oh!\u201d shouted Takeshi as he jumped to his feet and raced toward the left. He was much too late, however, and the giant of a boy took a step that placed his gargantuan foot directly over Yamamoto. The swordsman\u2019s pupils dilated as he gazed up at the dirty trends of Ryohei\u2019s shoe quickly coming down on him! \u201cNO! Senpai, don\u2019t step on-!\u201d Yamamoto, his usually calm voice full of fear, wasn\u2019t able to finish the sentence before Ryohei\u2019s foot came down with a deafening THOOM. Yamamoto\u2019s tiny form disappeared underneath the colossal foot, apparently crushed flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah~ Yeah~ Smash \u2018em up good!\u201d the energetic teen sang just as he unknowingly stepped on his fellow Vongola. The boxer snapped his fingers with his right hand and punched the air with his left. As that white shoe picked up again, one would think the bottom sported a new stain, but this was not the case. The shrunken teenager was still very much alive; his miniscule form having been caught between the trends of Ryohei\u2019s shoe and plastered into a glob of pink gum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That was a little too close for comfort\u2026\u201d the shaken up teen admitted as he watched the ground rapidly zoom away as Ryohei raised his foot and then speed toward him as the foot touched down. Each time Yamamoto\u2019s ears popped from the loud boom of the footstep and each time his handsome face came inches from being smeared into he concrete. The athlete tried to keep his cool and not move too much; he didn\u2019t want to get dislodged from the gum at the wrong time and really end up smashed to death. For now all he could do was wait motionlessly for his chance to get free...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While a little shaken up and dazed after his close encounter with death, Yamamoto was relatively unharmed. That wasn\u2019t to say his pride didn\u2019t sting a little bit, however. He was the tall, Number 1 athlete at school and a fairly popular kid, and yet here he was stuck between the shoe trends of another guy like a piece of lint. All around him was the smell of burnt rubber from Ryohei\u2019s shoes stomping down on the warm concrete so much. The constant up and down motion of the foot was beginning to make the black haired teen nauseous as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026Senpai\u2026*THOOM*\u2026if you could\u2026*THOOM*\u2026stop soon, that\u2019d be great\u2026*THOOM*\u2026hehe.\u201d Yamamoto mumbled, knowing full well Ryohei wouldn\u2019t be hearing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny swordsman\u2019s wish was granted after another five minutes of walking when the gray haired boxer arrived at the front door to his house. Upon entering, Ryohei popped out his earphones and stuffed them into his pocket with his iPod. He then took a seat on the single, small step in front of the entrance and started prying off one of his shoes. The shrunken Yamamoto\u2019s entire world shook as Ryohei gripped his shoe with his strong hands and pulled it off; flexing his socked toes once they were free. The Vongola then raised his shoe to his face and inspected the bottom of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! I knew I stepped on a few things...to the extreme!\u201d Ryohei exclaimed as his huge black orbs homed in on Yamamoto and the pink gum. The much, much smaller teen was taken by surprise when the humongous, manly face of the older male took up his entire vision.  Yamamoto\u2019s body vibrated when Ryohei spoke so close to him and his mere breath pushed him further into the gum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Senpai! I\u2019m glad you noticed me!\u201d Yamamoto shouted as he smiled thankfully. \u201cYou almost stepped on me like a bug back there; that would have been messy\u2026hehe.\u201d The Japanese boy chuckled, but if Ryohei had heard him he showed no signs of it. Instead the titan of a male took a quick moment to glance over the rest of his shoe before his impossibly huge, muscular index finger appeared. Yamamoto watched as Ryohei started using his fingernail to dig out the dirty piece of gum. He gazed up at the nail, looking like a huge ceiling to him, and assumed Ryohei was helping him free. That assumption was quickly tossed out the window when the giant middle schooler plucked the gum out and, without a second glance, flicked it away like the bothersome trash it was. He then proceeded to take off his other sneaker and examined it for any stuck objects as we. Soon he was picking out the squashed corpses of a few bugs that weren\u2019t as fortunate as Yamamoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Yamamoto, the shrunken boy was currently zipping through the air like a jet plane. He fully expected to go splat against a wall or something, but as luck would have it his body became unstuck from the sticky gum in midair. He then fell down a short distance before landing in a forest of carpet tufts. The teen hissed in pain a little as he stood up, clutching his arm which had suffered a minor rug burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother close one\u2026this is kind of dangerous.\u201d Yamamoto stated with another one of his laughs. As the centimeter tall boy gazed around the tall carpet fibers around him he quickly felt a series of familer quakes. Looking up, Yamamoto watched through his brown eyes as the towering, godly form of Ryohei passed him. Luckily the small teen wasn\u2019t in his path this time. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m in Ryohei\u2019s house now\u2026\u201d Yamamoto suddenly realized he felt a lot lighter. Looking behind him, the Rain Ring Guardian discovered it was due to his lack of a backpack. \u201cCrap! That had my favorite bat in it\u2026and my homework too! Damn\u2026\u201d Yamamoto sighed and took a quick glance around. As expected, his bag wasn\u2019t anywhere nearby. It was probably still stuck to that piece of gum and had thus been carried off somewhere else in this maze of a rug. In other words, Yamamoto wasn\u2019t going to be seeing it again\u2026 \u201cThis day\u2019s starting to go downhill\u2026I should find Yamamoto and get back to normal size before it gets worse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his objective clear, to gain the titanic Ryohei\u2019s attention, Yamamoto started trekking through the rug; heading in the direction he had witness Ryohei go. What would have taken a normal person like Ryohei a few seconds to cross took Yamamoto about an hour! By time he finally pushed himself out of the rug maze and out into a hall of some sort, he was short on breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s\u2026a chore at this size.\u201d mumbled the spiky haired teenager as he touched his knees and took a moment to catch his breath. \u201cAt least it\u2019s a good workout~\u201d Taking a deep breath, Yamamoto surveyed over his new surroundings and made note of two nearby doors that were open. Ryohei might have been beyond one of them, but they were across from each other and it\u2019d be another long trek to either of them. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to pick one. I hope I\u2019m right\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yamamoto stood there for a moment to think. His gut told him to go with the right door and so to the right he ran. One would have to know the tiny Yamamoto was there to notice his speck-sized body dash along the wooden floor. Several minutes passed and Yamamoto was still running toward the open door; still only halfway there. Not wanting to miss Ryohei if he was right, the athletic teen pushed his leg muscles to the limit as he ran even faster toward his destination. Within several more minutes he finally arrived in front of the massive entry way; panting like a dog and looking at the ground while his palms rested on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure hope this is Senpai\u2019s bedroom\u2026\u201d Yamamoto whispered to himself, figuring that would be the only room Ryohei would spend so much time in. When the shrunken baseball player recovered and looked up, the hope in his face seemed to dissipate. It was not Ryohei\u2019s room, but a bathroom; an empty bathroom to boot. \u201cFigures\u2026\u201d Yamamoto sighed and wiped some sweat off his forehead. For some reason the bathroom door was wide open and the light inside turned on. Perhaps Ryohei had made a quick stop in it while he was busy trekking through the rug or maybe someone else in the house had left it open. Speaking of someone else, Yamamoto hadn\u2019t seen or heard anyone but Ryohei. There were no signs of his sister, Kyoko, or their parents anywhere. Perhaps they were somewhere else in the house or not even home\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I have no choice but to search the house for someone.\u201d Yamamoto explained to himself as he turned around, intending on taking a peek into the opened door across from him first. This door was only open a crack, but it was more than enough for Yamamoto\u2019s small size to enter through. Before he could take a single step, however, the door suddenly swung open all the way and someone stepped out. It was, of course, Ryohei, but something was different this time. At some point since he got home, Ryohei had discarded his V-neck shirt and now walked around the house bare chested. Perhaps he just found it more comfortable or he had just been in the middle of an exercise routine. The towering teen\u2019s incredibly toned and muscular torso didn\u2019t sport a drop of sweat, however, so either that guess was wrong or he hadn\u2019t yet broken a sweat. What Yamamoto DID know for sure, however, was that the massive boxer was once again stomping his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSENPAI! SENPAAAAAI!\u201d shouted the young jock with all his vocal power, hoping the giant would hear him without those headphones in his ears. Unfortunately, the teenager was just too puny for his voice to reach all the way up to the larger male\u2019s ears. Those socked feet continued to stomp toward the bathroom; each footstep hinting at the heavy power Yamamoto would be caught under if one of those feet landed on him. With a face full of worry he tried to dodge again, but this time it would appear he had no need to do so. The 15 year-old titan passed right over the 14 year-old, Yamamoto almost falling backwards when he tried to crane his neck far enough to keep his eyes focused on the giant\u2019s face. \u201cHey, wait up!\u201d Yamamoto called as he ran after the moving, shirtless mountain of a boy. Just then one of Ryohei\u2019s hands pushed on the open door to close it behind him. Yamamoto\u2019s eyes bulged when he saw the huge, wooden frame of the door speeding toward him. Thinking fast the miniscule swordsman fell to his stomach and pressed himself flat against the cold floor; the door passing harmlessly over him. It was yet another close call, however, as Yamamoto felt the door touch the tip of his hair as it sped past him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was out of danger for the moment, the pint-sized Guardian stood to his feet and watched the bronze god that was the Sun Ring Guardian walk further away from him. His bathroom was average in size; sporting a tiled floor, a sink below a mirror, a toilet next to it, and a bathtub across from both. As the oblivious giant passed the mirror he came to a stop and looked into it with his black orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking good, to the extreme!\u201d Ryohei exclaimed as he examined his youthful face in the mirror. He then faced it completely and flexed both his arms; his biceps peaking like small hills of pure power. A wide grin formed on the musclehead\u2019s face as he continued to pose in front of the mirror. His tiny guest could just laugh and rub the back of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026I wish he would pay as much attention to me as he did his body.\u201d the black haired youth stated as he broke out into another run. As the shrunken athlete struggled to get to Ryohei, the titan spent an entire minute checking on the condition of almost every muscle in his upper body. When he was in the process of flexing his back, realization dawned on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops! I almost forgot why I came in here! EXTREME distraction!\u201d Ryohei bellowed with laughter befor reaching down and unzipping his black jeans. Yamamoto watched from the floor below as Ryohei then grabbed his jeans by the rim and tugged them down with his boxers in tow. The smaller teen\u2019s mouth fell open when Ryohei\u2019s bare, firm ass was revealed. He had seen plenty of naked guys in the locker room, but this was the first time one of them towered over him like an Adonis! The titanic fighter was just bigger than him in every way possible; the lack of clothes further showing this. A blush of embarrassment appeared on Yamamoto\u2019s face, but he shook it away and kept on jogging. This was no time to be intimidated by the nude giant; he needed to get Ryohei\u2019s attention no matter what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope Senpai doesn\u2019t get the wrong idea when he finds me...\u201d mumbled the speck of a boy. Suddenly, Ryohei started to move\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With his jeans and boxers looped around his ankles, Ryohei shuffled himself over to the nearby toilet. Far on the tiled floor below, Yamamoto watched as the titanic boxer lifted the seat and parked his bare rump upon the toiled with a thump. The young baseball player\u2019s eyes immediately widened with recognition and shock while Ryohei swiveled his ass into the toilet seat for comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026he\u2019s gonna\u2026\u201d As if on cue, the sound of a loud fart blasted through the bathroom like a foghorn. Following this was a short delay and then the sound of something big and solid dropping into water underneath the naked Ryohei. Yamamoto\u2019s mouth twitched and his face grew pale as a few smaller splashes could be heard after this. The shrunken Rain Guardian stopped dead in his tracks and glanced back at the huge door behind him; perhaps he could get Ryohei\u2019s attention at a\u2026different time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it was much too late for that. By the time he made it back to the door and slipped underneath the crack at the bottom, Ryohei would have been finished already. Sighing, the black haired teen looked back up at his relaxed buddy as he sat upon his milky white throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026I\u2019ll have to apologize to Senpai for witnessing this until the end of time.\u201d Yamamoto told himself with a groan. His face made an expression that showed he was NOT looking forward to that before he once again took off running. While he didn\u2019t like being in the bathroom while Ryohei was taking a shit, he couldn\u2019t lose this opportunity to earn the gray haired male\u2019s notice! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t have had all that pizza for dinner last night!\u201d exclaimed the Sun Guardian as he touched his chiseled abdominals with one hand. With a grunt the teenager released another wet log of fresh waste into the toilet. \u201cIt got me really packed\u2026to the extreme!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about a minute for tiny Yamamoto to make it all the way to Ryohei\u2019s socked foot. That time was filled with the sounds of the older giant grunting and releasing bombshell after bombshell of his digested supper into the toilet bowl. Yamamoto kept his head down as he ran and tried to ignore the gut-wrenching sounds coming from the huge male. When he finally arrived below the seated titan and next to his right foot, the smaller boy gazed up at it like a massive structure of white cotton. Occasionally it would move as Ryohei casually curled his toes within the warm sock. Not wasting any time, Yamamoto began bashing his fists into Ryohei\u2019s foot, hoping the giant would feel them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSenpai! Down here, Senpai!\u201d cried the shrunken lad as he looked up at the looming god of a boy. All he witnessed the giant do was grab his knees and grunt through his teeth as another thick log of scat was pushed out from between his muscled cheeks. A rumbling fart came with this one and it all made Yamamoto turn green with repulsion. \u201cI know you\u2019re\u2026busy, Senpai, but PLEASE LOOK DOWN!\u201d cried the middle schooler as he punched with all his strength. His feeble fists couldn\u2019t even make it past the white barrier around Ryohei\u2019s foot, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, the Sun Ring holder flexed his sphincter a bit and upon noticing the pain in his lower abdomen was gone concluded his business was finished. He reached an arm to his left to grab a few sheets of toilet paper, but in his hurry he accidentally yanked too hard and like a white snake the toilet paper started coming off the roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d Ryohei exclaimed as he stopped the spinning cardboard roll with a hand, but by then a fair amount of toilet paper had fallen to the ground around his feet. \u201cGreat\u2026Kyoko hates it when I waste toilet paper too. She\u2019ll be EXTREMELY angry for sure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Yamamoto buried his fist into the soft cotton of Ryohei\u2019s sock once more before grumbling in defeat. After all his effort, Ryohei still hadn\u2019t discovered his centimeter sized body right next to his foot. It was very disheartening\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026maybe if I tried challenging him to a boxing match?\u201d The teen pondered as he scratched his smooth chin. All of a sudden he heard Ryohei curse above him and looked up just in time to see the falling toilet paper descending toward him. Now, it was just toilet paper, so Yamamoto didn\u2019t appear that worried. Even at his reduced size where the thin paper would be heavier, it was still nothing that could hurt him. Therefore he didn\u2019t put a whole lot of effort into trying to avoid the white paper; he merely jogged to the side while keeping his brown eyes on the plummeting sheets. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yamamoto wasn\u2019t able to escape in time; in a second his miniscule body was buried underneath the white toilet paper. As expected, at his size even mere toilet paper was enough to weigh him down slightly. At first it was just a minor annoyance as the young athlete struggled underneath the heavy paper and slowly made his way toward freedom. However, the minor trouble soon turned life threatening when the towering, nude form of Ryohei stood up and reach down for the fallen rope of thin paper. Yamamoto wasn\u2019t sure what was going on at first as his speck of an existence was bundled up with the toilet paper and lifted up in Ryohei\u2019s large hands. The giant used both his hands to compress the paper into a single, packed lump. As he held the toilet paper in his hand, he was completely unaware of the itty-bitty Yamamoto trapped within its folds somewhere on the outer edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d Yamamoto mumbled as the world stopped spinning around him. The sudden movement of being picked up and rolled around in Ryohei\u2019s hands had disoriented and he was just now figuring out he was trapped in a handful of toilet paper. \u201cU-Uhhm\u2026S-Senpai?\u201d Yamamoto tried to look around for Ryohei\u2019s face, but all he could make out were parts of the titan\u2019s gargantuan body as the boxer started moving the toilet paper. Then, as Ryohei moved the bundle of clean paper behind him, Yamamoto saw the landscape that was the older teen\u2019s bare ass. His brown eyes widened as he watched Ryohei\u2019s muscular cheeks part a little like the opening of a canyon. Then the gray haired giant shoved the handful of paper forward\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto was at a loss for words. Just seconds ago he was within fresh air and perfectly fine, but then Ryohei had thrust the toilet paper between his cheeks and started to wipe. Instantly Yamamoto\u2019s shrunken form was pressed against a dirty, ungodly smelling wall within Ryohei\u2019s ass and the giant started rubbing the ball of paper up and down and all around his anus. The baseball player\u2019s eyes rolled into the back of his head as the smell of pure shit invaded his nose and his body was being covered in just that. He opened his mouth to scream, but that proved to be a massive mistake. At that moment his face was pushed against the scat covered wall of flesh and his lips kissed it. The young mafia member\u2019s face turned pale and tears started to stream down from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Senpai\u2026\u201d Yamamoto whispered as if he could reach the giant from deep within his behind. Ryohei merely whistled to himself and twisted the toilet paper between his cheeks, hoping to clean out as much of last night\u2019s supper as possible. Soon the once white ball of paper was stained brown and the little passenger it carried was bound firmly to it. His carefree outlook on this whole shrunken situation seemed to evaporate as all he wanted now was to be back to normal. Anything would be better than enduring this absolute humiliating torture; even fighting ten Squalos and ten Genkishis! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what must have seemed like hours to poor Yamamoto, Ryohei gave his ass one last firm wipe before taking the bundle of toilet paper out. Before it got too far away, however, the teenage giant lifted his leg a bit and unleashed one last mighty fart. This time Yamamoto didn\u2019t just hear it; its eggy stench forced its way up his nose and he silently screamed within the toxic air. None the wiser to his fellow Guardian\u2019s misery, Ryohei casually dropped the paper into the toilet and pulled his boxers and jeans back up to his waist. As for Yamamoto\u2026</span></div></div>",

Slowly it softened in the water and became a soggy, filthy lump on its surface. Yamamoto was trapped on the part of the lump that faced up at Ryohei and he struggled weakly against his sticky, brownish prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSENPAI!\u201d Yamamoto shouted as he shivered due to the cold toilet water. He tried to free himself from the toilet paper, but his tiny and weak body was sealed to the wet paper by tons of wet and dry waste. It was the most disgusting thing Yamamoto had ever had to endure and he couldn\u2019t help but weep a bit at his sorrowful state. Unknown to him, it was about to get loads worse\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, think I forgot something\u2026to the extreme!\u201d came Ryohei\u2019s loud voice above. The black haired baseball player gazed up at the looming, shirtless titan as he gripped his crotch and squeezed it through his black jeans. Yamamoto\u2019s face was the exact opposite of Ryohei\u2019s, a wide grin, as the larger male reached into his still-unzipped pants and yanked out his cock. It was soft in his big hand, but Yamamoto could tell Ryohei possessed impressive girth. That\u2019s not what he was thinking about at the moment, however! He was far more concerned about what the gray haired boy was planning to do with that thick member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer his question, Ryohei\u2019s cock slit seemed to open wide like a black eye. A second later, a torrent of yellow piss erupted forth from the huge penis and descended into the toilet bowl. For the boxer it was a normal, uninteresting action, but for Yamamoto it was so much more. The golden stream hit the clump of toilet paper and Yamamoto dead on like a fire hose. The sheer force of the urine knocked Yamamoto free of the toilet paper and blasted him away. The young teen landed far near the edge of the toilet bowl; sinking into the filthy water a bit. He held his breath and upon recovering from his daze, a result of being hit with such a powerful force and sent flying, swam to the surface. Yamamoto gasped for air upon emerging, but the air within the toilet was anything but fresh and he found himself cough and hacking up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026can\u2019t be happening.\u201d the brown haired Rain Guardian mumbled between coughs as he watched what was going on in the distance. Ryohei was still totally unaware of his presence; the muscle-bound titan just looked down into the toilet while he pissed on the ball of toilet paper. The acidic, hot liquid quickly turned the lump of paper yellow and it grew soft and moldy. Yamamoto also noticed the water he floated in was starting to turn warmer as a murky yellow color was added to its dirty brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I gotta get out of here. Now!\u201d Yamamoto told himself as he started swimming to the nearby edge; a massive wall of marble to him. Once he reached it, the ant-sized male tried to scale up it, but it was a useless attempt. The sides of the toilet were just too smooth and moist for Yamamoto to get any kind of grip. After clawing at the smooth white fruitlessly for a few seconds, the Japanese teen heard Ryohei\u2019s urinating start to slow down. The mighty stream of liquid gold became a trickle until just a few drops fell into the bowl. After this Ryohei let out an audible sigh and tucked his penis back into his jeans; zipping them up. With his business concluded, Yamamoto knew of only one thing that could happen next\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSENPAI, NO!\u201d the shrunken teen screamed up from his murky, cesspool of a prison. \u201cD-Don\u2019t flush! I don\u2019t wanna die like this!!\u201d Tears streamed down the Guardian\u2019s cheeks as he realized the humiliating, revolting fate that awaited him. He, like anyone else, did not desire such an end and thus he screamed and cried. The calm, easygoing Yamamoto seemed like a distant memory as the athlete sniveled and shouted while he choked on the fumes that surrounded him. \u201cP-Please\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even looking into the bowl while Yamamoto cried his heart out, Ryohei dropped the toilet seat with a loud THUMP and engulfed Yamamoto in hellish, rank darkness. He waited there for what seemed like forever; listening to his own frantic breathing. Then it happened: the deafening roaring. Yamamoto screamed, but the terrible roaring all around him masked all hints of his voice. The normally calm waters inside the toilet quickly became a whirlpool and Yamamoto, despite his best efforts to swim against the current, was easily dragged screaming underneath the waters. A moment later the contents of the toilet disappeared down the drain and the bowl filled with crystal clear water\u2026as if nothing had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny teenage swordsman covered his mouth and nose with his hands as his helpless form was swept through the pipes underneath Ryohei\u2019s house. All around him was the awful concoction of Ryohei\u2019s liquefied shit and his urine. He knew that if he opened his mouth it would be the end, but the hell ride seemed to go on forever!  Yamamoto\u2019s face turned blue and he could no longer hold his breath. His mouth opened with a gasp and instantly Ryohei\u2019s bodily wastes poured into his lungs. It was a slow and agonizing demise; the smell and taste of utter crap being the last thing Yamamoto ever sensed. Eventually the unfortunate, shrunken victim drowned within the filth of the bigger, superior man; his eyes turning completely white as his lifeless body was pulled down into the sewers with the rest of the insignificant crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the bathroom, Ryohei whistled to himself as he stepped in front of the sink and washed his hands really good. Once they were dried off he gave his reflection a bright smile and a thumbs-up before making his way out of the bathroom to continue this perfect day. Never did the young boxer realize he had sent Yamamoto and his own perfect day down the gutter\u2026literally. </span></div></div>",

He had trained in using more of One For All, managing to get a good amount without any of his bones breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a comment made by Bakugou was stuck in his head. The blond was being his usual aggressive self and called Izuku an insect. It didn't bother Izuku but rather stayed stuck in his head for some reason, as if telling him something about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on that's ridiculous, Kacchan was just being his usual self!\", Izuku grinned as he prepared to enter school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile hidden away was a mysterious figure shrouded in darkness. Putting a hand to his earpiece the man spoke. \"I see the mosshead, you sure you want me to use my quirk now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familar raspy voice came through the device, it was that of Tomura Shigaraki. \"Yes hurry up, i want you to capture him! Bring him here so that i can crush him and All Might's hope!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure sighed. \"Alright i get it, I'll be back in 20.\", turning off the earpiece, the dark figure pointed his finger at Izuku's form about to turn into U.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small concentrated beam shot out and flew towards the student. Izuku gasped as he felt light headed all of a sudden and fell forward, feeling as if the world was shifting. The figure sighed as he was successfully, however he cursed as another figure approached the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit i can't blow my cover, and if the boss doesn't get to crush him then I'm dust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku groaned as he opened his eyes, still feeling dizzy from his fall. However immediately something was wrong as the ground felt different, as if the material was more...close up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving his vision clear, Izuku gasped in shock as looming into the sky was the gate to U.A looking as big as a bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why is that so huge?! Or did i shrink?\", Izuku mumbled in terror at the sudden shift in his size, was it a quirk, a dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could panic more the ground began to shake, not like an earthquake but like that of...steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow soon covered Izuku and the greenette looked in both fear and awe as looming over was...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Anime is littered with many different characters. Most of these characters are heroes destined for great things. They believe they\u2019ll survive every obstacle, beat the bad guys, and save the day. However, what if they were faced with their \u201cbiggest\u201d challenge yet: Shrinking? Would these Big Damn Heroes still come out on top when they\u2019re the size of ants? Or do their true destinies take place on the bottom of someone\u2019s foot? It\u2019s all up to you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~Rules~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This is strictly a male/male interactive. No girls can shrink and no girls can interact with the shrunken character(s). They can still be there, but keep them away from the shrinkies. If you don\u2019t like it go find a GTS interactive. There\u2019s plenty of them here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. This is a completely unaware interactive. This means the shrunken character(s) can never be found or noticed by the giants (unless they are mistaken for bugs, in which case go crazy). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The shrunken characters in this interactive are REALLY tiny. Do not make them any more than an inch tall. We want to make the chances of them getting help as close to zero as possible. &gt;:3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. All chapters (save for choice chapters) must be of decent length (at least a paragraph) and have good grammar. Any chapter that looks too short or looks like it was written by some who\u2019s never heard of punctuation will be deleted. I\u2019m not gonna spell check your additions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. This is an anime only interactive. As long as there\u2019s an anime (or manga) of it, you can add it here. Do not add any characters from the real world or \u201cWestern Anime\u201d like Ben 10 or Avatar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. <b>VERY IMPORTANT: Choice Chapters</b> Choice chapters are important. They\u2019re how all the plotlines begin. However, do not flood the interactive with them. After choosing who the \u201clucky\u201d shrinkie is gonna be, do not take five chapters to decide who the first giant they encounter is. Also, and this is even more important, do not add ONLY choice chapters. After adding one or more choice chapters you must then add a REAL chapter to the interactive; either to one of your own choice chapters or anywhere else in the interactive. If I see someone has added a choice chapter, but not a real chapter and several hours have passed I will delete the choice chapter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s it. As long as you follow the above rules you may add anything else to the interactive. Almost everything is allowed; even stuff like hard vore, bathroom stuff, and sexual stuff. You can make the shrinkies find a way to return to normal\u2026or give them a very humiliating demise. &gt;:3</td>",
