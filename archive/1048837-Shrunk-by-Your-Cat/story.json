For six years, a truly great expanse of time for a cat, you had spent every day with your \"beloved\" owner. For every moment the two of you were together a single thought radiated within your mind, to someday devour him. Indeed you were far from an ordanary feline. As Phil stared in surprise, he was obviously taken aback by the intensity of your gaze, you slowly traced your tongue along the skin of his arm. This had been enough on all of the countless occasions in which your hunger reared up, but this time it was not enough. Nothing would satisfying you but to consume ever last bit of him. For a moment you considered just eatening him right off, but you pushed away such thoughts immediatly. As a cat your greatest joy was in the act of toying with your meals, and for six long years you had plotted out games with which to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the licking had calmed Phil somewhat you could tell that he was still unnerved, you would need to act fast. With a joyful yowl you leaps up, startling Phil greatly, and began the first stage of your new games.</span></div></div>",

First Phil starts to become covered in fur, then his bones, skin, and overall body shape turn into that of a mouse, finally Phil starts to shrink to the size of a mouse. You stand over you owner admiring his new rodent form. Phil shakes his head has he snaps out of the trance, looks up and sees you towering over him licking your lips. Phil seems to be puzzled as to why you look like you want to eat him, that is until he looks at his hands... Well paws actually. \"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I've been turned into a mouse.\" He screams in his now high pitched rodent voice.<br>\r\n\"Cat, It's me Phil, your friend. Please, please, don't eat me.\" Phil pleads as he looks up at you magnificent figure.<br>\r\n\"I know it's you Phil and I'm not going to eat you... yet.\"<br>\r\nPhil steps back a bit in shock, \"Ca... Cat, you can ta... talk.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I can.\", you say with a well-duh kind of tone in your voice, \"You just couldn't understand me when you where a human.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Phil replies. \"Well I guess I have nothing to...\", Phil stops as he just realizes you said you were not going to eat him... yet.<br>\r\n\"Cat, when you said you where not going to eat me then add yet at the end you were joking right?\"<br>\r\n\"Afraid not.\"<br>\r\n\"But it's me Phil, you know I'm not a mouse.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, i know, but I plan on eating you regard of if you are a mouse or not.

Someone help me.\" Phil screams at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n\"It's no use to yell, no one else is here and besides even if there was all they would hear is the squeaks of a tiny mouse.\"<br>\r\nThe look of pure horror on the little mouse Phil's face is priceless.<br>\r\n\"Wha... what do you plan to do with me Ca...

Remember, reviews and etc. are a big help, so...lets get to the fun stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Phil, a 16 year old boy who lives with his Mom, 35; brotther, 12; and sister, 20. You also have a cat, named Cat, who's been your best friend since you were 10. He's always been very friendly towards you. He'd lick you, play with you, eat from your hand, etc. What you didnt know, was Cat has always had the desire to eat you. And now he's figured out how. Also, Cat's gender is interchangable unless specified in a chapter. Any 'he' I use is a universal 'he'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the rules. Soft vore, hard vore, unbirth, CV, I dont care much (although I think scat is a bit gross, so keep it to a minimum a'ight?)give the guy at least a chance to live, blah blah blah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I will look after this story at least twice a week. Any submission I deem inappropriate or stupid i.e most one-liners, deviates from the story in a way that makes no sense(Suddenly God comes and shoves you up his butt. He farts, you die and go to Hell...yes someone has written something like that) I will edit or remove. I'm EXTREMLY lenient on what I dont allow though. I mainly want to avoid something like the above example though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a side note, I dont care if the cat isn't the one who gets to eat Phil, but if he doesn't, he'll be out for revenge...cus he's been wanting to get him for a looooong time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, lets get shrunk!<br>\r\n</td>",
