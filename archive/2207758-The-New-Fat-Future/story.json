The governments scramble to maintain control, as suddenly cultures and societies shift to accommodate the change. No one knows what caused the change, or if whatever caused it is truly gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story can take place in the small city of Big Lake when the change suddenly hits. It\u2019s home to a large national snack food company, Herschel\u2019s Eats, and the liberal arts school of Blackwood University. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur five initial protagonists are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Anthony Hartman</b>: a slim freshman at Blackwood University, 19, and part of the 20% that initially survived the blast. He\u2019s from Big Lake, where his mom Regina lives with his sister Kacey. His best  friends are the 260 pound Theodore, who was hit by the blast hard, and the 170 pound Nora, who was also hit. Can he stay slender?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Donna Mildred</b>, a senior at Blackwood who is 21 and now 300 ibs. She\u2019s from Los Angeles, and now she\u2019s ended up as a pear-shaped fatty, unable to cope. He best friends are her roommate, the hispanic Lita and the outspoken head of the slam poetry group Angeleia. What\u2019s her new life like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Michelle DiCiotta</b>, a 27 year old social studies teacher at the local high school, who luckily has only put on a few pounds bumping her up to 170 from 130, a rarity amongst her colleagues. She\u2019s naturally gluttonous though, so watch out! Her star student is the bookish Hana Mae, who was hit hard by the blast, but she also teaches football jock Brad and popular girl (and lesbian) Kim as well. How will she fare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kyle Wattersham</b>, the 35 year old 235 Ibs Dad of the middle school kids Hayden and Johnny, and the local football coach at the high school. Hit hard by the fat wave as were his Dad friends and his wife, Carrie, but he\u2019s trying to work it off. Can he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Anna Lewis</b>, a 35 year old blonde television anchor at the local news affiliate, who avoided the blast at a slender 145 Ibs. Unbeknownst to her puffy colleagues, she\u2019s an FA with a taste for fattening up the people in her life like her news producer Steve. Will she get her medicine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s from Big Lake, where his mom Regina lives with his sister Kacey. His best friends are the 260 pound Theodore, who was hit by the blast hard, and the 170 pound Nora, who was also hit. Can he stay slender?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been three months since the Bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s what everyone was calling it nowadays\u2014the Bulge. Simultaneously sounding much more ominous and yet somehow that much more a natural part of life, the term had quickly caught on after that reporter Anna Lewis had started using it. If it had meant anything other than 80% of people world-wide gaining <i>at least</i> fifty pounds, it might have been cool to know that the term had roots in Big Lake. Maybe not to those afflicted by <i>the Bulge</i> but to the grateful few that were spared, and perhaps the history books, it might have been an interesting fact to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh who was he kidding\u2014if the history books looked at this as anything other than a question mark, it still wouldn\u2019t have been interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the Summer started, Anthony (and the rest of the world, but teenagers are naturally self-centered) had been reeling from the fact that everyone (<i>everyone</i>) that he made regular contact with had gained at least fifty pounds literally overnight. It had happened the night <i>after</i> his high school graduation. Two days <i>before</i> his birthday. A whole month before his sister Kacey\u2019s sixteenth birthday party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, it had just\u2026 <i>happened</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone, of course, except for a lucky few. Himself included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony had never been a particularly stunning-looking guy. He\u2019d never been especially fit or good at anything. He had always just been blessed with a naturally thin physique, like the rest of his family (<i>until now</i>) and he had always just sort of existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had neat blonde hair, blue eyes, and possessed friendly but not especially noteworthy features. Until the day of the Bulge, he had never really seen himself as anything noteworthy. However, now that the world had so quickly expanded overnight, he finally found himself in a strange new demographic that had cropped up just as quickly\u2014the Unbulged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his clothes still fit\u2014his shirts hung off of his lanky frame and his shorts came high up to his mid-thigh without so much as a grunt or struggle to zip them up. His socks weren\u2019t tight around his feet and his shoes still nestled tight around the athletic build of his well-defined ankles. There wasn\u2019t an extra inch of fat around him that hadn\u2019t been there before\u2026 or even since! He\u2019d just kept going as best he could, like the Bulge had never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers, unfortunately, were not so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would still take some getting used to, coming down and seeing his new reality\u2014his mother\u2019s ass now had a wide, swinging berth that made her jelly belly wobble with every awkward step. While most people in the world only manage to gain fifty pounds or so, his mother had been one of the unlucky ones. She\u2019d packed on more than a hundred and fifty pounds overnight, and almost all of it went to her hips. She\u2019d made more than one passing remark about genetics being against his sister and her and, unfortunately, she happened to be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkipping breakfast again?\u201d his mother\u2019s round face pursed in barely suppressed aggression towards her son\u2019s skinny shape, \u201cWhat, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve got a figure to keep up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom.\u201d Anthony sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Mz. Hartman held up her hands in surrender, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, I know, I know, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked her son up and down, weighing his width against her\u2019s and coming up short. She had been a high-profile agent for Beaker &amp; Sachs before the Bulge had happened. Ever since she\u2019d been on a bank of vacation days (granted by a now especially jowly, incredibly turtle-like Mr. Sachs to all those affected by the Bulge) she\u2019d been burning up at home with nothing to do except cook for a body that thought it <i>needed</i> enough calories to support her great, big, bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could at least eat a pancake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, mom.\u201d Anthony grimaced, \u201cMeeting Nora and Teddy before class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat the pancake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, mom\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Uuuugh</i>.\u201d his mother groaned as she leaned her weight into an unsuspecting chair, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m happy for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you are, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fact that you didn\u2019t blow up into a parade float like the rest of us unlucky <i>saps</i> is a great thing!\u201d she gripped her chair tight, fat knuckles whitening as she spoke through gritted teeth, \u201cOr <i>worse</i>! Wind up like your old mom and find out she\u2019s one of the <i>thirty</i> percent who managed to\u2014!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I know, mom.\u201d Anthony wrapped his arm around his mom for a quick, sympathetic hug, \u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019ve gotta\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just when I <i>think</i> about, it I\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooooove yoooooou!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoof, she\u2019s taking it rough.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, do you blame her?\u201d Anthony grimaced as he put both hands on his tray, \u201cEveryone\u2019s a little messed up, but\u2026 I mean, she literally doubled her weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, none of us here would know what that feels like.\u201d Theodore scowled, his double chin creasing as he looked down at what was now his minimum caloric intake, \u201cI mean some of us <i>might come close</i>, buuuut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony and Nora exchanged awkward glances as their big bearded buddy frowned into his breakfast. Two breakfast burritos\u2014fat around as pool noodles\u2014and he knew that he\u2019d probably still be hungry in time for lunch. That was the same story that everyone who\u2019d gained a lot of weight was saying. Even the ones that hadn\u2019t\u2014it was like they\u2019d <i>eaten</i> themselves to that size. Everyone who\u2019d been Bulged sported a big honking appetite, and ol\u2019 Teddy was certainly one of the ones that got Bulged bigger than some others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his dark hair and his vaguely Italian, very handsome features, he\u2019d never been bad looking. Even now that he was just forty pounds shy of the big 3-0-0, he wasn\u2019t ugly. It was just, with his features and his hairstyle and his penchant for baggy dress, he suddenly looked every bit like the fat college frat guy, not even a week into the new semester. Wheras before he\u2019d been eccentric looking\u2014in the best possible way\u2014now he just looked\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, like a great big fat guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Teddy, don\u2019t do that to yourself.\u201d Nora chimed in (managing only <i>one</i> noodle-thick burrito), \u201cYou\u2019re still hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a fat guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a fat guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora had benefited from the bulge a bit more than others. She\u2019d always been a little flat in both departments\u2014puberty had done her some favors, but she\u2019d never been particularly impressive. But now that she\u2019d been Bulged, Nora sported an impressive chest that kept everyone (Anthony and Theodore included) occupied as she transitioned into shirts that were more suited to her size. Sure she had a tummy, and her ass was kind of floppy. But that chest\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That chest</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ho!</i>\u201d Nora clapped her hands together viciously, \u201cWere you two even listening to what I was saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was <i>saying</i> that it could have been a lot worse.\u201d She said bitterly, taking a bite out of her breakfast burrito, \u201cYou know I hear that they had to cut some celebrity out of their house the other day. Some people got <i>huge</i>, guys\u2014you got off easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Teddy rolled his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd <i>you</i> got off super easy.\u201d Nora said with a swat at the back of Anthony\u2019s head, \u201cSkinny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not my new nickname.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh yes it is.\u201d Nora smirked as she took on an ominous tone, \u201cAt least until you catch up with the rest of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think the Bulge isn\u2019t over?\u201d Teddy\u2019s brown eyes widened in shock, terrified of ballooning into an even bigger size overnight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2014I just think that the world\u2019s got a lot to learn about portion control now that everyone\u2019s suddenly <i>at least</i> fifty pounds heavier.\u201d Nora said confidently, \u201cYou Unbulged guys aren\u2019t gonna stay that way for long. Trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward moment of silence as her gaze lingered on Anthony, who exchanged worried glances with Theodore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let me have this one thing, can you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no, I had to buy a whole new wardrobe.\u201d Nora broke her fa\u00e7ade, \u201cNow eat up, twig-boy. We\u2019ve got class.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only good news was that none of the sidewalks were crowded. Everyone who had been Bulged of course found it hard to walk, and the streets were choked with buses. Anthony and Nora walked together, as Theodore had immediately broken off to try and get a coveted double-wide seat on the Campus Shuttle, his wide, thick ass jiggling in his tight jeans as he bounced across the street to the crowded bus stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t much of a time for Nora either, as she kept getting winded and falling behind Anthony\u2019s long strides. She had to frequently jog up alongside him to keep pace, her breasts bouncing. \u201cSlow down!\u201d she said after the fourth time. \u201cWhy (<i>huff</i>) on earth (<i>huff</i>) did we schedule our first class (<i>huff</i>) so far from the dorm hall?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony shrugged. \u201cOne of the few classes that was open, I guess.\u201d Ahead of them on the sidewalk, there was a somewhat large crowd gathering. A heavyset blond senior girl with wide hips who had definitely been Bulged hard was standing uneasily on a cement rail, surrounded by equally heavyset acolytes, male and female. They were listening to her speak quite emphatically about something, and as Anthony got closer he heard \u201c...and now this is our life! Why do we still feel disgusted by our fat bodies when we really should give ourselves some love. Recognize the new world, and accept it in. You are still gorgeous, beautiful, and hot as hell, not in spite of your plumpness but because of it!\u201d She asked the crowd \u201cWhat are we?\u201d and they responded in unison \u201cSexy as hell!\u201d This chant continued a few more times as Anthony and Nora got closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think that\u2019s all about?\u201d Nora asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo clue,\u201d said Anthony, which was a bit of a lie.</span></div></div>",

The Unbulged didn't have to find a new wardrobe, get stuck in narrow doorways or desks, or even have to change their eating habits all that much. Those 20% rolled a natural 20 on avoiding those extra pounds, the lucky bastards. Well, Anthony would have to disagree, looking at what happened to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey guys, wait up...ouch!\" came a voice from down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're steppin', skinny,\" a gruff senior pushing five hundred snapped at the girl trying to squeeze past him. Defiantly, the still-slim figured girl with long flowing black hair managed to slip out from behind the guy's girth and make her way over to Anthony and his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gina, how was summer?\" Anthony asked, trying to break the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, the usual guff...dealing with assholes...\" Gina grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry you had to deal with that,\" he said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sucks,\" Nora said less apologetically, propping up her new breasts, possibly to show off. Teddy got out of talking to her by shoving the rest of his second burrito into his mouth instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" mumbled, staring down at her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind him, he's just cranky,\" Anthony said, nudging Teddy's pudgy pecs with his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hasn't had second breakfast!\" Nora said in a terrible hobbit accent. Even Teddy broke into a laugh at that quip, and Gina was practically bent over double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that was a sold reference, I'll give you that one,\" he chuckled. \"And yeah, sorry about my fellow 'hobbitses' giving you shit, Gina. That's not cool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina smiled, one of the few she gave these days. Anthony felt a bit of relief, considering how badly the Bulge had hit her. Or rather, hadn't hit her. She and her twin sister Lina were the dual lacrosse stars of Big Lake High, superstar athletes destined for greatness and two of the most popular kids around, up until the Bulge dropped on her life like an atom bomb. All of her close friends had been dedicated lacrosse players, all of whom got hit hard with the Bulge and, out of jealousy for their lost waistlines, wanted nothing to do with \"that lucky twiggy bitch\" anymore. Even her sports scholarship got trashed overnight because of the sudden obesity among players gutting the sports teams at her chosen college, leaving her stuck at Blackwood and spending the summer vacation getting bullied by Lina , who by all accounts was the biggest victim of the Bulge on the team and the most jealous of her twin sister's avoidance of the excess pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that's what she told Anthony when they bumped into one another by pure chance and she became so overwhelmed by the stress that she broke into tears and told her the whole story. Ever since then though the two have been fast friends, spending a lot of the summer with him, Nora, and Teddy, as she tried to put her life back together and chart a different course, so to say, though she still retained a bit of an athletic build from her old lacrosse days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I'd say this after what happened,\" Gina admitted. \"But I'm actually looking forward to my classes here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here, I hear the Lit teacher is really solid,\" Teddy said, licking his fingers clean from his breakfast burrito at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solid or solidly built?\" Anthony suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Porque no los dos?\"</i> Teddy shot back, a grin creasing his chubby cheeks. Nora and Gina collectively rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have Lit this first block...I'm pretty sure I'm in the same base class as you and Nora,\" Gina recounted, pulling up her schedule on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'd better hurry,\" Nora pointed out. \"We don't want to be late for...\"</span></div></div>",

Teddy wished Anthony luck as he waddled on down the hallway, leaving Anthony and the two girls behind an incredibly pear-shaped Indian girl with a voluminous pink sari, her hips briefly catching on the frame. Ignoring the feeling of angry glares from the Bulged burning into the back of his head, Anthony took a seat in a desk next to Gina. He couldn't help but notice how spacious it was, twice, maybe three times as wide as he was. Blackwood evidently wasn't taking any chances with the furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther then that, the class was fairly normal, if a little dull. The professor, a buxom middle-aged librarian type by the name of Ms. Yen who scored an inflated hourglass shape from the Bulge, droned on about the syllabus and the expectations for the year while Anthony leaned back, feeling his mind slip away into daydreams to the tune of the professor's droning voice and occasional crinkle of snack wrappers and chip bags...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BANG*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony jumped, and quite a few people yelled at the sudden sound, spilling food all over the floor in surprise as they turned to the door in the back that just slammed open, watching a three-hundred or so pound teacher lumber into the room, sweaty and panting, his shirt riding up to expose his prominent and love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daryl, you're interrupting my class!\" Ms. Yen said in shock. \"What in blazes are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to...turn on the news...\" the male professor said, clutching a stitch in his side. \"They're talking about...the Bulge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room went deadly quiet as Ms. Yen, eyes widening, quickly made her way to the computer as the male professor fiddled with the projector to show the whole room what was on. Anthony turned back to the front as the blue light stung his eyes, rubbing them irritably as the computer clicked onto the first news site Ms. Yen could find, with a big headline right up front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>NASA OFFICIAL TESTIFIES ON BULGE REPORT: CAUSE DISCOVERED</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class was transfixed as a video popped up, a live feed of a congressional hearing, the splitscreen showing an immensely obese Senator snacking on a big plate of french fries and the other showing a severe looking woman in dark sunglasses and a lab coat, going over a stack of papers in her hands, the audio coming on in the middle of her response<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-unlikely that we will have to take drastic measures to address increased food consumption,\" the labcoat lady said. \"We aren't going to have hard numbers on this until the end of the year, but there's been an upward trend in crop yields and livestock fertility that coincided with the event colloquially referred to as the Bulge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure my constituents will be happy to hear that,\" the Senator said, his colleagues giving a few light chuckles. \"But more to the point, Dr. Polzinski, you had news to share in regards to the origin of this...particular crisis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony leaned forward, the groans from the seats behind him indicating others were doing the same as the doctor on screen flipped through her notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe splitscreen turned into a wide shot of the scientist as the slideshow behind her progressed through a series of space photos of the moon, with a small fleck circled in red on each photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is our belief that the Bulge was created by this, an asteroid we've designated BLG-92,\" Dr. Polzinski revealed, to the collective gasps of Congress and Anthony's classroom. \"The asteroid was caught in the orbit of our Moon approximately one year ago, and it appears to be letting off periodic bursts of a type of hyper-intensive radiation, one of which appears to have entered the Earth's atmosphere approximately three months prior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Radiation?\" a Senator asked. \"Like from a nuclear reactor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, outside of the physical effects on human adipose tissue and certain types of crops and livestock, there's been no negative effects documented that are directly caused by the radiation,\" the scientist explained. \"If possible we'd like to request funding for a manned mission to further explore the effects that this asteroid could have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony couldn't quite believe his ears. An asteroid letting off radiation caused the Bulge? It sounded impossible, the realm of sci-fi and fantasy, and yet here was an actual scientist talking about it like it was as plausible as the moon eclipsing the sun. A murmur of conversation rose behind him as the other students in the class discussed the news, and even Gina looked awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wild stuff, huh?\" Anthony said, leaning over to her across his super-wide desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, tell me about it,\" Gina replied. \"It's so weird to think something like this is out there, something that could cause all of this.\" She waved her hands around the classroom to demonstrate. \"Space is...space is kind of cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure some people would agree with you on that one,\" Anthony laughed, thinking about Teddy's crankiness that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" Nora shushed us. \"There's more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no, as far as we can tell BLG-92 is in a steady orbit around the moon,\" Dr. Polzinski said. \"It might go into orbital decay on its next revolution but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother associate in a lab coat suddenly appeared in the frame behind the scientist, grabbing her attention as he handed her a sheet of paper. Her brow furled as she read over it before handing it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's been a development, Mr. Senator,\" Dr. Polzinski said, a slight quiver in her voice. \"We've just finished calculations on the next radiation burst-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, NEXT?\" another Senator interrupted. \"You're not saying there's another Bulge coming, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead silence, in the classroom and congress as they waited for the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes,\" Dr. Polzinski announced coolly. \"We believe the atmosphere will catch a burst of this radiation very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How soon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor swallowed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three to four days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen lunchtime came, there was a deafening quiet in the cafe area as other students discussed the big news in hushed tones, as though the second Bulge would happen right away if anyone mentioned it too loudly. The table that Anthony and his friends shared was unusually quiet as well, devoid of even the sounds of Teddy scarfing down his burger and instead picking through his extra-large serving of French Fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna be starved by the time you get home,\" Nora pointed out helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the use?\" Teddy said glumly. \"I'm going to end up a gluttonous hog anyway, might as well savor the moments when I don't want to stuff myself to bursting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know that,\" Anthony suggested. \"It could affect people differently the second time around. You might not gain anything at all. Or just the minimum amount.\" Teddy shot a glowering look at Anthony as he continued to eat his fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope that's what happens to me,\" Nora admitted. \"I only just got used to this size, I can't imagine what'd happen if I got hit with a big one.\" Her eyes drifted over to Anthony and Gina sitting next to each other, and her eyes suddenly lit up with manic delight. \"Ooh, what if it catches you two this time around?\" The skinny duo exchanged nervous looks, only now realizing the implications of what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even think of that,\" Anthony admitted. \"I mean...woof...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it bad that I kinda hope it does happen to me?\" Gina admitted, drawing surprised looks. \"I mean, I would happily pack on a few if it'd shut my sister up and get people off my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that would be a plus,\" Anthony realized, remembering his mom's attempting to force food on him this morning out of spite. \"Well, hopefully nothing hits us in a way we don't expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear hear,\" Teddy said, chugging down his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it be funny though if Anthony was the biggest one of us after the next Bulge?\" Nora idly suggested. \"Since he's the smallest one of us now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not by much,\" Gina interjected, knowing that with her musculature and build she slightly outweighed the lanky Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, if he gets hit, I'll get hit even more,\" Teddy insisted. \"No way is he going to be the biggest one of us after round two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, come on,\" Anthony pleaded, cheeks turning pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty bucks says you're wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddy and Nora shook hands vigorously as Anthony turned to Gina for support, who merely shrugged and finished off the rest of her fries. He couldn't really blame them for making a game out of it, though. No doubt that much like his own birthday and graduation from before, the events of the Second Bulge would overshadow the days counting down, and that all he and anyone else in the world could hope to do was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all he could think about in the meantime was what was going to happen to him, and how the dice would fall this time around.</span></div></div>",

This was the night the asteroid passed by earth again, and who knew what would happen? He ran his hands down his skinny frame, feeling it for perhaps the last time. He felt his trim, muscular torso, straight hips, and stick-thin legs, and sighed as he began to weep. He drifted off to sleep around 2, having not been able to stay awake any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, he woke, and felt heavy. \u201cOh goddddd.\u201d He groaned and threw the covers off to discover his worst nightmare had in fact come to pass. He was heavy, heavier than he had ever felt in his life, and the bulk of his body had pinned him down. His pajama shirt was ripping, straining around his gut. He had a gut! With some effort he managed to stumble out of bed and waddle down the hallway to the bathroom, attempting to remove his destroyed shirt as he did! He was in shock as he stared at his ruined body in the mirror, taking in the girth of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe studied the changes that had come to his body. The biggest one by far was the absolute size of his hips and butt, which had blown outwards. He really did take after his mother, he thought as he attempted to spin around and see the round fullness of his ass, straining against his stretchy pajama pants. His thighs were also huge, rubbing together and jiggling as he walked. He slapped his ass experimentally, feeling it jiggle. His belly was the next largest feature, a pale, creamy dome burying his abdominals under the swell. It was soft and jiggly, puffin topping over his plans in and uncomfortable way, and sitting on top of it were a pair of plump moobs. He gave his belly a squeeze with his chunkier hand, confirming that it was in fact real, his soft drooping arm fat brushing against his sensitive moobs in an uncomfortable way. As he flicked his eyes up to the mirror, he realized that there was so much fat on his plumper, chubby face that he formed a third (!) chin when he looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to have gained at least 100 pounds! He quickly pulled an XL sweatshirt he normally used as a sleep shirt on, and waddled downstairs, not used to the sway of his hips. He wondered with a feeling of dread what had happened to everyone else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had already undergone one massive shakeup in the status quo, it was all most people could do to get a wink of sleep, let alone let BLG-92 pass overhead without obsessing over its trajectory and the effects that it would have on the poor, unsuspecting populace below. After having expanded by a bare minimum of fifty pounds\u2014no one was exactly excited about what it would do with another go-round the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, though Anthony had fallen asleep. While his mother stayed up, cool as could be, and watched the news with a stone-cold look of determination on her face (she\u2019d been one of many who\u2019d held out for a reversal of fortunes, despite the lacking evidence) and his sister did her best to distract herself with videos of pre-bulge entertainment (Youtube, Hulu, Disney+, whatever she could get without having to rise under her own power) Anthony had done the impossible and slept through the Passover of a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that had been the biggest fucking mistake of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround five \u2018o\u2019 clock in the morning, Anthony awoke feeling heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just the weight that pressed down on his chest, but the weight that pinned down his arms. The girth of his legs that he could only just barely kick, and the sensation that he was somehow <i>falling</i> off of his bed? While still being planted firmly, <i>heavily</i> on the mattress as it groaned and squeaked at his every movement, Anthony was very vividly experiencing a strange sensation of\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nof <i>weight</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had difficulty turning his head\u2014his cheeks felt swollen. The collar around his neck, in actuality what remained of his sleep shirt, cut deep into his flesh as it bulged over the ring of white cotton fabric. His hands, so soft and doughy, recoiled at the tactile sensation of <i>rolls</i>, actual <i>rolls</i> that claimed his neck. And his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking down, now in shock, he felt his chest. Tight, never firm but always tight, had suddenly expanded outwards immensely. He had\u2026 he had <i>breasts</i>. Or at least, heaving, fleshy moobs. They were heavy and sweaty and round and just\u2026 there were rolls underneath them! His legs were halfway buried beneath this weight, this indescribable, gelatinous\u2026 <i>blob</i> that it would take a good two minutes of idle jiggling to realize was <i>attached to him</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only once he realized what had happened\u2014what had been on the news the day before, and the strange world that he already found himself living in\u2014that he realized just what had occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the first bulge had hit, he had been spared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the second one had occurred\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he hadn\u2019t been so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOOOOOMM!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey, I\u2026 I know I was kind of a bitch to you.\u201d His mother smiled mercifully\u2014her new chin bulging out from underneath her double decker, \u201cAnd for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m really sorry\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting Anthony out of bed had been hard. He hadn\u2019t ever been particularly strong to begin with, so the Bulge just sort of buried his lanky frame underneath pounds and pounds of fat. He had no bulk to begin with, and moving\u2026 well, <i>all</i> of him had been a hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat up\u2014you\u2019re going to need your strength.\u201d His mother said in a sympathetic, winded voice as she toddled around the kitchen, \u201cThe first few days are the hardest. Your body\u2019s going through some <i>changes</i> and\u2026 well\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice it to say, he had <i>not</i> been skipped this second go-round. More than five hundred pounds of nineteen year old freshman\u2014less than a day ago, he had been one of the skinniest people on Earth! Now he was this big\u2026 fat\u2026 <i>thing</i>! The bare minimum Bulge had been fifty pounds, and leave it to him to gain ten times that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if your college is doing what Casey\u2019s school is doing\u2014letting you homeschool\u2026\u201d his mother\u2019s lips tugged at the side as she comfort-snacked her way through what had been the second most awkward breakfast she\u2019d endured this past month (right after her own incredible expansion, though she\u2019d been treated rather gracefully this second time around) \u201cBut maybe, for a few days\u2026 you, um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go to class, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!

The campus university was offering a bussing system for those who had proven <i>especially</i> meaty after two trips of that stupid fucking radioactive rock going and fattening everyone up. It required some information, some pictures, before and afters that \u201cproved\u201d he\u2019d been bulged\u2014so fucking embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot as embarrassing, however, as literally taking up a whole fucking bus bench by himself. The seating was assigned, so he had to register which seat the shuttle would take him in every morning. Which was humiliating because <i>he was so much fucking fatter than everyone else on the train</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them were three, four hundred pounds. Pretty honking huge just as early as three months ago, but almost <i>average</i> sized in this new twice-bulged world. But Anthony? After one zap of that stupid comet, he was twice the size of some of the whales that waddled around campus\u2026 not that\u2019d he\u2019d know anything about how things looked these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of world was he living in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping off of the bus with a great amount of effort and time (unloading literally tons of passengers took about twenty minutes of suspension-creaking, bus-whining agony on a bunch of overloaded joints) Anthony found himself on campus for the first time since the Bulge\u2019s sequel had gone and fucked up his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly hung down to his fucking knees, and he could barely walk three steps without getting winded. His arms were so heavy he could barely lift them. His legs were woefully ill-equipped for the job of supporting his monumental fatassery and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i>God</i> if he wouldn\u2019t have done anything for a fucking cheeseburger right now. A whole slew of them. He felt like he could eat dozens of the things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo surprise\u2014he\u2019d been eating like every inch of the monumental fatass he\u2019d become literally overnight ever since It had happened. His appetite was through the roof!

It'd make him late for his class and probably the next one depending on how long he took but fuck it, he was too hungry and in too much of a sour mood to care, and that meant defaulting to his base state; sating his new, enormous appetite. Already panting heavily as he meandered at his new, glacial pace, he was already wondering what changes the cafeteria was making to cater to \"his type\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of which, as he paused to catch his breath, leaning against a nearby tree, he heard the distinctive sounds of footsteps. Heavy, sluggish footsteps, carrying way more weight then they should have, accompanied by deep sighs of breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...pardon...huff...me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony's face heated up in embarrassment; he knew that voice, one of the three people he didn't want to see right now, Only...was it always that...deep? Curiosity overcame his shame, and he slowly turned to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...G-Gina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh....hey...Anthony...\" Gina said, coming to a shambling stop. \"Um...okay...wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony could hardly believe it. One person avoiding the bulge only to get super-bulged on the second go around was unbelievable enough, but...two of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them openly stared at one another, completely gobstruck by their transformations. Gina's gaze traveled across his meaty arms and legs while Anthony stared at her face, her once slender classical chin and cheekbones swaddled with pliable fat, puffing out her cheeks and sitting atop an array of chins, three not including the thick ring of neck fat she sported; her hair had clearly been the only thing Anthony readily recognized as being Gina's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes traveling down, he noticed how her shoulders and fat arms, much like his, had swallowed up her elbows and wrist, and he'd bet good money that those catcher's mitts she sported were just as doughy as his own digits. With a pang of humiliation, he even noticed that her heavy breasts the size of large cantaloupes (Anthony wasn't good at guessing bra sizes so he didn't even try) were still comparable in size to his own fleshy moobs. Same could be said of that belly of hers too, a great fleshy mass creased at the belly button, hanging over her lap. She had better luck finding a shirt that could decently cover up then he had, though it still barely reached within a few inches of her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention...dear lord, her butt. He could see it from the front. Wide and flabby, it easily tripled and probably went beyond the width of the skinny girl he knew pre-Bulge, hanging out like a shelf behind her and flowing into thunder thighs not at all dissimilar from the tree that Anthony was leaning against for support, ending in cankles that overflowed her chubby feet jammed into ill-fitting sandals. Nora may have had her beat in the breast department (Fuck, how was SHE going to look now?), but Anthony felt like he could say with completely confidence that the \"lucky twiggy bitch\" her fellow lacrosse players dumped possessed the largest ass on campus. At least among the people who could still move, but even then that would be a close one. The idea of carrying that thing around made Anthony ache just looking at it; if she wasn't a former athlete, he reasoned, she would have easily been pinned down by this bulk, like he almost was at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got...fat...\" Gina said at long last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...so did you...\" Anthony replied dimly. Another few seconds of pause, then Gina attempted a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry...right...?\"</span></div></div>",

The queen bee was certainly aware of her continued good looks, and was flirting with a nearby figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat figure belonged to Brad Heller, known as \"Moose\" to most of the class. He was a human tank before the Fat-pocalypse, standing well over 6 feet tall, and weighing over 200 pounds. Now, his weight was roughly 280, much of it having settled in a new belly and his tree trunk sized limbs. Even his recent pounds couldn't disguise his muscles, however, and he seemed to be dealing with his 80 pound gain a lot better then most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third figure to draw her attention was also likely the most significant. Slow, heavy footsteps were the first sound Michelle heard at her approach, followed several minutes later by heavy, exhausted breathing. The massive, elephantine figure of Hana Mae glacially made her way into the room, one arm over the shoulder of her brother, each step punctuated with a fleshy wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHana was, in a word, brilliant. Easily the best student Miss DiCiotta had seen in her (admittedly short) career, Hana was a short young woman, standing at around 5'0\" with belt length black hair. The shy girl had already been fairly chubby, but now she was positively massive. In the aftermath of the disaster, the school had taken health measurements on behalf of the government, and Hana had clocked in at a whopping 594 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar from a physically active sort, she'd been totally unprepared for her 350 pound-ish gain, and was left barely able to move. Her brother, whose name was completely escaping the young teacher, was constantly coming around to help her. Honestly, Michelle wasn't certain if Hana could rise unaided, as she had yet to see the girl move without his help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking matters worse for the black haired genius was the nature of her gain. Her legs had turned into literal tree trunks with large sagging rolls of their own, leaving the poor girl barely able to bend her knees. Her ass and hips were simply gigantic, needing her brother to push her fleshy form through the door frame. Her huge, multi-rolled belly was slapping mightily against her thighs as she moved, and Hana let out a mighty gasp. Moose, who was very kind (though far from bright), moved to help the Mae siblings, and Hana threw her other meaty arm around his wide shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts, as befitting someone her weight, were gargantuan things, and only Kim came close to reaching the same size. Like every other part of her body, though, they seemed only to hamper Hana's movements even further. Michelle could see the blonde bee sneering at enormous young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two boys lowered the over-burdened girl to the couch that had been set up for her in the back of the class, Michelle looked around. Was it time to start the lesson?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the television screens tuned to Channel sixteen all across Big Lake, a puff piece about the school changing its curriculum to accommodate the students most severely affected by sudden weight gain wrapped up, and the camera cut to the inside of a familiar newsroom, and the bright sunny smile of the most trusted woman in the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Refreshing to see how our educators are turning the Bulge into an opportunity to explore new ways to educate our children!\" Anna Lewis announced, blatantly name dropping the nickname she coined for the sudden epidemic of obesity that struck just a few weeks ago that had since become common parlance. \"Anyway, that's all the time we have, stay tuned for our economics program Bull and Bear, where we'll be discussing the shocks being faced by the diet industry as it adapts to the new society changes. Good night, and good news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaand, that's a wrap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage lights dimmed as the warning bell sounded, and Anna relaxed, taking off her glasses to rub her sore eyes. Another day, another news cycle centered around this infamous Bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a hand here with no coffee in it,\" Anna called out as she stood up, straightening out her power skirt and suit. There was a yelp as one of the interns waddled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-here you are Miss Lewis, iced with a hint of vanilla and caramel!\" the young college-age girl huffed. \"Just the way you like it!\" She was red-faced from the exertion of going faster then a ponderous walk, still getting used to the sixty pounds piled onto her lanky 100 pound frame that congregated in a big buddha belly testing the buttons on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now go do whatever else you do here,\" Anna said, dismissively taking a sip of her beverage of choice as she waved her off. The girl obediently scurried away, giving the news anchor a wonderful view of her butt as it swayed back and forth, squeezing past a three-hundred pound camera man trying to get out and grab a bite to eat. Just another part of the daily struggle for those flung into obesity by the scourge that was the Bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing to enjoy her coffee (that intern did make an excellent brew, perhaps she should make an effort to remember the girl's name), Anna leaned on top of her news desk, almost flaunting the perfectly trim body that was blessedly untouched by the Bulge. A lot of the crewmen and women working to clean up the set and get things prepped for the next news cycle looked on with envy and jealousy, perhaps even with a little bit of hatred towards the gorgeously attractive and talented news anchor with the supermodel figure. She must have been so damned lucky not to lose that tight body of hers, everyone must have thought, and Anna would agree that she was lucky. Lucky that she wasn't still dreaming after that first day when she realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Anna had a secret. A secret that, had it ever been revealed during her formative years, would have had her labeled as a social pariah among the popular students whom she counted among her number, or at least she seemed to think it would have. Because she had a type, not so much to the cool and attractive star quarterback that she did end up dating, and dumping, a long time ago, but to someone with a bit more...meat on them. A lot of meat, in fact. Anna didn't have a name for it until a few idle searches online led her to a certain subset of people who were into the same things that she was. Fat admirers, big handsome men, big beautiful women, and so many more new terms and ideas that she never thought of before, and ever since then she'd been carefully living the double life, excelling in school and her new career as a charismatic media figurehead while secretly devouring fanfiction about her favorite characters stuffing themselves silly and watching videos where large men and women showed off their luscious, succulent curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the Bulge was quite the experience for Anna, even if it was a bit of a double-edge sword. The suddenness of the event had saturated an already overloaded news cycle, and with her co-anchor being hit so hard that she couldn't leave her house, Anna had been pulling double duty covering all of the stories surrounding the Bulge that poured into the newsroom. That would have been bad enough, but add on top of that Anna struggling to not reveal how, well, 'excited' she was at all of this news about people suddenly growing fat, and she was being run ragged. And it wasn't like she could complain either, considering everyone else at the studio was working just as hard but with the added bonus of bellies and rolls to get in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Anna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slim news anchor deigned to look over and was rewarded with the corpulent form of her news producer, Steve Sampson, his perfectly round belly hanging a good foot in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, word from on high is we're getting a second anchor flown in,\" Steve reported, waving a printout in one hand while the other had a box of donuts tucked under his arm. \"Should be back on regular schedule for you by next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be nice, feels like it's been ages since I-\" Anna started to say, but paused as Steve let out a slight belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pardon,\" he said, covering his mouth. \"Been eating like a hog lately, those kind of slip out sometimes.\" He let out an awkward laugh that shook his rolls and folds like jello. Anna's eyes were drawn to the diamonds of flesh emerging between the buttons on his front, and was starting to imagine them popping off, one by one. Anna bit her lip, frustration and arousal warring within her; she was absolutely adoring all the extra pudge on the people around her, but she felt sort of cheated in Steve's case. A friendly kind of guy, smart but a little meek, he was also skinny as a rail and Anna had been subtly trying to push him to fatten himself up. It felt like he had finally given in and started to have a little extra at meals when the Bulge hit and Steve walked into work, immediately becoming the biggest man in the office at a massive four-hundred and fifty five, or so he told her. Anna had so been looking forward to turning the news producer into her personal feedee, seeing those jowls and cheeks swell, his manboobs developing and starting to sag while his thighs ballooned to the size of tree trunks, and the Bulge had cheated her out of that excitement by making it happen right away! It was unfair! Not unfair enough that she didn't have fantasies about sleeping on his stomach like a big squishy waterbed, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Anna?\" Steve said, waving the paper in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...h-huh?\" she replied with a start, realizing she was so caught up in her aroused thoughts that she didn't notice her producer was still talking. \"Oh, sorry Steve, kind of dozed off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, can't say I blame you, just don't do that during a broadcast,\" Steve chuckled. \"Anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: \"...the boss wanted to talk to you, after the report was finished,\" Steve said, sounding concerned. \"I'm...sure it's nothing serious, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: \"...I was talking to the investigative reporter, and he said he found something interesting about the Bulge,\" Steve repeated. \"Think you can talk to them? Sounds like it could be a real scoop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: \"...do you want to grab a bite to eat?\" Steve asks, sounding a bit shy. \"I uh, know a nice place by the lake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: \"...I was curious if you had any idea where the Bulge came from?\" Steve asks, blissfully unaware that Anna was secretly behind it the whole time! *Dun Dun DUUUUUUUUN!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5: \"...anything interesting going on since the Bulge hit?\" Steve asked, casually leading into a free choice option for the beloved reader.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Please tell me you weren't talking to Gwen...\" Anna asked pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Gwen? She's our best investigator we've had in a long time,\" Steve insisted, adjusting his belt with his free hand. \"Remember how she broke the corruption scandal at City Hall a month back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but she's...you know...\" Anna waffled a bit, biting her lip to avoid saying anything mean. \"...a bit excitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, it's not like you don't get a thrill out of doing this job too!\" Steve laughed. \"I've seen how excited you've gotten over the news lately, she's just really into her work like you are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna turned a thousand different shades of red, thankful that Steve misunderstood why she was 'excited' over the news. \"Well, I'll see what she found out then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck! When you're finished, we should go over the schedule for when the newbie arrives,\" Steve said, digging into the box of donuts for another sweet treat. Tearing herself away from watching the big guy stuff his cheeks, Anna trotted off towards the back offices, where many of the reporters and field anchors were stationed when they weren't out collecting scoops. Most of them were in cubicles, sitting in newly arrived office chairs that held butts that had doubled in size, but a few were prestigious enough to get their own private offices in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of which was adorned with a bronze nameplate: Gwen Gallahad, investigative reporter. Sighing, Anna knocked reluctantly on the heavy wooden door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hmm...yes?\" came a voice from inside. \"What do you want, I'm drawing a conclusion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Anna, Gwen,\" Anna replied. \"Steve said you had something to show me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the door behind you, quickly.\" There was a small click as the door unlocked. Anna gave it a few seconds, then with a small measure of annoyance opened it herself and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lighting was dim in most places, thanks to Gwen twisting the lamps in the room to illuminate a big corkboard along one wall, a small disused desk sitting off in the corner, flush among a wall of file cabinets. The floor was an utter mess, covered in discarded papers and snack food wrappers, and the corkboard was little better, with papers and photographs tacked on haphazardly and connected with red string, exactly like the over the top conspiracy theorist straight out of a bad television program would do. And right in the center of the mess was Gwen Gallahad, a short, red-haired firebrand who, to Anna's shock, was substantially under-dressed, her flabby butt clothed in pink polka-dotted fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..wha...why are you in your underwear?!?\" Anna demanded, taking a step back towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh, yes,\" Gwen said, as if she just now realized it, placing a portly hand on one of her wide hips. \"Split pants earlier, was uncomfortable and distracting, so disrobed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay so it made a modicum of sense; Gwen had a junk food habit that predated the Bulge and after she was blown up just shy of the big three hundred her appetite must have gone through the roof, meaning bursting from her clothes was a distinct possibility, but...why prance around in her underwear instead of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like you mind anyway,\" Gwen huffed. \"Saw how you look at Steve and interns, practically climaxing whenever you talk about people getting stuck because of their weight. Obvious, really.\" She slapped her heavy, double-rolled stomach to demonstrate, leaving Anna a flustered mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look, what did you w-want?\" she choked out, unconsciously slipping out of her suit jacket since she was starting to feel overheated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been thinking a lot about this Bulge,\" Gwen mused, pondering her conspiracy theorist corkboard. \"Who would be affected, who would benefit. Had a few theories, but no one I tapped would be able to mastermind an event like this. Save one.\" She tapped a photo on her corkboard, a blown up photo of the president shaking hands with a man who's smiling face was circled repeatedly with black ink, somewhat covering up his silver-flecked black hair. \"Von Gull\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Gwen declared, steepling her fingers. \"Derek Von Gull, a man who very much does not like to be in the news. You won't believe the favors I had to pull to get this one photo. Elusive fellow, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so an obscure businessman doesn't want his face out in public, how does that connect him-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would THINK that, wouldn't you?\" Gwen said over her. \"But look at this evidence. Mr. Von Gull doesn't appear on headlines but you know where he does show up? Boardrooms, benefactors, corporate lobbyist groups. And every single one of them connected to companies that specialize in one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen turned to Anna and held up an empty chip bag and the remains of a snack food wrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junk food. Every company that specializes in selling cheap, unhealthy foods has a connection back to this Von Gull character, and you know how popular junk food is, yes? Everyone would have had some in the last few months or so when this guy started showing up, like about...eighty percent? And isn't it funny how right before this started, a lot of the companies that this guy invested in were planning on releasing new products, perhaps to capitalize on a recent, sudden demand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Anna said noncommittally, hoping to get out of here relatively soon. Anna didn't care much about junk food, and hadn't actually had any in quite some time, since she had a chocolate allergy and had grown to prefer fresh fruit over most, thanks to a diet to shed some excess pounds from a year or so back. Thus, she hadn't really enjoyed any junk food since...a few months ago. Huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm sure you're saying, 'Come on Gwen, it's just some rich fuck who invests in a lot of food companies, it's a good business decision right?' Ohhhh no my friend, not in the slightest!\" Gwen reached a fever pitch as she returned to her corkboard. \"See, there is one little business where he makes an appearance that has nothing to do with junk food; a chemical plant in Dusseldorf. And not as an investor or board room stiff; as a top researcher! Now tell me, Miss Ace Anchorwoman!\" Gwen demanded, stepping forward so close that her stomach pressed against her. \"What conclusion would you draw from that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...this Von Gull character did something using his chemical expertise to the junk food all his companies sell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EXACTLY!\" Gwen shouted in triumph. \"And they're going to do it again, too! The same corporate back channels I got this information from are planning another surge of product releases in a week, and I'll bet my hat that they're going to Bulge everyone again to move that product!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I'm gonna go now,\" Anna said, backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all fits, damn it! You have to report on this before the corporate fat cats make US the fat cats, damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...think about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna shut the door behind her, a little too forcefully perhaps as Gwen's investigation swirled inside her head. An evil corporate plot to fatten up the world and sell more food? How ridiculous, it was like a bad fetish story! Like she'd really suddenly gain weight overnight from something put into the food supply!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...say if Gwen was right about this conspiracy theory of hers. That an evil corporate douchebag had caused all this weight gain. Did that mean...it was going to happen again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna paused, turning to look at an empty cubicle, her gaze drawn towards a near-empty bag of gummy bears. She loved gummy bears. It was one of her favorite snack foods before she got serious about her diet. And if Gwen was right, it was filled with something that, in a few days time, would Bulge everyone again. For the first time, she stared at her own, flat stomach, and began to wonder about what to do. Reporting this story would be huge, and no doubt being the one who broke such a massive conspiracy wide open would make her into a legend overnight, but imagine how people would look after a second Bulge. Imagine...how SHE'D look after a bulge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, this was ridiculous. Was she really going to be suckered into a goofy story like this? It was impossible, it had to be.  Surely the junk food was not the source of this Bulge. She could easily eat these gummy bears and nothing would happen! Was she really going to push the studio to air Gwen's silly conspiracy theory?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna smiled, shaking her head at her own silliness. She was getting way too much of a rise out of this to start envisioning these wild scenarios about evil corporations trying to fatten the world up. The world would uncover the truth about what caused this, and most likely it'd be some chemical accident or a fluke of human biology, and she'll get a few good stories in on the scientists who discovered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, might as well not worry so much about diet, Anna rationalized to herself as she fished the last few gummy bears out of the bag. It wasn't like anyone was going to give her a second glance when most of her co-workers were twice her size, not to mention it'd help to get these harebrained, fetish fic ideas out of her head. Polishing off the gummy bears, Anna wondered if it'd help if she finally just asked Steve out instead of dancing around it like she'd been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on a sexy saunter as she meandered back into the newsroom, the night of passion that ensued drove all thoughts of Gwen's conspiracy from her head, and she quickly forgot about the name of Von Gull. Which was exactly what the billionaire industrialist wanted as he hid out just a stone's throw from Anna's news studio, just a few days after her encounter with the investigative reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything going on, it barely made the news that Herschel\u2019s Eats, the lifeblood of this small town and its biggest business, was quietly bought up by a German investment group days before the Bulge struck. There was barely any change in operation, save a small investment of cash to construct a second basement level, so it made sense that the big purchase went largely unnoticed. In that second basement level, however, big plans for the future were afoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe haze of cigar smoke hung in the air as Von Gull sat behind his expensive antique desk, pondering the wall of television monitors in front of him that illuminated the room, showing a hundred foreign and local news broadcasts covering the Bulge. Extinguishing his Cuban in the ash tray, he ran a hand through his silver-flecked hair and steepled his fingers, leaning back in his chair. Wordlessly, a slight woman with perfectly styled blonde hair that would have made our Anna feel jealous scurried up behind him, setting a glass on the table and pouring a small helping of schnapps from a fancy crystal bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Penny,\" Von Gull muttered quietly, intently focusing on the screens in front of him. \"How is the board room situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pacified,\" Penny replied in a monotone, her dark eyes barely blinking. \"There is some hemming and hawing from the European chairs but nothing will come of it, I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Le Clerc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be replaced soon. From what I understand, she's suddenly become quite unable to move on her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Gull cracked a rare smile. \"A fine job. Everything's going according to plan. Now if only Miss Hamada would...ah, speak of the devil...\" The businessman smiled as the news screens flickered and several in the center joined together to show a new face, a young, thin girl in a white collared shirt, wearing large round glasses that made her look like a particularly harried owl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Morning, Miss Hamada&gt;,\" Von Gull said, effortlessly swapping to the girl's native Japanese. \"&lt;Trouble establishing a connection?&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Of course, my superiors don't know about this so I had to bounce this past several proxxies, sheesh,&gt;\" Hamada said, rolling her eyes like this was obvious. \"&lt;In any case, I have your schematics all set up, just need to run some tests and we'll be all set&gt;.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Wonderful, we'll need them once humanity is struggling with mobility, so make sure they can hold up in that situation,&gt;\" Von Gull said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Himada huffed. \"&lt;And for my part? You promised you'd help me get big too, not even your remotely fattening chemical worked on me.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;I've sent a more potent formula your way that'll overcome your little issue.&gt;\" Von Gull pressed a few buttons on his desk to confirm the shipment. &lt;\"There's a risk you will be rendered immobile, of course...&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Perfect.&gt;\" Hamada declared, glee etched on her face right before the signal went out and the wall of news reports returned. Von Gull was pleased with this outcome, very pleased. It was frankly a miracle that he got this far after he created his formula, a potent chemical that sat in the human body and could be manipulated globally with the push of a button, a button he had at his disposal at all times. He expected some push-back, but the corporations he manipulated to spread his formula bought his story about how it would increase their profits hook line and sinker and had been happily feeding people the chemical since. He felt more confident then ever, and soon his desire to see a world truly at peace, united in a fat and happy utopia, would truly come to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand hovered over the button, the very one he first pressed that triggered the event known around the world as the Bulge. He'd been patient, tempering himself to afflicting the world slowly until he could make his big announcement, and it was time for the next phase of the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs casually as if he was changing the channel on his televisions, Von Gull pressed the button that would Bulge the world again, right as our friend Anna was...</span></div></div>",

No one knows what caused the change, or if whatever caused it is truly gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a mostly free-for-all story, with some major rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Minimal slob, please. Burping and messy eating are okay, but avoid toilet stuff and literal filth.<br>\r\n-Sex is fine, but not too graphic please. Not a lot pf descriptions of cum and lactation and things like that or the chapter will be removed.<br>\r\n-No major transformations into literal animals, plants, objects. <br>\r\n-No vore.<br>\r\n-No weight gain over 1000 pounds, please<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT IS ALLOWED<br>\r\n-Weight gain - male and female<br>\r\n-Expansion (belly, breasts, ass, inflation, blueberry)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to keep chapters long and detailed.
