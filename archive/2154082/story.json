            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a stretch and a yawn, Dulce Coraz\u00f3n had stepped into the world outside her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce didn't like the idea of leaving her comfy bed, but she knew it had to be done.  Summer break is too good (and too short) a time to waste laying around, especially for someone like her.  Time away from school should be taken full advantage of - forget the weather!  With this in mind, the blue-streaked sweetheart opened her blinds for her quiet morning greeting to the city of Asunci\u00f3n.  Her face and hair was treated to a pleasantly cool breeze, unusual for the city at this time of year, but she didn't care.  If anything she took it as a good omen and the perfect start to her break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce had left her room to be greeted by... nothing.  No busy activity downstairs, no sounds or smells of breakfast, not even the tapping sound of her mother texting her annoying co-workers.  It was very quiet within the house.  It was when she had searched the kitchen that she remembered her parents saying they would be gone for a few days and it was up to her to look after their humble abode.  To her that meant two things: she had finally proven to her folks how responsible she could be and (without seeing the irony of her thought) that she could do whatever she pleased without them around.  Of course, she would still have to look after the family cat and make sure the house still stood but <i>apart from that</i>, nothing would interrupt her newfound freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eager beaver of 13.5 years of age rushed back upstairs to the bathroom.  After she had showered, fixed her hair, brushed her teeth, and dressed up (choosing her new favourite outfit for this occasion), Dulce returned to the kitchen to make something she had always wanted for breakfast but could never have: unbaked cookie dough on toast with blueberry jam.  She certainly lived up to her name in many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she ate her food in the living room, and enjoying it immensely, Dulce made the \"mistake\" of sitting on the couch with her legs stretched out across the cushions while she watched television.  It wasn't long before the family cat, a three-year-old Lykoi named David L\u00f3pez, leapt up on the couch to join his cute master.  David moved towards his eccentric keeper's dusky bare feet, her lavender toenails shining in the sun, and noticed a piece of savoury beef that just <i>happened</i> to be wedged between her left foot's second and middle toes.  Dulce pretended she didn't feel the cat's whiskers brush against her freshly cleaned foot or his nose gently tap her toes while she kept her gaze fixed on the screen, but her grin and the brief reflexes of her foot were dead giveaways.  David's fur had \"coerced\" the offending toes into giving up their bounty, which he gobbled up without ceremony, but he was not finished yet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when David decided to repay his generous master by \"cleaning\" the leftover juices and tiny beef bits left on Dulce's toes that the girl stopped pretending.  The living room was filled with the melodious sounds of her laughter as the skin between her toes were being scoured by her cat's coarse tongue.  Fortunately, she remembered to put her plate on the table before she started breaking into girly giggles; she had never been one to waster perfectly good food that way.  But for her the hardest part was trying to keep still and not roll away while David L\u00f3pez continued his accidental tickle torture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at the moment it wasn't torture to her.  The girl's non-existent begging clearly showed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, David L\u00f3pez had decided he had removed every last trace of beef between his master's adorable toes and ceased his licking.  Since he had had his fill of meat (and Dulce was getting closer to having <i>her</i> fill of tickles), DL opted to just lay on the couch, resting his head where Dulce's jean cuff met the top of her left foot.  Meanwhile, Dulce was catching her breath while fanning her face with her hand.  After putting her cat through this charade so many times, one would think she would be used to the feeling of his tongue's rough surface.  She had accepted that she would never get used to that sensation but from her point-of-view that wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  Her breath had been recovered but the infamous \"phantom tickles\" still lingered between her toes.  She would've rubbed her toes with her hands or against the couch cushions, but after seeing David L\u00f3pez resting his head on her ankle, content and at peace, she couldn't bring herself to disturb his little snooze.  So she decided to leave him be and just let the lingering sensations disappear on their own.  Using her right foot, which had nothing in its toes, Dulce began stroking the top of David's head and along his shoulders affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce flashed another of her famous smiles, the kind that could probably light up an entire room, as she kept petting her cat with her foot.  \"You're just a big hairy dork, David L\u00f3pez,\" she said without dropping her smile, \"but you're <i>my</i> big hairy dork and we both know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, Dulce was content to lay there for a little longer and refocus on the TV while letting her cat rest by her feet.  But just then, something had occurred to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dork?</i>\" she thought.  \"Why am I still repeating that word in my head - and not think about David L\u00f3pez?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a light bulb suddenly switched on in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" exclaimed Dulce, not noticing her outburst had woken up her cat.  \"I can't believe I forgot about the alien jewellery!  Excuse me, DL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden motion she had swiftly pulled her legs out and leapt onto the floor with a new sense of purpose... for the day, at least.  She would use that bracelet/alien hardware, the Macrocosmic Stone, to pay a visit to one of those \"dorks\" she had either crushed on within or without their respective media.  It was the kind of scenario every fanboy, or fangirl, could only dream about or write in fanfiction.  And this little se\u00f1orita was going to do just that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiiiiiiight after she cleaned up the water from the flower vase she had knocked over....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstandably, an object with power of such magnitude could be misused (in a bad way) if it were to fall into the wrong hands.  That was why Dulce kept the Macrocosmic Stone within a box under several locks in the most secret of locations - under the bed.  A few number punches, turned keys, and combinations later yielded in the reveal of the Macrocosmic Stone in all its glory.  She fastened the bracelet to her left wrist as per usual and pressed her first two fingers on the stone's surface, activating the device.  Though she never properly learned or understood whatever alien text showed up on the device's display screens, Dulce had always looked at the language barrier as her playing a Japanese exclusive video game on an emulator.  Even though she could not read Japanese to save her skin, she could figure out the controls and menus through trial and error.  She applied that same logic to the device itself and she had learned how it worked in no time.  This is an ill-advised method to be sure, especially when dealing with reality-bending technology from a far-off galaxy, but it was fortunate that nothing terrible had happened to Dulce whenever she <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">played around with</span> studied the Macrocosmic Stone from every possible angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had the device pull up the heads-up display hologram, Dulce began selecting and whisking away various holographic panels until she had found the one she had been seeking.  The panel appeared to be folder that Dulce herself had set up containing profiles on various fictional characters and their respective universes, saved personally for ease of use and access.  All she would have to do is select where she wanted to go and if she could pinpoint a close proximity to the character in question, tap the white circular pad on the stone's surface and presto!  A warp link would be created and travel would be made possible.   It would be best not to eat before transporting to different times and places, however; Dulce learned this lesson the hard way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInnumerable doors laid before Dulce Coraz\u00f3n in a single digital corridor, and to her knowledge she had the only key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u><br>\r\nAdditional Information on Dulce Coraz\u00f3n</u></b><br>\r\n<b>Personality Strengths:</b> affectionate, cheerful, courteous, outgoing, reliable, socially independent<br>\r\n<b>Personality Faults:</b> blunt, complacent, convenience first, picky, spendthrift, stubborn<br>\r\n<b>Skills/Attributes:</b> whistling without moving lips, using the Macrocosmic Stone, maintaining an 85% average in school, fluency in Spanish, Guarani, and English (needs the Macrocosmic Stone for all other forms of communication), typing quickly and proficiently<br>\r\n<b>Likes:</b> pink and blue colours, lavender (colour), sweet/bizarre food combinations, French food, green tea, blueberry pies, horror movies, buddy comedies, video games, swimming, colouring, tickling, feet<br>\r\n<b>Dislikes:</b>yellow and green colours, Paraguayan food (ironic, yes?), sushi, iced tea, pineapple, cycling, drawing, physical sports (will try anything once<br>\r\n<b>Trivia:</b> Dulce drew inspiration for her cat's name from two sources: she named him David after David Kessler, the main character from the movie <i>An American Werewolf in London</i>, and the L\u00f3pez half simply means \"son of the wolf\" since his breed resemble werewolves.

It had been a shame that her time-jumping ability hadn\u2019t surfaced back then because she\u2019d been obsessed, even positively enamored, with this one boy on the screen. Now she activated her bracelet, feeling a kick of excitement in her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere we\u2019re going,\u201d she yelled, \u201cthere are no secret identities!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the seasoned adventurer she was, Dulce quickly ran into her room, past the heap of clothing behind the closet compartment her parents didn\u2019t know about, and retrieved all the necessary components paramount to an adventure. Rope, duct tape, zip-ties, a few handcuffs, a spool of thread. You know, all the essentials. Dulce tried to picture her target in her head: Hiro\u2019s innocent, smooth pale feet bound together and those bubbly toes tied so helplessly with that thread. To think that it could all be hers. Then she stuffed her backpack with some feathers, her hairbrush, two spare toothbrushes, and her pen collection. Satisfied, the young girl threw her backpack over one shoulder and mimicked checking the time on her bracelet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry David Lopez, I\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d She waved cheerfully at her cat who deigned to turn around and yawn, sharing none of her excitement. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sidestepped the piles of discarded trash bags, quiet as a mouse, and peeked out from the alley into the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just like the movie. Tall, glass skyscrapers glittered in perfect, Disney-like symmetry. Dozens of people populated the bustling street, chatting, while store owners began flipping Closed signs to Open. The smell of fresh espresso thick in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" The lively girl said, jumping up. Something about the perfection of the street, from the twittering birds to the cute boys flying past on skateboards was undeniably Disney-like and evoked a sense of freedom and joy that made Dulce feel like anything was possible. As innocently as she could, she stuck on foot out as one boy with blonde hair and a T shirt over a long sleeve skated past her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew forward in a cartoonish circle. \"Oof!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my bad!\" Dulce giggled, peering down at him, beaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had lost one sandal in the fall, and Dulce was staring at the boy's cute, perfectly shaped foot. Long and smooth ending in five deliciously symmetrical toes. Of course Disney. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"The boy rose up, dusting himself off. He paused, as if just noticing his bared foot, and then looked around curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" said Dulce, revealing the sandal from behind her back. The boy's face brightened and he made a move to take it. Dulce gave it up, watching with sadness as that cute foot was partialled covered up. As the lad skated away, joining his pals, Dulce reminded herself that greater, more vaunted prey lay ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming to herself, Dulce turned to the university from the movie. She smiled and sauntered forward, a girl on a mission.</span></div></div>",

The girl's face broke into a smile and she shuffled around, hiding her backpack behind her. \"Um no, not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro raised one eyebrow skeptically. The young boy had seen other kids, usually vandals, try and enter the university by breaking in. At five one in hightops, with nothing but a red T shirt and cargo shorts, he knew he didn't look much like an enforcer of justice. Still, the girl barely looked older than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need an access card to get in,\" He said, revealing his own card and swiping it at the university gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OH, thats what I was missing. Of course.\" Dulce's smile crinkled even further. \"Well that's too bad I guess. I think I left mine at home. Do you think I could borrow yours for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I dont think so,\",replied Hiro. The innocent kid sounded genuinely sorry too. \"Is your house far away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say so,\" giggled Dulce mischeviously. She was staring at the Asian boy's feet which were covered in red hightop sneakers. They were decently sized compared to his slender ankles and looked brand new. \"Hey OK so super weird request but would you mind letting me see your shoes? It's for...a science project.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro blinked. \"Yeah, sure no problem! These ones are new. I just bought them last week.\" He lifted one foot up and began undoing the laces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, thought Dulce, her fingernails digging into her palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hiro!\" Another familiar face popped out from behind them. It was Wasabi. \"What are you doing, we're going to be late for Gogo's demonstration!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Hiro panicked. \"I totally forgot that was today!\" He quickly laced up his sneaker again, along with all of Dulce's hopes and dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...um, I guess I might see you around then...what was your name?\" Hiro awkwardly waved as he swiped his card into the gate. The security guard at the desk gave him a nod as he entered the premises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dulce,\" answered the girl. \"Very nice to meet you, Hiro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\" Wasabi grabbed the Asian boy's skinny shoulders and pushed him forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh we'll see each other again, thought Dulce. Very soon. But first she had to figure out a way into the university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girl poked her head up from the bush, looked left, looked right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmpty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent down and rummaged through her backpack. Most of the ropes meant for delicate bondage could not hold her weight as an anchor. Finally she found some pink skipping rope that looked durable. Swinging it around, she hooked it to the gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiro,\" Dulce said, straining herself up the gate. \"You and those wonderful soles of yours will be mine this summer. Mine mine mine!\" As their sole owner, shed take wonderful care of them, shed pamper them and treat them and never take a second off of them. And to imagine the squeals and laughter and begging that that cute boy would emit. He would be her perfect little toy to play with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce mounted the gates and jumped down. Or tried to. At the last second, her skipping rope caught the gate top and she dangled a foot off the ground, swinging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!

She popped her bubble gum. \"You know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm,\" Dulce's mind went on double speed. \"Yeah, of course! Remember that one thing, that one time...um..science and...skateboarding! Thats right, you like skateboarding. I mean we like skateboarding. Which we talked about. That one time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce ended her tirade with a friendly smile. She might have gotten away with it if her backpack hadnt decided to spill right then and there. Gogo's eyes widened and then widened further at the non PG13, non-Disney-acceptable, pile of rope, handcuffs, toecuffs, gags, and other more nebulous things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoooooooot, Dulce thought. Oh my god this cant get any worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Gogo?\" said Hiro coming up as well. He saw Dulce. \"Oh hey, it's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know her?\" Gogo asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she also goes to this university. She said she was just going home to grab her passcard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is she dangling off the gate, clearly in the middle of climbing it?\" Gogo tapped her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Hiro frowned. \"Hey that IS suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce's flip flop decided to fall off there and then, hitting Hiro in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aborignal girl wiggled her tanned toes. \"This is a misunderstanding, I swear! Just let me off and I'll explain myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont believe you,\" said Gogo crossing her arms. She casually plucked Dulce's other flip flop off her foot and held it in front of her. \"Besides you arent allowed to enter university labs with open toed shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give that back!\" Dulce swung forward impotently. \"This wasnt how this was supposed to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGogo and Hiro shared a quizzical look. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And also whats all this?\" Hiro picked up a feather duster from Dulce's fallen backpack. \"Are those...skin lotions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two scientists picked up a pouting Dulce and dragged her into a spare lab room for questioning.

I swear I can explain this!\" Heads turned as Gogo and Hiro dragged the complaining, tanned girl into a spare laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab in question looked like a dungeon. It had been frequented by a kinesiology professor back when contact-based experiments were more common. As such, Dulce beheld numerous chairs with straps for holding down individuals and numerous touch-based instruments like sponges and tiny claws. Normally this would have excited her to no end had she been in the opposite position she was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\"Dulce cried as they strapped her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this legal?\" Wasabi asked, rubbing his palms nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's just a little girl!\" Honeylemon crouched down, sympathy on her pretty face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little girls dont have industrial grade handcuffs,\" said Gogo, deadpan. She dumped all of Dulce's precious contents on the table before them. Four curious heads leaned over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are miiiiine!\" Dulce kicked her bare feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I am just confused.\" Wasabi picked up a shiny toe trap. \"You guys...think shes a villian in disguise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour heads turned around to squint at the young aboriginal girl in newfound light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" admitted Hiro. Everyone perked up to listen to their leader. \"But I dont want to interrogate her like our last villian. Maybe shes just a kid who wanted to vandalize something. Although...\" He frowned. \"She did seem to know my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too,\" said Gogo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree about the interrogation part. We're not doing that again,\" said Honeylemon firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how are we supposed to get information out of her?\" asked Wasabi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain they turned to Hiro, the youngest among them but also their de facto leader and a smart and innovative individual. The young Asian boy frowned in thought, and then picked up one of Dulce's big feathers. \"I have an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce watched in fear as her favourite superhero team group huddled and commenced whispering. Her natural curiosity made her strain and kick trying to listen in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" said Hiro walking forward. The others fanned out around him, surrounding Dulce. The inquisitive girl's bright eyes swept to each one in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasabi stood to her left. Honeylemon to her right. Gogo to her left, but almost kneeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro walked forward. \"Alright,\" he said. \"Tell us everything about the bag and how you know our names.\" He had something behind his back. \"Or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear Im just a student! A really smart one for my age just like you!\" Dulce shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, what's Maxwell's four electromagnetic equations?\" piped Wasabi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave us no choice!\" Hiro said. \"Now everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute Asian boy revealed Dulce's own feather duster and snatched one of her bared feet. His warm fingers closed over her tanned foot, holding it in place, while he brought her feather duster down on her sole. Dulce gasped at the sudden contact, jerking and dancing in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was an inexperienced tickler but Dulce was terribly ticklish. Still, her giggles werent entirely unhappy as she felt his fingers brush and stroke her soles. Part of her kept her foot from squirming too much so Hiro could keep a hold over it. She even spread her toes to kind of guide him on where to move that duster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Wasabi brandished Dulce's own quill and began sliding it into her T shirt sleeve to tickle her armpit. Honeylemon squirted some of Dulce's sensitivity lotion onto her neck and spread it around, causing the young girl to moan and gasp, before dancing her fingers over it and under her chin. Gogo had Dulce's other foot and was using her favourite rake for her cat to torture it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahhahahaha stawwwp!\" Dulce screamed, buckling and wiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she likes it,\" said Honeylemon after a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we just have to tickle harder! We can do it team!\" said Hiro. Had this not been a Disney world, such a line would have sounded terrible. But here it galvanized everyone like lightning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AhahahaHohohohahaha! No! Not there!\" The young girl screamed as Hiro's fingers found her worst spot, just under the webbing of her toes. Usually she could only take 30 seconds of tickles there. It had been nearly half an hour. \"Pleeaaasse! Hahahahaha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another ten minutes, tears were streaming down Dulce's face. The team decided to give her a break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to talk?\" asked Gogo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" replied Dulce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be back in the evening,\" said Honeylemon. \"Maybe youll change your mind after some time alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Big Hero 6 left the lab room. Dulce slumped in her chair, defeated. The last she saw before the door swung shut was the heel of Hiro's shoe, knowing with every step it was further out of her reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her small feet were scrunched up, the cold air caressing them making them feel terribly vulnerable but also in a good way. She wiggled in her restraints gamely, trying to free an arm or shimmy loose. After a while, she pursed her lips, scanning the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Dulce's many adventures, rarely had she been so confounded by her enemies. Maybe it was because she had not anticipated the heroes to be so efficient or maybe she had been blinded by her goal: a lovely pair of unblemished, cute boy feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did have ample experience in escaping bondage. Wether for herself or having cute boys she had captured wriggle their way free. Being caught was not the end of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce reached out with one foot and snatched a quill between her big and middle toe. Being the flexible girl she was, Dulce began jabbing the sharp end against the old, decaying lock by her ankles. Within seconds it sprang open, along with all the straps holding her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce collapsed on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up, the adventurer began stowing everything into her backpack again. \"Rematch time,\" said Dulce. \"And this time I'll make sure it's on my terms.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldnt be too impatient. She needed to be prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the next few hours, the eager beaver went and poached a number of important things from other labs and offices. She couldnt find shoes unfortunately - at least none that fit her - but that hardly mattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the anointed time, Hiro made his way to the lab where theyd kept Dulce. He was quickly apprehended by a horde of software engineers who were furious that a young kid the same height as Hiro and wearing similiar clothing had gone and stolen all their wires while hiding his face. The poor boy was perplexed and thus his arrival was delayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Big Hero 6 entered the lab, unaware. When they saw the empty chair with its broke straps, they instantly knew what was wrong. But by then, Dulce, dressed in clothes similiar to Hiro, slammed the door behind them. Sleeping gas which she had borrowed from another lab hissed into the room and soon the team was asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hiro was alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning and bubbling with determination, Dulce sprang back towards her prize. </span></div></div>",

It had taken forever to get the problem of the stolen wire figured out and now he was late to meet up with everyone else. The young genius raced through the halls, sneakers squeaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner, something caught Hiro's ankle and he smashed to the ground, all his velocity sending him sliding forward. Then whatever had tripped his foot yanked on it, sending him upwards. \"Wooahh!\" Hiro waved his arms, trying to orient himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing he knew, he was in a strong, tight net, hanging in the air. He was upside down which wasnt fun and the best he could do in terms of movement was wiggle his feet which were sticking out from two holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" Dulce leaped out, like a magician revealing her trick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" squealed Hiro. \"How did you escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My own little secret,\" she giggled, pressing one finger to the Asian boy's lips. \"Now then, you wouldnt believe how long Ive been waiting for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Hiro bravely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh youll see you silly boy,\" teased Dulce, pracically bursting with energy now that her prey had been captured. She dragged the net across the hall into an empty lecture room she had prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound proof,\" said Dulce, twirling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wont get away with this!

She brightened. \"I know just how to change that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro struggled and squirmed pitifully as his captor dragged him over to the center of the room and retrieved something from her backpack. His legs were still tangled heavily and his feet were sticking out of the holes of the net. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce walked over and grasped the Asian boy's left ankle with one hand and his heel with the other, sitting on his leg to arrest further movement. Hiro had a slim stature, even for his age, and Dulce has able to wrap her entire hand over his slender ankle. He felt his shoe being yanked off, then the cold evening air against his slightly sweaty black socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww Hiro!\" Dulce admonished teasingly. Hiro's face went red as the strange aboriginal girl made fun of him, her cheshire face grinning she mocked waving one hand over her nose. In reality, Hiro's feet didnt smell much at all but she loved the way he looked so embarrased. Dulce tossed the discarded sneaker away and then peeled off Hiro's black sock as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing to my shoes and socks?\" Hiro cried, flailing from under Dulce. Fear slightly tinged his boyish voice as he felt those implacable fingers hold down and then bare his other foot as well. Being raised in a somewhat tradional japanese household, he was used to some degree to being barefoot at home. His brother would always tease him about his extremely soft feet and sometimes tickle them as well to Hiro's frustration. While he was comfortable at home to being without shoes, the child genius rarely went barefoot outside. He had also never had his shoes and socks stripped away by a stranger before. 'What do you plan to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want you to be a bit happier!\" Dulce exclaimed. She wiggled one tanned finger across Hiro's upturned sole. \"See!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger left a pink trail along Hiro's pale, soft foot. Dulce knew that although for an Asian boy, Hiro had fairly large soles, they looked quite sensitive as well. She was rewarded by a shrill girlish scream from the japanese lad and felt his slim body squirm underneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Dulce said, slapping Hiro's bare soles dominantly. \"That was a waaaay better reaction than I hoped for!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait!\" Hiro's plea was so desperate that had he not already been in her grasp and exquisitely unshod, she might have taken pity on him. Instead the aboriginal girl dove all ten nails mercilessly into the Asian boy's feet, raking and scratching them with wanton abandon. His laughs filled the empty lecture room, music to Dulce's ears. She listened to him beg every now and then, and made him list out his most ticklish areas for her exploit such as between his tender little toes, the center of his arches, and what degree of pressure from her nails tickled the most. After ten of so minutes, Dulce stood up from a gasping, teary-eyed Hiro and cracked her fingers. He was curled up, his dark hair covering part of his eyes, and his skinny legs tucked under his chin. As Dulce had instructed, Hiro was not allowed to hide his feet from her, nor curl them up or scrunch his toes. Like the smart boy he was, he was learning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce smiled widely and mimiced raking the air. Hiro flinched, stray giggles spilling from his mouth. \"No no no no please!\" Those big sexy feet flapped in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce laughed and gently slapped his butt. \"Lets give those tootsies a break OK? Where shall I explore next?\"</span></div></div>",

Cootchie cootchie coo Hiro the Tickle Toy. Cootchie cootchie coooo. Im going to tickle those lovely feet of yours.\" She sat down on his ankles again, her own bare tanned feet inches from Hiro's face, asserting her dominance over the boy genius. \"Your arches. Your toes. Your instep. Your heels.\" Each label instigated a dozen quick devious strokes on the respective spot. \"And I love the way you squirm when I tickle your feet just like this.\" She drew a long S with her finger down the japanese boy's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nohhahhahahahaha!\" Hiro screamed. \"Nooahahahat my heels!

He tried to rub one foot against the other to get rid of the ticklish feeling of this dominating girl's fingers on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.\" Dulce stripped off Hiro's shirt and threw it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro yelped, shocked at the sudden disrobement. \"'Hey!\" He tried to hide his bare chest with his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce whistled. \"Arms. Up. Now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro gave Dulce a pleading look but obeyed her, lifting his skinny arms back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce began drilling her nails into his abdomen, watching the slim muscles there scrunch with each jab. Hiro's laughter bounced off the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whos your tickle master?\" Dulce demanded, taking her tickling to the next level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youhhahahaha!\" Howled the boy genius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youhahaha are hahahaha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce grinned and playfully poked Hiro's smooth armpits. \"Come on little boy, say the whole line.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro sputtered and tried to bring his arms down. But the net tangled them and he was left squirming and screaming helplessly with his tormentor's satisfied face inches from his own. To say such a humilating thing while looking directly at his tormentor made Hiro twist and fight in defiance. But soon his spirit was broken and he shouted out \"You're the tickle master gahahahahaha not my armpits please! Youre the tickle master, the tickle master hahahaha please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce tickled his naked chest, playing with his nipples. \"And what are you then, if Im the tickle master?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew hed be smart enough to get it. \"Im your tickle slave!\" Hiro howled, the humiliation of the words coloring his face. \"Hahahaha Im your tickle slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it again. Whos the master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Youre the master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whos the slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me! Hahahaha Im the slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce had Hiro repeat this a few more times until she was satisfied. His entire stomach and chest were reddened from her handiwork. The cute japanese boy was gasping, barechested and barefoot, with his arms obediently held up and his feet stretched out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a fast learner\" said Dulce, running her hand down his warm neck and chest making Hiro shiver. \"Where shall we explore next?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that most boys had places that were especially sensitive simply because no one had ever tickled them there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where else I can make you laugh?\" The spanish girl asked, tapping one nail against her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...please no more,\" Hiro wheezed. His face was slightly red and also damp with nascent tears and sweat. The poor lad was gasping for breath, his black hair draped over his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh can poor little Hiro not take a bit of tickling?\" Dulce asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Come on Hiro, we've barely begun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo emphasis this, she retrieved a pair of toe cuffs from her backpack. Hiro's eyes widened when he saw this and he gave a nervous laugh. \"Wait, those arent what I think they are, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulce snapped the cuffs over the Asian boy's big toes, then wiggled her tanned fingers over his soles playfully. He shrieked, jerking his skinny legs back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're going to find the rest of your ticklish spots, Hiro Hamada, Im going to need to keep you still.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont WANT you to find all my ticklish spots,\" the dark haired boy protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Dulce threw her hands up. \"You're a fan of science right? This is the greatest discovery ever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro blinked and tried to find a way to explain how tickling a kid to death didnt really qualify as science. But there seemed to be no getting through to this strange girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be a good experiment and sit up.\" Dulce wiggled her cold fingers in Hiro's warm armpits causing him to shoot forward in surprise. She giggled and snapped a pair of handcuffs over his wrists and hooked one finger in the loop of the cuffs. She dragged him backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chair waited for him where Dulce deposited the bound boy. She tied his upper arms to the back, along with rope wrapping over his bare chest and waist. Hiros legs were elevated, with his soles resting on another chair where his ankles were lashed together. Dulce ended her lovely work by tying two pink ribbons to Hiro's smallest toes, which, along with the big toe cuffs, forced all his toes to be spread out to their maximum capacity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Isnt this fun?\" Dulce said, slapping his stomach. Hiro grunted. The aboriginal girl skittered her nails across his slender waist and chest, admiring her work as Hiro struggled and whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theres no use struggling,\" said Dulce twirling the key to his toe cuffs on her pinkie. Hiro recoiled as she extended one hand towards him but she merely tugged on the rope binding his arms. \"My knots are the best in the world. So dont worry, youll never ever ever escape.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that like it's a good thing!\" shouted Hiro.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's good for one of us,\" Dulce responded, wiggling her eyebrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand tugging the rope moved along the cord, until it traced his bare waist, just over his hips. Hiro squirmed uncomfortably, a shadow of a forced smile on his lips. His spread out toes tried to curl with apprehension as those indomitable fingers followed the vector of the rope, teasing his sweaty hot skin. They moved dangerously close to his armpit and then settled with the insides of his bicep and elbow instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh someone doesnt like that I see,\" said Dulce, smiling. \"Knowing that the tickles are coming, powerless to stop them.\" She ended her fingers' tickling journey at the palm of Hiro's hand, swirling her nails on his soft palm. Like any good kidnapper she had tied his fingers back, leaving him helpless to stave off her nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cootchie cootchie cooooo.\" He was clearly ticklish on every inch of his body and Dulce was loving it. But it was clear that there werent any spots really significant on his torso. Still, Dulce made the most of it by leaning her lips to his right ear as her fingers drew circles and shapes over his underarm and palms and teased \"cootchie cootchie coooo, tickle tickle tickle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro had squeezed his eyes shut while the slow methodical torture occured and at her voice, so close to his ear, he jumped a little. The boy genius squirmed helplessly as the girls voice continued to tease and belittle him in that baby tone while her unseen hand invoked giggles out of him, pinching and playing along his shivering torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing up here huh,\" Dulce finally concluded, giving Hiro a friendly rib squeeze for his trouble. She took a step back and observed her toy once again. She made a rectangle with her two hands, pretending to squint through them. Hiro lolled his head forward, gasping at the incredibly intimate and irregular tickles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets try that cute tush of yours Hiro\" decided Dulce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro shook his head. \"No! Not my butt!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late!\" Dulce pulled on Hiro's bondage, forcing him to slide up chair until his butt was poking out of that open area between the chairs back and seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith flourish, she pantsed him. The boy genius was wearing blue boxers with robots on them. \"How adorable,\" Dulce commented, making Hiro blush. Then she pulled the back end down and retrieved a feather from her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smart, mature boy who usually spoke with sophistication and reserve squeaked a highpitched scream as Dulce diddled the feather along his butt cheeks and then between them. Racuous, helpless laughter poured out of him as his tormentor traced the tantalizing feather along his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot!\" exclaimed the spanish girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOHAHAHAT THEREEE!\" Hiro howled, his face burning red at the humiliation. </span></div></div>",

With his fingers and toes restricted, all he could do was plead verbally between guffaws of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh youre so cute when you beg\" said Dulce. She was very happy she had found his 'hidden' tickly spot. \"I wish I could give you a break Hiro, but you just make the cutest sounds when I do this.\" Up and down the feather went, sliding between his cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhahahahahaaa Stawwwhhap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or this.\" She twirled the feather inwards, making Hiro jump and squirm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahhahhaha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes Dulce decided to be nice and put away the feather.

She produced a big bristly brush almost the size of Hiro's slender foot. The skinny lad's face fell as he saw the spanish girl twirling the huge brush expertly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont you dare move your feet away Hiro Hamada!\" Dulce admonished loudly. She spun the brush around and smacked him lightly on his bare butt with it, leaving a pink mark. \"You will be a good obedient tickle toy for me, got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for the him to answer, Dulce grabbed Hiro's skinny ankle possessively and sawed the brush mercilessly on the Asian boy's quivering pink foot.

The last thing the boy remembered was entering his house after a long day at the lab with his team, and then ascending the stairs after powering down Baymax. The dark haired lad had sensed something amiss right before his hand touched the doorknob, but he had been too tired to care, and entered his room. <br>\r\nNow he looked around, blinking at the strong afternoon light streaming through his window. Outside, the city skyline, as beautiful as ever, stood out sharply against the crisp blue sky. Hiro tried to sit up, but found something tugging his wrists. Someone had bound his slender wrists together with a pair of his old socks, and then duct taped them to the ceiling. <br>\r\nStartled, the boy genius tried to turn around, but found that his ankles had been cuffed in a similar manner to his chair so that his knees were resting in the seat and his soles were aimed behind him. <br>\r\n\"Whats going on?\" The dark haired boy said, panic settling into his chest. The chair rolled back and forth as he struggled in vain. <br>\r\n\"Hello Hiro Hamada,\" said a voice from behind him. A cold finger casually swiped the bottom of his upturned foot causing the Asian boy to screech, arching his back. He had always been extremely ticklish, much to the cruel delight of his mother and friends and to his own constant embarasment. <br>\r\n\"Whos there?\" Hiro asked, scrunching his pink toes. <br>\r\nHe heard a camera flash next and managed to turn his head ever so slightly to see a young girl about his age of spanish looking descent with tanned skin and two braided pigtails. She wore a casual pink hoodie and cargo shorts along with flip flops. She was poising a camera just above his naked pink soles and taking picture after picture. <br>\r\nNoticing his gaze, she stood up. The harbinger of Hiros doom and his captor flashed a bright, innocent smile full of jaunty fun. \"The names Dulce Corazon, pleased to meet you!\" <br>\r\n\"Why did you tie me up? And how do you know my name?\" Hiro asked anxiously. His wide eyes were trained on her hands which flexed dexteriously and eagerly, hoping theyd stay away from any further involvement with his feet. <br>\r\n\"I came across the multiverse to tickle you!\" answered Dulce, patting her prisoners back cheerfully. <br>\r\n\"What?!\" The boy genius shook his head. \"Thats crazy, are you saying multiple dimensions exist?'\"<br>\r\n\"Of course dummy,\" answered Dulce. She danced her finger down his bare neck, trailing over his shirt where she began to poke and prod. \"And theyre all full of ticklish, soft skinned boys like yourself, Hiro Hamada.\"<br>\r\nHiro snorted and giggled, shaking his head as the strange girl tickled him relentlessly with his fingers. Dulce jabbed along his ribs, up and down hard enough that his thin T shirt made little difference. Hiro burst out laughing when she touched his hips and Dulce clapped her hands in joy at the reaction. \"Looks like Ive found a sweet spot!\" <br>\r\nThe boy genius could hardly deny it as he wheezed and huffed, the slim muscles in his arms and torso flexing as he tried to pull himself away. Dulce was having the time of her life, giving her captive boy no breaks, stroking her fine nails under his shirt and over his warm stomach and hips. Hiro squealed at the cold touch and dissolved into childish giggles. <br>\r\nDulce continued her fun for about ten minutes, before divulging her attention to his perfect, smooth, pink feet. She always loved it when boys took care of their feet and Hiro was no exception. He had pale, unblemished insteps, pink soft undersides and a set of lovely symmetrical toes. Dulce wasted no time slapping on a pair of toe cuffs and then wiggling a small lotion bottle in front of Hiro's face, teasing the Asian boy. <br>\r\n\"No not that!\" Hiro cried, reading the label. <br>\r\n\"Oh yes, my little tickle toy!\" said Dulce, ruffling his hair. Now his struggled increased dramatically, the rest of his pink oval-shaped toes aside from his big ones wiggling in denial. Dulce slapped on the first dollop of lotion onto the japanese boy's left foot causing him to jerk aside. Then she used both hands to rub it all across his sole, digging her fingers into his heel and arch and even between his toes, rubbing her palms across those soft soles until everything was evenly coated to her liking. Now one of Hiro's slender feet was faintly shiny and smelled of lavender over its natural smell. Dulce squeezed some lotion in her other hand and slapped it onto Hiro's other foot, giving it an equal and relentless treatment, until her fingers had slipped between all his toes, and every inch of his feet was covered in Dulce's lotion, had been touched by her hands. <br>\r\n\"Perfecto!\" said Dulce, admiring her handiwork. She wiped her hands on a towel thoroughly (leaving even a trace on herself left the skin exquisitely sensitive for hours). She darted a glance at the boy attatched to those feet she'd been preparing and was pleased to see a look of fear and submissiveness over the skinny dark haired boy. His feet were crossed, as though hiding from even the bedroom breeze and he was gasping faintly from all the nascent tickling her fingers had left. <br>\r\nDulce took Hiro's chin under one finger and said to the boy \"dont worry, the worse is yet to come my tickle pet \" <br>\r\n\"Please dont tickle me!\" Hiro said. \"I'll do anything!\" <br>\r\n\"Hmmm how about this? Since youre so smart...\" Dulce gently brushed her fingers under his chin making him giggle and squirm in discomfort. \"why dont you tell me where you think your most ticklish spot on your feet is? If you are correcy I'll let you decide where youll be tickled first.\"<br>\r\nHiro gulped nervously. He could feel the cold breeze stroking his vulnerable, oily soles like a premonition of the torture to come. He couldnt stand the idea of Dulce's cruel long fingers having their way with his tied up feet. He closed his eyes and tried to think of where his soles might be most sensitive. Memories of being pinned down and tickled by his mom and friends played in his head while Dulce's rough fingers under his chin anchored him to reality. </span></div></div>",

For weeks she has been looking forward to some much-needed time off, but not for the reasons people would expect from students her age.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months ago, she had come into possession of a piece of alien technology.  What looks like a platinum bracelet with a verdigris stone adorning her left wrist is actually a device capable of warping reality itself, allowing her to travel across time and space.  To what extent, you ask?  By the fact there is a fanfiction tag attached to this interactive, Dulce had discovered (through trial and error, a practice of which no Doctor would ever approve) she could jump across fictional universes; whatever name of the universe she could imagine and input, she could access from the seemingly endless databases.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, this made the teenage Paraguayan reality-hopper curious about a lot of things, not least of all her various fictional \"crushes\" from various media.  There have even been time when she wondered what their feet might have been like up-close (if no such visuals existed), what they would feel like, and whether or not they were ticklish....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut two and two together and you can see where this is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nFeliciana Mateo Dulce Nu\u00f1ez y Coraz\u00f3n:</b> Our main character and universe-hopper extraordinaire.  Thirteen and a half years old, 5'1'', 82 pounds, slender build, Spanish/Aboriginal ancestry, size 5.5 feet (U.S.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is a picture of the \"sweet heart\" in question, commissioned by yours truly. <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/701ee54d-08fd-45a8-a534-a9e5eea4ebd9/ddmnjto-e094d496-049a-4b30-b539-e46dd1e0f8aa.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzcwMWVlNTRkLTA4ZmQtNDVhOC1hNTM0LWE5ZTVlZWE0ZWJkOVwvZGRtbmp0by1lMDk0ZDQ5Ni0wNDlhLTRiMzAtYjUzOS1lNDZkZDFlMGY4YWEuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.VecLhOUyHOzKOnFd2EBjnRvGx5LxBMUHcBnSF-2PVe8\" target=\"_blank\">https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/701ee54d-08fd-45a8-a53...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>RULES:</u><br>\r\n- Write in 3rd person.<br>\r\n- No spam or ridiculously short chapters.  I can help with spelling errors and such, but I also appreciate proofreading.  Don't end them too early either.<br>\r\n- You may use male characters (preferably those closest to Dulce in age, though I'm not too picky) from any anime, video game, cartoon series, webcomics, whatever medium you can think of for storylines with Dulce.<br>\r\n- In a similar vein to another interactive I've made in the past, this one will focus on a girl interacting with male feet.  Now I don't mind if Dulce receives tickling or footplay once in a while (she likes being tickled up to a point), but I'd prefer it if Dulce is the one doing stuff to boys' feet.<br>\r\n- Going off of that, traps are allowed for choices because I like messing with my character's head,especially when it comes to her asking why she feels attracted to another \"girl\".  This can extend to <i>reverse traps</i> too.  And since I've just mentioned female feet...<br>\r\n- Female characters can only be selected as choices for independent storylines with Dulce <i><b>IF</b></i> they had either disguised themselves as males convincingly in canon, are reverse traps (as I've already stated) and/or they are definite tomboys.  Also, don't include them as choices to the point where it becomes a female-centric story; this <i>is</i> a f/m interactive after all.<br>\r\n- I <i><b>might</b></i> decide to include a section for OC storylines, or I might not.  I'll need to think about it.<br>\r\n- Keep Dulce and any of the third-party male characters in.... character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from the above rules, I can't think of anything else to add to the list so I'll close with my favourite maxim: have fun. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, and I shall reward well-written chapters with points for this interactive too - as long as they follow the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>UPDATE:</b> After careful consideration, I have decided to allow the creation of an OC section for those who would rather do that instead.  The rules for chapters and borrowed characters from other media still apply to any creations made in the aforementioned section.  But apart from that, feel free to do whatever.
