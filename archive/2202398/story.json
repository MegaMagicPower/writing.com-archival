            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mr. Matthews walked into the library and surveyed the room. There were six students that showed for his inaugural Hike Club meeting. He looked down at the stack of liability forms in his hand. Seeing that the principal had emphasized no less than seven times after grudgingly giving the okay to starting the extracurricular club two weeks ago, the teacher supposed he should get them out of the way before he forgot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, everybody. Please start by filling this in\u2026\u201d said Mr. Matthews, passing out the forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the students began to scribble in the blanks, he surveyed the room. Five juniors and a senior. Rachel, one of the juniors, was one of the more talented athletes in the school. She had made the varsity soccer team in her freshman year and was talented enough to have a realistic shot at an athletic scholarship to college. Mr. Matthews hadn\u2019t had her in class, but he had heard good things about her can-do attitude and ability to push herself from Mr. Len, the coach of the girl\u2019s soccer team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrin, at the next table scribbling away at her form, was a quiet, hardworking student. She was a year ahead in most of her classes and had ambitions to go to medical school. Mr. Matthews wasn\u2019t sure if that was more her ambition or that of her Korean parents. Though he had her in class this semester, she was shy and difficult to get to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the next table, sat Brent and his girlfriend, Alexandra. Brent was a receiver on the football team. He wasn\u2019t the greatest student, but he got by. He was, however, good enough to have signed a letter of intent to play football at Washington State University. His girlfriend, Alexandra, was gorgeous. Her lithe body had really begun to blossom over the past year. She was already the most beautiful girl at the school, and Mr. Matthews wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she became a model or actress once she graduated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and Walt were at the table to the far right. Megan was a curious girl that liked to participate in renaissance fairs and live action roleplaying. Mr. Matthews was fairly certain that she was in the band, though he couldn\u2019t remember what she played. Walt was a really smart kid that Mr. Matthews had enjoyed having in class. Reserved, he was into video games and books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them, it seemed, were into hiking. Rachel, however, was the reason that he had started the club. Since he didn\u2019t have her in class, he needed another way to make contact. His premonition had told him that she was the one. Mr. Matthews had overheard Walt talking about her love of hiking and the outdoors, so\u2026 Hike Club it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter discussion of everyone\u2019s experience level and comfort level, Mr. Matthews announced \u201cOur first hike will be Mt. Si in North Bend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, Brent, and Walt looked excited. Trin, Alexandra, and Megan looked a little unsure. It was an ambitious hike, but Mr. Matthews had his reasons for choosing it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've always wanted to hike to the top of Mt. Si. My dad says it's the training hike for climbing Mt. Rainier!\" Rachel gushed to Walt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is Rainier next up?\" asked Walt, nudging Rachel with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you put it that way, we could go together...\" Rachel replied, fluttering her eyelashes in an exaggerated display of coquettishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalt sighed inwardly. He knew that Rachel thought of him only as a buddy, but he would love nothing more than to go to Mt. Rainier with her. Together. With no one else around. His mind began to fantasize about Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...right, Walt\" said Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" asked Walt, snapping back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan sighed. \"Earth to Walt. This is Houston, over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, got distracted. What did you say?\" asked Walt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was telling Trin here that Salish tribe used to use fir free branches to ward off evil spirits. Since it's getting close to Halloween, I thought that might be a good idea for us too.\" Megan clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to her, Trin. She's a goofball.\" said Walt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked on shyly while Megan punched Walt in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooowww!\" Walt said, rubbing his arm. \"That actually hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" replied Megan with a lopsided grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get going, folks!\" said Mr. Matthews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Matthews wanted to get Rachel to the target zone to see if she had the sight. If she did, he could probably beat the Others to it. He didn't think that they knew about this location. Of course, the Others seemed to have an uncanny ability to locate the treasures that no one in the Group understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi and Brent were off by themselves near the trail marker, deep in discussion, but Mr. Matthews gathered them as well, getting the hike started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone needs to use the restroom, now's your chance...\" Mr. Matthews announced as they approached the pit toilets just past the trail marker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww, those things stink!\" said Lexi, wrinkling her nose. Brent laughed, then headed over to use them, much to his girlfriend's dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group hiked up switchback after switchback until they finally arrived at the summit ridge. There was a light dusting of snow from the previous night, and the group sat down to put on their jackets while they rested at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel noticed something in the distance, near the haystack and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, there's some golden shining thing over there. I'm going to check it out...\" she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Matthews beamed in joy. She did have the gift! She was--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Mr. Matthews' last thought as a blood-covered blade appeared in his chest, plunged through from back to front. He dropped to his knees and collapsed, revealing a beautiful woman in a black skin-tight bodysuit and a hand on her hip.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lillian turned to move her mouth inches from Norman's ear, shouting to be heard over the insanely loud techno playing over the fraternity's speakers. \"I hate these fucking parties. Why do I always get talked into coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman took his turn, moving mouth to Lillian's ear and shouting in return, \"I know. Me too. Wanna head out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!!\" came Lillian's reply. The two slipped into their traditional routines, Lillian collecting Amanda, and Norman collecting George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian scanned the room, until her eyes came to rest on Amanda's athletic 5'6\" frame, her long, light-brown hair bouncing as she danced, plastic cup held over her head as she swayed her shapely ass to the music. Lillian felt a surge of jealousy watching her pretty friend holding the attention of a good-looking guy with her sexy movements. How Lillian wished her shapeless form were more like that of her friend... she would give <i>anything</i> to have a guy look at her like that. Maybe even Norman? She had those kinds of thoughts randomly about her suite-mate, but never took them too seriously. She probably had a chance with him... and their semi-nerdy interest were pretty well in alignment. But... on to the task at hand: collecting her roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian rose and approached Amanda, tapping her on the shoulder from behind. Startled, Amanda dropped her drink... right on Lillian's head. As the cheap beer splattered all over her, soaking her hair and face, and dribbling on her top, she closed her eyes and sighed. It was a fitting end to her miserable night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian's sigh propelled a few droplets of beer onto her attractive friend's glistening cleavage as she turned around. \"Oh my goshhh, Lil, I'm shooo shorry,\" Amanda exclaimed cringing at what she had done to her friend and stumbling a bit as the room spun in  alcohol-fueled motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Lillian opened her eyes, beer still flowing down her face, grabbed her friend's hand, and led her out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Norman spotted George chatting (well, more like the frat party equivalent of chatting--hollering at the top of his lungs over the music) enthusiastically with Megan, the attractive, ginger-haired girl from his LARP group. She was the whole reason they were all here. George had the crush to end all crushes, and she was its object. Unfortunately for George, she had placed him so far into the friend zone, he would have to cross a continent to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Megan was putting on her jacket and waving goodbye. If she weren't Norman would never have been able to get George to leave. As Megan walked away, George began to survey the room until he spotted Norman. Norman nodded his head toward the door, and his friend nodded back in acknowledgement. They both made their way through the plastic-cup holding crowd toward the door, meeting Lillian and Amanda just outside in the cool, fall air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Norman asked Lillian before he could think better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian shot back an angry glare, \"Our good friend Amanda here, that's what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shaid I'm shorry, Lil. Geez!\" Amanda replied, as she focused on putting one foot in front of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them noticed the shadowy figure that slinked quietly behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway to the dorm, Norman suggested that they take a shortcut across the cemetery. After swinging his legs over the fence and dropping to the ground, Norman turned around to catch Amanda if she fell. Fortunately, Amanda's significant athletic prowess compensated for her drunken state, and she gracefully landed in a crouch. Unable to reach the top of the fence, George gave Lillian a boost up one side, while Norman caught her on the other. Then, George swung himself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, Norman felt uneasy, as if he were being watched. Maybe this shortcut hadn't been such a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, coming out of nowhere at incredible speed, a dark shape barreled into Amanda, sending her sprawling to the ground. Before anyone could react, a silver flash flew past them from behind... directly into the dark shape's chest. The dark shape gave a brief crimson flash, before disappearing in smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian, Norman, and George turned, eyes wide, to see a slim, leggy feminine shape clad in form-fitting black striding toward them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was difficult to make out her features in the dark night of the new moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the woman grew close, a distant street lamp provided just enough light for the group to see that she was stunningly beautiful. She looked like a buff supermodel. As she reached them, she said simply, \"Choose your champion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian, Amanda, Norman, and George waited expectantly, but the woman said no more. Norman and George exchanged a look, and Norman shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscomfort and impatience driving her bravery, Lillian, hair still dripping from the beer that Amanda had spilled on her, took a few steps toward the woman. \"Care to elaborate, lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further words, the woman grabbed Lillian's arm. The two of them disappeared in a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian blinked. She and the mysterious woman had appeared in a dark stone room, lit by torchlight. Three pedestals that looked a bit like bird baths stood in the middle of the otherwise empty room. The one to the left contained glowing blue liquid; the one in the middle, swirling green; and the one to the right, dull red liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian turned to the tall, gorgeous woman next to her, trying to decide which question to ask first, when the woman gave her a cup and said a single word. \"Choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian paused again, waiting for the woman to say more, but, again, she didn't. It was fairly clear that the woman expected her to take a drink of one of the three liquids. Lillian had no idea, however, which to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this like a Harry Potter sorting hat kind of thing?\" she asked aloud, not really expecting an answer, and not receiving one. The woman simply stood there like a statue, gaze locked firmly on the stone wall across the room. \"Loqacious, aren't you?\" she sassed the woman, probably unwisely, but she was a little emboldened from her frustration and having to make what seemed like an important decision based on no information whatsoever. Walking around the pedestals, she finally decided to look at their supporting columns. She saw some wording etched in each one. They all said the same thing: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>cogitant facti sunt</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Latin. How she wished she had taken Latin right now! Lillian chided herself, she need to do the best she could to figure this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cogitant</i> looked like cognitive or cognition, so it probably had something to do with thinking. <i>Facti</i>. She wasn't sure. Fact? <i>Sunt</i>. She had no idea about that one. Think fact? Think about what you want to be, maybe? It seemed to make sense. It had to be something like that. She again tried to think of what sunt might mean, but it was no use. Between the pressure and the events of the night--not to mention the couple of beers she'd had at the party--her brain wasn't in full gear right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink fact. What you think is what you become. What did she want to become? She should probably think about what she wanted to be like or change into or something when she drank the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around to the other side of the pedestals to see if they said something on the other side. They did! The words inscribed were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue liquid - <i>spiritus</i><br>\r\nGreen liquid - <i>animo</i><br>\r\nRed liquid -<i> corporis</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian didn't know what <i>animo</i> meant, but she knew that <i>spiritus</i> was spirit and <i>corporis</i> was body, like corporeal. <i>Animo</i> had to be mind. Mind, body, and spirit. It made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... it seemed like the blue one made her spirit become something, the green one made her mind become something, and the red one made her body become something. <i>I guess the question is</i>, Lillian thought, <i>which one do I want to change...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Think about what you want your body to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of her attractive roommate Amanda--her 5'6\" height, her athletic body, her lovely features. She looked back at the buff supermodel woman still standing like a statue in the corner of the room. She tried to think of an idealized version of herself--athletic, taller, beautiful. She might as well take advantage, if she got to choose, and thought of herself as incredibly sexy. She smiled at the mental image. Let's see Norman resist <i>that</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspired by her new self-image and the thought of seducing Norman, she filled the cup to the absolute brim with the red liquid, and drank it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she was in some type of stone cell with iron bars. In the corner was another girl. A slight but pretty girl, probably around 5' with long dark hair and cute features sat there, arms around her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she said. \"You must be new. I haven't seen you in here before. I'm Kelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian looked at the girl, walked over, and offered her hand. \"I'm Lillian. Nice to meet you. What is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guess is as good as mine. I was cutting through a cemetery at night on my way home, with a friend, and this really good-looking guy came up to us and told us to choose a champion. I started to ask him what he meant, and I was here!\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds familiar,\" said Lillian. \"Except that it was a woman that asked me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one did you choose?\" asked Kelly, looking eager to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red.\" Lillian answered simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool. There was another red in here when I first arrived. He was... easy on the eyes. Too bad he's gone.\" Kelly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone?\" Lillian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He had gone through two trials. After they took him for the third trial, he never came back. Not sure if he didn't make it through the trial, or if they let him go after that or what.\" Kelly answered. \"He said that the same thing happened with the girl that was here when he first arrived. Two trials, then gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the trials?\" asked Lillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me, they've been one-on-one fights with these weird creatures. I beat them both times, and then I came back here. That's all I know. You use your new abilities to fight them.\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New abilities?\" asked Lillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're a red, so you're basically a fighter.\" Kelly replied. \"I chose the blue liquid, so I got magic.\" Kelly reached out her hand, and blue lightening cracked and curled around it. \"Pretty awesome, right?\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too bad there's no mirrors in here to check out your new self, but you should check out as much as you can. I'm sure your body changed. The last guy said his did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled that she hadn't thought to check herself out earlier, she looked down to see if she had changed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bending over, she crunched down on them. She could see the faint outline of abs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian felt around behind her. Her ass was tighter, harder, and had probably gained an inch, just like her breasts! This was unbelievable. Her legs felt smooth and shapely. They seemed longer as well, though it was difficult to tell. As she ran her hands along them, she noticed small triceps popping into relief on her arms. She flexed one arm to see the small bump of a bicep appear. How cool was that! She looked over to her shoulder and saw small striations appearing as she moved. She was buff! Okay, not really buff but had small, visible muscles. It was more than she had ever had before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow she wished she could see her face! But there was no mirror in the small cell. It was difficult enough to see the rest of her body in the dim, flickering torchlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering Kelly, whom she had forgotten about in the joy of exploring her body, Lillian looked back up to meet Kelly's eyes. Kelly's eyes held a glimmer of amusement, as she smiled back at Lillian. \"I take it, you like the changes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Lillian replied bashfully, a little embarrassed at having checked herself out so obviously in front of the smaller girl. Had she really cupped her breasts? Right in front of this girl she barely knew? Oh my God!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian heard a clank and looked to the cell of the door. The silent supermodel had inserted a key and was about to open the door. This was her chance to escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Silent Supermodel, as Lillian decided to name her in her mind, drew the door back, Lillian raced for the door, determined to slip through, evade her captor and make a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe darted through the opening, when she suddenly felt Silent Supermodel grab her around the waist. Lillian pushed at her arm, trying to dislodge it, but it was like iron. Even with her new muscles, she could not seem to budge the woman's arm in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing Lillian to her side, she carried Lillian with one arm, descending down the stone steps into the darkness below...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silent Supermodel finally set Lillian back down, shoving her into another cage before locking the door. This cage was larger and had bars on three sides, stone wall on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this supposed to be my trial?\" asked Lillian, mostly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lillian's suprise, Silent Supermodel answered, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian, frustrated at how little information she was being given and scared at the prospect of a fight with some kind of creature Was the fight to the death? <i>Shit,</i> she had forgotten to ask Kelly. That was probably important to know. If she killed something that she wasn't supposed to kill, that might not go so well for her. If she wasn't trying to kill the creature, but it was trying to kill her, that was probably a pretty big disadvantage. <i>Stupid, Lil, stupid,</i> she chastised herself. She had been so distracted by her improved body, she wasn't keeping her attention on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard roaring coming from the stairwell. It must be the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it came into view, Lillian cursed. A huge, muscled humanoid beast was being pulled by four men gripping chains. Lillian wasn't a very good judge of height and distance, but this thing had to be at least seven feet tall. <i>If it takes four men just to drag this thing down here, how on earth am I supposed to beat it up or kill it</i>? Lillian mused to herself, fear beginning to consume her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking like a leaf at the far end, Lillian watched as the men forced the brutish beast into the cell with her. <i>Get ahold of yourself, Lil.</i> Lillian took a few deep breaths in an effort to control her fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining the cell around it, the beast finally noticed Lillian's form pressed to the back stone wall. It charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflexes faster than she was used to, Lillian dodged to the side and under its long arm as it reached for her. Almost instinctively, she fired an elbow into the side of the beast eliciting a grunt from the thing as she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where did that come from?</i> Lillian wondered. <i>That red juice must have done more to my body than just make it look good.</i> She thought of Amanda. If she were here, she would have teased Lillian about her <i>mad fighting skillz</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she wished Amanda were here. And Norm and George for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast attacked again. She dodged again in the same way. This time, as she struck the thing, it spun and raked her back with the claws of its other hand. Lillian's back exploded in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Lillian chided herself again. Her back throbbed where the beast's claws had torn deep grooves down her back, as the sharper pain began to subside. <i>If you keep doing the same thing and letting it learn your moves, you're going to get yourself killed here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt blood start to creep down her back from several of the grooves. She couldn't see it, so she didn't know how bad it was. Maybe that was for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the spirit of unpredictability, she took the offensive firing her hardest blows at its chest, stomach, and anything else she could reach as she lunged forward, driving it back. It grunted in pain at each strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian darted back before taking a defensive posture again, shifting her weight back and forth on the ball of each foot, primed for quick movement. Wow! She was moving like a real fighter. Go red juice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian tried to move in on the beast again, but this time, its claws flashed out nearly taking her head off. She ducked in time, though, got inside its reach and delivered a hard front kick that sent it stumbling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, I must be pretty friggin' strong!</i> Lillian thought, confidence beginning to grow a little. <i>I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have survived those claws, though, if they had hit my neck. This must a fight to the death. It has claws, though, and I have fists. How am I supposed to kill this thing without any weapons?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian scanned her eyes around the room. Was there anything here she could use? No. The floor was completely bare. Her eyes searched the stone wall for anything. A weapon rack would be good... but... no. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! There was something. Sitting in a sconce was a torch high on the wall, providing the only dim light to the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the creature lurched forward, she maneuvered between its legs, launching both arms upward in a dual strike. It connected, sending the creature tumbling over her, though its leg caught her in the head. She hit the ground hard, seeing stars. Knowing she didn't have much time before the creature rose back up, she shook off the dizziness and ran the far wall. Her foot found purchase on the stone, and she launched herself up enough to tip the torch with her hand, destabilizing it enough to drop to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked it up and threw it at the thing. It connected with the creature's head, the burning oil on the surface of the torch splattering all over its face. It cried out, scratching at the flames. However, that only served to get burning oil on its hands as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian hugged the wall at the farthest end of the cell as she watched the thing struggle and burn, feeling slightly remorseful, as she saw the pain that it was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the adrenaline of the moment began to subside, her back and head <i>throbbed</i> painfully, bringing tears to her eyes. She would need to tend to these injuries quickly, especially if she had at least two more of these fights to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a flash. She was back in the pedestal room with the bird baths. Silent Supermodel was there. \"Choose\" said the strange woman again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice vocabulary, lady. Monosyllable, much?\" she asked, mostly to amuse herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent Supermodel just stood there, expressionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the cup again, filled it to the rim with the red liquid, and drank again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash, and she was in the cell with Kelly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly smiled. \"How'd it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, she realized that it wasn't hurting any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bad what is?\" Kelly asked before a look of realization crossed her face. \"Oh yeah, the liquid heals you after every trial. Speaking of which... you look awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her excitement to relay the battle and concern about her injuries, Lillian had forgotten to check out her latest round of changes. Her small B's had swelled to borderline C's. Firm and perfectly-shaped, she couldn't wait to show them off to Amanda. They were ever so slightly smaller, but shapelier than her friends she decided as she examined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faint outline of abs from before had become a full on six pack. Hard and sexy, this was the stomach she had always dreamed of having. Her arms felt hard with small but noticeable feminine muscle rounding them out. Her legs were sleek and slim. They wouldn't have been out of place on a ballerina. How she wished for a mirror...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian realized that she felt strong. A certain... vitality... flowing through her that she had never felt before. She was almost looking forward to that next trial. <i>Was that weird?</i> she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother clang at the door, and Silent Supermodel pulled it open, looking at Kelly. Without a word, Kelly walked up to her, offering her hands. Silent Supermodel clamped the manacles down on them and led her away, closing the cell door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her third trial,</i> Lillian said to herself. <i>Good luck, Kelly..</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After about 15 minutes, Kelly flashed back into the cell, slumping against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it go?\" asked Lillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were three of them this time. It was... so much harder. I almost didn't pull this one off.\" stated Kelly. She seemed to be clutching her left side, but Lillian couldn't see any injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not what Lillian wanted to hear. A stab of fear shot straight to her heart. <i>Was she going to be able to get through this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could think about it too much more, Silent Supermodel came to the cage again. Weighing her options, Lillian decided to try escape again. She didn't see a downside. The worst that could happen is the same thing that happened last time, and Silent Supermodel would carry her instead of pull her by chains. So she made a break for it, trying again to slip past the gorgeous guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thing happened. The only difference was that she seemed able to move Silent Supermodel's arm a bit this time. Not enough to actually escaped, but her struggles were strong enough to cause her some difficulty. Silent Supermodel gave a rare expression as Kelly was able to do this, however. She seemed to look... concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was pushed into the cell, she saw a tall, handsome human man at the far end of the cell. Was she supposed to fight a person now? Was she supposed to <i>kill</i> a person now? Somehow that seemed a much more daunting proposition than killing even a huge beastly monster as she had last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the man changed. He became a six foot monsterously huge wolf. Ahh, so werewolf it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man charged before Lillian had any more time to think. Kicking out her leg, she rolled onto her back, launching the wolf all the way to the far wall, where it impacted with a crunch. She did a helicopter ninja thing with her legs was was back on the balls of her feet in a flash. Wait... how had she done that? Her body was doing this seemingly without her mind's knowledge or direction. At least it seemed to be doing a better job than she would have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf slowly rose to its feet and launched at her through the air. Stepping to the side lightning fast, she fired a left cross at its head, connecting with its head and sending it reeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking its head as if stunned, the wolf wasn't coming at her again, so she approached it warily. It still seemed dazed, so she risked a big, slow, powerful uppercut to the underside of its jaw, taking advantage of its current state to deliver a knockout punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast's head snapped back with a crack, and it collapsed unmoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire fight hadn't even taken 30 seconds. She must be getting better at this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash, and she was back to the pedestal room. Silent Supermodel looked concerned again as she filled her cup absolutely full of the red liquid and drank it all. Then a flash back to the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was shocked at the speed of Lillian's return. \"Wow! That didn't take long... and man, you look buff! And gorgeous! I really should have gone with the red stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian looked down. Full swells pushed her shirt out even farther than before. Large C's probably? Her abs were even more impressive. A diamond hard eight pack, jagged obliques, etched Adonis belt. She had never seen more impressive stomach on anyone, even in fitness magazines. Legs carved in marble, smooth and perfect, displayed striation and sinew with every movement. Her arms were similar with small but hard, lean, feminine muscles standing in full relief along their length. She looked like a fitness model who hadn't eaten a carb in five years. Except for her full, ripe breasts, which seemed incongruous with her lean, shredded muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of chatting with Kelly--she was really coming to like this girl--Silent Supermodel came back, pointing at Lillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn--again?\" Lillian said, surprised. She debated whether to make a break for it, but, again, didn't see any reason not to. She ran at the door just as the tall, beautiful automaton opened it, lowering her shoulder to it. Silent Supermodel's eyes went wide, and she was knocked back to the far wall of the hallway. \"Come on, Kelly, let's go!\" Lillian cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked shocked, but she did as instructed. As her friend darted through the opening, Silent Supermodel seemed to recover, blocking their path to the door down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian walked up to her, light on her feet, shifting her weight from one foot to the other automatically. Silent Supermodel fired an insanely fast jab at her head, but Lillian moved just enough to feel the air against her cheek as the tall woman's fist sailed by. She sent an uppercut into the woman's solar plexus (it seemed to be her new body's favorite move), and Silent Supermodel began to double over with the impact. Lillian grabbed the back of the woman's head as it came down as used the downward momentum to smash the woman's face into her rising knee. She felt the pop as her knee plowed into the poor woman's nose. She felt a pang of remorse as the woman fell to the ground like a sandbag, but she had to keep moving if she wanted to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed Kelly's hand, her friend giving her a look of \"I can't believe that you just did that!\" and pulled her friend along to the far door. The door led to a grand hall, opulently decorated, but, fortunately, empty. She saw a huge, arched double-door at the far side of the room, and ran for it, still pulling her friend along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her shoulder into the door at a dead run, and the huge, thick door moved open enough to allow the two of them to pass. They ran out into the daylight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Momentarily confused at what Kelly was seeing, she finally looked down. Ten yards in front of them, something was coming up from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian's eyes went wide as she realized it was hands... and a head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!\" Lillian said. She didn't curse often, but if this wasn't a WTF moment, she wasn't sure what was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing finished coming out of the ground and rose to its feet. It was a person... sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirt-laden stringy dark hair partially covered a pale, partially decomposed face. Bones showed through cheeks. It wore a suit, dirty but high quality. It stretched out its arms and walked slowly toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian saw a bolt of electricity fly past her and into the thing. She looked back and saw Kelly, a single arm raised, palm facing outward, electricity crackling around it. Lillian swiftly turned back to the creature, the... zombie? It was shuddering as the blue electrical current writhed around it. Once the electricity dissipated, however, it resumed its forward march.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian stepped up to meet it before it arrived at the rest of the group. He pulled back her right arm, forming a closed fist with her hand. She let it fly. Her fist connected right under the thing's jaw before it could react. She gave the punch everything she had, and its head went flying, arcing upward, leaving the rest of the body behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body seemed to stiffen, then it went down on both knees. Then, it fell face-first (well, chest-first actually, considering the whole lack of head thing) to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian heard slow clapping coming from behind them as the zombie body hit the turf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely done.

She was tall for a Chinese woman, at 5'6\", and extremely thin. She brushed a few strands of shoulder-length ebony hair from her eyes to use the retina scanner. A green light came on with a beep, and the exterior door to the lab slid open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes as the exterior door closed again, and a cloud of sterilizing agent formed around her. 120 seconds later, the interior door to the lab slid open, and she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a perfectly square box of thick plexiglass, a glowing blue orb hung, suspended by... nothing... in the center of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXei Li slowly walked around the floating object before passing her hand over the cube. No strings. She grabbed a ring clamp and swung it above and below the cube. No magnets. What was this thing? How was it remaining suspended?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a noise behind her! Startled, she spun to see... Freddie walking in from the decontamination chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie's eyes were understandably glued to the bizarre object in the middle of the room, just as hers had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to it, he reached out his hand to touch the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's a...\" Xei Li started. Freddie touched the box, and the blue orb accelerated into his chest and disappeared, knocking him to the floor, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...good idea?\" Xei Li finished, before rushing to Freddie's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the liability alone could...\" said Ron, the manager of this lab team was on the phone as Freddie regained consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Freddie's eyes fluttered open, Lindsay interrupted Ron's conversation, \"He's awake!\" The team gathered around their fallen comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie looked around, but as he looked at each member of his team, he saw a display of statistics and abilities appear when he focused on their faces, like the interface of an RPG video game. As his eyes flicked to a menu, a sub-menu of options would appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plus signs next to each attribute and ability, with a mana value beside each one. In the top corner of his vision, he could see that he currently had a mana value of 2. Scrolling through the menus, he couldn't find anything with a value that low!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to Xei Li, he opened her Physical Attributes sub-screen and finally saw something that he could try! Her A-cup breasts required 2 mana to increase. He willed the points there, and Xei Li gasped. She looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo beautiful B-cup breasts stretched her sweater further than it had ever been stretched before. Xei Li looked back up at Freddie in shock. He grinned, then his head fell back, and blacked out again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With that whole...\" Lindsay glanced at the nurse and paused. \"...thing that happened to you in the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse finished taking Freddie's vitals and informed him that the doctor would be in to check on him in about 30 minutes, now that he was awake and his vitals were normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xei Li and Ron were here too, but they went to get something to eat. We decided that one of us should stay behind, though, in case you woke up... so... here I am!\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened to you? How did you do that <i>thing</i> with Xei Li's breasts?\" Lindsay asked in a hushed voice now that the nurse was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Freddie. \"That orb went inside me, and now I can see screens of stats for anyone that I look at. I had two points of mana, and I used them to increase Xei Li's boobs as an experiment. They were the only things that I had enough points to improve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you see my screen right now? What else can you improve?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see your screen, but I can't improve anything right now. I see options for increasing your physical attributes, your intelligence, your skills, but they all take mana points. I don't seem to have any mana points right now. I think I used them all up on Xei Li!\" Freddie said, eyes roaming the character sheet in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can't, you know, make me bigger?\" Lindsay said, hands moving out from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now, I need more mana points.\" Freddie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you get more mana points?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure... Let me focused on the mana point part of the screen.\" He did, and an alert popped up. It said: <i>No mana points available. Mana must be recharged through sexual activity.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" said Freddie aloud. \"You can't be serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Lindsay with a confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... sorry. I wasn't really talking to you. I just saw how to... recharge... my mana.\" Freddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did? What do you need to do?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um, need to engage in sexual activity,\" Freddie said, embarrassed and beginning to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexual activity!\" said Lindsay, surprised. Clearly that hadn't been what she was expecting. She thought a moment, \"What kind of sexual activity? That's pretty vague... but let me try something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay gave Freddie a chaste kiss on the lips. She pulled back, opening her eyes. \"Did that do anything?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie checked his screen. He had one mana point! \"It did! I have a point of mana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that enough to do anything?\" Lindsay asked. \"You know, to do for me what you did for Xei Li?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lindsay is already pretty,</i> Freddie thought.<i>I wonder why she wants bigger breasts so much...</i> He checked her screen but it cost three mana points to increase her B-cup breasts to Cs. \"No. Your kiss gave me one point, but I need three points to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Lindsay thought. \"Let's try another experiment...\" She leaned forward, closing her eyes, and kissed him hungrily. Her tongue entered his mouth with a swirl before she ended the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that?\" she asked. \"How many points did that give you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie, breathless, from the unexpected kiss (he could get used to these experiments!) checked his screen again. \"It gave me two more points! I have three now!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA satisfied smirk crossed Lindsay's pretty face. \"Well, I think you know what our next experiment is...\" She gave him a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie concentrated on Lindsay's breast size and willed it to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay's expression turned to surprise as she felt something in her chest. She looked down to a nice pair of C-cup breasts. She looked back up toward Freddie with a sparkle of excitement in her eye.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She fantasized about being a sexy siren that could wrap a man (or a woman) around her little finger. She wanted to be able to make someone's knees wobble with her beauty alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was fairly certain that Freddie (and maybe Xei Li) had coworker crushes on her at the lab. But she wanted to be able to walk into a room and command every eye. She wanted to walk down the street and cause traffic accidents. She wanted people to ache for her, she was so utterly gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay had thought about plastic surgery, but the risks, scars, and occasional botch jobs that she had seen kept her from going through with it. Freddie's gift, however, was the perfect way to increase her beauty. She wanted to see how far he could take it. And she was willing to do just about anything for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay turned her attention back to Freddie, whose eyes were glued to her more voluptuous breasts. She scanned the room. Walking over to the room's window, she turned the blinds closed. Then, she closed the heavy hospital door softly. Now with complete privacy, she walked back to Freddie, standing beside his hospital bed. She began to strip, removing her blouse and slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Freddie asked, voice wavering slightly with strong emotion as desire welled within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it look like, silly,\" Lindsay told him with a wink. \"I'm experimenting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed the last of her clothes, setting them on the chair she had been seated at earlier, then she pulled the sheets down to Freddie's ankles and pushed the hospital gown up to his stomach. Sweeping a long leg over him, she mounted him on the hospital bed. Her slender hips were bare and warm as they met his hardening cock. She pressed her mouth to his and, while kissing him, placed her slit over his now-hardened rod. she pressed down, and he shuddered in pleasure. She was growing wet, her natural lubrication allowing her to envelope his shaft. She sat up to let gravity pull her down his length before she leaned forward to continue kissing him. She began to pump him, up and down, letting him push his length inside her. It felt so good... even better knowing what may happen afterward. Lindsay shivered in anticipation, smiling slightly while she kissed the younger man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of passionate gyration both of them came, one after the other. Lindsay let out a long breath. Freddie seemed stupefied, with an awestruck look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay dismounted, pulled his hospital gown down, and began to put her own clothes back on. She turned to him, \"How many points this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie looked at her and checked his screen. \"Ten!\" he exclaimed, shocked at the number. He hadn't expected so many. Sex really powered him up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooo. What would it cost to make my face prettier?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... three points,\" Freddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about another breast improvement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four points this time.\" It must take more points to fuel each additional level of improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about making my legs longer and...\" she winked. \"...sexier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. One point per inch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Three inches to my legs would make ten points.\" Lindsay said. \"Why don't you try it? Let's see what happens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Freddie concentrated on each of those three areas and willed the improvements to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was instant. Lindsay felt her body change. She stopped buttoning her blouse, as her breasts pushed outward into D territory. She couldn't stretch the blouse across her chest any more. It was too big! She hadn't yet put her slacks on, which was good, because she felt herself rising as her legs grew three inches and became smoother and more toned. She couldn't see her face, but looking over to Freddie and judging the expression on his face, it must be looking pretty spectacular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. This whole thing was a dream come true. Once she got Freddie out of the hospital, she would need to start paying him regular visits. This was too good an opportunity to pass up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lindsay grabbed her pants, the door opened. Xei Li and Ron walked in to find her, blouse undone, and pulling pants up long bare legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon and Xei Li glanced at Lindsay, then at Freddie, then back again. \"Awkward,\" Ron intoned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something about the way she said it wasn\u2019t very appealing. It was as if he were an unwanted chore that simply had to be done, like taking out the garbage.

He grabbed her under her ass to support her weight and kicked the apartment door open, as her lips and tongue hungrily explored his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was seriously turning him on. She sure seemed to want this now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked the door closed and carried her to his bedroom. He leaned over and set her on the bed, dropping her the last few inches. Her new, larger breasts wobbled as she bounced on the bed springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly stripped off her blouse and pulled down her pants, then did the same to him. She curled her arms back around him and pulled him into her, her teeth finding his neck and biting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so hard!\u201d he cried as she wrapped her legs around him once more. She was a freaking animal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped on top of him and mashed her breasts into his chest. There was no loving in her embrace. This was purely physical. He didn\u2019t mind, barely able to keep up with her rapid onslaught of passion. It seemed a little forced, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...He was unable to finish the thought when her bare hips began to gyrate, pressing her lower abdomen into his cock. Her warmth felt amazing, despite the fact that he hadn\u2019t entered her. Her accelerated pace pounded sensation into him, making him hard. She certainly wasn\u2019t much for foreplay. Her lips dropped straight down to his now-hard dick, not stopping for so much as a kiss along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips started, closed, over his tip. She pressed downward, mouth grinding against his cock as she went down on him. He felt her lower teeth drag downward, and he shivered. This was all happening so fast. He hadn\u2019t even had time to think about..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Her tongue swirled around his tip as she reached the top again, and he lost his train of thought yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXei Li sucked, licked, scraped and ground her mouth, lips, and tongue over him, urgently rising and falling over his quivering cock. Her flash-seduction had his hips bucking in record time. He thrust himself into her mouth as he came, grunting with the final effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spasmed, she looked up at him hopefully like a kid on Christmas morning. She pulled her lips away, wiping her lips with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can you improve me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie felt vaguely used. Xei Li definitely had more interest in what he could do for her than she did in him. It was a strange feeling. He didn\u2019t know what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat reluctantly, he pulled up his interface. He had 20 points this time. Twenty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXei Li noticed and returned his smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHere goes,\u201d Freddie said, wondering idly why he had received so many points from the climax Xei Li had given him. Summoning his will, he punched the plus sign by her legs three times, adding three inches to her legs to bring her to a modelesque 5\u20199\u201d. He did the same, twice, for her breasts, bringing her even with Lindsay\u2019s D-cups. And he still had ten more points!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXei Li watched in amazement as the ground moved further away. Her hands twitched, then moved up to cup her burgeoning breasts as well. She gave Freddie a shocked look as he considered his next changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the remaining ten points on her fitness level, then sat back and watched the resulting changes occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXei Li\u2019s abs sculpted into chiseled, athletic perfection. Her glutes and hips rounded with feminine muscle. Her legs and arms looked unbelievable, slim but with hard, defined musculature that looked as if carved from stone. She looked like something along the lines of a triathlete supermodel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning to the floor-length mirror in my bedroom, Xei Li twisted her sinewed torso, muscles rippling with every movement as she eyed every part of her new body. Freddie heard a gasp of pleasure as she surveyed the new her. Clearly, she was pleased with the results of his handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran back over to him, jumping on top of him on the bed and giving him a lung-crushing hug before bounding up, half-donning her clothes and running out the door without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie lay on the bed, puzzling out the rather confusing experience with Xei Li\u2026 and Lindsay. He felt as if the girls were using him more than anything else, not that he entirely minded. Having increasingly beautiful girls jumping his bones wasn\u2019t exactly an unpleasant experience. Still, he found himself wishing for something more\u2026 fulfilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzz from the apartment intercom interrupted his thoughts. He jumped up and walked to his apartment door, pressing the talk button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lindsay. May I come up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Um\u2026 sure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie slumped against the wall by the intercom. What should he do? He had a good idea of what Lindsay was going to want to do. Should he do it? Should he hold out for something more? Was he okay with being a tool for his coworkers to become better and better looking? As he considered, he heard a knock on the door. He opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay stood there in an open trench coat, wearing nothing underneath but a lacy black bra and panties. She looked amazing. Not as fit as Xei Li was, perhaps, but amazing\u2026 and he knew that she could probably look still more amazing within the hour. As his gaze reluctantly returned to her face, he saw that she was biting her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door wider, and she slipped in the door, breasts brushing against him on the way...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was clear what she wanted now and he didn't feel like he would be able to resist her if she really pressed the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking,\" she began, as she strolled through his apartment. She still kept the trench coat on. \"And I think we should continue our little experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo surprises there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess,\" Freddie interrupted. \"You want me to improve you a bit further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay smiled. \"Now that would be nice, wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie returned a smug smile. Called it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Freddie had been so sure about her intentions, he all but screamed in surprise. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay's smile only grew bigger. She knew she had totally subverted his expectations. \"What I mean is, that you have a gift that has unbounded potential and right now you've been using it for some rather small stuff if I understand correctly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think small is the word I would use,\" Freddie countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smug smile was still on Lindsay's face. \"Let's recap what you did so far. You gave Xei Li a boob job, me a bigger makeover and if I had to guess, Xei Li went in for seconds. Is that correct so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie only nodded. He was getting curious about what she had to suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how many mana points do you have left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head sunk at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a single one? That's not very surprising. Apparently you're the type of guy to do everything to please a woman. Even if that woman isn't interested in him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWay to set the mood. If she wanted to make Freddie turn her down, she was doing a great job. <br>\r\n\"On the other hand that is quite charming on it's own. But I don't think that's the right way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you suggesting?\" Freddie felt a bit irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about a partnership. I'll help you get more of those mana points and in return I want 75% of those points to be spent how I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie almost fell over. That sounded surprisingly reasonable compared to what had happened so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Wouldn't it make more sense if we split those points halfway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I the only person you will sleep with from now on?\" Lindsay counterd. \"Because I doubt that I will be. Those points are not part of the deal. And the moment you have a serious girlfriend, this little partnership will effectively be over. Higher risk for me, so I want a bigger part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was racing. She clearly had given this a lot of thought. And it made sense to him in a way. Still, he could bargain a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two out of three.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Lindsay answered almost immediately holding her hand out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was easy. Freddie took her hand and shook it to seal the deal. The moment this was over, Lindsay almost jumped him, planting a kiss on his unsuspecting lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really want another boost, do you?\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I already told you that's not the case.\" she leaned in to whisper in Freddie's ear. \"The next point are all going into you! After all we need to produce a lot of points for Project Super Lindsey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie gulped. He had totally failed to even consider that he might use his gift to improve himself as well. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next hour, Freddie was in heaven. Unlike their spontaneaous sex in the hospital or the sudden blow-job of Xei Li, they took their sweet time this time. Kissing, foreplay, all the stuff that was cut short before, now they had the necessary privacy to do all that. Things just went a bit easier in his own bedroom compared to the hospital. Sure, Lindsay had made it pretty clear that they weren't romantically involved, but it still felt a lot like they were. Maybe her gratitude about the improvements he had made to her so far was a factor in it. At the very least, they made it very easy for him to enjoy this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they both collapsed next to each other in his bed, panting and letting the pleasure of a mutual orgasm slowly fizzle out. Freddie had to admit that he could get used to that part of their aggreement. When he turned to look back at Lindsay, she was already snuggling up to him, smiling as he watched him with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for more?\" she asked, playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need a short break right now,\" Freddie answered, still panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Lindsays face only grew broader. She planted a kiss on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she whispered. \"But while you are recovering, we could \u2026 talk about your little gift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie nodded. He was a bit confused. Lindsay had made no secret about this being her primary concern right now. So why did it feel like there was a hint of disappointment in her? Would she have preferred it otherwise? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lindsay began to needle him with questions about his \u2026 power or however that should be called, she saw the woman he had come to respect shine through again. She was concentrating on the facts and data that she could collect, taking notes all the while. She actually made him draw the user interface he was seeing so as to get a better understanding. It felt like it took forever for her to finally mention the elephant in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\u2026 how many points do you have at your disposal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie looked and couldn't believe his eyes. \"F-fifty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsays eyes grew wide. \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie nodded. He noticed that there was even a small tooltip for that. \"50 Points available, 16.666666 at my own disposal, 33.333333 promised to you\u2026 It even keeps track of our d...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay's lips met his even before he was finished. \"That should make it 51. Easier to split\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually 52 now\u2026 guess this kiss was better than the one in the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother kiss followed, a bit more passionate than the one before. \"54, 18 for me and 36 for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to satisfy Lindsay. She looked at him like a new toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite cute in the facial department, so no need to waste points there right now\u2026\" she thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie became excited as she reminded him that she wanted to use her points for his benefit. Ten points in fitness had turned Xei Li into a poster girl for physical perfection. What would happen for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the options for your little friend?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning the status menu for himself, Freddie got a quick overlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's options for length, one point for two inches right now. Guess the price will go up after that. Sensitivity and pleasure, both a point for a 10% increase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay raised her brows. \"What's the difference?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like what I feel versus the feeling it causes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sounds plausible. Anything about stamina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not specific to that area. But as part of the fitness slider, stamina should be increased along with muscularity and strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay returned to her notes, writing things down. Then she began to nod as she did the math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two points in each of the options for your penis, five points to make you five inches taller and the rest goes to your fitness. Should be about 25 points. And in case you want to add something too, I'd like to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie gulped at this. Was she really planning on using all her points on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? 25 points in fitness seems like a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point. I want to see how far this can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Freddie concentrated on the screen again. He found that he could plan the changes beforehand and then hit submit for them to happen at once. That was convenient as he quickly went through his penis-related options and added three more points on pleasure from his own repertoire. The screen seemed to know exactly which points came from himself and which points had been part of the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm\u2026 I think there's a problem. The fitness option only allows 10 points in total. It opens new options for strengh, muscle definition and stamina instead.\" Freddie wondered if the same had happened with Xei Li. Damn he hadn't paid attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put five in each then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie decided that he might could probably use some more stamina and added another five of his own to the ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another new menu: Superhuman.\" Freddie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we're talking!\" Lindsay said joyful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason relayed the new options as he went through them. It seemed like every power that ever made it's way to a comic book could be found here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez those sure have a price tag,\" he commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much would it cost to fly?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thousand points.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay bit her lip. \"That's gonna take a while.\" She looked at him hungrily. \"So\u2026 are you gonna use those points now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie almost had forgotten to hit submitt over the surprise of finding super powers in the menu. He absentmindedly hit submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, the transformation was instantaneous, but there had never been so many points used at once. Fredie grew in all directions, taller, stronger, more endowed, more muscular. An average guy at 6'1\" suddenly shot to 6'6\" hunk of a man that looked like he had done nothing but work out in his entire life. And he had to admit, it felt great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay looked at him with big eyes filled with lust. They had never bothered to get dressed again so she saw everything he had to give. And who could fault her for liking what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a feeling we can try and aim for tripple digits next time.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay pressed her lips on his, and their kiss quickly grew more passionate. Freddie had felt drained before, but now he felt more alive than ever. Pressing Lindsay against the wall, he lifted her up with one arm, she expertly jumped up in snyc and put her legs around his waist. A short groan escaped her lips and Freddie realized he was too rough, not knowing his new strength and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie thought quick on his feet and summoned Lindsays display, immeditely hammering the remaining ten points into fitness and then submitting it, right as Lindsay was guiding his member into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh\" she moaned as the change hit her right as he pushed into her. Her body shifted, growing more toned and muscular in a way very similar to how Xei Li had become. But with Lindsays better start, she looked even better than the Asian woman. Lindsays body began to shiver as the combined feelings pushed her beyond her breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Myyyy \u2026. Gooooooooood\" she was screaming now as the orgasm rocked her body. Freddie contemplated slowing down, but his own body moved on auto-pilot now. There was no foreplay this time around, just pure lust combined with bodies that could readily perform feats they usually would have struggled with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all over each other for the next hour, barely caring for any furniture that might be in their way. But eventually even their improved bodies reached their limits, and the two off them collapsed onto the bed once more - fortunately their tour had taken them back there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Lindsay exclaimed as she finally caught her breath again. \"Now that was incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" was all Freddie managed to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they weren't a couple, Lindsay snuggled up to him. Freddie didn't mind, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did we make the double digits?\" she asked, quitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie was quite interrested about the answer himself, summoning the status screen for Lindsay. The readings were quite surprising:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwn Mana Point available: 150 (100 locked for Lindsay by deal)<br>\r\nLindsay Mana point available 50 (33,3 locked for Freddie by deal)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial deal:<br>\r\nUseable points Lindsay: 133,3<br>\r\nUseable points Freddie: 66,7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXei Li Mana points available: 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm it's a bit complicated,\" he tried to explain. \"Looks like 200 points\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Freddie noticed that Lindsay wasn't listening anymore. The exhaustion had caught up to her and she had fallen asleep in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie tried to figure out the numbers for a moment. Why were there now separate pools for Lindsay and Xei Li? How could they gather their own mana points now?  Xei Li was - thankfully - nowhere near them, so he could only look at Lindsays sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he stumbled across the answer. A status effect was active, like a passive bonus:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mana boost: Sexual activity gives 50% extra Mana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking his own status, he found the same there as well. So the sex had actually been worth 100 points but they both got 50 points extra to go with that? Before he had time to double check the theory, sleep overwhelmed him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Freddie woke up the next morning, he felt like the events of the past day had been a weird dream. Had he really acquired the ability to change peoples bodies? Fueled by having sex? But these questions were answered soon as he felt Lindsays naked body snuggling against his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it was no dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, sleepy head,\" Lindsay whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie finally opened his eyes to see her face so close to him, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" he whispered, feeling his heart beat faster as they looked into each others eyes for a long moment. Then she made her move. Lindsay pressed her lips against his gently, and Freddie readily returned the kiss. His member stood at attention almost immediately - even without the improvements they had made to their bodies so far, this was hardly a surprise to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they just focussed on making out. Slowly. Then suddenly Lindsay broke the kiss and looked away. Taken by surprise, Freddie almost failed to see any reason why Lindsay did that. She was clearly contemplating something. Yet the moment was short, and she quickly noticed his puzzled look. Smiling again, Lindsay kissed him once more, their tongues dancing for a moment, before she released it yet again. This time a lot slower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie had no time to even wonder what she intended to do now, as he felt her hand travel down his body, her fingers grasping for his member and beginning so slowly caress it. He gulped, doing exactly nothing as Lindsay shifted on the bed, moving the blanket out of the way and postioned herself further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, he had a clear view of her naked body, the result of several enhancements had made her the outright best looking woman he had ever seen. Her healthy, toned body combined with her large breasts felt unreal to him. But he knew thew were. He had felt them quite extensively last night. Lindsay flashed him another knowing smile as she went down, her lips slowly teasing his member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie's eyes almost rolled back in his head, Xei Li had been surprisingly good at this, yet Lindsay was even better. Probably because she had no intention of getting this over with as quickly as possible. For almost fifteen minutes, Freddie was in heaven as Lindsay licked and teased him. The enhancements he had made to himself clearly paid off as well. His own sensitivity made it feel much better while Lindsay clearly seemed to enjoy herself there too. Not to mention how long he actually lasted before finally exploding into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swallowing everything, Lindsay then rose from the bed and left the room without a further word. It wasn't much of a mystery either, as Freddie soon heard the sound of the shower removing the last bit of doubt about her whereabouts. Still, the whole situation felt weird to him. Lindsay had gone from romantic to sexy to weirdly distanced too quick for his tastes. He had to remind himself, that they were not a couple. They had made a deal and that included sexual activities. That blowjob had been motivated by getting more mana points only. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie let out a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the bathroom, Lindsay quickly splashed some water through her face as the shower was still heating up. What was wrong with her? This was a deal! Sex yes, emotions no, that's what this was. Then why had she gone and cuddled up to Freddie like this? And that staring contest? She shook her head. They've had a moment there and she didn't like that. If this continued like this, she might even fall for him for real. It didn't help her case that she had turned him into her dream guy - physically at least - and that the sex had been more than great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay blinked at her reflection, for the first time realizing how different she was looking now. She had noticed how Freddie had made his own changes to her during sex last night - it definitely had enhanced the moments and everything to follow. Still, she hadn't taken the time to get the full new picture of her. She was all kinds of hot now. Feminine muscle paired with just the right curves, large breasts and legs that went for miles. Lindsay definitely approved of these changes, if Freddie hadn't done them, she would have asked for them come the right time. But it was kinda cute he had done that anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head again. Freddie could be lucky that she was approving, otherwise he'd have changed her against her will. Lindsay clung to that thought, not because she wanted to start an argument, but she needed a reason to be pissed at him. To suffocate those budding feelings of affection she was otherwise developing towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lindsay was done with her own shower, Freddie did the same and they got dressed. They shared a quick breakfast, during which Lindsay asked for the current status in terms of mana points. She was quite surprised to hear the numbers, even after Freddie went and explained some kind of bonus that seemed to increase their gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie now had 180 points while she now apparently had stored 60 herself. Through their deal, there were now 160 points at Lindsay's disposal and 80 for Freddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose numbers were a lot to take in. The two of them had been ridiculously sexy after a 63 points between them, now there were 240 points in total waiting to be spent. A part of her wanted to use those points right away, make more enhancements that would make her even hotter. But she had the eyes on the price. Superpowers were a possibility and they were expensive. Besides they had to get to work, another enhancement would likely lead to more sex and cause them to be late. And Lindsay had decided she needed some distance from Freddie for now. She wondered if she should test out gaining more points on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put a pin into that for now,\" she decided. \"I'll come over tonight again and think of how to spend it, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie just shrugged in aggreement. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I finished signing the waiver, then went to the small black tent to pick up my race packet. I looked around at the fit participants in their specialized footwear and my nerves fluttered. What the heck was I doing here? Did I really know what I was in for here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in line next to me turned my way, striking up conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First one?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that obvious?\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda. You just look a little nervous is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, great!\" I said, letting out a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. You'll be fine. It's all about having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and nodded at the man, then tried to quell my obviously frayed nerves. Apparently, they were written all over my face so that even strangers could tell I was nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked up my packet and entered the village of tents that the race crew had erected for this weekend's events. It was pretty impressive. Music blared, and buff, bare-chested men jumped, squatted, and stretched. Women clad in only sports bras and shorts, sporting abs I could only dream of, stood staring into space with intimidating intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at my polyester t-shirt and plain, black Wal-Mart leggings and sighed. Sexy amazon, I was not. Intimidatingly intense? Yeah. Not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was reasonably fit but thoroughly average in every respect. I certainly couldn't show off ridged abs like these other ladies. I was such a fish out of water here that I almost turned around and walked out. I could text Rick and Aaron and tell them I was sick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate!\" Rick's voice came from behind another gaggle of fitness freakazoids. Shit! Too late now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched Rick emerge from behind a flock of pony-tailed fitness model types as they pranced along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick fit right in with this crowd. His tight tech tee hugged his bulging pecs; his carved arms stretched the sleeves of his shirt. As he moved, I could see the cobbles of his tight abs through his thin shirt. He smiled as he saw me wave, approaching at a jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had been crushing on Rick for a while now, stealing glances as his gym-honed physique during our training sessions for this race. When he had first asked me to do it, I think I gave a schoolgirl titter as I said yes--so NOT in my normal nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rick approached, he slid a hand across his buzz cut, flipping off the accumulation of misty rain from the western Washington morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Kate! Glad you made it!\" Rick gave me a firm hug. I delighted in the pressure of his strong arms and hard body as the hug pulled me up to my tiptoes. My breasts ached a little, pressed against his iron chest, but I ignored it. It was a small price to pay for the rest of the yumminess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too!\" I said cheerfully, neglecting to mention the fact that, moments before, I had nearly decided to eat my $20 parking fee and get the heck out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, guys!\" came Aaron's voice from behind me. I turned and felt my smile widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs attracted as I was to Rick, Aaron was the one I was really comfortable around. He was a good-natured fortyish man and my Spartan-training bestie. Where Rick was so athletic and hardcore as to be intimidating, Aaron was jovial and self-deprecating. I had liked him from the moment I met him at the crags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged Rick, his body softer than Rick's and his grip non-painful. I bounced back, more comfortable now by his mere presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you guys ready to do this thing or what?\" said Aaron, giving Rick a quick guy-clasp as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we ever!\" said Rick, a twinkle in his blue eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No comment,\" I said, letting my nervousness show through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh! I'm sensing some butterflies in our little buttercup over here,\" said Aaron good-naturedly. \"If anyone should be worried about this thing, it should be me! I can barely do a pull-up these days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick clapped him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do just fine, man. And so will you, Katie!\" Rick said with an encouraging nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" I said, unconvinced as I looked at the super-fit folks passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at the packet. It had a sticker on it: \"Competitive Wave: 8:00 AM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck does <i>Competitive Wave</i> mean?\" I asked the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. It just means they check your burpees and stuff. Don't worry about it,\" said Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaaaay...\" I eyed him warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it to Rick to get us roped into the craziest of the crazies for this thing!\" laughed Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick just gave a crooked grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what do we do now?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's put on our wristbands and headbands and stuff,\" said Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us opened our packets and began to don the items in the packet. Timing chip wristband--check. Competitive 8:00 AM Wave wristband--check. Headband with the number on it--check. Beer wristband?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't even like beer!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Aaron snatched the wristband away from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that. Beer is my best event in these sorts of races,\" he told me with a wink. Rick gave a belly laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were done, we went over to the bag check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another $5! Geez! These guys really bleed you dry!\" I said, miffed at all of the incidental charges. \"Why don't they just include this in the price of the race? I don't even think I have any more cash after the parking fee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Katie... I got you covered,\" said Aaron, forking over the requisite cash for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Aaron,\" I said, sheepishly, embarrassed at not thinking ahead enough to bring more cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron gave a comedic bow, one foot in front of the other. I laughed and nudged him with my shoulder, nearly toppling him off balance. He joined my laughter as he recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe checked our backpacks, used the port-a-potties, and climbed over the low wall into the starting area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fun little pep talk by the race announcer, hollaring \"I am a Spartan!\" and \"Aroo!\" a few times, we were off. As we passed through the starting gate, I thought I saw a weird blue glow around the the underside of the sign and the poles to either side. As I ran, I looked back. No blue glow. That was strange, I thought. It must just be nerves making me see things or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back ahead to watch Rick's rock hard butt bouncing in front of me and half-smiled in spite of myself. At least there would be some good scenery in this race, I thought, giving a little mental giggle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He immediately slowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, guys! I must have gotten a little carried away with the adrenaline of the race and whatnot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank... you...!\" I puffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced over at Aaron, already as red-faced as I probably was. He said nothing, just panted, as we slowed to a jog, some of the hard-core racers passing around either side of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at Aaron, I noticed a faint blue glow around him, as if a dim light were shining behind him, and I was just seeing its silhouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron gave me a puzzled look, and I stretched my arm out in front of me. It looked just like Aaron, glowing faintly blue around the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was really weird. They must have some sort of black light on the course, I surmised. I looked around and didn't see anything. They must have them well hidden. They really spared no expense in these races! Too bad they hadn't spent that money on a free bag check instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued to run to the first obstacle, these chest high hurdle-things. Rick popped over them with ease. I jumped up and mantled, then flung a leg over it, pushing off with my foot and landing on soft knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us managed to get over them all to the next obstacle, a really, really tall wall. The wall had to be around eight feet tall. I came to a stop as I considered how to tackle this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I did, Rick ran up to it, jumped into a pull-up, and hauled himself over with ease. Damn that guy! He made everything look so easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a little red piece of wood about two feet up from the ground and decided that was my ticket to the top. I ran up, hit the little wood step with my right toe and sprang up to reach the top, I managed the pull-up, my arms shaking with the effort but determination powering me through. Once I flung a leg to the top, I knew I had it. I maneuvered my other leg over and dangled for a moment on the other side before dropping down. On the landing, I accidentally fell backwards, smearing mud all over my back. I grimaced as I felt the cold, damp earth stick to my shirt. Oh well. That's what these races were all about right? Mud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pleased, though, that I had made it over the thing. I yelled encouragement to Aaron, who I knew was just behind me, then I saw his face appear over the edge of the wall. I cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron smiled as he saw me, and powered himself over. We high-fived, and I noticed the slightest blue glow around his hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick ran back to us, clapping us both forcefully on the back with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work, guys! See? Piece of cake!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron and I gave each other a look, each rolling our eyes as we thought of our struggle over that last wall, only our second obstacle. I could sense that he was as game to keep going as I was, though, and we joined Rick in a brisk jog, ready to see what else the race would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe neared something in the distance. Bails of hay tied up to wooden posts with a row of gates maybe twenty feet in front of them. I watched a racer fling a wooden pole into the hay and realized that this must be the spear throw I had heard about... something I had never done in my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be interesting...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I walked up to the metal gates and grabbed one of the spears. It was basically a broom handle with a nail in the end. I threw it, harder than I was expecting. Which probably would have been great, except for the fact that I was standing on top of the thin rope they had attached to the end of it--something I had neglected to notice before I threw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the spear sailed toward the target with surprising force, the rope coiled around my ankles and pulled my feet out from under me. I went down hard on my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rope stopped the flight of the spear halfway to the target when it ran out of slack, and the spear crashed straight down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick and Aaron on either side of me had just released their spears. Rick's struck the target perfectly (of course). Aaron's went sailing over it, as if his throw had more power than he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they heard the suctiony thump of my back landing in mud and the subsequent whoosh of breath leaving my lungs, the two looked toward me simultaneously. Gasping for breath, I watched Rick's eyes widen before he broke into a rollicking round of raucous guffaws. I turned to Aaron, who was doubled over in laughter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes, then went to work extricating myself from the tightly coiled rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much for helping, jerks,\" I muttered as I untangled myself with no help from the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I rose, I saw the others, still hopelessly lost in laughter, and I began to laugh at myself along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen our laughter subsided, Aaron and I did our thirty burpees while Rick kept count. As I finished my burpees, I turned to Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those burpees were actually easier than I was expecting,\" I said to Aaron before jogging out of the penalty area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought so too,\" he said. \"Good thing 'cause I have a feeling we'll be doing a lot of those today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at Aaron, and the three of us ran toward the next obstacle, which looked was three little hills of mud with water underneath and a wooden wall at the far side in a pool of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I ran, I noticed the soft blue glow outlining my arms again. I ran faster. Whatever the weird blue outline was doing, it seemed to be giving me an energy boost. I looked at Aaron, and he seemed to be gaining speed inside his blue outline as well. Looking ahead to Rick, he didn't have the outline--but he always ran fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick leapt over the first hill and splashed into the water, eliciting shrieks from some of the nearby racers doused in the spray. Rick turned back to us, dripping with muddy water. He shrugged, looking sheepish. Aaron and I looked at each other then sprinted ahead and did the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmigod, the water was cold! So freezing cold! I shivered as I struggled out of the muddy pit then slid into the next one. The final mud pool was divided in half by a wooden wall. They were going to make us go underwater in this filthy, frigid puddle?! I braced myself and dunked under water, eyes shut until I popped up on the other side of the wall. I wiped the muddy muck from my eyes and dragged a hand along the top of my head to wipe away some of the water. My ponytail dripped dank water onto my back, making me shiver with every drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck!\" I cried out. Rick stuck out his tongue at me; I did it right back. We both laughed and continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the Z-Wall, an aptly named zig-zagging wall with small one-inch wooden holds for hands and feet. Having rock climbed before, we had little trouble with this one, making it to the end and smacking the little cow bell to prove that we had completed the stretch without touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ran for another half mile or so before the next challenge. Not only was I not tiring, I actually felt great! I was feeling stronger and more energized than when I had started the race! Which was good. Because next up was an obstacle I thought I might struggle with--the 16' rope climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ran up to the obstacle. Rick leapt onto the rope and hauled himself up hand-over-hand until he rang the bell at the top. As he lowered himself, Aaron and I did the same. Incredibly, I didn't even need to use my feet. My arms were strong enough to haul myself up and ring the bell. I was completely amazed! I had practiced twisting my feet in the rope to allow my legs to help. Today, though, I was feeling so strong I didn't need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my arms and saw small bulges of muscle, significantly more toned than they normally looked popping out of them. Maybe doing these crazy races really was great exercise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we continued on, I noticed more striations in my leg muscles than I usually did as well. Sweet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a barbed wire crawl setup at the edge of a river. I dropped down to hands and knees and began to slide myself under, when all the sudden a blue glow came from the water below me. The ground seemed to disappear from under the water, and I fell into the blue void before I could so much as cry out...</span></div></div>",

A light breeze frizz of hair was tickling my forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened? Had I passed out during the barbed wire crawl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI popped one eye open, then the other. I immediately squinted in the bright sunlight. Bright sunlight? What happened to the chilly, misty rain from the morning? How long had I been out? Why was it so warm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled my head up, the rest of my body still resting on the\u2026 sand? I looked ahead to see white sand beaches, brilliant blue water and rising hills of green. I was warm, sweating in the baking heat of the sun. This didn\u2019t look like the grey, chilly Puget Sound bordered by cedar and fir forests that I was so accustomed to this time of year! It looked and felt more like Hawaii than the Pacific northwest\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat upright, and watched a gentle wave roll in, the water lapping at my foot again. I swiveled my head to take in the rest of my surroundings, and saw Aaron splayed out on the sand by the water as I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat roused me to action\u2014I needed to see whether he was okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stumbled to my feet and ran over to where Aaron lay. I put my ear to his mouth and felt warm breath against it. He was breathing. Good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my hand on his shoulder and shook. He moaned, then cracked open his eyes, squinting against the bright light of the sun, as I had. I let out bated breath in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaron? You okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so. What happened? I was right behind you in the barbed wire crawl, when I suddenly felt like I was falling\u2026 Wait! Why is it so warm out? And the sun?\u201d Aaron shot upright, and his jaw dropped. \u201cWhere <i>are</i> we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood question. I\u2019m thinking we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore, Toto!\u201d I replied, looking around again, now that I knew Aaron was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a cry in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked in the direction of the sound, and my eyes widened in surprise. There was a group of about a dozen men with spears running toward us. Their bronze helmets and breastplates glimmered in the sun, crimson cloaks flowing behind them as they ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell are those guys?\u201d Aaron asked, voicing the question that was at the forefront of mind as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a feeling we\u2019re about to find out\u2026\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached, I saw sweat glimmering on their huge, muscled arms and legs. They were <i>very</i> tan with dark hair. They wore open-armed linen shirts under their breastplates that ran to lower thigh, almost like a dress, with a leather skirt, apparently to protect their upper legs. They wore open-toed leather boots and bronze armor over their shins. They looked like they belonged to some sort of classical era army. Was this some sort of anachronistic battle reenactment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey surrounded us, spears pointed toward us and ready. If they were reenacting some sort of battle, they were taking their acting pretty seriously!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said one of them in some other language that I somehow understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Kate, and this is Aaron,\u201d I replied in the same language, that I could somehow speak. \u201cNice to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cCome with us,\u201d the leader of the soldier said, cryptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was going on here? How was I understanding and speaking some other language? Who were these guys? Where was I? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to ask all of these questions, but the expression on their leader\u2019s face had me thinking twice. I decided to wait until we arrived at\u2026 wherever he was taking us.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His blue glow was back\u2014and he seemed even more buff than before. He wasn\u2019t a match for these rippling-muscle play actors, but he was definitely on his way. He looked <i>much</i> more muscular than he had this morning at the start of the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing my eyes on him, Aaron glanced back to me as well. I watched his eyes go wide as he saw me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I whispered for no good reason. The soldier-types were close enough that they could hear me whether I was whispering or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s you! You\u2019re looking super fit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am?\u201d I looked down. The previously small bulges of muscle in my arms were becoming more significant. They looked incredibly defined, as if they were carved from marble like a Greek statue. With arms like these, I could get a role in the next <i>Wonder Woman</i> movie as one of those amazon fighters. The thought made me smile\u2026 which caused Aaron to give me a questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to stop and see what my abs and legs looked like, but I wasn\u2019t sure how these guys would react to me suddenly stopping. I didn\u2019t want to be speared from behind by accident by a solider that was slow to react, that was certain! So I kept running, albeit itching with eagerness to check my new crossfit-esque self out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! Greek statue\u2026 GREEK! You know, that\u2019s what these guys\u2019 outfits were reminding me of, now that I thought about it. It was like we were on some sort of movie set that was being filmed in Hawaii. How had we ended up in Hawaii, though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the plants along the beach where we were running. While I had never been to Hawaii, the flora didn\u2019t really look like what I would expect to see in Hawaii. Things looked a bit drier and less dense than I would expect, given the pictures I had seen. I also wasn\u2019t seeing any coconut trees or palm trees. Maybe we weren\u2019t in Hawaii.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obvious suddenly struck me. We were in Greece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we in Greece?\u201d I said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the soldiers turned to me and gave me an incredulous look. I looked back at him and shrugged sheepishly. I took that as a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, if we were going to be suddenly transported from our Spartan race in Washington, why was Greece any less likely than Hawaii? Actually, given the name of the race, Greece was <i>very</i> appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Are we in Sparta?\u201d I asked loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d answered the man who had initially spoken to us. \u201cWhere else would we be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit! Aaron and I really were in Greece. Unable to help myself, I asked another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what year is it?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What kind of question is that! Are you one of those stupid Athenians with your sometimes 12-, sometimes 13-month calendars? It\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re confused about the year. I would be too if I lived in the Gods-forsaken land\u2026\u201d He began to grumble, punctuating his under-the-breath comments with the occasional epithet about Athenians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthenian calendar? Of course, he wouldn\u2019t just give me the year in BCE or whatever. The modern calendar probably hadn\u2019t even been invented yet! Even if he had given me a straight answer, I probably wouldn\u2019t understand it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026which meant I had traveled ThrOUGH TIME AND SPACE BACK TO\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Fucking Sparta!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmigod, omigod. OH MY GOD!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had I gotten myself into here? Damn Rick and his fucking Spartan race! I had thought I was in over my head before\u2026 Now, I would give anything to be back to that level of over-my-headness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was I going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back over to Aaron, who looked as stunned as I probably did. Apparently, he had come to a similar conclusion after hearing their answers to my questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe looked at each other, the color draining from our cheeks. Our mutual looks both said one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were in deep shit!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More appeared from over the rise until there were about two dozen of them, double the count of Spartans I was with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spartans formed up and charged ahead in unison, while two of these Immortals, whoever the hell they were, drew bows that were shaped a bit like Poirot's mustache in <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i>. I was fairly certain there was a name for those things, but I couldn't think of it just then. I was more than passingly worried about being skewered at that moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Immortal guys loosed his arrow, and it sailed between Aaron and me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" said Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sentiments exactly,\" I replied. \"These Immortal guys are apparently thinking that we're with these Spartans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ducked down in the sand, trying to present a smaller target to the enemy's two bowmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not exactly liking that name of theirs. Immortal? Do you know who these guys are?\" I asked Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're Persians, if my <i>300</i> movie knowledge serves me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>300?</i> Is that the one with Gerard Butler and the six pack squad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shit! I get to go to the real life version of that deal, get shot at and am probably about to die, and all I get is a bunch of dudes in armor? Hello? What's with the shirts and stuff? Where's my male eye candy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother arrow landed in the sand an inch in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate, I think we've got bigger fish to fry right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay...\" I said, still annoyed that I was being cheated out of my muscle show. I guess their arms were pretty nice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate! We should help the Spartans. The Persians think we're with them, and they're outnumbered. Helping them might be our only chance! This is life and death here! Quit thinking about Gerard fucking Butler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron charged ahead, running in a crouch as another arrow soared over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wish I could fuck Gerard Butler. Instead, I'm just fucked!\" I muttered under my breath, then I followed behind Aaron, not sure what I was supposed to do bare-handed against a bunch of armed and armored soldiers...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I ran, I saw another burst of blue light around Aaron. I looked down. I was glowing a brilliant shade of blue as well. My quads were growing, as were my arms. They were becoming both leaner and more muscular. I could actually see the striations of my leg muscles popping into sharp relief as I ran--through my yoga pants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt good too... No, not just good. Make that great! I felt as if I had just guzzled ten red energy drinks, strength washing pumping through me by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning my eyes forward, I could see Aaron bulking up by the second as well. Gone was the last of his pudginess. His bulging arms pumped, more defined with every swing forward as he sprinted, his back becoming carved in hard, delicious sinew. I couldn't wait to see him from the front!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were almost to the Immortals now. One of them drew his bow and loosed an arrow at my head. Despite the fact that I was within ten meters, I was somehow fast enough to grab the arrow out of mid-air a millimeter before it pierced my eye. Normally, I probably would have stopped to consider how amazing that was, but I was in the middle of a freaking battle here, so... I didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran up to the Immortal arrow-firing bastard that had just tried to kill me as he dropped his bow and began to draw his sword. Before he could finish pulling it free of the scabbard, I slammed my hand down on the edge of his palm with so much force that it shot the hilt of the sword--and his hand along with it--right back into its sheath. With the momentum from my sprint toward him, I placed my other hand right in his face and shoved with all my might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently <i>all my might</i> was considerably more than it used to be because the man flew both backward and downward as if shot from a cannon as my inertia carried past him. I slowed to a stop in a couple of steps, then whirled to face him. He was on the ground writhing weakly, the back of his head bleeding a crimson pool onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously? What a wuss! Some \"Immortal\" he was--taken out by a single shove from a girl who had no idea what she was doing! Despite the fact that I should probably be moving on to either attack or defend against the next guy, I took a second to smile at my unexpected victory. My objective for this little battle rose from \"don't die\" to \"don't die and take out an Immortal or two to help out my Spartan frenemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached down and grabbed the hilt of the downed man's sword, giving it a tug. The man tried to stop me, but his struggles were weak and pathetic, and I broke his grip with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow armed, I surveyed my surroundings in an effort to decide what to do next. I saw two men attacking Aaron, who was backing away from them. They took turns swinging their swords at my unarmed friend. He leapt backward to avoid each stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes narrowed, and I sprinted toward the men from behind. Aaron's eyes went wide as I came up behind them. Both men saw Aaron's startled expression and apparently determined that it meant something because they both turned to see what had caused his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a cry of desperation and determination, my voice really belting it out with feeling! My choir teacher from high school would have been proud. Or, actually, now that I reconsidered my screech... maybe not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the warning Aaron had inadvertently given them was too late to matter, at least for the first guy. I swung my sword and sliced a deep gash across his neck, dropping him like a sandbag on the sandbag carry in the Spartan race that I was <i>supposed</i> to be doing right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man squared his shoulders to me, preparing to engage me with his sword. I gulped. I was having some success with surprise attacks on these guys, but I had no idea how to really use a sword to fight another armed swordsman. This probably wasn't going to go well for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Aaron saw my frightened look and used my distraction to advance on the Immortal guy from behind. He grabbed the man's sword arm and yelled to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't hesitate. I stabbed my blade forward. It glanced off his chainmail. Shit! I forgot about the whole fucking armor thing! Stupid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man struggled with Aaron for control over the sword, I regained my faltering balance and tried again. This time, I raised the sword above my head and swung downward with everything I had. The blade cleaved right through his felt hat and into the top of his skull. It came to a halt about halfway down his face. He dropped to his knees then flopped over, my sword still buried in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes wide, watching the second man I'd killed fall. I felt dizzy. I smelled the metallic scent of blood swirling into the pungent aroma of body odor from sweaty, unbathed men. I looked at Aaron blankly, then my head bobbed forward, and I retched. The sight of my sword in his head, the smells of the battle, and the screaming knowledge that I had just ended a man's life proved too much for my stomach to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron rubbed my back as I hunched over, heaving. He looked around tensely, as I stared at the ground. I felt his large muscles relax. He spoke in a calming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are only four of them left, Kate, and they're running away. Looks like the Spartan guys took care of the rest of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, my dry heaves ceased, and I came back up, breathing heavily. I shook with the strange, juxtaposed sensations of excess nerve-tingling adrenaline and absolute relief. I couldn't believe I had killed someone. Two someones. Maybe three! My mind was telling me that after very nearly killing me with an arrow through the eye socket, I hadn't had much choice. My heart, however, was in shattered pieces, and tears welled in my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my tears began to fall, my knees began to wobble. I plopped down to the ground on my heavily-muscled glutes. Aaron crouched in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Kate. Remind me not to get on your bad side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled in spite of my tears, which continued to flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron doubled down on levity. Knowing him, it was the only way he could imagine to get me to stop crying. It worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These immortal guys didn't really live up to the hype of their name, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI choked out a laugh, then another... then, I couldn't stop. Tears of laughter replaced tears of horror, and I laughed hysterically. He began to laugh as well, putting his huge arm around me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seven remaining Spartans, in the middle of piling up their dead, paused. They looked at us, their grim expressions turning to baffled amusement as they observed their odd, guffawing prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignored their bemused looks and roamed my eyes down Aaron's newly chiseled body before snapping them back up to meet his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's with the new Conan look, Aar?\" I asked. \"You look like you could take on the whole lot of poorly-named Immortals right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking,\" he said. I looked down at my lean, muscular arms. I really needed to get a mirror and some privacy to see the full extent of my own transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I opened my mouth to respond, two figures shimmered into existence behind Aaron. The Spartans' eyes grew wide and they dropped to their knees, heads bowed. It was an incredibly gorgeous woman and a man whose muscled perfection and strong jaw made him look like some kind of Greek god. Both were clad in white robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Ares,\" he said, as Aaron's head swiveled to see what I was staring at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Aphrodite,\" she said. \"And we are here to meet our newest champions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should have been stunned, shocked, amazed. In a way, I was. But so much had already happened to me today, I wasn't quite reacting exactly as I should. All I could think was how I had nailed it with the Greek god description. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Touch\u00e9</i>, I thought to myself. <i>Tou-fucking-ch\u00e9.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the gods' surprise, I began to laugh.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ares and Aphrodite shared a surprised look, then turned their gazes back to us. Aaron looked at me like I was completely insane. Let\u2019s see. In ancient Greece? Seeing gods and goddesses? Body adding lean muscle mass by the minute? Maybe I <i>was</i> insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut assuming I wasn\u2019t, I needed to get my shit together and deal with this latest turn of events, like, <i>now</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked first at Aphrodite, then at Ares. I gulped. I was about to talk to two heavyweight members of the Greek pantheon. I really hoped I hadn\u2019t gone insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean we\u2019re your champions? Or are you talking about these Spartan dudes here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was speaking in Greek as I had been since we arrived. I idly wondered what \u201cdudes\u201d came out to in Greek-speak before turning my attention back to what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and Aaron are our champions. The Spartans are about to face an overwhelming force of Persians, and they have been making supplications for our aid. Since the Spartans focus on the body more than the mind or the spirit, as the Athenians do, we felt that gifts of beauty and strength would be appropriate. Ares provides the strength, and I, of course, provide the beauty,\u201d said Aphrodite passionately. \u201cHave you not noticed the sapphirine glow about you as you have received our gifts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe <i>have</i> noticed the blue glow\u2026 but why did you bring us back in time and give us these gifts? Why not choose a Spartan from this time?\u201d I said. I noticed Aaron\u2019s curious glance at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Spartans, are you not?\u201d Ares said, tensing, as if afraid he and Aphrodite had made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, n--\u201d I began to say, when Aaron interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are! We are Spartans!\u201d he said, giving me a dirty look. He lowered his voice and told me in a vehement whisper, \u201cWe said so at the start of the race, remember? I\u2019m thinking it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to tell Ares we\u2019re not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was right. We <i>had</i> said that. But we weren\u2019t really Spartans, were we? I wasn\u2019t about to impersonate someone from a culture I knew nothing about\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over to Ares and saw him looking tensed and ready for action, his hand on the hilt of his sword. Um, yeah. I was suddenly thinking Aaron was right--not a good idea to piss this god off. Okay, then. Spartans, we were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re Spartans! The Spartiest Spartans of all, in fact! It\u2019s no wonder you picked us to beef up and stuff...\u201d I said, trying desperately to sound convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres\u2019 hand relaxed on his hilt. Whew! He was buying it--at least a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, um, what are we supposed to do about this little Persian problem of yours?\u201d I asked, trying to smile. I wasn\u2019t sure, but I was thinking my expression probably looked more like I had just swallowed a half dozen lemon wedges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, you will aid the Spartan army in defeating them, of course,\u201d said Aphrodite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to feel a sinking feeling in my stomach, the queasiness from the deaths of those Immortal soldiers again flooding into me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. So how many Persians are we talking about here? Are we talking, like, a hundred, or a thousand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo hundred thousand, give or take,\u201d said Ares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said, turning green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around and walked behind Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI puked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My gaze landed only on the seven remaining Spartans, who were looking at Aaron and me in complete shock. Rattled to the core by the notion that Aaron and I were supposed to help some army take on two hundred thousand freaking Persians, I was more than a little off balance mentally, my emotions penduluming between terror and hysterical humor. After vomiting out my latest round of terror, I was beginning to feel bemused disbelief instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that\u2019s right, Spartans. Your uniformed little gods picked my sorry little pseudo-Greek ass to be extra-Spartified, I thought with manic smugness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes met Aarons after surveying the Greeks. His face was white, and he was trembling. Uh oh. That was moving my emotional pendulum back toward the terror end of the spectrum. Damn it, Aaron!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my emotional roller coaster began to flatten into something resembling\u2026 maybe not calm but perhaps less completely freaked, the Greeks piled up the bodies of their fallen comrades and enemies. They motioned for Aaron and I to follow as they once again set a swift pace to their camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later we arrived. Aaron and I stood at the edge of an army of seven thousand. I was sincerely hoping that they had another hundred thousand or two somewhere around here, or we were about to be in a serious world of hurt when the Persians showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did I have to be on the Spartan side of this mess? Would it be really shitty of me to flip sides? I mean, my only real allegiance to these Spartan guys was a stupid little entry form I\u2019d filled out in a race near Seattle a couple of thousand years in the future. Was I seriously supposed to die with these people just for that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaron, do you think we should get the hell out of here? I mean, we\u2019re not really with these Spartan guys, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean abandon them? After their gods just told us we\u2019re receiving their blessings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t really feel like dying for some people I don\u2019t even know. Hell, how do we even know these are the good guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKate, I think this is the Battle of Thermopylae!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. The Gerard Butler movie, I know! Only with a bunch of stupid armor to take away my eye candy! So you in? I mean\u2026 out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKate, we can\u2019t leave three hundred Spartans to take on a huge army by themselves! Maybe this is how they really succeeded in delaying the Persians--they have our help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, look who\u2019s got a high as hell opinion of himself! First, there are a lot more than 300 guys in this army. Second, I seriously doubt our help is going to really make a difference here. I mean, you\u2019re looking buff enough to fit in with the six pack movie troupe from that movie, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can take on 200,000 freaking army guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKat, we can\u2019t abandon them right now. We just can\u2019t!\u201d Aaron\u2019s voice was growing agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you seriously want to sign up to die for a bunch of strangers?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice came from a tent nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKing Leonidas would like to see you now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d I hissed to Aaron in a loud whisper. \u201cWe missed our chance to get out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made our way to the tent, then paused as two spear-toting guards blocked our passage. I noticed a barrel of water a few feet away and walked over to it to get a sip of water. As I stood over it, about to dip my hands in to draw some water to my mouth, I noticed my reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most of the cages were empty, but there was one other prisoner in a cage. She was a pretty Latina that looked to be about Emma\u2019s age. She wore a crop top and skinny jeans, displaying a toned stomach. Her eyes slowly opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 is\u2026 going\u2026 on?\u201d the girl said slowly, groggily.

Christie held the box up to her ear and rattled it. There was no sound. She tossed it to her younger sister. \"Feels empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen took it and clutched it to her chest. \"I don't care. I like it. I'm going to see if Maime\u00f3 will let me have it.\" She couldn't explain why she wanted this box, she was simply drawn to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Jen and Christie's mother gathered the sisters for their flute lessons. Jen intended to ask her grandmother for permission to take the box, but her grandmother seemed busy. Not wanting to part with it, Jen took it with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Halloween, it was tradition for the Murphys, the Alvarados, and the Ahmads to get together and take their children trick-or-treating. The three families lived in the same suburban neighborhood, and had similarly aged pairs of daughters. Whenever the families got together the girls automatically separated into two groups by age. The 13-year-olds, Jen, Adi, and Abia, ran off to change into their costumes. The 17-year-olds, Christie, Rosa, and Dwaa were too old for tricks or treats, and went off to the living room to watch a scary movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the parents returned to the Murphys' house with their younger daughters and their bags of candy in tow, the girls ran to the living room to organize their candy stashes. The girls poured the candy out on the floor, beginning to separate gum from the candy and the like. Distracted by their task, the younger sisters didn't notice as their older sisters snuck into the room. Christie, Rosa, and Dwaa raided their younger sisters' stashes, pushing the candy back into each respective bag, then prancing around their younger sisters, bags held high and out of their younger sisters' reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, so sad... pipsqueak can't reach it. I guess that means it's all mine...\" Christie said, shoving her younger sister to the ground and walking off with all of her candy. Tears welled in Jen's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three younger sisters, upset and holding back tears ran to the basement, the wonder and excitement of another holiday spoiled by their bullying older sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we were bigger  than them,\" said Abi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we were stronger than them,\" said Adi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we could have what they have,\" said Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish were were prettier than them too,\" said all three friends, in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment that the final wish was complete, the three girls heard a click. Whirling, Jen remembered the locked box that she had brought home the day before. It was sitting on a shelf with some of her other toys. She walked over to it and realized that it had come unlocked by itself. Bringing it to the others, she opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, was a scroll with strange Celtic writing on it. Jen sounded it out, trying to remember the bits of the Celtic language that her grandmother had taught her. She chanted it over and over until she believed that she had it right. Joining in, Adi and Abi began to chant with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that they all completed the verse together, a green mist formed over the scroll. Jen and Adi, surprised, stopped chanting. Abi kept going one more time through the verse before stopping. As she finished the final verse, the mist flowed to her, disappearing inside her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!\" said Abi, rubbing her chest and looking to see if anything had happened where the mist had touched her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Jen said. \"Should we tell our moms about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" said Adi. \"Our sisters will find out and take it away from us too! I think we should keep it for ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls agreed. They all went home and sleep well on Halloween night, dreams of scrolls and green mist highlighting their dreams.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt her chest, where the woman had touched her, and felt\u2026 breasts? Pulling her head up from the pillow, she looked down at herself. She definitely had breasts! And her hips looked more developed. Was she taller too? She scrambled out of the bed to the bathroom to look at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Abi\u2019s body resembled her sister\u2019s than her own from the previous day. It was as if puberty had accomplished three years of work in one night! She looked like an attractive 16-year-old on the cusp of womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she admired herself, her sister flung open the bathroom door. \u201cOut of my way, Abi! It\u2019s my turn\u2026\u201d her sister started before noticing Abi\u2019s significant changes. \u201cHow did you grow so much?\u201d Dwaa asked her, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I had a growth spurt,\u201d said Abi, shrugging. With the two of them in front of the mirror, Abi could compare her new body to her sister\u2019s. She was still about an inch shorter than Dwaa\u2019s 5\u20197\u201d height, but her breasts were a good cup size larger than her sister\u2019s B-cups. Abi\u2019s waist seemed narrower and hips wider, giving her a more dramatic hourglass shape than her sister, though Abi\u2019s legs didn\u2019t look as long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwaa\u2019s eyes narrowed in jealousy as she realized that her younger sister seemed to now be the more curvaceous of the two. \u201cWell, I\u2019m still taller than you, Abi. And you wish you had my legs!\u201d Dwaa shoved her sister out of the bathroom as she tried to wrap her mind around the effects of Abi\u2019s amazing growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Abi approached Dwaa and her boyfriend, Steve. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t my little freak of a sister,\u201d Dwaa said. Turning to her boyfriend, she said \u201cI think that she had some kind of cancer or something, because she\u2019s got tumors growing from her chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi\u2019s cheeks flushed in embarrassment and tears welled in her eyes. She was tired of her sister insulting her! Dwaa opened her mouth, ready to insult her sister again, but a green mist seemed to form around her mouth, and it shut again. Dwaa\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, but she said nothing. Abi turned and ran away, ashamed and hurt at her sister\u2019s cruelty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwaa looked at Steve, who seemed to be staring into the distance. She frowned as she followed her boyfriend\u2019s eyes\u2026 to Abi\u2019s new boobs, which jiggled as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, the three young friends met in Jen\u2019s basement again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it! You look so developed and pretty,\u201d gushed Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re bigger than my sister too!\u201d Adi exclaimed, hands cupped at her chest to indicate breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has to be from us reading the scroll together last night!\u201d Jen said. \u201cI knew there was something going on when that green mist went into you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it again. Only this time, I\u2019ll do the last chant!\u201d said Adi. The other girls excitedly agreed, hearts fluttering in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they chanted, an indistinct red shape began to form over the scroll. Finishing the verse, it coalesced into the shape of a sword. Abi and Jen stopped, but Adi read the verse one more time. As she finished, the insubstantial red sword plunged into her chest. Like Abi the night before, she rubbed her chest, where it had struck, a strange tingling on her skin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smell of distant smoke spoke of a faraway battle. A raven gazed at her from atop the wall. It flew down to her, transforming into a beautiful, dark-haired woman as it landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman placed her hand on Abi\u2019s chest, exactly where the red sword had entered her. \u201cI am the Morrigan,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be my avatar, the Knight of the Cause.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi awoke. Just as Abi had the following morning, she touched her chest. <i>Was she as beautiful and developed as Adi had become yesterday?</i> she wondered? She sprang from the bed to her bedroom mirror to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely prettier and more developed, but in a different way than her curvaceous friend. Toned muscle decorated her 5\u20198\u201d athletic frame. B-cup breasts stood proudly from her chest, less eye-catching than Abi\u2019s and probably smaller than her sister\u2019s pair as well, but firm and perky nonetheless. Her abs and obliques were defined and visible. Her legs were long and sinewed, and her butt was full and hard. She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi normally dreaded gym class, but with her new, athletic body, she couldn\u2019t wait to see what she could do. Today, they were playing basketball. Ordinarily one of the last to be chosen, she was one of the first today. As the teams took the court, three boys and two girls on each team, the ball was tipped to her. Running quickly down the court, she came to her defender. She spun around the girl easily crossing the ball to her left hand. One of the boys stepped up to block her path to the basket, but she was already leaping into the air. The boy tried to block her shot, but she had jumped too high. She shot the ball, and it swished through the net. Adi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the game ended and the students went back to the locker room, her team had one 32-16. She had scored 24 of her team\u2019s points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school that afternoon, she returned home to find her sister Rosa munching on Adi\u2019s Halloween candy. \u201cSo how are you so much taller today, mutant, did you sell your soul to the devil or something?\u201d Rosa asked with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi came up to her sister as Rosa also rose to her feet. Adi was a good two inches taller now. \u201cMaybe I did,\u201d she responded, reaching for the bag of candy on the couch. Rosa grabbed her arm, trying to prevent her from taking it, but Adi was the stronger of the sisters now. She pulled the bag of candy away, turning to go back to her room. She tossed a candy into her mouth and thought, <i>I can get used to this\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening in the basement, after the three friends marveled over Adi\u2019s phenomenal physique, it was Jen\u2019s turn. After all three said the verse together, a blue engagement ring shape formed above the scroll. Jen intoned the verse alone the final time, and the ring plunged into her chest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She drew her dark cloak around her to protect her from the cold. She saw something swimming toward her--a dark shape under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shape emerged\u2014it was a man. He placed his hand on Jen\u2019s chest, exactly where the blue ring had entered her. \u201cI am Manann\u00e1n,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be my avatar, Seeker of Treasures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke from the strange dream to see what she looked like. She was confident that she would be different, but since her other friends hadn\u2019t developed in quite the same way, she was curious what her changes would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, her long, red hair shone as it dropped down her back in thick ringlets, the flowing, flaming mane catching her attention instantly. She wasn\u2019t much taller, she saw, slightly disappointed at her 5\u20194\u201d height. She was slender and lissome, small barely-Bs sat high on her chest. Slim arms, lithe legs, and a tiny waist gave her body an agile, elfin appeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed tumbles of red curls from her face and stared at the reflection of her face. Her face had an ethereal beauty that was captivating. She turned it slightly from side to side, up and down. Regal cheekbones, luminous viridian eyes, long lashes, full lips, and retrouss\u00e9 nose combined to make her face spellbindingly attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt breakfast, Christie sat down, setting her backpack on the table. Then, Christie did a double-take. \u201cWow, pipsqueak, good job on the makeup today! You actually look pretty. Too bad you\u2019re not a <i>real</i> woman yet,\u201d Christie said, thrusting out her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen got up to put the dishes away, snaking a hand into the pocket of her sister\u2019s backpack and fishing out a twenty-dollar bill with lightning speed, she stashed it in her own pocket without her sister noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked to school, Jen found a small picture of Christie\u2019s handsome boyfriend Calvin folded into the bill. <i>Yum,</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi toyed with Jen\u2019s long curls that evening. \u201cYour hair is sooo amazing. I wish that had been one of my gifts!\u201d Abi told her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you made out the best in the boob department,\u201d Adi told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue\u2026\u201d Abi said with a broad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s decided, right? We\u2019re all going to try reading the verse the second time this time,\u201d Jen confirmed. Her friends both nodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sat around the coffee table in the basement on their knees and joined hands this time. They spoke the words of the verse, and this time three orbs\u2014one green, one red, and one blue\u2014appeared above the scroll. They all spoke the words a second time, and the orbs flew into their respective avatar and disappeared.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only unusual thing that had happened today was the Morrigan\u2019s voice in her mind as she woke up, saying <i>In victory will be your reward.</i>--whatever that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi\u2019s gym teacher--Mr. Muscles, the girls called him\u2014explained the rules of today\u2019s tournament. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do something a little different today. We\u2019re going to have a tennis tournament. I\u2019ve written seeding on the chalkboard attached to the fence. The first round will match up the two lowest seeds, and the winner will advance, playing the higher seeds. Your performance over the course of the semester so far determined the seeding. The first one to win three points\u2026 to 40 if you remember your tennis scoring, people\u2026 wins the matchup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi looked at the chart and saw that, based on her performance prior to yesterday, she was the very lowest seed. She would go first. Her opponent was overweight, large-breasted, and completely unathletic, and she frowned when she saw that she had to go up against Adi, who looked a bit like Ana Ivanovic after the previous day\u2019s changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi made short work of the girl, winning 40-love. As Mr. Muscles announced her the winner, she felt her chest tingle as it swelled outward slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next competitor was also a girl, a tall, gangly girl with glasses that seemed to swing her racquet in slow motion. 40-love. This time, Adi felt the tingle in her legs as she felt them lengthen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the tenth matchup, Adi looked as if she could dominate Wimbledon. Her workout clothes no longer fit properly. Her tank top had become almost halter-like as her breasts filled it to bursting. Her midriff left bare, the ridges of visible abs and obliques clenched and contracted as she moved. Ever longer legs grew more and more muscled with each match, especially when she beat the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the final matchup, the contest was not even remotely fair. The fit, muscled boy on the opposite end of the court gulped in fear as he awaited her serve. Adi\u2019s sports bra and tank top had split down the seam at the side as her breasts bulged. Her steel hard stomach was so incredibly defined, each brick of her eight pack abs pushed out close to an inch. Her shoulders were ripped baseballs of muscle. Her biceps and triceps danced with striation as she gripped her racquet. Her gorgeous, tight butt, pushed her lycra pants so thin that they were nearly see-through. The endless legs that brought her to 6'0\" were packed with smooth, feminine muscle. She looked like a cross-fit athlete merged with a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi\u2019s serve rocketed past him with blazing speed, unreturnable, for another ace. She flashed him a brilliant smile as she felt her muscles grow even denser with power.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought back to the twenty she had taken from her sister the previous day. Should she take more things from people that deserved it? It seemed to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat down at breakfast across from her larger, better-endowed sister, she noticed that her sister\u2019s legs and bust seemed to glow with blue energy. \u201cChristie, are you okay?\u201d Jen cried, suddenly concerned that something was wrong with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie looked up toward Jen in surprise and confusion. \u201cWhat, pipsqueak? I\u2019m fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your boobs\u2026 and your legs!\u201d Jen protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie looked down, then looked back to her sister. \u201c\u2026are so much sexier than yours? You\u2019re so right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen\u2019s face scrunched in confusion. It didn\u2019t appear that her sister could see the blue energy inside her. Jen concentrated on the energy in her sister\u2019s chest, and it began to swirl. As she focused on it even more intently, a blue beam shot from Christie\u2019s chest into her own. Jen arched slightly in pleasure. What was THAT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen tried it again, this time focusing on her sister\u2019s longer legs. A blue beam shot from Christie\u2019s legs into her own. She noticed as the hem of her jeans slid over her ankles, perhaps a half inch. Her legs had grown longer! She examined her sister\u2019s legs. The older girl\u2019s jeans seemed to touch her shoes, where they hadn\u2019t before. Her legs had shrunk! Jen had stolen a half-inch of height from Christie\u2019s legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to the chest beam. Did that mean that her breasts were larger too? She ran to the mirror in the hall. It was difficult to tell, but she thought that they were ever so slightly larger. She looked back at her sister, and the blue energy was gone. Apparently, she could only take a small bit, but she was able to take the attributes from her sister that were better than her own. This must be what the voice had meant this morning! She wondered if she could do that from others? Suddenly, she could not wait to go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at her desk in first period, Jen brushed a stray lock of gorgeous ginger from her face. She looked over the girl next to her, Linda. Linda was a dancer, having taken lessons. Her tightly muscled, elegant legs glowed with blue energy. Focusing, Jen watched the blue beam improve her legs even more than her sister had this morning. Looking toward her teacher, she stole a bit of her knowledge\u2026 and just a touch of height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at one of the girls from the track team, she stole some speed. Turning to a cheerleader, she stole some beauty from her face and some litheness from her body. Paying a visit to the class math whiz, she stole a bit of his intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed drawn to attributes like cleverness, quickness, and speed. And, of course, she could never get enough beauty! She drew attributes from her classmates at every opportunity throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, she was a 5\u201910\u201d supermodel, long, leggy, and lean. She moved like a cat, graceful and quick.  \u201cThank you, Manann\u00e1n, I owe you one,\u201d she thought as she admired her beautiful body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She ran to the bathroom to check the mirror. She spun around, but couldn\u2019t find any further improvements to her curvy body. Disappointed, she thought about what Brigit had told her. <i>Who did she desire,</i> she mused. The only person that came to mind was her sister\u2019s boyfriend, Steve. She sighed. She thought of his muscled arms, how his chest bulged in his t-shirts. As she thought of his lips, she licked hers. She noticed a green mist form around her before it appeared to absorb into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few miles away, Steve didn\u2019t notice as green mist swirled around him before being absorbed into his body as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve walked into school, he met Rosa, hugging her and kissing her full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi, at her locker, felt her lips prickle slightly. She looked in the mirror mounted in the door of her locker. Her lips looked fuller. They looked just as good as her sister\u2019s, in fact! She squealed in delight, causing the student next to her to give her an odd look. She didn\u2019t care. The changes were starting again, and she was growing prettier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve went to his locker, admiring the luscious ass of Brittany, the head cheerleader along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi felt her butt prickle. Reaching back, she felt as it felt larger and firmer. She smiled a crooked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve admired Miss Langley\u2019s long legs and beautiful hair. His eyes drifted to Lindsay\u2019s expansive cleavage\u2026 throughout the day, his teenage hormone-addled mind admired the attributes of the girls of the school, until the final bell rang, and he went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi spent the day feeling prickles in her breasts, face, stomach, legs, butt, over and over as Steve unwittingly formed his perfect woman come to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time, she went home, Abi\u2019s 5\u20198\u201d body took the term voluptuous to another level. Huge breasts\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure of their size any more, but they were well beyond DD--jutted proudly in front of her. A tiny waist and wide, expansive hips sat atop shapely, lush legs. The contours of her body were dramatic, buxom perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped that Steve came over. If Rosa was going to steal Abi\u2019s candy, Abi was going to try to steal hers too, she thought as a sparkle of mischief entered her eye. And Rosa's candy had a name...

If she stayed in her room for a bit, Christie would be gone soon anyway. Christie had a music lesson this evening. Jen wanted to save her new appearance to shock Christie at the best possible moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Christie left to her lesson, Jen heard a knock at the door. She checked the family doorbell camera on her phone. It was Calvin, Christie\u2019s super-hot boyfriend!

Come in!\u201d she called out toward the front door, trying to sound as much like her sister as she could. Calvin entered, closing the door behind him. He approached Christie\u2019s door and knocked. Jen stealthily snuck up behind him, using her newfound quickness and agility. She quickly slipped a blindfold over his eyes. \u201cI have something special planned for this evening, Calvin,\u201d she said, still mimicking her sister\u2019s voice, but dropping it into a husky octave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, I can\u2019t wait,\u201d Calvin replied eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen led him into Christie\u2019s room, pulling out a chair and sitting him down.

Soon\u2026\u201d Jen trailed off alluringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin shivered in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of growing lately, Calvin,\u201d said Jen in her husky-Christie voice, giving it a seductive edge. \u201cAnd I wanted you to get a chance to <i>feel</i> it before you see it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen slipped out of her clothes until she was in just bra (it was her mom\u2019s bra actually, since none of hers fit\u2014and even this one was extremely tight!) and panties. She strode around the chair where Calvin sat before moving her lips to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere are the rules,\u201d she whispered into his ear throatily. \u201cI take your hand in mine and let you feel my body. If you grab me or take off your blindfold, my clothes go back on, and I kick you out. I strongly encourage you to follow the rules, Calvin, because, honestly, my body is becoming pretty spectacular.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet!\u201d said Calvin, erection already beginning to bulge in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen took Calvin\u2019s hand and slid it up her long, sinuous leg. It felt so smooth, so shapely that his erection grew to steel. \"Your legs are so much sexier than I remember,\" Calvin mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... you have no idea how much hotter I've become,\" Jen said, sly smile forming on full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guided his hand along her rounded hip, undulating it just slightly, causing thoughts of copulation to cloud his desire-addled mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew his hand along her sleek, slim stomach and over the swell of her ripe breast. Calvin\u2019s erection peeked out of the top of his pants, impossibly rigid. \"Oh my God, you're so much bigger...\" Calvin moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled his hand to her mouth, and enveloped his forefinger between sensual lips, drawing slowly outward toward its tip. Calvin shuddered in hunger for her, learning forward. \"You are so hot,\" he whispered, voice heavy with building desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen threw a bare, slender leg over him as she sat on his lap, face-to-face with her sister\u2019s boyfriend. She leaned forward and kissed his lips. Calvin moaned again as he returned the kiss, pent up desire about to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw her supermodel sister, nude save a bra and panties, thick ringlets of fiery hair rolling down her bare back, sitting on her boyfriend\u2019s lap in a kiss. Her jaw hit the floor, too surprised to be angry yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen drew back from the kiss languidly, despite knowing that he sister was now watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jen\u2019s pillowy lips pulled away from his, Calvin could only think about Jen\u2019s body, her lips, her warm, inviting hips. It was too much, and Calvin\u2019s desire overcame him. He exploded in his jeans, hips bucking involuntarily as his girlfriend looked on in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen strolled by her stunned sister, picking up her clothes on the way. She shut the door behind her, leaving them to\u2026 whatever was going to happen after this! Jen felt a little for her sister\u2026 until she remembered all of the times that Christie had belittled her, shoved her, been terrible to her. <i>You know what they say,</i> she thought. <i>Payback is a bitch!</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She picked up the call. Jen excitedly relayed her tale to her best friend. Abi shrieked in delight as Jen got to the part about her sister walking in on them. \u201cThat payback is legendary, Jen, LEGENDARY!\u201d she told her friend. \u201cI was thinking about doing something like that with Steve. Dwaa always says he\u2019s a breast man,\u201d Abi looked down into her own expansive cleavage, \u201c\u2026and these babies are so big, they\u2019re probably going to need a custom bra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the phone, Jen thought for a moment, the added cleverness she had taken from the brightest students and teachers at school coming in handy right now, \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi prepared in her room, pulling lowcut vermillion top over buxom, bare breasts, nipples tenting the fabric. She didn\u2019t\u2019 have a bra large enough to fit, and this was better for the task at hand regardless. She tried a pair of her sister\u2019s lowrider jeans from the clean laundry pile, but she couldn\u2019t get them on over flaring hips. She went with a white stretchy-waisted skater skirt instead, tugging it down just a bit to show a sexy inch of skin below her top. A bit of light makeup and scarlet red lipstick completed the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi waited on the couch, ready to jump up the moment she heard the door. She knew that Steve was coming over to see Dwaa tonight, but she needed to be the one to answer the door, if her plan was to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang, and she called out, \u201cGot it!\u201d as she ran to the door. Pulling the door wide, she gave Steve a good look at her voluptuous charms. His eyes were glued to her magnificent cleavage. <i>So far, so good,</i> Abi thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm is Bra\u2026 I mean\u2026 Dwaa home?\u201d he asked, gaze leaving Abi\u2019s chest for the briefest of moments as he corrected her sister\u2019s name, before being drawn like a magnet back to her bra-less wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me\u2026 wait, I think you have something on your face. Let me get it for you\u2026\u201d said Abi, stepping forward, and pressing her large breasts against his muscled chest. She took a slender, French white long-tip nail and brushed it lightly along his lips. \u201cThere\u2026 much better,\u201d she breathed huskily, her face just inches from his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwaa came up behind her sister, and said, \u201cHi, Steve!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwaa\u2019s face drew into a scowl, as she saw her curvaceous sister pressed against her boyfriend. \u201cGet away from him, you whore! I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing ever since you had this growth spurt, but it\u2019s going to stop RIGHT NOW!\u201d Dwaa pulled her sister to the side, grabbed Steven\u2019s wrist, and led him inside to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwaa and Steve proceeded to watch a movie, but Abi walked into Steve\u2019s line of sight at every opportunity, giving him titillating glimpses of gorgeous coffee-and-cream flesh at every opportunity. Every time she appeared in front of him, Steve\u2019s eyes became glued to her comely curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwaa, seeing the effect that her sexy younger sister was having on her boyfriend, finally threw a pillow at her sister. \u201cGet out of here, you tramp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi let the pillow hit her and fall to the floor. She reached down for it, bending over and giving Steve a clear, unobstructed view of her prodigious, round breasts. She squeezed the pillow up to her sternum, pushing those delicious breasts up and out in the process, then she strutted to her room Her sister had gotten to the door more quickly than she had hoped, but her little \u201cshows\u201d in the living room might have been enough to get her plan back on track. It still might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie progressed and Dwaa began to make out with Steve. As they kissed, Dwaa\u2019s body pressed into his. He couldn\u2019t help but compare her to her younger sister. Abi\u2019s breasts had been so huge, so firm, so soft. She was soooo sexy. As he took Dwaa\u2019s breast in his hand, he thought about what it would be like to touch Abi\u2019s luscious orbs. \u201cOh, Abi\u2026\u201d he moaned in passion, turned on at the thought of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwaa flushed with anger and pulled away. Wordlessly, she glared and him. Then, she stalked off and slammed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve, embarrassed and hard, quietly snuck away through the front door, probably off to masturbate to thoughts of his girlfriend\u2019s smolderingly sexy younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It had worked after all,</i> Abi thought with a sly smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She debated whether to change her class to <i>Jill of all Trades, Master of None</i>, but decided to remain a <i>Math Whiz</i>. Being a specialist was better than trying to be everything and not great at anything, she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a small girl, should she spend a point or two to make herself taller, stronger, or prettier as the other girls had? No, she decided, if she was going to specialize, she was going to go all out on intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what should she sacrifice to get herself more intelligence? Strength? She was only at 2 right now. Going down to a 1 might make it difficult to do much of anything physically, so she wasn't going to touch that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgility was at 4, so that was a possibility. What else? She could lower willpower as the other girls had, but she didn't like the idea of losing willpower. She might even want to increase that if she could. More drive was always a good thing. That left beauty as the only other alternative. She thought about her attractive, elfin, waifish features.Was she willing to reduce her beauty? Debating between reducing her beauty and her agility, she decided on reducing agility. She was already weak, and she wasn't into sports or dancing, or other things that would require much agility, so she preferred to take that one down more than her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy pressed Agility and lowered it to a 1. That left her 3 points to spend. She pressed intelligence and tried to add all three there. Once it hit 10, however, she didn't have the option to go any higher. Apparently that was the maximum value, at least during character creation. She left it at 10 and debated where to put the other point. Should she go with willpower? Or she could add to her petite beauty? Maybe she should become stronger? The thought of adding some muscle to her thin frame had some appeal. However, in the end she decided that she didn't want to take herself down to a 1 in any stat, so she added the point back to Agility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the green checkmark, and it was as if everything suddenly became clearer as she became one of the most intelligent people on earth with a 200 IQ. She began to wonder if the game was using the character sheets to drive quantum shifts in the fabric of space-time. It seemed magical, but maybe magic was just technology that did exactly that.

This game isn't something that we do in John's basement for fun. It's being played in our real lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I solved a proof in math class today, I received a notification that said I had unlocked the 'Best Student Ever' achievement and got a bonus stat point.\" Peggy pressed on the Beauty stat on her character sheet and the others saw that she had the option to raise it by a point without having taken any of the other points away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy had been experimenting with her character sheet since she arrived at home. Unlike during character creation, where she had been capped at 10 points on intelligence, Peggy seemed to be able to spend her stat point on intelligence now. Since 10 seemed to be the normal human maximum for any stat, she could presumably take herself to a superhuman level with the bonus. She had strongly considered adding the point to intelligence to make herself superhumanly smart. However, she sensed her classmate's unease around her as her intelligence grew, and she didn't want to alienate herself further socially. She decided then to put the point into the attribute that would help her the most, socially--beauty. She didn't need to be the most popular girl in school, but she didn't want to be a super-smart freak without any friends either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her Beauty score by one and pressed the green confirmation checkmark. Her friends watched as her waifish beauty jumped up a level. She had worn a form-fitting but elastic yoga outfit tonight and moved a floor-length mirror to the basement, knowing what was in store. She wanted to be able to see the changes to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs lengthened by two inches, still very slender but adding some toned flesh to them in just the right places. Her hips became a bit more supple, her burgeoning breasts gained a cup size. Her waist seemed to become a little firmer, and her face became more beautiful as her skin gained a healthier sheen, her eyes seemed a little larger, her lips more plump, and her cheekbones a bit higher. Her ebony hair seemed to gain volume and length. She had been cute before.

She had just watched Liz's performance and was struck by how effortlessly the beautiful girl could command the attention of the audience--in this case, Miss Kelly, the school drama teacher. Amanda had never beaten her for the lead part in a play before. This time, however, she was an 8 on the beauty scale, not a 7. She was fairly certain that she was a match for Liz in the beauty department now. <i>She could do this!</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEncouraged and optimistic that she could win with her new charms, she gave the dramatic speech, nailed the song, and felt Miss Kelly's response to her graceful dance routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the school day, Amanda ran straight from class to the posting on the auditorium door. She saw her name on top by the lead role. She had done it!! She was overjoyed, running to tell Rachel and Peggy the news, when she saw the notification. A banner floated into her vision announcing, \"You have unlocked the 'Starring Role' achievement. You now have a bonus stat point to allocate on your character sheet. Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had done it! She had earned a bonus point, just as Peggy had. She couldn't wait to use it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at home, she pulled her character sheet from her hiding place under the bed, and, without hesitating, pressed the Beauty stat. She changed it from 8 to 9, and pressed the confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her face toward her vanity station mirror, and watched her face go from beautiful to absolutely gorgeous. Her breasts swelled, cleavage straining her top. Hips burgeoned anew, her already shapely legs grew longer and more luscious. If this kept up, she might be able to get parts in Hollywood. She considered as she examined herself in the mirror. Scratch that, she was probably enough for that right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped a selfie and texted it to Rachel and Peggy with a message that said \"Guess what? Bonus point!\" She couldn't wait to go school tomorrow and flirt with the guys as they drooled over her. Andrew was dating Liz, but when he saw her new smoldering model's body, she might just have a chance of taking the hottest guy in school for herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>Amanda's Character Sheet</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Amanda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Physical Characteristics\t</b><br>\r\nHair Color:\tBlond<br>\r\nEye Color:\tBlue<br>\r\nHeight:\t5\u20199\u201d (increased from 5'7\")<br>\r\nWeight:\t126 lbs (increased from 114 lbs)<br>\r\nChest:\t32E (increased from 30D)<br>\r\nWaist:\t21\u201d<br>\r\nHips/Inseam:\t33\u201d (increased from 32\")<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n<b>Class</b>\t<br>\r\nChoir Boy/Girl\t<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n<b>Core Statistics\t</b><br>\r\nStrength:\t3<br>\r\nAgility:\t6<br>\r\nIntelligence:\t5<br>\r\nWillpower:\t3<br>\r\nBeauty:\t9 (increased from 8)<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n<b>Skills</b>\t<br>\r\nSports:\t1<br>\r\nKnowledge:\t3<br>\r\nProblem Solving:\t3<br>\r\nLanguage:\t4<br>\r\nFighting:\t1<br>\r\nCreativity:\t4 (increased from 3)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They\u2019re getting older and they\u2019re ready to leave Illinois and move to Arizona. The heat is good for their joints. They have a ton of stuff in that old house, and they\u2019re going to need help sorting through it, having garage sales, and cleaning. I can\u2019t go all the way to Carbondale from Chicago every weekend. You know how busy I am at the firm. I really need you to do this for me, hun.

She constructed a cardboard Home Depot box, filled it with clothes. She constructed another box and filled it with dusty house d\u00e9cor. Another box. More junk. Rinse. Repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the afternoon, she was covered in dust and sweat and had had enough for the day. At least now, there was space to walk around in the attic a bit. It looked like there were a good two or three more days of work to fully clear it out, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she packed the last box for the day, she noticed an old, wooden chessboard sitting on top of a dusty bookshelf along the vertical wall of the attic. She walked over to it and ran a finger along its smooth finish. Despite the fact that everything else was covered in a fine coat of dust, the chessboard was not. It\u2019s smooth, maple length was pristine and clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pieces were all standing in their proper places, ready for a game to begin. She moved a white pawn forward two squares on a whim before examining the rest of the flawless board. It was just\u2026 odd. There was something about it that she couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on. She stood there for a moment, just staring at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook herself out of it. What was she doing? She needed to take this box down to the garage. Then, it was time for a nice, long, hot shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t wait for that shower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Natalia pulled down the expanding stairs and ascended them into the attic again. She walked over to the pile of collapsed cardboard and began to build another box, when she noticed something out of the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A black pawn had been moved two spaces forward.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tucking a lock of hair behind her ear, Natalia examined the chessboard closely. It was a beautiful hardwood set. The white pieces had a vague curved, feminine profile, while the black pieces were blockier, more masculine. She hadn\u2019t noticed that before. The board was in exactly the same place that it had been, the pieces in the same places that they had been, with the lone exception of the black pawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grandparents were too old to climb the rickety folding stairs to the attic. There was no way they had come up here and moved that pawn. There was no one else in the house that she was aware of. She would ask, but she was certain that she would have known had someone else come to visit. <i>How, then, had that piece moved?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she moved it, then forgotten about it? She had read of people doing strange things while sleepwalking. Maybe she had moved the piece in her sleep without realizing it? She had never been told that she had ever sleepwalked by her family or anyone else, so it seemed unlikely, but what other explanation was there? A ghost? That seemed even more farfetched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia shook her head. Sometimes weird things just happened. She wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to go back to packing boxes, but she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to look away from the chessboard. Not understanding why she was doing it, she moved another piece, a knight, forward to protect her pawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had she done that? It had just felt like\u2026 something she needed to do. She shook her head again and went back to packing up the piles of junk in the attic and bringing it down to the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, she thought of the chessboard as she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dreams that night were torrid. She dreamed of hands caressing her. She dreamed of lips kissing her. She dreamed of legs intertwining with hers. There didn\u2019t seem to be another person, just touches. Erotic, sensual touches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up feeling aroused, feeling sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her shower, Natalia looked at herself in the mirror. Her pretty face and slender body were both very attractive and she had no problems attracting dates in high school. Her only wish was that her AA breasts had developed a bit more. Today, however, she was pleased with her looks. She looked good, she thought. Her breasts, while still small seemed slightly swollen today. Maybe she would make it to at least an A cup after all. She had heard of girls that developed a bit more at 18. Maybe she was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her body looked good too. All of this manual labor must be doing her body some good. She looked extra toned and just the slightest bit curvier. Mostly, she just felt\u2026 good. She felt alive, energized, and beautiful this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, she headed up to the attic. Another day of packing, maybe two, and she would be done clearing the massive amount of junk up there. As she reached the top of the stairs, her eyes were drawn again to the chessboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, a black knight had moved.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn\u2019t sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the blocky knight piece that had moved and put it back to its original location. She watched it, half expecting it to move in front of her. It didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tempted to move another white piece, but she decided not to. Maybe the black pieces would stop moving if she stopped moving the white pieces. She tucked her hair behind her ear as she thought. This was getting to be a little freaky now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t sure whether she should ask her grandparents about the board. What if she had done something wrong by moving the first piece? She didn\u2019t want them to be upset with her. She didn\u2019t want to frighten them either. Her grandfather had been having some heart trouble as it was. The last thing that she needed to do was give him anxiety about living in a haunted house. Her grandparents were firm believers in the supernatural. Natalia never had been, but this chessboard thing was starting to give her second thoughts. She decided that if she stopped moving pieces, and everything stayed the same, there was no need to do anything further. It was odd, but it would be over. Someday, she would ask them. <i>After</i> they had moved out of this house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia worked for the rest of the day on cleaning up the attic, and came very close to finishing. By lunchtime tomorrow, she would be finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, she called her friend Rei. They chatted about Rei\u2019s new boyfriend, about what clothes to get for school, and about the upcoming weekend, when Rei was going to join her for a few days over the fourth of July in Carbondale. Natalia thought about telling Rei what had happened with the chessboard but decided that she would show her when she came. She didn\u2019t want her friend to think she was crazy. Maybe she would move a piece and see if her friend could corroborate what was happening. If nothing else, maybe they could have a cool, if harmless ghost story to tell people on Halloween at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fell asleep tonight, her thoughts again went to the chessboard and that masculine-looking knight piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dreams that night were even hotter than the previous night. She felt her back arch, her desire rise. She was writhing in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke, skin moist and hot to the touch. She felt as if she had been making out with her boyfriend and things had begun to border on foreplay territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a deep breath, calming her heartrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came out of the shower this morning, she looked closely at her body again. She was getting that 18-year-old last push of puberty after all. Her breasts were clearly larger, definitely a proper A cup. The rest of her body looked even better than it had the day before, thanks to the constant physical activity of the last few days. Were her narrow hips a bit wider? Maybe. Her smile looked a bit whiter, her hair had good volume today. She was looking forward to getting some new clothes with Rei this weekend. By the looks of things, she was going to need at least some new bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dressed in short jean shorts and a tank top, ready to wrap things up in the attic. She pulled down the extension stairs and climbed up. She walked to the chessboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black knight had advanced twice from where she had put it, and another black pawn had moved.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, two really, since one of them just got the black knight to where it had been originally yesterday morning before she moved the piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia picked up the white pawn. She was fairly sure that it had a more exaggerated shape today that it had on Sunday when she first saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was crazy! Apparently, she couldn\u2019t stop the game. It was going to continue whether she made a move or not. Worse, it seemed to take her move if she didn\u2019t take it! She debated again whether to discuss this with her grandparents but decided to show Rei and get her thoughts before she did. Rei would be here in a couple of days, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered, then made a move, sliding a pawn to a position also covered by her knight. She wanted a strong defensive position, since her opponent seemed eager to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia packed up the rest of the junk in the attic in the morning, then used broom and dust rag to clean in the afternoon. She looked at the chessboard and debated what to do. She could leave it up the attic, away from her and just continue this game as she had been. She could move it to the garage with everything else. She could move it into her room. She considered that last idea. If she moved it to her room, she would be able to keep an eye on it. Maybe she would even be able to see how it was moving! She could stay up and watch it until she observed what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided. She picked up the chessboard and brought it down the stairs to her room, setting it on top of her dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia lay on her stomach on the bed, arms propping her head up, watching the chessboard. As midnight approached, her eyes grew heavy, and despite her best intentions, she drifted off to sleep. That night, Natalia\u2019s dreams were vivid, intense. Her body felt sleeker and more voluptuous. Something was filling her, and she bucked in pleasure. She awoke in mid-moan, close to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took several deep breaths to calm herself down, though her body still tingled with pent up arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to the chessboard. The black bishop had advanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved another pawn to protect her original pawn against this new threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia decided to see if her body looked any different. Checking herself in the mirror, she saw that her body was as it had been in the dream. She was taller, her legs were definitely longer. Every part of her looked a bit better, healthier, shapelier. Her breasts had to be closing in on a B cup size. It was still her, but slightly magnified again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Natalia had always been attractive, Rei had always been beautiful. Natalia had always envied her friend a little, as she had clearly been the prettier of the two. Now, however, it had to be pretty close. She was clearly catching up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had to deal with strange supernatural events in this house for the summer, at least there seemed to be some perks that came with it! She smiled, then giggled. <i>At least I seem to be dealing with a sexy ghost\u2026</i> she thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She fell asleep to increasingly erotic dreams, then awoke just before she came. Her body continued to improve by the day, legs smoother and longer, breasts fuller, stomach tighter, face more alluring. She couldn\u2019t wait until Rei saw her. Her friend certainly didn\u2019t have anything on her now, looks-wise! Rei might even be a little envious of her now! The thought sent shivers of pleasure through her. Maybe she was enjoying her unnatural development a little <i>too</i> much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so sensitive these last few days. She had outgrown her bras and her nipples were constantly hardening as they rubbed against her cotton shirts. Her hips and butt had swelled a bit, so she was forced to start leaving the buttons on her shorts undone. Their skin-tight fabric rubbed against her down there, making her moist repeatedly during the day. As she imagined this must be something like what horny teenage boys felt like, she almost laughed aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was certain\u2014she needed new clothes. When Rei came, they were totally going shopping. She tucked her hair behind her ear. Maybe tonight, she and Rei would be able to take turns watching the board and finally see what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei pulled up in the driveway, and Natalia sprinted out to see her, enveloping her in a hug the moment she stepped out of her car. As Natalia stepped back, Rei realized that they were eye-to-eye. Gone was the three inch height disparity that she had enjoyed throughout their senior year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Nats!\u201d Rei said, noticing that her height wasn\u2019t the only way in which her friend had grown. \u201cYou look totally amazeballs! Check you out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right? I had a little bit of a late growth spurt. There\u2019s something I have to show you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle? I\u2019d say more than a little!\u201d Rei responded, seeming to ignore Natalia\u2019s last comment. \u201cAnyway, you look mega-hot. I can\u2019t wait to check out the Carbondale club scene with such a sexy wingman\u2026\u201d Rei grinned slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Is</i> there a Carbondale club scene?\u201d Natalia joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotes!\u201d Rei responded. \u201cWell, there\u2019s one anyway, for under 21s.

As her friend came out of the changing room in tight jean shorts and a cropped sweatshirt, Rei gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look snatched, Nats! Your abs are sexiliscious! You totally need to show them off. Here, try this one too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia tried Rei\u2019s next outfit on, modeling it in front of the mirror, unsure if she was comfortable showing this much skin. It was a fire engine red halter with a black, scandalously high-cut tube mini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can think of an wide-eyed emoticon that would be appropriate right about now,\u201d Rei said, walking around her friend in admiration. \u201cYou <i>are</i> wearing this one to the club tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dad will never let me out of the house in this crazy thing!\u201d Natalia protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing he\u2019s not here then,\u201d winked Rei. \u201cI think I saw something like that on Etsy, but I wussed and didn\u2019t get it. You so have the body to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Natalia... you\u2019ve <i>got</i> to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing sexy clothes and crop tops was more Rei\u2019s style then Natalia\u2019s. Natalia was more a jeans and t-shirt girl. Tanks were usually as sexy as she got. She had nice legs and wore a skirt from time to time\u2014especially when she was set on attracting a guy\u2014but for the most part, she was conservative. Being raised by a single dad didn\u2019t lend itself to daring fashion choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a part of her, however, that had always wanted to be daring, to be sexy, to be more like her gorgeous friend.  The more dynamic peaks and valleys of her new profile seemed to encourage her to put them on display. The nightly stimulation seemed to have her body in a simmering concupiscent state these days as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever influenced her, she relented, agreeing to buy the revealing clothes that her friend was foisting on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlinky dresses, tiny shorts, cropped tops. The girls took advantage of seemingly every sale at the mall to add to their collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they wound their way to Victoria\u2019s Secret. Natalia opted to have her measurement taken, finding that she was between a B and a C cup now. On the chance that her growth spurt would continue, she opted for the C. Rei picked up a B for herself while they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove back to Natalia\u2019s grandparents\u2019 house, she told her friend that she had seen some strange things happening at the house, prepping to tell her about the chessboard.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well except for that one night where I didn\u2019t move, and it moved three times, but really it was twice because I moved one of the pieces, and then there are the dreams...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia paused for breath, as her friend gave her an uncomprehending look at her eager babble. When Natalia was unsure how to say something, she tended to just rattle in a stream of consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard a lot of stuff about chess pieces and something about dreams. Dreams sound a lot more interesting than chess pieces, so take it from there,\u201d Rei said expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, my dreams have been rated M for mature each night since the chess match started. I feel all this\u2026 <i>stuff</i>, you know. Then I wake up all hot and bothered.\u201d Natalia\u2019s face went crimson, but she needed to confide in someone about what was happening, and her friend was the best person for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by <i>stuff</i>? Rei asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all things to ask, why did she have to ask about that word! Natalia looked at the floor and flushed an even deeper shade of red. \u201cYou know, like sexy touching and\u2026 filling\u2026 and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d her friend replied in comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he good looking?\u201d Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see him. I just kind of <i>feel</i> him.\u201d Natalia\u2019s face could make a strawberry look pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve got yourself a sexy, body-enhancing, chess-playing ghost, eh?\u201d said Rei. \u201cAnd here I came to see you because I thought you were going to be bored to death!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia, as embarrassed as she was, was happy to have shared these crazy events with someone. The two girls chattered while they dressed and did hair and makeup for the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were immediately granted entrance by the bouncer; hotness test #1 passed. Two guys bought them (non-alchoholic) drinks; hotness test #2 passed. They danced the evening away with said guys; hotness test #3 passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls plopped into bed, exhausted when they got home, all thoughts of chess and ghosts forgotten, while they giggled about the guys they had wrapped around their pretty little fingers at the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Natalia awoke after another night of tantalizing dreams, wiping the moisture from her forehead, and\u2026 other places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap! I totally forgot! I was going to have us take turns watching the chessboard,\u201d she exclaimed as she saw a black rook in a new location on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei sat up, woken by her friend\u2019s outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Rei. My bad.\u201d Natalia told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. Did another piece move?\u201d Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! A rook this time. Hey\u2014did you feel anything, you know, <i>unusual</i> last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean other than this sex god ghost, who\u2026\u201d Rei replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia\u2019s eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m just messing with you, Nats. No, sadly, I didn\u2019t feel a thing,\u201d Rei finished with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bitch!\u201d Natalia laughed, throwing her pillow at Rei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei looked her friend over and said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure those are full Cs now, hot stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia looked down in surprise, then smiled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rei rushed over to her friend\u2019s side as she bucked and moaned in her sleep. Rei shook her awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Natalia said groggily. Then, she remembered her intense, erotic dream and quivered. \u201cDid I just\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Rei with a twinkle in her ebony eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d Natalia pulled her pillow over her head in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a screamer, Nats. You are definitely a screamer,\u201d Rei added with a beatific grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia reached over and flung another pillow in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei caught the pillow and walked over to the chessboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh. Check.\u201d Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!?\u201d said a muffled voice from under the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck! As in, you\u2019re losing your chess match to Ghostly McWonderdick.\u201d Rei sassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to stay awake last night, but it was sooo totally boring that I couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d She added, apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia tried to will her blush away as she removed her pillow from her face and set it to the side. She walked over to the chess set as Rei admired the significantly longer, sexier legs that emerged from Natalia\u2019s oversized t-shirt that she used as pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Look at those glorious gams,\u201d Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour legs are ridiculous! You\u2019ve got to take that t-shirt off, so I can see the rest of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlut!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bantered with her friend, Natalia picked up the white queen. The chess pieces were dramatically different in shape than they had been. They seemed taller and more dynamically shaped. Natalia focused on the board. Rei was right, she was in check. Luckily, she saw the way out, moving her bishop to block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was alone in the bathroom, Natalia did as requested and removed her baggy t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2026 M\u2026 G\u2026\u201d she mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraight out of bed without shower or makeup, and she still looked like something from the photoshopped pages of a Victoria\u2019s Secret catalog. She had surged in beauty last night, well beyond any of her previous enhancements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxuriant waves of blond-streaked brown tresses flowed around her magnificent face. High, arching eyebrows framed huge, dazzling, viridian eyes. Bold ebony lashes flashed as she blinked in surprise. Regal cheekbones, a retrouss\u00e9 nose, and captivating lips graced her elegant visage. Her breasts were voluptuous and full, her stomach ridged and defined, her hips rounded and firm, legs endless and curvaceous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe effected a witheringly sexy come-hither stare at the mirror, and her own sexuality blasted through her. <i>Wow!</i> As Rei would say, she was sexy AF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she showered and put on some of her new, sexy clothes, her beauty was absolutely breathtaking. She was on another whole level. She looked as if she belonged with Hollywood celebrities and Instagram goddesses. She dare not put on any makeup for fear that she would make herself look <i>worse</i>! She walked out of the bathroom and back to their shared room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG, Nats! You are sexy AF!\u201d Rei said, covering her mouth with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Told you!</i> Natalia thought to herself. She thought that she detected a note of desire in her friend\u2019s awestruck expression and tucked a lock of hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stretched longer, sexier limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the chessboard. Black had made another move. The ghost was after her queen. She moved defensively, taking her queen out of immediate danger. She pondered her strategy as Rei began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia decided to check her latest changes as she stepped toward the mirror in their shared bedroom. Her lips curled into a delighted smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia couldn\u2019t stop admiring herself. She was absolutely stunning. She cocked her hip one way, then another. One leg bent, both legs straight. She practiced looking provocative. Then Innocent. She continued to model for herself in the mirror, fascinated with her new looks. If she had needed a C before, she probably needed a DD/E now. Maybe they could go to the mall so that she could try more clothes on her aesthetically exquisite body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few feet away, watching her friend strike one sexy pose after another, Rei was growing more and more turned on. She had never before thought of her friend that way, but she was just so\u2026 <i>sexy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei\u2019s gaze lingered on Natalia\u2019s interminable legs. They swelled with feminine muscle under flawless, smooth skin. The delectable flesh of her legs looked so perfect, almost polished. Rei wondered what it would feel like against hers. She wondered what it would feel like on her lips\u2026 Rei came to her senses with a start! What was she thinking! This was her bestie\u2014she shouldn\u2019t be thinking about Natalia like this! Rei was a beautiful girl. She had her pick of the guys in high school, and Natalia had always been her sidekick. Now, however, Natalia\u2019s beauty had far surpassed her own, reversing their relative positions in the social hierarchy. The thought of it made Rei hot with desire. She had never had interest in girls before, but the combination of her friend passing her as the alpha female of the two as well as the sheer seductive power of Natalia\u2019s increasingly intoxicating beauty sent shudders of surprisingly powerful erotic hunger through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei continued to gaze at her friend as she came back from her shower and began to dress. Natalia put on a tank top and low-rider shorts. The tank top, originally long enough to come to her pants, now left two inches of electrifyingly sexy midriff showing. Rei licked her lips as her eyes drank in the other girl\u2019s ridiculously toned abdomen. Ridges of taut muscle stood in defined relief under svelte, nubile skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei\u2019s eyes continued up the swell of her full, voluptuous breasts. They filled out the tank top in spectacular fashion, perky nipples visible as Natalia didn\u2019t have a bra capable of containing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was captivating and elegant.  Waves of rich, luxurious tresses, now more brilliant blond than vibrant brown tumbled downward. Huge, striking green eyes loomed over lofty, prominent cheekbones, framed by long, bold lashes. Scarlet lips, full and pillowy consummated her elegant, glamorous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia was a work of art\u2014a masterpiece.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I definitely need some new bras. Probably some new shorts too. These are getting pretty tight in the hips.\u201d Natalia wiggled her flaring hips, the fabric of her shorts straining to contain them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia felt confident and sexy as she walked out of the Victoria\u2019s Secret fitting room to show her friend her new DDs. Rei and the sales girl looked on in awe as Natalia\u2019s breathtaking body looked significantly better than those of the world\u2019s hottest models whose posters adorned the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia examined herself in the mirror. The bra was just a little tight, she thought. She should probably get some extra DDDs, just in case she needed them tomorrow. She noticed the shop girl and Rei staring at her wide-eyed in the mirror\u2019s reflection. She grinned. Being drop-dead gorgeous was really starting to be fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext stop, the hair salon, so that she could have her amazing locks looking as amazing as the rest of her. She tucked her hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls walked out of the mall, Natalia was the one doing most of the talking, a role-reversal from their typical banter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat stylist did such a great job with my hair! And I really like the French-tip manicure that we both got at the nail place. I\u2019ve never had my brows threaded before, either. They did an amazing job!\u201d Natalia gushed about their various stops at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotes,\u201d replied Rei, lost in thought admiring her friend\u2019s improvements on perfection. \u201cYou look\u2026 irresistible, Nats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia beamed, never having seen her friend awestruck before today. She was pleased that she had been the one to do it to her. She had to admit, she <i>did</i> look pretty incredible. She couldn\u2019t wait to try that new curve-hugging bodycon dress their next time at the club. She was certain the guys would be drooling over her in that thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When they arrived home, Natalia rattled on about how excited she was about her improvements, her new clothes, her anticipation of their next trip to the club, and how she was looking forward to heading to college in the fall even more now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei didn\u2019t say much. Her eyes kept drifting to Natalia\u2019s body, which was creating new, suggestive feelings in her. She didn\u2019t know what to make of them or whether she should act on them. Luckily, Natalia was too bubbly to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as Rei tried to keep watch on the chessboard, Natalia seemed to be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rei\u2019s eyes began to slowly close involuntarily, she felt Natalia roll over, pressing up next to her in their shared bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood lord, was her friend naked under the sheets?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia\u2019s large bare breasts pressed into her arm. Her bare hips touched the side of Rei\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei\u2019s eyes went wide. She was suddenly wide awake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rei was about to say something, Natalia cut her off with luscious lips and probing tongue. Rei stiffened and thought about pushing her friend away. But the sensation of her friend\u2019s perfect body, perfect lips, melted the thought in flames of arousal. As her friends lips drifted lower and lower, all remaining thought gave way to molten desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning sunlight began to stream through the window, Natalia awoke naked, with Rei in her arms. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Natalia said out loud.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tried to think back to what had happened last night. She had fallen asleep. Had she had another erotic dream? Yes, she had! I wasn\u2019t with the ghost\u2026 is was with\u2026 Oh My God! She had slept with her best friend in her dream. But was it just a dream? Their naked bodies and Rei\u2019s morning kiss seemed to indicate otherwise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just\u2026 I thought\u2026\u201d Rei started, a lump forming in her throat, surprised and hurt by Natalia\u2019s reaction. She felt helpless against her rising arousal as she looked at her ever-more-gorgeous friend\u2019s beyond-stunning face. Her eyes grew glassy as tears formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA range of emotions swirled through Natalia\u2019s perfectly formed chest. She felt horrified that she had slept with her bestie without even intending to. She felt bad for her friend, who was clearly hurt by her reaction this morning. She felt\u2026 aroused that she had managed to seduce her friend, who had never given the slightest hint that she had ever been attracted to women before. Natalia didn\u2019t know what to do. She was completely unprepared for this situation and completely at a loss for words and actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at Natalia\u2019s conflicted expression, tears began to stream down Rei\u2019s cheeks. Rei\u2019s hurt turned to anger as her desire for Natalia continued to grow. She was just so <i>achingly</i> beautiful. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who kissed me, Natalia! I just\u2026 I mean\u2026 I couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d her words began to fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did? I\u2026 think I was dreaming, Rei. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 you know.\u201d Natalia struggled for words to explain what had happened to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!\u201d said Rei, in frustration. She was beginning to understand what had happened. Natalia hadn\u2019t meant to do what she did. She was just having one of those erotic dreams again, and Rei was in the same bed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei got out of bed and ran to the bathroom, locking the door behind her. She began to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia lay back in the bed, hands to her head. How had things gone so wrong so quickly! She had been enjoying her tremendous beauty and her friend Rei\u2019s company. How had this happened! She felt terrible and guilty. Though she hadn\u2019t meant to, she clearly had put her best friend through an emotional roller coaster. What should she do now? Her friend seemed to have romantic feelings toward her now. Did she feel the same toward Rei? She didn\u2019t know. She needed to sort things out. For now, she set her feelings aside. She brushed stray strands of hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia arose from the bed to stand naked before the mirror. She didn\u2019t feel the same joy or delight today, with the Rei situation weighing heavily on her mind. However, she did notice in a clinical way the massive improvements to her beauty overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfection had become \u00fcber-perfection. Her face was beyond compare. Her breasts, matchless paragons of flesh. Her waist and hips, the quintessence of athletic flawlessness. Her spellbinding ass was heart-stopping and unsurpassable. Her legs, ideal examples of feminine perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference in beauty between her and the supermodels on the lingerie posters from yesterday was now as vast as the difference between those models and their overweight grandmothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had never been a more perfect beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is this happening?\u201d she said out loud, awed by her own reflection. The question pushed her thoughts to the chessboard. Black had put her in check again. There was one move available to her, so she took it. It was not looking like she was going to win this game, but she wasn\u2019t certain what would happen if she did. Examining the pieces, they were exquisite. Curved and polished, she had never seen craftsmanship on this level before. They were far better than they had been at the start of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to ask Babushka if she knew anything about the chessboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia, in form-fitting workout clothes, approached her grandmother, who she had barely seen since Rei had arrived. Her grandmother\u2019s eyes went wide in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatalia? What happened to you? You look so different!\u201d Babushka asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welled in Natalia\u2019s eyes. She relayed the whole story to her grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabushka remained silent for a long while when she finished. Natalia was about to ask her for her thoughts, when she suddenly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike mother, like daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia wasn\u2019t sure what she had been expecting her grandmother to say, but it certainly hadn\u2019t been that!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know that I shouldn\u2019t have, but in my age, I had forgotten it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia waited for her to continue, tucking a lock of gorgeous blond hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you were a baby, your mother would bring you here, to our house. One day, she moved a piece on the board. Strange things started to happen to her. One day, she just disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabushka stared out the window as she spoke, a distant look in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until years later that I put things together. The chess match had to be related to her disappearance. I had the chessboard examined by an expert, and he traced it back to a Khlyst owner. This owner said it had belonged to Rasputin himself. Apparently, Rasputin had been involved with the Khlysts. His Khlyst cell had been obsessed with beauty and its association with the divine. The people in the cell believed that Rasputin could heal their physical defects, as he did for the tsar\u2019s family, but to make them more beautiful, not just more healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I was never sure where your mother went. I didn\u2019t know if the spirit of the chessboard had taken her over and she left, or if she became part of it. I never knew. I thought about destroying the thing\u2026 but what if your mother was trapped inside? I searched for someone who could tell me, but I never found someone. Eventually, I gave up and accepted that my daughter was lost to me, one way or the other. I thought that I had made my peace with the outcome, though I always pray for your mother to be returned to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, however, I am faced with the same situation again! It is my punishment for never fully dealing with it the first time, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia\u2019s grandmother looked shaken now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to find someone who can help us! What about someone at SIU?\u201d Natalia suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, child. I\u2019m willing to try anything. Perhaps you will succeed where I failed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, then. Let\u2019s go,\u201d said Natalia. She let a puffy-eyed Rei know that she was leaving for a bit. She picked up the chessboard, taking care not to disturb the pieces, and got in the car with her grandmother. She googled Russian history professors at the university, texted herself his office number and building, and they headed out to meet him.\u2003<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hadn\u2019t entered a strange and wonderful new relationship with her best friend as she thought she had last night. She was just a body that happened to be in the bed while her friend was having a sex dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t ever seem to have good luck with guys, so why should women be any different. Rei didn\u2019t even know who she was any more. She couldn\u2019t believe how this trip had turned out! She began to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rei noticed that Natalia\u2019s grandfather was standing in the doorway, and she tried to gather herself. He scanned around the room and was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was strange</i>, Reilly thought, as she struggled to gain control over her emotions. She walked out of the room to see what he had been looking for. <i>He probably just wants to know where Natalia went,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia and her grandmother knocked on Professor Turgenev\u2019s door at SIU. Even in the conservative clothes she had borrowed from her grandmother, Natalia\u2019s spectacular beauty took the man aback, his attraction to her instant and obvious. However, as his eyes turned to her grandmother, the professor seemed to be spurred back to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the professor ushered them into his office, Natalia set the chessboard down on his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia relayed the tale, and the professor seemed to pay particular attention to her lips as she spoke. She hoped he was actually listening! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished, he seemed skeptical. Granted, it did seem outlandish, but she could prove at least one aspect of it. She pulled out her phone and showed him a selfie that she took two weeks ago. That was me two weeks ago, Dr. Turgenev. And look at me now. She indicated her impressive form, filling out her grandmother\u2019s stodgy clothes in ways never anticipated by their designer. <i>Oh my gosh, </i> thought Natalia, as she watched him stare at her impressive charms yet again, <i>now I see why they say that beauty is a curse!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp here, professor,\u201d Natalia said, pointing to her breathtakingly gorgeous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes,\u201d he said sheepishly, cheeks flushing. This girl was just <i>that</i> attractive. He had never seen anything like it. He struggled to get his brain functioning again... If those photos were really from two weeks ago, her story just might be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have studied the Khlyst sect in some detail, and I\u2019m aware of the rumors from the time period that Rasputin was a member of the sect, but most scholars believe that Rasputin\u2019s so-called powers of healing were actually\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia cleared her throat, pointing at the picture on the phone, then at her face. \u201cI\u2019ve got some fairly compelling evidence that the rumors of Rasputin\u2019s powers might be legit here, doc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint taken,\u201d said the professor. \u201cThere is actually a Khlyst sect member locally here in Carbondale that I interviewed for my book a few years back. He might be a good person to talk to about this. He might at least know the oral history of this chessboard from within the cult. I can\u2019t remember his name, but let me check\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the professor looked pleased. Apparently, he had found the name that he\u2019d been looking for. \u201cHis name was Boris Lebedev,\u201d the professor said, an expression of victory on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drained from Natalia\u2019s exquisitely beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris Lebedev was Natalia\u2019s grandfather.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I noticed she was playing a game of chess with you, but I noticed that the chessboard was gone from your room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei, unsure how much she should say, simply said, \u201cI think that she put the board somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, okay.

We don\u2019t need anything more,\u201d the gorgeous girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way back to the car, Babushka asked her granddaughter, \u201cWhat does all of this mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia sighed, debating what she should say to her grandmother. She decided to tell her the full truth of her suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabushka, Dedushka is a member of the Khlyst sect. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s coincidence that the Rasputin chessboard is in your house. I think that he wanted it there. You told me that you thought it had something to do with mom\u2019s disappearance. I was reading about the Khlyst on our way here. Each Khlyst cell has two leaders, a \u201cChrist\u201d and a \u201cMother of God\u201d. When Rasputin died, he was believed to be the \u201cChrist\u201d of that cell. I don\u2019t know who the mother is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe craziest thing is that Rasputin was believed to be working on a different sort of everlasting life for two leaders of his cell. He was working on capturing souls, I guess. I\u2019m wondering if either he or the mother of that sect was able to trap their soul inside the chessboard. Maybe the soul in the chessboard takes over the soul of the other player if they win the match?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe mom ran away to escape that from happening to her?\u201d said Natalia, questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that would mean\u2026 that your soul depends on the outcome of this chess match?\u201d asked Babushka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Natalia. \u201cBut I\u2019m certain that Dedushka knows something about the chessboard. And we\u2019re going to find out exactly what it is.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She went to find her grandfather, but found Rei first. Rei noticed the intense look on her friend's beautiful face and frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Nats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Dedushka. I think that he's the one who's been moving the pieces on the chessboard every night. I think that the chessboard might be a tool to steal people's souls.

Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what do we do?\" Rei asked, breathing in to steel herself in anticipation of the coming conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We find Dedushka,\" Natalia said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls searched the house in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came back to the kitchen... and Dedushka was there! He had re-placed every piece on the chessboard, configuring it in exactly the same way that it had been when Natalia had taken it back to the professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to make the final move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia and Rei sprung into action, Natalia grabbing one arm and Rei the other, their momentum carrying all three into the wall. Each girl held one of the old man's arms, using both hands to press arm to wall, preventing him from achieving the checkmate that could take Natalia's soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls struggled to hold the older man in place, Natalia heard familiar voices coming from the hallway toward the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, are you sure that we should give Rasputin this body? She will be powerful, very powerful.\" Natalia knew that voice! Where had she heard it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabushka walked into the kitchen with the professor from SIU! It had been the professor's voice! But why had he called Babushka mother? She certainly wasn't his birth mother. It had to be... that Babushka was the other of the two leaders of the Khlyst cell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia gasped as realization dawned. Her grandfather and grandmother were the two leaders of a Khlyst cell! A cell that included Dr. Turgenev. And they were trying to give her body to someone else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia's mother walked in behind them, carrying a dagger. Natalia's heart dropped through the floor, and she relaxed her grip as shock washed over her. Her grandfather used Natalia's distraction to struggle free. He used his free hand to pull Rei away, and pushed her into Natalia's mother, back first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia's mother put one arm around the girl's stomach and drew the dagger around her under her far ear. In one swift motion, she sliced across Rei's throat. Rei gurgled for a moment, eyes wide and locked on Natalia's horrified face before dropping to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabushka walked to the table and made the final move. Checkmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia froze in fear. She felt... strange. Floating. She closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natalia opened her eyes again, she began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't tuck her hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I love how each brings out a different curve, a different line of my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love trying on something new for the first time. I love slipping into something warm and comfortable. I love the excitement and anticipation of dressing for a formal event. I love pushing my breasts into a tight sports bra and sliding yoga pants over my hips, knowing I look cute for my workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not the prettiest girl in the world, but I keep my twenty-five-year-old body fit, and I\u2019ve been called cute. I\u2019ve had a boyfriend or two that called me beautiful, but that\u2019s on the checklist of boyfriend job responsibilities, so it doesn\u2019t really count. Besides, those boyfriends left me for someone prettier. Or sexier. Or blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings me back to why I\u2019m thinking about clothes. I\u2019m going to this singles event tomorrow night, and I need something to wear. I want to feel desired. I want to feel desirable. I need the perfect outfit. Something different. Something amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked through rack after rack of clothes at one department store after another. Nothing was quite <i>right</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, I walked through the mall trying to think of another store to try, when a bright red dress in the window of a strange little consignment shop caught my eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t normally go for used clothes or vintage stuff. The thought of wearing something that others may have worn didn\u2019t appeal to me. But this dress\u2026 there was something about it. It was a mini halter dress with a high hemline and open back. It was a solid red color, but it had intricate stitching that gave it an elegant and unique texture upon closer examination. The stitching was exquisite and in perfect condition. It was designed to show off my best features\u2014toned arms, legs, and back--and cover my worst\u2014small breasts and narrow hips. It was the perfect dress for my body. It was the dress that I wanted. I knew it from the moment I saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the store to find a hunched, dwarfish old woman minding the shop. She gave me an odd, overbroad, predatory smile as I entered that didn\u2019t fit her grandmotherly appearance whatsoever. It totally gave me the creeps. Ordinarily, I probably would have hustled out of the shop at that moment\u2026 but I <i>had to have that dress.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said expectantly, continuing to wear that disturbing, overly broad grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind if I tried on that dress? The red one in the display?\u201d I pointed it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, dear,\u201d she said, still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuffled slowly over to the display and removed the dress from the mannequin, bringing it to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took it from her as she continued to smile her hideous smile. I walked to the back, the hair on the back of my neck sending warning shivers down my spine as I had absolutely no doubt she was continuing to watch me with that eerie grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to put the spooky old woman out of my mind while I tried the dress on. I walked out of the changing room and over to the floor-length mirror as I clasped the straps behind my neck. I swayed from side to side, turned slightly, then finally did a pirouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress fit as if it had been tailored to my body. I was reasonably sure that I had never looked so good in anything before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back to the changing room and slipped my jeans, t-shirt, and hoodie back on. I brought the dress to the strange shopkeeper. She continued her smile\u2014how I wanted to tell her to stop smiling!\u2014but I was almost out of there anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can have that one for free, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to do me a favor sometime if I call on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much, but I would rather just pay for it, and\u2026\u201d I said, not wanting to ever see this freaky lady again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, dear. Now have a nice day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she shuffled to the back and was gone. She had never asked for my phone number, email, or even my name. It seemed unlikely that she was ever going to call in that favor. So I took the dress, walked out of the shop, thanked the Lord that I was rid of that creepy lady, and went home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pattern of the solid-colored fabric was mesmerizing and gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived at the mixer five minutes late, noticing several pairs of eyes turning in my direction.

We were all in this dating scenario together, no reason to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally wrapped up our conversation and moved on to other clusters of people. Another man approached. This one was fit, not particularly handsome, but a good body impressed me more than an attractive face. It showed effort and willpower\u2014something about the person. A nice face just showed good genes. I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked me over as he approached, and I felt the sensation under the dress again. It didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable, and it didn\u2019t feel good. It was just... distracting. I fought the urge to look down at myself. The man must have liked what he saw as he checked me out, as he smiled broadly. The sensation intensified to the point where I needed a bit of privacy to see what was going on. I apologized and excused myself to the restroom for a brief moment. I was interested in this guy, so hopefully he waited for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the restroom straight to the mirror, fidgeting under the dress. My eyes widened.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I felt my slender stomach, tracing lines of definition through the fabric that I was certain hadn't been there before. Everything that the dress covered seemed to have improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a delighted giggle before covering my lips with my fingers. What was going on here? Was it the dress that was changing me? I thought back to the way it had captured my attention, to the creepy old lady... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided that I was going to have to have to pay Creepy Grandma another visit. First, however, I needed to test out my new charms on the man I'd set my sights on at the mixer. I smiled and walked out of the bathroom with a confidence I hadn't felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding up to him, I let my newfound confidence fuel my flirtatious side. Maybe it was my confidence, maybe my larger chest, but his roaming gaze along my body lit his eyes with hungry fire. His eyes darted sideways before they came to mine. He didn't know I noticed, but I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave him my sultriest eyes, my sexiest smile, and I could see its impact in his face, in his eyes. This felt good, a game that I now felt ready to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to get out of here? I think that I've found what I'm looking for here,\" I said. Whoa! Had I just been that forward? Was the dress influencing my mind as well as my body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and seemed to consider. It didn't take him long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes. Coffee?\" he said. I was pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as it comes with dessert...\" I said with a wink. Oh. My. God. Where was this coming from? This so wasn't me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind? I could go for dessert...\" his response was safe. He wasn't sure what I was saying, and he probably didn't want to offend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked toward the coffee shop, and I'm not sure what came over me. I pulled his strong body toward mine and kissed him. Hard. Passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel him harden against my abdomen. I smiled into the kiss as I pushed him against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles of his hard back and firm butt hit brick as my hands and lips roamed. He tasted like baked brie, sweet, savory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why was I doing this?</i> I thought, suddenly alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I stopped thinking and nipped his lower lip with my teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop!</i> I said, in conflict with myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I pulled back, leaving him gasping for breath. I had clearly overwhelmed him. I had clearly overwhelmed me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who was I becoming?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned by the thought, I grew suddenly demure. I smiled and mumbled an apology, then left, hustling away in the dark rainy night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI definitely needed to see Creepy Grandma. Like NOW.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My smirk quickly turned to a frown, however, as I thought, <i>that's not me! I should be freaking out about that dress changing my body, not feeling satisfied and sexy. What is </i>wrong <i>with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body, improved as it was, was no different than it had been when I had taken off the dress last night. The changes must only happen while wearing it then. That was good. It gave me some control over things. I wondered if it would work again, tempted by my new, daring side... but I resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the dress changing my personality too? That was a really concerning thought. Whatever the benefits of wearing the dress were to my body, I certainly didn't want it affecting who I was. I certainly hadn't been myself last night at the mixer. I had been far more forward and daring than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to put that thought out of my mind as I looked at my phone to find out when the mall opened. I would get answers soon enough when I had a chance to speak to Creepy Grandma again. The mall opened at 10:00 AM. Perfect! I went to the gym for my morning workout, got my morning latte, then headed to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked into the shop, I didn\u2019t see Creepy Grandma. I did, however, see a skimpy black getup on the mannequin in the window where the dress I had purchased was previously displayed. It looked like something a figure skater might wear, with a form-fitting bodysuit look for the front of the torso, an open back, and a short skater skirt. The only thing that was a bit different was the black and silver shield on the front. I had never seen anything quite like it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rang the bell at the desk, hoping that it would bring out Creepy Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd waited some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rang the bell again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreepy Grandma didn\u2019t appear, but a green mist began to swirl around me. I tried to turn and leave the shop, but I seemed to be frozen in place. I frantically looked from side to side, as my eyes were the only things that I seemed to be able to move. All that I saw, however, was green mist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world began to spin, faster and faster. Until the world went black.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I awoke, I found myself in complete darkness, limbs spread out, chained to a cement wall. I had cold iron cuffs on each wrist and ankle that were attaching me to the wall. My back was bare, pressed to the frigid cement, and I began to shiver immediately after regaining consciousness.  I could feel that I was wearing clothing however, but not my sweater and jeans from when I had been in the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad someone changed me? Into what? Why? Bare back, covered front\u2026 Was I in that figure skater outfit from the display in the shop? It certainly fit the profile of whatever I was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of some stranger changing my clothes was odd and more than a little disturbing. I didn\u2019t want to dwell on that right now, however. I had to figure out how I was going to escape this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe these chains were old? I pulled my right hand out from the wall with all my might. I felt a warm strength pour into the arm as I pulled, but it wasn\u2019t enough. The cuff wasn\u2019t going to break. If it was old, it was still sturdy enough to hold me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried the other arm and each leg. Same thing. Warmth, strength, no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I heard a clang. Something from the darkness behind me, above me, and to my left. There must be a stairwell over there somewhere? I tried to reimagine the room\u2019s layout now that I had heard a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard footsteps descending, slowly, methodically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to see the slightest bit of light. It was warm, orange, flickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light grew brighter as the steps approached, until finally, I could see myself in the faint flickers. I was indeed wearing the skater outfit from the shop. My breasts seemed even larger than before, blocking my view of the rest of my body. Affixed to the wall, I couldn\u2019t crane my neck forward far enough to see over my now significant swells. As I looked to each side, I noticed that my arms were more toned and defined, the flickers sending shadows dancing along the swells and valleys of their contours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the owner of the footsteps came into my view. It was Creepy Grandma, looking all the creepier with the flickers of the candle she held before her fluttering over her overly wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. You\u2019re awake, my dear. I\u2019m glad. Come to see me when you let yourself out,\u201d she said in a gravelly voice. Then, she began to head back to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! That\u2019s it! I can\u2019t exactly let myself out with these chains on!\u201d I said, trying to hide the desperation and anxiety in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but she looked at me intently. She gave me the impression of a raven, quietly intense, studying. Then, she turned and began a slow walk up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo no water? Food? You\u2019re just going to leave me here?\u201d I said, no longer caring if I sounded desperate. I <i>was</i> becoming desperate! I thought that the woman was going to do something. Tell me something. Something. <i>Anything</i>! But she just left me here. For no apparent reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the fuck was this? What did she want from me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should never have come back to the shop. After that first trip, I should have known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to that first trip, I remembered the favor that I owed the lady for the dress. Was this what she considered a <i>favor?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a fucking pyscho!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was becoming angry now. Furious. I couldn\u2019t remember ever feeling so <i>mad</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith rage giving me energy, I tried once more to pull my arm from the wall. This time it moved. Ever so slightly. I could feel the iron cuff pulling out from the wall. It began to bend, creaking. Finally, a snap! My right arm was free! With one side free, I had much more leverage. I used my powerful core muscles to twist as I pulled as hard as I could with my left arm. I heard a ping and the clang of metal pieces on the ground. My left was free now too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that I realized I should have freed my legs first. With nothing holding my upper half to the wall, I began to fall face-first toward the ground. My ankles pressed against the front of their cuffs as I went down hard. The cuffs seemed to bend under the force, until they popped open, allowing me to fall the rest of the way to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my hands hit the stone floor, it wasn\u2019t feeling as cold now. My skin was feeling insulated from the cold somehow. As I rose to my feet, I already knew my next course of action. I was going to show that old lady exactly what I thought of her <i>favor</i>. I felt my lips twist into a sneer as I began to ascent the steps that Creepy Grandma had traveled a moment before.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw her across the room, smiling her wicked smile as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to march across the large room to give her a piece of my mind, you know, for the whole chaining to the wall in the dark dungeon below her house thing, when I saw a large form step between us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had I not noticed this guy before? He bulged with muscle, its striations visible under his tight suit. <i>Why did superheroes and supervillains always wear tight clothes?</i> I mused momentarily. I should come out with a line of fashionwear focused on invulnerable baggy jeans and chunky sweaters. I could totally own the loose-fit superhero outfit market!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I should probably be more worried about the situation at hand right now, so I went back to my original thought about noticing the guy. I suppose I had been too focused on Creepy Grandma to look around at the rest of the room. I did now. Luckily, there weren't any other people in the room besides the three of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at the man. I recognized him. He was Vile Vern, one of the more powerful supervillains in the city!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh! Even with my new strength, I doubted I was in his league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could figure out what to do next, he was on me, an amused Grandma looking on in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVile Vern grabbed me by my black skater outfit and let loose with a punch to my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll air left my lungs, and pain exploded from my abs. I fell back, pulling him off balance and onto me due to his grip on my clothes. I felt like cursing, but I couldn't manage it with the lack of air in the lungs issue. At least I could mentally curse, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck! That hurt!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. That felt better. It wasn't better for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVern's huge body crashed on top of mine, creating another whoosh of air from my lungs just as I was beginning to refill them from his punch! Apparently I wasn't invulnerable, because the combination of the two <i>really hurt!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do, I duplicated a move that I had watched a number of times in MMA fights. I wrapped my legs around his lower back. That's when I realized that MMA fights didn't usually involve a man and a woman. This had the look of something distinctly more sexual... The thought didn't last long, however, because I saw my legs. The were so long, so smooth, so sexy. I had always had pretty good legs, but now they were amazing! I guess that this latest Creepy Grandma outfit hadn't just made me stronger, it had improved my body just as the first had. Where was a mirror when you needed one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I felt a blow to my head. Oh yeah, fight. Why was my mind always wandering when I should be focused on not getting my ass kicked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis blow hadn't hurt as much as the one to my stomach. Thank goodness for my hard head! I reached out to grab his large hands in my smaller ones, in an attempt to prevent him from landing any other blows. He pulled out of one hand--barely, but when he tried to do the same and his other arm out of my grasp, he didn't seem to be able to. Was I growing stronger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his moment of surprise, I reached out and grabbed his free hand with my right again, and this time he couldn't pull free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was growing stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tightened the grip of my legs on his lower back, pulling him into me. His hard chest pressed against my breasts... which I now noticed were larger. Yay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't get distracted by your sexier parts now, Elaine!</i> I chastised myself. <i>You've got a fight to win here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tightened my legs even harder and Vern grimaced in pain. <i>I was hurting him! I was actually hurting him!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, with him pressed against me and his arms in mine, in a decidedly unromantic lover's embrace, I couldn't really hurt him. Or him me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining confidence in my growing strength, I decided to push him off me. Using my long legs and toned arms, I pushed up and outward. Vern went flying, crashing into the corner of the room where ceiling met wall, then slamming down into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose to my feet as he began to slowly rise to his. I didn't want to give up my momentary advantage, however, so I walked over to him and kicked him in the face, my toe catching his chin. He flipped upright and smashed against the wall a few feet away, half-caving it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spared a quick glance in Creepy Grandma's direction, and she was smiling even more broadly than usual. I shivered at the sight of her distended cheeks. This lady was just so incredibly hideous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVern had recovered while I was distracted with Grandma and her awful smile, and he launched a punch in my direction. Luckily, either he was slowing down, or I was moving faster, because I dodged out of the way before it hit me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed up with a punch from the other hand. This time, I put my hand up to block it and did, knocking it away without too much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sent another right hand toward me, really slow this time--almost as if he were moving through water. I grabbed his large hand in my smaller one, stopping it cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had seen this part before in the movies, so I knew what to do. I squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, all it seemed to do was cause him a grunt of pain. I doubled down on my effort, feeling strength pouring into my arm and hand. His fingers seemed to bow under the pressure, until they finally snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snap* *Crackle* *Pop*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the Rice Krispies slogan but less delicious, more gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face contorted in pain as I released it, his fingers bent at odd angles, obviously broken. I threw an uppercut to his jaw before he even knew what hit him, and he flew into the ceiling before landing on the floor in a crumpled heap. Wood, plaster and other detritus landing on top of him as he lay there, unmoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn! I was pretty strong now apparently. I tried to be concerned for Vern, but I couldn't seem to care about him. All I felt was satisfaction at having overpowered the man. My lips curled into a smile involuntarily, and I looked over to Creepy Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why did she give me these clothes? Did she want to make me stronger? Does Vile Vern work for her? Maybe I should have thought to ask him some questions before I kicked him? Oh well... she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the real question was why I didn't think twice about kicking him in the face, and why I felt only satisfaction, no guilt or remorse about it. Was I becoming evil? I felt as if the thought should bother me. It didn't. All that was really bothering me is why the old lady didn't seem to have a single mirror in this place, so that I could get a look at my new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I debated whether to leave or wait for Vile Vern to awaken, I heard a soft thump outside the front door. Wow! Maybe my hearing was improving too. Then, I looked <i>through</i> the door. I'm not quite sure how I did it, and I didn't dwell on the fact that I had for long, because I was too distracted with what I was actually seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Megaman</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman and his cousin, Megagirl, were the strongest, most powerful superheroes in Megatown. And probably in the world. I couldn't help but lick my lips, as I looked through his costume with my x-ray eyes. Look at that ridiculous chest... those abs of steel. Vile Vern was muscular, but this man? He was chiseled to perfection. Yummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes roamed his acres of tanned, carved muscles then began to go lower to check out his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then he was right in front of me. In, like, an instant. <i>Shit!</i> Had he caught me checking him out? Well, if he had, at least he would know I was interested...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put on a sexy smile and cocked my hip. Where was this coming from? The dress? Had that dress permanently changed my personality to make me a sexy little delicious minx who could wrap any man around... STOP IT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really needed to stop thinking these thoughts! I was in control. I was in control... of my sexy legs that went on for days, and my...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nARG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman seemed confused as he looked at me. Finally, he spoke, giving me something to think about other than SEX!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello, miss. Thank you for taking care of Vile Vern here. I've been looking for him for a while now,\" he said with a smile before his expression turned serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you don't mind my asking, why are you in Megagirl's costume from the time she turned evil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. Was I evil now? Was he here for me? <i>Shit!</i> Wait, though. All I had done was knock out a supervillain. That wasn't so bad, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's funny that you should ask that. You see, a few days ago I got this dress from this weird, creepy old lady in the mall, and I wore it to a singles mixer, but I noticed that it made me hotter, with bigger breasts and stuff. So I went back to find the old lady, but this lady knocked me unconscious somehow and dressed me up in this thing, then chained me to the wall of her dungeon downstairs. Then, I somehow started to get superpowers, and I broke through the chains in the dungeon. Then, I came upstairs, and this Vern dude tried to kill me! So it's really not my fault, you see. I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and now that I think about it, it is really creeping me out that the old lady must have seen me naked getting me out of my other clothes and into this costume. But you probably don't care about that part, and I probably didn't really need to point it out, but there you have it. That's how I got into this evil Megagirl costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman stared at me in awe. I do tend to ramble when I'm nervous. Or in trouble. Or in front of a hot guy. And when all three are happening... <i>and</i> I have superbreath? Well, I guess you just saw what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he spoke. \"Well, miss, it sounds as if you've been through a lot today. It might be best to change out of that costume, though, before someone thinks that you're evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And did you say you had superpowers now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said. Limiting myself to a single word answer now, so that I didn't babble again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I test them a bit?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bit my lower lip and batted my eyelashes. \"You can test my body however you'd like, any time you'd like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God!\" Had I just said that to Megaman? I flushed with embarrassment, unable to control my seductive side around someone I was attracted to, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay. Ah, thank you,\" Megaman said, clearly a little embarrassed at the situation himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took my hand in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, grip my hand as hard as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did. I squeezed with everything I had. His hand turned a little purple, but his grip still felt firm on mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Lord! You're almost as strong as I am--probably on par with Megagirl! You say you never had superpowers until this old woman dressed you in that costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Never!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I need to see what's happening here and consult with the Megatown DEO branch. Let me take you home, so you can change out of that outfit. I need to take it with me to be examined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, do you mind if I try to fly back on my own? Maybe you could give me some pointers or something, but I've always wanted to fly. I thought that since I had all of Megagirl's other powers, I might...\" I trailed off, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means...\" Megaman said. \"I always like to give a little hop at takeoff, like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my ex-ray vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd OMG, he was huge--his, package, um, packaged up rather nicely in its spandex cocoon as it bounced with his hop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? I couldn't help it... and I was evil-ish now, remember? And a sex fiend, thanks to the dress. It's not my fault!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked outside to try out what he had shown me... Not that! The flying thing! Get your mind out of the gutter! Not <i>that</i> evil. Yet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman rose up to meet me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice work!\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d I said coyly, absently wondering what those huge, hard muscles of his would feel like against my...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what have we here?\u201d Said another voice from behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spun and saw Megagirl hovering in space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMegagirl, I... it\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d I said, feeling momentarily guilty for ogling her brother or cousin or whatever. Then, I realized that I hadn\u2019t actually said or done anything, so I didn\u2019t need to feel guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise. Though I\u2019m curious why you are wearing my old evil-Megagirl costume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, well, it\u2019s a long story...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was forced to wear it by some sort of evil old woman,\u201d Megaman interrupted, probably to avoid another crazy run-on story gush by yours truly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForced? By an old woman?\u201d Said Megagirl, incredulously. \u201cHow did she even have this outfit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood question,\u201d said Megaman. \u201cAnd I intend to find out the answer...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure whether to be grateful to Creepy Grandma or not. She had somehow turned me into a sexy superheroine, but she also seemed to be changing my personality either with these clothes or via some other mechanism. I tried to decide whether I liked the changes. I was definitely becoming bolder, more aggressive. I didn\u2019t necessarily mind that. I was becoming less restrained, less concerned about doing whatever I pleased. Was <i>that</i> a good thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one was a bit tougher to answer. On one hand, it was freeing. It felt good, caring less about everyone else. I could simply do what I wanted, consequences be damned. On the other hand, what about others? Shouldn\u2019t I wanted to do right by others? Shouldn\u2019t I want good things for others more than for myself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conflicting thoughts warred within me. Each had its appeal. I decided that I should pay another visit to Creepy Grandma to learn more about what was going on. Maybe that would help me define my course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megaman and Megagirl discussed what had happened to me, I slipped away, floating slowly away before accelerating to maximum speed back to the shop at the mall, the only other place I knew to find her. The two superheroes didn\u2019t seem to be following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed outside the mall, then made my way to the shop.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Creepy Grandma was standing at the counter, freakish smile and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to the counter, set both forearms on it, and leaned forward until my face was less than a foot from the old woman\u2019s. I would never have been so bold to do that with the evil, creepy old hag before the changes in my personality, but, well, that was then. This was now. And I needed some answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, lady, I need you to tell me what\u2019s going on. Why are you doing this to me? Are you putting some sort of spell on the clothes? Are they changing my personality? Talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman began to laugh. I was confident in my new strength, my new abilities, but her raspy gasps of delight were really making me feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could blink\u2014which is now pretty damn fast\u2014Creepy Grandma\u2019s hands shot out and clamped these silver bracelets around my wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked down to examine the new hardware on my wrists, her hands shot out again, wrapping a silver choker around my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was this old hag so fast?! I mean, I was nearly as fast as Megaman! This lady was faster than that? How was that possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to feel strange. My skin tingled. My hair raised. A sensation of power began to spread from my wrists and neck. Was I becoming even more powerful? Was it something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to be concerned, but it was becoming increasingly difficult. The feeling of power seemed to be washing my worries away. I felt as if I were floating in darkness. I felt the warm arousal of wickedness melting my goodness away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know how else to describe it, the inherent goodness that my parents instilled in me through childhood felt charred, burning away by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so lost in the mixture of heady, complementary sensations\u2014power and amorality\u2014that I didn\u2019t even notice that Creepy Grandma was no longer in front of me. She had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lady was seriously elusive. I had come to get answers, armed with powers nearly a match for Megaman\u2019s, and I had managed to get exactly none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked around, a blue and red figure walked into the shop. It was Megagirl. Gorgeous, blond, sexy Megagirl. I licked my lips as I felt a strong attraction to the wholesome heroine. Was I into girls now too? Shit! That was new!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose from my lean over the counter and walked slowly toward her. She must have seen something in how I now looked because her eyes widened slightly, and she tensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI strolled casually her way, and she eyed my new choker and bracelets with suspicion. I felt myself smile, my chin moving down slightly. My eyes stayed on hers. As I approached, I saw Megagirl\u2019s muscles prepare for action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it that she was sensing that told her to prepare for action? Was it simply my approach? Now that I thought about it, I wondered why I was approaching. Couldn\u2019t I have spoken to her from the counter? But I hadn\u2019t spoken, had I? I wondered what I was doing. It was almost as if my body where developing a mind of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came to a stop two feet in front of the beautiful heroine. She looked nervous.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t believe it! Megagirl? The nubile blond goddess herself? The thought sent an electric thrill through me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered what I looked like. I had still not gotten a proper view since donning the black Megagirl costume\u2014and now I had the bracelets and choker as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced to the glass in the shop window and saw a faint reflection. My figure looked dramatic and incredibly toned. As I compared my faint outline to Megagirl\u2019s hers was left wanting. Her profile looked flat and girlish next to my dramatic, sexy curves. I was somehow filling out her costume far better than she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization of just how phenomenally gorgeous I must be sent a wash of strong emotions through me. Pride, arousal, and a carefree, ecstatic feeling combined in a heady rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was dangerously sexy. And with the restraint of years of social conditioning slipping with my burgeoning power, <i>I</i> didn\u2019t even know what I might be capable of doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegagirl gulped, and she remained tensed for action. She obviously wasn\u2019t sure what I was capable of doing either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Creepy Grandma\u2019s voice behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for, girl? Kill her! I\u2019ve given you the power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body tensed involuntarily, and I watched Megagirl\u2019s eyes go wide. Already prepared for a fight, she launched a fist toward my face. It seemed slow. I slapped it away, spinning with the movement while raising my other arm. I used the momentum of my spin to send my raised elbow into the other girl\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power of blow sent the girl flying through the wall of the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had I done that? I hadn\u2019t meant to do that! I just wanted to ogle the pretty girl\u2019s body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither attack nor thoughts of attraction seemed like my own. I was becoming some sort of uninhibited goddess. The thought wasn\u2019t unappealing... but it wasn\u2019t exactly me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow should I fight this? Should I fight this? It would be so much easier just to go with it. <i>So</i> much easier. And more fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back to Creepy Grandma, with her evil smile and met it with one of my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard something from the room next door and watched as Megagirl struggled back through the ragged opening in the wall. She seemed a bit wobbly from my blow, and her lip was bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never seen Megagirl bleed before, even in the toughest of her fights. But somehow I had done this to her. I felt a surge of empathy for the poor girl. I knew that she was no match for me anymore, and I didn\u2019t really want to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to me and readied herself to throw another punch. Seeing her telegraph the coming blow, I moved before she could react. I knew that if I let her swing, my body would launch a counter strike before I could stop it. So I hugged her, wrapping my armed around the slender girl and locking her arms to her side. There, now she couldn\u2019t attack me, and I didn\u2019t have to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasant sensations coursed through me as my breasts pushed into those of the blond girl. I smiled in the knowledge that mine were obviously larger and firmer. Just as I was beginning to think sexy thoughts, Megagirl\u2019s lips moved upward toward mine, and she kissed me.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As pleasant as it was, I broke the kiss and glanced down to see the old woman\u2019s hands clasp a thin black belt into place around my ridiculously toned abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, God!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt another rush ripple through me, the strongest yet. I shuddered with the sensation, my fingers and lips trembling with power. I felt my body changing once more. I couldn\u2019t see what I was becoming, but I could see the smoldering haze of desire in Megagirl\u2019s eyes become an inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attraction to Megagirl remained, but it fell under the shadow of irrational fury. My lips curled downward as I felt hatred pouring into my veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow finish her,\u201d commanded a raspy old voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands rose at the woman\u2019s command, and I gripped Megagirl\u2019s shoulders firmly, my slim fingers sinking into her indestructible muscles with ease. She yelped with pain, but there wasn\u2019t anything she could do about it now. I was far too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a red and blue flash behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet her go,\u201d said Megaman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreepy Grandma cackled behind me, and Megaman\u2019s gaze drifted to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d he cried, a hint of fear in his eyes. What was <i>that</i> all about? Did he know her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flung Megagirl to the side with casual ease and approached Megaman with a nonchalant saunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see the delicious mixture of fear and arousal in his eyes as they watched my languidly graceful movements. Smiling, I struck before he ever knew what was coming. My first powered through his unprepared abs with ease. I watched his features contract in pain as if in slow motion as my hand wrecked him, rearranging his internal organs. I felt one of his bones crack as my hand nicked the bottom of his ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he was gone, flying through the roof of the mall with hypersonic speed. The heat of my rage diminished, vented by the pain I knew I had inflicted on Megaman. It remained, but it had been turned down to a low simmer. I turned to find that Creepy Grandma was gone once more. Where did this old hag go all the time? I needed some answers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a moan, my eyes turned to Megagirl, who was peeling herself out of a crater in the floor. Had I really thrown her that hard? I shrugged. Guess so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back to the mangled shop, eager to find a mirror as Megagirl rose shakily to her feet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw her dazed eyes trace the curves of my body out of the corner of my eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stopped in front of the mirror, my breath caught. I was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsolutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed hard as my eyes wandered the delicately chiseled perfection of my face, its radiant skin, its large, luminous green eyes. I ran my fingers through the thick, lustrous chocolate strands that poured over my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could visually explore my body, a body I already knew was far superior to Megagirl\u2019s, I saw her face appear over my shoulder in the reflection. My eyes were drawn to hers\u2026 and the blazing firestorm of desire that raged within them. She rested her chin on the slope of my toned shoulder, turned her head slightly to the side and began to kiss my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt pinpricks of arousal from the lurid sucking of her soft lips on my tender flesh and my full lips parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands slithered around my impossibly firm waist, and her fingers traced my abs upward until they cupped my breasts with a crackling thrill. I felt my breath escape my parted lips in an amorous exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached back and found her hips with my hands. Resting my fingers on their fabric-clad swells, I pushed inward, just slightly. Her flesh, indestructible by even the most powerful of weaponry, was pliant under the immense power of my slender fingers, pushing inward and eliciting a moan from the blonde as she felt my strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and straightened, looking down on the girl who was previously held as the ultimate woman. Our breasts touched with prickling electricity, mine far fuller than hers. Her hands found new purchase in the middle of my back, and she attempted to pull me toward her. The effort, one that I knew was sufficient to overpower all but the most powerful of supers, felt light, inconsequential to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how powerful was I know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a surge of dark pride quicken my heart. I was so beautiful, so powerful, so invincible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I was better in every conceivable way than the woman before me, this paragon of feminine power.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the realization dawned, I felt a confidence I had never before known. My eyes explored the beautiful superheroine, quivering like living clay, ready to be molded by my desires, living, for the moment, in anticipation of ecstasies she could scarcely imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled broadly as I wrapped my arms around the small of her back and pulled her upward and into me. Her body wrapped around mine, seeking the maximum amount of contact between us, as our lips met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt her husky moan vibrate against my mouth. She had never been with anyone like me, someone who could overpower her with ease. She clearly loved it, the excitement was written all over her tensed muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bent my knees and lowered her to the velveteen chair by the changing rooms where we stood. I pulled her gently away from my body, leaving her panting with arousal, half-reclined, on the chair. I took off the belt, briefly worrying that I would lose its effects...until I remembered that they were permanent. I took off the boots deliberately, watching her azure eyes trace the contours of my shapely calves. I could feel their staggering hardness as my fingertips slipped down their slowly arcing length to push the boots down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegagirl shifted in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly began to peel off the tight black fabric of my uniform, rolling it down my defined arms, over the dramatic swells of my bountiful breasts, down the sculpted ridges of my abs. I pushed the outfit over my lavish hips with a sexy shimmy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegagirl clasped her hands, her fingers whitening the flesh on the opposing hand as they clenched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished pushing the costume past the smoothness of my sleek thighs until it dropped to the floor, then stepped carefully out of the small heap of cloth. I kicked it to the side as I rose my eyes to meet hers once more. I knew that they smoldered. I know that Megagirl\u2019s did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped toward her, placed a hand on the armrest to either side of her and lowered my body tantalizingly over hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see her uncertainty. She didn\u2019t know what I wanted, yet she squirmed, knowing the untold pleasures it would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was about to swoop my mouth toward hers once more, I heard a sound. My eyes darted up to see Megaman\u2019s shocked expression at the store entrance.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Megaman\u2019s surprised expression quickly turned into a scowl and he began to walk toward us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegagirl, still clothed, jumped in front of me and held out her hands. He came to a stop just before his chest bumped into them then looked at her quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, exactly is going on here?\u201d he asked her, his tone reminiscent of a father questioning a daughter who had been out too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched with amusement.  I wondered whether I should put my clothes back on. I was hot as hell. Invulnerable. More powerful than either of the Mega-cousins. Fuck it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust leave me be right now. This doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell it doesn\u2019t! You\u2019re letting this evil bitch corrupt you, and I can\u2019t\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you calling an evil bi\u2014\u201c I started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrupt me how exactly?\u201d Megagirl interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know\u2026 I mean\u2026 look at what\u2026 uh\u2026 you know what I mean!\u201d As Megaman struggled for the right words, digging himself into deeper trouble with every one, Megagirl stiffened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo because we were having a private moment between <i>two women,</i> you call it <i>corruption?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I call it corruption because she\u2019s <i>obviously</i> EVIL! And you\u2019re getting way too <i>friendly</i> with someone who\u2019s <b>EVIL!!!</b>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me\u2014what has she done that\u2019s so evil!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? She attacked us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I attacked her first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 her costume is black!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...And wearing black makes one evil because\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026 I mean\u2026 it\u2019s obvious! Look at her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo because she\u2019s wearing black and is into <i>women</i>, she\u2019s evil?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when you put it that way, it doesn\u2019t sound good, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirked and crossed my arms, delighted by Megagirl\u2019s verbal beatdown of her older cousin. Even I was beginning to be persuaded by her arguments, and I <i>knew</i> the dark thoughts that I\u2019d been thinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...But what? Attacking someone simply because of how she looks and her sexual orientation? Sounds more like you\u2019re the evil one here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?! Are you calling me\u2014?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES! I think you\u2019re not nearly as open-minded as you think you are, <i>cousin</i>! And you need to give that some hard thought. In another place. Right NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman looked at his younger cousin with an expression of absolute shock, hand dropping from his injured ribs. He opened his mouth as if to speak, said nothing, and, after a moment, clamped it back shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stifled a giggle as Megagirl simply continued to glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, scowling, he jumped into the air and flew away. Megagirl turned back to me, her eyes dropping for a brief moment to my nude body, then flicking back to meet mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where were we\u2026\u201d she said, voice dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am <i>seriously</i> turned on right now,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d she said with a dark smile. \u201cSorry about my cousin. He means well, but he\u2019s kinda old-fashioned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries\u2026 but let\u2019s go to my place. When I\u2019m here, that creepy old hag always shows up and dolls me up more. I\u2019d rather have a bit of privacy right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I grabbed the door handle and twisted, sending splinters of door frame flying. Looking at Megagirl, I shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we entered my apartment, I closed the damaged door as best I could, for privacy. Taking Megagirl\u2019s hand in mine, I lead her to my futon. Gazing at me, distracted by my insanely gorgeous face and not looking where she was going, Megagirl stumbled over my coffee table. Not wanting to damage it, she lurched, lost her balance and fell on the cushions. Her hand, still gripping mine, pulled me off balance toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose that I could have used my flight power or superstrength to resist the pull\u2026 but why? I allowed myself to fall on top of her, onto the futon, bringing our faces mere millimeters apart. I could feel her breath on my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both smiled, relieved to have privacy this time for our intimate encounter. I swept over her, brushing her lips with mine. They felt soft and pliable as I grazed them. Megagirl shivered beneath me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I think this is about where we left off,\u201d I whispered throatily, oddly confident despite never having been with a girl before. Probably because her desire for me was so obvious I could nearly taste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone were all the insecurities about my body that normally plagued my thoughts during foreplay. Gone were any concerns that I wouldn\u2019t be \u201cgood.\u201d I hadn\u2019t had a chance to fully explore this new body of mine, but I had seen enough to know that it put Megagirl\u2019s to shame\u2026 and hers was pretty much perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a strange warmth beginning to burn in my belly as I realized just how overpoweringly gorgeous I must be. I mean, Megairl had graced every magazine cover known to humankind. She was who every girl wanted to be\u2014the strongest, most powerful, most desirable woman alive\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And she couldn\u2019t hold a candle to <i>me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered, my heartbeat quickening as the thought sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled my lips away from hers. Her head came up slightly, mouth reaching upward for mine, eyes closed. She flicked her tongue over her lower lip. I could practically <i>taste</i> her need as her moistened lips searched for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sliced her uniform right down the middle with a sharp fingernail, exposing her delectable body to my hungry eyes. After peeling the flaps of the costume away from her flawless skin, I playfully remained just beyond her reach. After a moment of hesitation, she opened her eyes a sliver, long lashes opening ever so slightly to reveal the iridescent blue oceans beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, she was beautiful.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snaked her bare, willowy arms around me and slithered her smooth legs around mine, pulling me toward her. I resisted, giving her a brief taste of my phenomenal strength. She pulled harder, but it was no use. She was powerless against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I heard the hint of a moan escape her lips, her fingers pressing against the smooth, sculpted steel of my elegantly muscled legs and back, I relented and gave her what she clearly yearned for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI surged forward into her, crushing her lips with mine, feeling her bite and suck their ruby plumpness. Our breasts collided, sparking fireworks of sensation. I rolled my supple hips into hers as she devoured every part of me that her mouth could cover. As I plunged my tongue into her mouth, I heard her chirp in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation was all-consuming. Our tongues swirled together, sleek bodies gracefully sliding against each other. I felt enraptured as never before, lost in the consummate pleasures of her idyllic form. I pulled my mouth away, breaking the silence of the evening with heavy breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding my lips across her cheek, dabbing kisses along the way, I found her earlobe and bit down lightly, teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tremor in hers tickled my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held back a smile, knowing the impact I was having on her, and dragged my teeth along the edge of her jaw, then dropped my mouth to her neck. I sucked in then bit lightly on her sensitive flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe writhed underneath me, gasping out a soft breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI worked my way down her long, swan-like neck in this fashion, running kisses, teeth, and tongue into the hollow of her clavicle, then diagonally down to the upper slopes of her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard her tongue lick her lips, a barely audible purr rumbling from her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kissed her breast slowly, ensuring that she felt the full effect of every leisurely purse of my luscious lips. When I arrived at her nipple, I swirled it with my tongue, barely touching delicate pink flesh, knowing exactly the electricity that fired through her overtaxed synapses. Once I had completed several loops, I touched my teeth to it on both sidees, pressing carefully into her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back arched, and I felt her firm, fleshy orb quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued, drifting my tongue down the lower arc of her exquisite breast to her ribcage. Working my way down, nipping and kissing each steel-hard abdominal, I finally neared her tender folds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer moans became huskier with anticipation, skin warm under my touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI darted my tongue out, receiving an answering gasp, then curled it and slid down her entrance. When I turned my attention fully to pleasuring her, her moans began to rise in volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing grew more urgent, becoming an anxious pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more coaxing, clenching minutes, she began to thrash. I wanted to make it last, but her delectable body was so coiled with pent-up arousal that she came far faster than I expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exploded in violently wriggling tremors. Her slim, sexy legs clamped down on my tightly as she threw back her head and screamed her release. I watched her buck, fingers hyperextending, then curling inward, clutching as if to latch onto the fleeting pleasure that rocked her breathtaking form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her involuntary movements faded, I laid my hand gently on her stomach. I could still feel the trembling aftershocks of the intense climax deep within her. Her breathing, stopped for the duration of her orgasm, began anew as she sucked in a lungful of air, then let it out slowly, calming and cooling her torrid body. I glanced up to her face. Her eyes were half-open, gazing at me adoringly with those stunning blue eyes of hers. Her cheeks were flushed, her forehead glistening with sweat, a few strands of blond hair beginning to clump together with moisture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never looked more beautiful to me than in that moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYour turn,\u201d Megagirl breathed as she recovered. We changed positions on the futon, and I closed my eyes, snuggling into the pillows for the pleasure to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that it didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping one eye open, I watched Megagirl, entranced by the black material of my \u201cdark Megagirl\u201d costume, pull it over her naked body. My jaw dropped open as a red flow flashed along the edges of her profile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d I cried, remembering the hateful feelings that had welled within me each time I had donned more of Creepy Grandma\u2019s outfit. Besides, Megagirl was already so strong, would she become even more so with the power infused by the clothes? I shuddered to think of what she might do with that hatred and that much power at her disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts evaporated, however, when I saw the effects of the costume on her already gorgeous body. Curves leapt outward into mouth-wateringly exhilarating shapes, bones rearranged into feminine perfection, muscles rippled with impossible might, like magnificent springs loaded with unbelievable tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this what I had looked like when I changed? I didn\u2019t think so. I was pretty sure she looked better. Way better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWild-eyed, blond hair whipping as she moved, Megagirl clamped the bracelets and choker on as well, her phenomenal beauty becoming still more awe-inducing with the electric crack of each item\u2019s closing clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped up from the cushions and grabbed her wrists, attempting to prevent her from buckling the belt. Which she did anyway. With ease. As if I wasn\u2019t even been pulling on them at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good Lord! Was she </i>that<i> much stronger than me now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in answer, she twisted her achingly beautiful lips into a smile and broke free of my grip instantly. Faster than I could see, her hand was suddenly tightening around <i>my</i> wrist\u2026 and it <i>hurt!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dropped to one knee as the pain from her slender fingers became unbearable, and Megagirl simply laughed. I looked up into her eyes, searching their hard, glassy, indigo irises for a sign as to her intentions. I wondered whether she was going to kill me, influenced as she was by the dark clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed hard, sensing the indecision in the conflicted furrow of Megagirl\u2019s now-divine brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, just as Megagirl seemed to be deciding on a course of action, I heard Megaman\u2019s voice outside my third-floor apartment window. From the sound of it, he was barking orders to someone that was with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both Megagirl\u2019s and my eyes turned toward the window, I realized that he hadn\u2019t been talking to <i>someone.</i> More like <i>someones.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entire super-team was assembled, some hovering in the sky. The rest gathered immediately below, on the ground. It looked like the entire Megasquad had come with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a brief surge of pride that Megaman had brought such a contingent solely for the purpose of dealing with little ol\u2019 me. Of course, wouldn\u2019t they be surprised when it was more than likely Megagirl who they would be forced to contend with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still wrapping my mind around yet another abrupt turn of events (there had been a LOT of those lately\u2014sheesh!), Megagirl disappeared, her hand no longer around my wrist. I pulled my arm in with super-speed, caressing my injured wrist with my other hand, when I heard the window glass shatter, crystalline shards showering my living room floor with a symphony of rattling taps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose to my feet and looked out to see Megagirl grab the cape of her first challenger and windmill her arm, flinging him into the ground with earth-shuddering force. Several more heroes flew toward her only to be catapulted back at hypersonic speed by lightning fast blurs of hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegagirl was completely unscathed, smiling, staring down Megaman, apparently wanting him to make the first move. I wasn\u2019t sure he would. After the ease with which she had dispatched the first wave of heroes, Megaman\u2019s nervousness looked to be transforming in abject terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething needed to be done. Before I gave it much more thought than that, I leapt forward into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I jumped out of the window, I had a brief worry that maybe I had lost the powers granted by the clothes\u2014that maybe that\u2019s why Megagirl was so much stronger than me. Luckily, however, that was not the case, and I did <i>not</i> plummet several stories to the ground below like a self-reprimanding brick. Note to self: check for powers <i>before</i> jumping out of windows, not <i>after</i> next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying toward the arial fray, however, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what I should do. Should I fight against the Megasquad? Against Megagirl? In the movies, the superheroes always knew who the bad guys were. In reality, it wasn\u2019t quite so simple\u2026 Hell, I didn\u2019t even know if I were there hero or the villain of this little tale!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I debated my strategy, I heard a voice call out behind me\u2026 from the open hole in my living room? Twisting in the air for a look, I saw the face I was half-expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed it. Creepy freaking Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI zoomed back toward her but stopped a good ten feet short, determined not to come within range of her ultra-quick hands. Unless she could fly too. Please tell me she can\u2019t fly\u2026 please?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done, girl? You gave my beautiful costume to one of the Megas???\u201d she asked, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you gave me a freaking instruction manual, lady! How was I supposed to know\u2026\u201d I huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...that it would do <i>exactly the same thing</i> to <i>her</i> that it did to <i>you,</i> child?\u201d she interrupted with a punctuating eye roll. \u201cWhy I chose the most insipid, vain, <i>millennial</i> to do this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m not sure what insipid means, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s bad. And you\u2019re saying <i>millennial</i> like it\u2019s a bad word. And I\u2019m <i>standing right here!\u201d</i> I looked down and quickly amended the statement. <i>\u201cFloating</i> right here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There. Take that, bitch,</i> I thought, crossing my arms over my *ahem* fabulously endowed chest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The harsh, rattling sound seemed to gain momentum for a moment, becoming louder and faster... until it sputtered into a coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked the red-faced woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d she rasped. Then, she waved her hands in the air, as if knitting with no needle, and I watched as fabric began to form around my naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026?\u201d I asked, still looking down at the threads rapidly forming and stitching together over my breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet, child,\u201d said Creepy Grandma, looking even paler than usual. As her hands continued to go through the motions, I felt a surge in strength and vitality ripple up my spine. The old woman wobbled, seemingly ready to keel over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to give you the power to overcome Megagirl, enhanced as she is by your stupidity. You must kill them both. You <i>must</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why? Why do you hate them so much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate them because of what they took from me. I hate them because they tricked me into giving them powers, then used them only for themselves. I made them their suits, bestowed upon them their powers. In return for a favor. One that they never granted. Instead, they went and saved people. They made themselves celebrities,\u201d she spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I learned how to ensure that wouldn\u2019t happen again,\u201d she said, shooting a clawed hand to the window frame to keep herself upright. \u201cI discovered how to make the cloth change thoughts. How to infuse the powers with a price. A burning need to do my bidding. To kill the Megas!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what did you want them to do? Originally, I mean,\u201d I asked, feeling my eyes go wide at her revelations. Megaman and Megagirl had gotten their powers from Creepy Grandma too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer unnatural smile creaked even wider, but she didn\u2019t answer. Instead, she stumbled backward and collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady? You okay? Creepy Grandma?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flew into the apartment and knelt beside her. Checking for a pulse, I frowned. There wasn\u2019t one. Had making my outfit done her in? I felt a little guilty now\u2026 but <i>shit!</i> I had never asked for this. None of this! I had simply wanted a damn dress for my mixer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the Megas had wronged her somehow? Stolen her gifts without paying the price? Maybe they really <i>were</i> the bad guys\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...except they were on opposite sides now! So what was I supposed to do about <i>that!</i> Remembering the battle, I looked out the window to see that Megagirl had wiped out all but one of the Megasquad\u2019s members. A few seemed to be splattered on the ground, but most simply looked injured, albeit out of commission. The only one left was Megaman. And Megagirl was floating toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a final glance toward Creepy Grandma, I wished her happiness in the afterlife, though I sincerely doubted that would be her fate. I leapt out the window once more, feeling the air flutter my probably-super-mega-gorgeous mane as I rocketed toward Megagirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put him down before I could even get there. Easy peasy, with one punch to the stomach and one to the jaw. He slammed to earth unconscious. Or maybe dead, I thought, remembering the feeling of his rib cracking under my fist when I had fought him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was pretty tough. I was putting my money on unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, decision made. I\u2019m fighting Megagirl!</i> I love it when things work out like that. No struggling and agonizing with difficult choices. Just: <i>Elaine smash.</i> I really hoped Creepy\u2019s upgraded threads were going to put me in this girl\u2019s league. If not, this was going to be a very short fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slammed into Megagirl from behind as she watched her cousin, unmoving, in a crater on the ground with what looked like conflicting emotions. As my outstretched fists collided with her spine, her back arched, and the momentum of my strike flung her half a mile away before she slowed with her flying power and came hurtling back toward me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared, I could see the anger in her eyes. I probably could have seen it before too, if I had thought to use my X-ray vision, but I wasn\u2019t all that accustomed to my powers. I had mostly used them to have sex. Really, really good sex. I mentally shrugged. Not that there was anything wrong with that. It seemed like a damn fine use of powers to me! Saving cats from trees and people from burning buildings was so played out these days\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tugged my attention back to the task at hand. Megagirl was pretty much unstoppable by the looks of what she\u2019d done to the Megasquad. My power level was a bit of an unknown right now. I needed to take this fight pretty seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the side just as Megagirl arrived, dodging her double-fisted return blow. Then, I slammed my fists down on the back of her head, sending her plummeting to the ground below. Deciding to take advantage of my opportunity, I flew down stomping on her to grind her further into the pavement before she could recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped back to see the effects of my punishment. The damage seemed pretty significant. Megagirl was moving, but it was more of a pained, writhing motion than a I\u2019m-going-to-jump-back-up-and-kill-you-before-you-can-blink sorta deal. Then, I noticed something. It was a dark-red streak. On the back of her hair. I was fairly certain it was blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet! I could hurt her. I felt a twinge of guilt at the thought. But for some reason, it didn\u2019t bother me as much as it should have. Maybe it was the influence of the clothes. Creepy had implied that she laced all of her clothes with Mega-hate these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile my mind was busy musing, Megagirl lunged forward and smashed a front kick into my stomach, knocking me backward. <i>Damn it! I had thought I was prepared for that move!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug in my heels to come to a stop, wreaking havoc on the pavement. <i>The city was going to have to dig deep into the budget after this battle,</i> I thought idly. I ran a hand over my sculpted abs. They hurt a little from her strike, but not too bad. I felt my lips curl upward as I realized that I was quite a bit stronger than Megagirl again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug my toes into the soft asphalt and launched myself back at Megagirl like a track athlete jumping out of the blocks. I saw her eyes widen and arms cross in a cringe as I struck. This time, however, I abandoned caution and just continued to pound her with my fists. I knew I was stronger now, and I decided to simply use that fact to my advantage, raining blow after blow on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she collapsed to the ground, blood trickling from her nose and lips, bruises forming on her face. I could see her chest rising and falling, so I knew she was still alive, but she was out of commission for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flew over to Megaman and noticed his chest moving as well. So he was alive then. Good, I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing sirens and the stuttering thuds of helicopter blades approaching, I decided to take off. I remembered to use my X-ray vision this time as I zoomed away, peering down to see the medical workers trying\u2014and failing\u2014to get an IV into Megaman\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out an amused laugh. <i>Good luck with that, guys,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was fairly certain they would be okay. I thought about what they had done, taking their powers and refusing to pay for them, but decided to do at least mostly good with their use. Was that ethical? Maybe not. Was it the right thing to do? Maybe it was. Particularly if Creepy Grandma had wanted them to do something awful. And that was my sneaking suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople don\u2019t come by such power cleanly. I sure hadn\u2019t. There is always taint. I could almost hear my father saying: <i>What\u2019s important is how you wield it, Elaine.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I should reconsider the whole \u201csaving people\u201d thing. Might be pretty cool. I\u2019d be loved and adored. I wouldn\u2019t be hurting for dates anymore! Not with this body! Plus I\u2019d probably have, like, a billion Instagram followers. Yay, new influencer career!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut being a supervillain could be pretty awesome too. Who needed a career when you could just take whatever you wanted? I could just set up shop on a beach resort in Tahiti and kick back for the rest of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Decisions, decisions\u2026</i> I pondered, as I flew toward the haze of the horizon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nI definitely didn't see that coming, but then again, this morning when I woke up I couldn't imagine being transformed into some super-horny doppleganger superheroine either!  I mean, for all intents and purposes, I was now a darker, curvier, sexier version of MegaGirl.  And judging from our brief encounter so far, a stronger and more powerful version as well.  I guess I could see why she was attracted to me.  I WAS super hot, after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so was she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gladly returned her kiss, pushing my incredible bosom into hers as we made out, our tongues passionately swirling inside each others' mouths, as my unstoppable nipples began to press into her seemingly invulnerable chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, what am I doing?  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't a lesbian or even into girls, so I knew I shouldn't be doing this.  Besides, I still had this strange overwhelming feeling inside me that said I should be listening to Creepy Grandma and just kill her.  Yes.  Yes.... I needed to kill --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, god....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs MegaGirl's soft hands slid down my voluptuous curves, any thoughts of ending this -- much less killing her -- became a distant memory.  I cooed in delight as she wrapped her hands around me, sliding them under my black skirt and squeezing my delicious buns of steel.  The notion of the same hands that were capable of tearing through solid steel were now only able to slightly dimple my harder-than-anything glutes sent a wave of pleasure through me that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy raked my through her golden locks like a wild animal as I kissed her harder.  Deeper.  More passionately.  If was body was tingly before, it now felt completely electrified.  My libido now apparently was just as super as the rest of me in this black outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis black outfit!   I was beginning to think the superheroine costume was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.  It made me beautiful.  Sexy.  Confident.  Super.  It was so ironic that all I wanted to do was take it off now so MegaGirl and I could fuck like rabbits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my god!  Did I just think that?  What's wrong with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I tried to answer the question to myself, I was interrupted my MegaGirl breaking off the kiss long enough to nibble playfully on my neck, whispering to me amidst staccato breaths, \"T-t-t-take meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I had been trying to hold back the raging river of tempestuous desire up to this point, her sexy plea sent a peoverbial wrecking ball through the mental dam I had erected to hold the waters back.  No more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at her, I give her a Cheshire grin as I grabbed her by the arms and launched skyward.  Of course, it didn't register at the time that we were inside the shop so we ended up plowing through a mixture of ceiling tiles, roof trusses, and concrete during our escape.  Of course, thanks to the benefits of superstrength and invulnerability that we both possessed, it barely messed up our hair.  And if I'm being honest, it only got me hotter, seeing our superhard bodies knife through solid concrete like a hot knife through butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jesus, I feel like I'm gonna explode</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur impromptu flight didn't last too long as I quickly spotted a deserted building about 15 miles away and adjusted our trajectory with perfect accuracy despite the distraction of all the the airborne heavy petting going on.  We streaked through the sky like two sexy SCUD missiles, crashing into the deserted building only seconds later, our super sexy and indestructible bodies now lying in a 12 foot diameter crater covered with debris.  I don't think we even stopped kissing for a second.  Until MegaGirl decided to ratchet up the fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching beside her, the blonde goddess wrapped her hand around a 4 foot length of steel rebar, using her superstrength to rip it out of the concrete as easily as a young girl would pluck a daisy from a field.  Smiling mischievously, I watched as my former idol used her superhuman strength on the steel bar, folding it over on itself again and again with the same ease that a magician would make balloon animals.  Admittingly curious at this point, I watched in fascination as she manipulated the metal to her whim despite the muffled whines of the metal as it bent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite the turn-on, partly from watching this platinum blonde supermodel displaying her power so casually and partly from the knowledge of knowing I was just as strong, if not stronger!  I began to feel myself getting wetter and wetter by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding up her creation, MegaGirl gave me a sly wink as she placed her hand atop of the now foot long section of compressed rebar and gave a nice squeeze with her superhuman grip.  As she removed her hand revealing a makeshift bulbous head, I giggled and nodded in approval as I lay back on the pile of debris, teasingly lifting the hem of my skirt for MegaGirl and her new super toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nI quivered and held my breath, feeling one of MegaGirl's fingers hook teasingly inside the crotch area of my costume, as she gave it a playful but superstrong tug.  I exhaled breathlessly in unison with the crackle of the three super-reinforced, titanium snaps releasing, the crotch of my skin tight bodysuit springing open like Pandora's Box to the lust-filled superheroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaGirl grinned mischievously -- it was almost an evil smile -- that made me question who was really the heroine and who was the villainess at that exact moment.  But I wasn't able to contemplate for very long as MegaGirl placed her new toy against my sex, re-scrambling my thoughts..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn creating the head of her makeshift dildo, MegaGirl's had compressed and molded the solid steel with her superhuman fingers, the pressure causing the temperature of the steel to skyrocket well into triple digits.  However, thanks to my newfound invulnerability, I felt only a pleasurable warmth -- VERY pleasurable -- as the red-hot probe made first contact, my fresh juices sexily sizzling against the steel rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ohhhhhhhh!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bite my lower lip and moan as my super-charged nerve endings send a tidal wave of pleasure to my brain.  Not only has this costume made made me stronger and faster and more beautiful, it's even made the sex better!  I almost begin to laugh at the thought, but then I almost swallow my tongue as MegaGirl pushes the steel cock inside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuuuuuuuuuuuuccckkkkkkk</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body writhes in ecstasy as I feel the hardened steel fill me up, my inner walls clenching against its rough super-ribbed exterior.   I feel so invincible and so vulnerable in the same instance as I watch the world's greatest superheroine stare down at me like the cat that ate the canary as she mouth's \"just wait...\" to me.  My body explodes with goosebumps almost instantly with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't have to wait too long as MegaGirl skillfully begins ever-so-slowly pulling the rebar out and then slowly inserting back, her motions short and slow.   I moan in delight , my eyelids fluttering like a hummingbirds wings as I feel the hardened steel slowly sliding inside me compliments of MegaGirl's skilled hands.  It's excruciatingly slow.  Wonderfully slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes once again and look at the super girl atop of me as she smiles confidently.  She knows she's skilled.  She gives me a playful wink as I feel the movement inside me beginning to speed, the strokes infinitesimally longer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, extremely skilled!  With each passing thrust of her hand, MegaGirl's superhuman control allows her to go slightly deeper and faster each time, sending more and more waves of pleasure crashing against me like an unprotected seawall in a hurricane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hurricane approaches a category 3 storm, I'm in pure ecstasy.  As a close my eyes tightly, I can swear I can hear the muffled sound of my super strong inner walls clamping down on the rebar, the rough metal edges blunting and smoothing against my slippery and powerful insides.  It's... so....freaking....surreal!   My hands rake through my hair like a wild animal then absent-mindedly reach out.  My left hand finds a piece of rough chunk of concrete which I crush like oyster crackers with my superhuman strength. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nGod!  I'm so fucking powerful!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crescendo builds as MegaGirl continues her machinations, increasing tempo and range with every rep.  Her innocent smile belying insane power and control and she continues to work her toy inside me with impunity.  My super hardbody writhes in ecstasy, my buns of steel pulverizing the hard concrete slab I'm laying on as a wriggle and grind against it.  My hands give up on the fragile landscape around me and grasp for something stronger and more durable as I grope my new super curves, marveling at their size and firmness.  Thoughts of bullets bouncing off them makes my coo as I squeeze them with superpowerful fingers that could crush steel.  I'm nearing orgasm as I feel the steel dildo slide faster and faster in and out of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-s-so close....\" I breathlessly whisper as I feel the strength of the hurricane continuing to rise.  MegaGirl hears my exasperated commentary and takes that as her cue.  Up to this point, MegaGirl has demonstrated her superhuman control and stamina on me.  She now decides to demonstrate what else make her super...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh!  Jesus!  God!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes snap open at the overwhelming sensation as I sit up and look down as MegaGirl's arm quickly becomes a flesh-colored blur as she moves the rebar in and out of my pulsing slit at superspeed.  I want to scream, but I feel my vocal cords tighten almost in concert with my pussy as it tries to clamp down on the steel cock inside me, slowing it.  It's like trying to catch a rope made of silk slipping through my fingers.  So tantalizing and soft.  Orgasmic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an eternity of about fifteen seconds, the hurricane inside me reaches category 5 status.  My head crashes back into the concrete slab I'm lying on, cracking it in half.  I don't even feel it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the pleasure centers in my head are at DefCon 1 as the sensations of touch, smell, and sound converge close to a breaking point when -- seemingly impossibly -- MegaGirl somehow doubles and then redoubles her speed.  She is TRULY the world's greatest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes mere seconds after that for orgasm after orgasm to wash over and pile up inside me like cars behind a jack-knifed semi.  On orgasm number three, I kegal hard, clenching down on the rebar inside me, my super strong vaginal walls crushing it into steel paste inside my crevice as I cum yet again, spewing molten steel and my juices out onto the concrete slab.  Oh.  My.  God!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my super stamina, it takes me a few seconds to recover and catch my breath.  Looking up at MegaGirl, she is as beautiful as ever, her golden tresses blowing in the breeze as stands up and she gives me a coy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Larger and larger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was MegaMan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at me and scowled. Then, he looked at MegaGirl, and his scowl deepened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing MegaMan's disapproving stare at MegaGirl set off the spark of anger within me. Who was this asshole to judge? He hadn't been here. He had seen how much MegaGirl and I had enjoyed each other. What was wrong with that? Fucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the anger built within me, I saw a brief flash of Creepy Grandma in my vision. My choker and bracelets glowed and seemed to grow hot. I felt power surge through me, stronger than ever before. I let out a scream, and MegaMan's eyes locked back on me. They widened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaGirl gasped. I felt my body grow. The super-fabric of my costume creaked from the pressure my beyond-super body was placing on it. The seams began to give a bit, the costume no longer able to contain my burgeoning body. I was tempted to look down at myself to see how much beautiful I had become, but I didn't. I stared at MegaMan with building fury, boiling into rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan ushered MegaGirl behind him. He continued to stare at me, eyes wide. He swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled evilly. He was afraid. Afraid of little ol' me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed as I floated up toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan reached out a hand to take mine, I slapped it away. He looked stunned. Something in how I looked spurred him to fearful action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most powerful superhero in existance took a swing at me in slow motion. I raised my hand and stopped it with my hand, taking my time closing each finger around it, knowing that he was far to slow to pull away from me, even if I moved at a leisurely pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face instantly contorted in pain. I squeezed harder and heard crackling sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan's face was a study mixture of pain and terror. He swung his other fist at me. I fired out my other fist to meet his. As they  met, the bones in his knuckles popped and his hand flew back, swinging him around the hand I held like a barn door. I pulled his broken hand toward me, sending his body toward mine. As he came within my reach, I smashed both my hands down on his shoulders, and he rocketed downward into the ground like a human-sized tent stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaGirl, who had been floating behind him looked at me with fear in her eyes.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She must feel it. I guess that makes sense. Let\u2019s see. They should be fuller. Her left one is a little higher than the right. Let\u2019s even them up. Better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah\u2019s a soccer player on my co-ed rec team, so I\u2019d better not make them too big. She won\u2019t be able to play as well. I\u2019m thinking some C-cups will do nicely. I make them inflate to that size, making sure that they are firm and riding high on her chest. Satisfied, I stop adjusting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy alarm went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was such a weird dream. It was like I had the power to change reality. And I had used it to make the breasts of the prettiest girl on the soccer team bigger and nicer. I\u2019ve had worse dreams, I guess. Yeah, as I think about it, this one was a pretty good dream. I\u2019ll take that over my deadline-driven nightmares any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got ready to go to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, after work, I arrived at the match a few minutes late. Rush hour traffic in Portland was getting pretty bad these days. As I ran toward the field, I saw Leah out there. She really was a good-looking girl. I\u2019d asked her out once, but she had politely declined. Couldn\u2019t blame her. I was decent looking and had a decent job, but I wasn\u2019t much above average on either count. Leah looked a little like Alex Morgan. Thinner, maybe. And just as little up top. But she <i>was</i> out of my league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually I was a starter, but since I was late to the match, I was riding the bench today. Rick ran over, gassed, and asked for a sub. There were three of us. I looked to Jerry and George, but they nodded to me. I ran in for Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball came my way a moment later. I controlled it, then passed it to a streaking Leah, behind the defender. She tapped it twice, lining up a shot. Then\u2026. she shot! GOAL! She scored! We killed the last few minutes of the game, winning 1-0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team went to the bar after the game and drank our customary victory shots of J\u00e4germeister. A few beers later, I was nicely buzzed. I zoned out a bit, looking at beautiful Leah, my gaze drifting to her chest. If only I could really make her breasts bigger as I had in the dream\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. Just like the dream. They grew.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as it stopped, she looked up and looked around. No one else had seemed to notice--at least not yet. She caught me looking right at her, however. I quickly averted my eyes, but I was fairly certain it was too late. She had seen me. I got up and went to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came out of the bathroom, Leah was looking right at me. She rose from her seat and intercepted me on my way back to mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walt, could we have a word?\" Leah asked, grabbing my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... I guess so,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guided me outside the pub by the arm, took me about twenty feet from the entrance, then turned to face me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walt, did you notice something when you were looking at me a few minutes ago?\" Leah asked, crossing her arms under her larger boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!? No! What do you mean?\" I said, stumbling over me words in my haste to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah cocked her head to the side and raised an eyebrow. She said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. I noticed that your breasts got a little bigger. It must be that time of the month, right?\" I said. Sometimes, I'm not all that smooth. This was one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That time of the...!\" Leah looked surprised. Then annoyed. She smacked me on the arm. \"Men!\" she said in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walt, this is clearly <i>not</i> normal. Women's breasts don't grow by two inches within minutes even at <i>that time of the month</i>,\" she said in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" I decided she deserved to hear the truth. I'm a terrible liar anyway. \"I had a dream last night that your breasts grew. Then, at the pub, it happened! I don't know anything beyond that. I didn't do it. I just sort of had a premonition of it or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah clearly hadn't expected that. She opened her mouth. Then shut it again, thinking. Finally, she said, \"So you had a premonition? Have you ever had any other premonitions before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't think so anyway,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah considered for another moment. Then, she bit her lower lip and leaned toward me conspiratorially. \"Do you dream about me a lot? What else happened in the dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... No! I mean... nothing else... happened,\" my face flushed with embarrassment. I was flustered enough around pretty girls. I hadn't really understood the full ramifications of telling her about my dream. Story of my life--not realizing ramifications, not the other thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah looked slightly disappointed. She seemed as if she wanted to say something else, but then thought better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay then, let's go back inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went back in and sat down in our seats again, joining the rest of the team. I noticed, however, that she kept looking at me off and on the rest of the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I finally got home that night, I was tired from alcohol and exertion.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This time, it was Elina. Elina was cute, maybe, but not pretty as was Leah. She was smaller than Leah by a couple of inches as well. Not much in the way of curves either. She did have a lithe, fit body, however, as soccer players generally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were in the middle of a match, but I just stood there. I stared at her unselfconsciously, She grew taller, more muscular. Feminine muscle became visible as her legs became leaner, more defined, slightly larger. Then her arms. I somehow knew that this was happening all over her body. She was becoming stronger, faster, more powerful. If she had been a house cat before, now she was a panther, coiled muscles ready to spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball came at me. I woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I rose in my bed, I wondered if this would come true, like the last one had. We didn't have a match today, but we did on Thursday. I couldn't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Thursday. I hadn't dreamed since Tuesday night when I had imagined Elina growing, or if I had, I didn't remember the dreams. I was on time for this one, taking the field at the beginning of the match as I usually did. I couldn't help but notice how good Leah looked with those new swells under her jersey. She smiled at me as she noticed me looking. Man! I really needed to get better at hiding my glances!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted Elina, but she looked the same. In the dream, though, she had changed while I looked at her during the game. We would see in the next 90 minutes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match didn't start well. I played midfield. They had a really good striker, and he kept getting past me without difficulty. The third time he blew by me on the outside, he also got past our defender and angled a shot high and away from our keeper for a goal. We were down 0-1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the same guy came around me to the inside to get an unchallenged shot from the top of the box. Another goal. 0-2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of the second half, this guy was coming at me again. This time I managed to strip the ball from him with a sliding tackle and get it to Elina. As I rose to my feet, I stared at her. I realized right away that it was exactly as it had been in my dream. I watched her as ten, maybe fifteen pounds of muscle grew on her frame. She was cut, powerful, fast, strong. She began to streak to the goal, but her strokes to dribble the ball in front of her were more powerful than she expected. She lost control of the ball to a defender who cleared it right at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish I could say it was a header, but the ball hit me directly in the forehead as I continued to stare at Elina and knocked me over. Their striker got the ball and slipped past our defense one more time to make it 0-3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and glanced over to Leah. She was looking back and forth from me to Elina, eyes wide. I was pretty sure that she had noticed what had happened. Elina didn't really seem to, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah tapped the ball back to me when play resumed. I pass it back to her. Noticing Elina, now incredibly fast, making a run on goal, Leah lobbed the ball over their midfielders, hitting Elina in stride. She rocketed a shot past their keeper for a goal! It was 1-3 now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the other team came at us, I managed to strip their striker of the ball again and find Elina with a pass. She took the ball the length of the field by herself and scored again. 2-3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn our next possession, Leah, who used to be our best scorer (I was sure that Elina was now), put a ball in the back of the net to tie it up at 3-3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir striker beat me a fourth time as they possessed the ball from the circle. This time, however, his shot glanced off the crossbar for a goal kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe managed to get the ball to their end as the minutes remaining in the game dwindled. Elina's shot ricocheted off the hip of one of their defenders, the girl rubbing her hip in pain where the ball had struck her. On the ensuing corner kick, Elina jumped several inches above everyone else and headed it in for the game winner. We had come back and won 4-3!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team crowded around Elina, slapping her high fives, patting her on the back, and hugging her. She had been the hero, scoring a hat trick. A couple of people told her that her new workout routine must really be paying off, but Elina shrugged it off. She still didn't seem to pick up on the extra lean muscle she had gained. She probably would tonight when she showered, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the match, at the pub, Leah sat next to me. She whispered into my ear, \"Did you dream of Elina last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"It was two nights ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's eyes sparkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later, I rose and excused myself to use the restroom. After I entered, as I went to set the lock behind me, the door burst open. It was Leah! She locked it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...?\" I started, honestly confused about this unexpected turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my mind tried to come to grips with what was happening, Leah said, \"I can't have you making all the other girls better than me, now can I? Let me give you something to dream about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed me. Hard. Passionately. My lord, did her lips taste good. Even after the match, too, she smelled of flowers on a spring day. Her new breasts pressed against my chest, and my dick sprang to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it was beginning to get <i>really</i> interesting, though, she stopped. With a smile and a wink, she unlocked the door and darted out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as I wanted to, I didn't dream of Leah that night. Or the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Saturday mornings, our team usually practiced for a couple of hours. Practices were fairly informal affairs, so people straggled in around 10 AM. I hadn't done much on Friday night, so I was on time today. My social life was a little lacking other than my friends from soccer, and we had had matches on Monday and Thursday last week, going out after each to celebrate the victories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I jogged onto the field, Leah was already there. She noticed me, smiled, and jogged over to meet me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you dream of me, Walter?\" she said with a wink. \"Am I about to change today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I don't think I dreamed at all the last couple of nights...\" I started, apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?\" Leah said, her smile turning to a frown. \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like I can control this thing!\" I huffed. It wasn't the right thing to say. Her frown turned into a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want another kiss, is that it? You're holding me hostage now that you know that I want you to make me stronger, fitter, sexier, and...\" Leah stopped herself and blushed. I don't think she meant to say that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Leah, believe me, I wouldn't mind seeing you even sexier, not that you're not sexy enough already,\" I said, relieved that I had thought to mention that last part. Girls like those sorts of compliments, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's face softened a little. \"When you changed me and when you changed Elina before, you sort of stared at us. Can you try it right now? Starting, I mean. Concentrate. Let's see if it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay...\" I said uncertainly. I began to stare at her well-formed boobs. If Leah was giving me the go-ahead to ogle her, I was going to take full advantage. I started to think about their nice shape, their nice size for her athletic frame... and I began to become aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah stood there, tapping her foot, looking down occasionally at her own chest. Nothing, however, was happening. Eventually, she became impatient. \"Okay, that's enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So apparently that doesn't work. You've got to dream it.\" Leah looked torn, conflicted about something. She took a step toward me, then stopped herself. \"Let's get back to practicing,\" she finally said, then turned back to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of practice, Leah went at it really hard. She was trying to keep up with Elina. She couldn't. Elina was now an incredible player, talented enough to try out for the city's women's professional team, the Portland Thorns, maybe. I wasn't sure if she was quite good enough to make it, but she sure looked ready when I saw her in practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt noon, when we wrapped up our practice, Leah came over to the sideline, gasping for air. She collapsed on the sideline, lying on her back, arms and legs outstretched, new breasts prominent. I enjoyed the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah huffed and puffed for a good minute before she managed to control her breathing. She looked at me and said, \"Why couldn't you have made <i>me</i> the soccer superstar. Elina is so freaking good now. I can't keep up with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you never know. Maybe I'll have a dream tonight,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah got that twinkle back in her eye, but she said nothing. She rose to her feet, looked hesitant, then jogged away to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, I dreamed again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We had this mousy administrative assistant at work. Her name was Rachel. She was nice, and once she found out that I liked Star Wars, she liked to keep me up to date on all the latest rumors and such about the upcoming movie. I think she had a bit of a crush on me, because she seemed to go out of her way to talk to me whenever she noticed that I wasn't busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dream over the weekend was of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel came over as I set down my latte and removed my jacket. \"Happy Monday!\" she said. She always seemed to be in a good mood. Truth be told, she had a great personality, and I wouldn't mind dating her... if she weren't so homely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your weekend?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was alright. I dreamed of you last night!\" I said. Wait! Had I just said that? Damn! I really needed to think more before I just said stuff. That was going to give her the wrong idea... well, unless the dream came true... then, it might be a very good idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel blushed crimson. She seemed to stumble over her words a bit, then she zipped back over to her cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over to her cube as she sat there, staring at her screen, apparently in thought. Then, the dream kicked in. I stared as her body burgeoned with curves. Her hips widened, her breasts grew a few cup sizes, her waist remained slim. Heck, it may have slimmed even further. Her legs seems to grow more shapely inside of her leggings. I saw the reflection of her face in the window of her cubicle. It was definitely prettier than it had been a moment ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel shifted uncomfortably in her chair. She seemed to notice that something was happening. He saw her expression of shock in the cubicle window as she looked down and saw her D-cups? on her chest. She pulled her cardigan around her large chest and hustled away from her desk. Probably to the restroom, I'd wager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't come back the rest of the morning. After lunch, I wandered over to her neighbor and asked where Rachel had gone. He cube-mate told me she hadn't been feeling well and had gone home for the day. That's too bad. I would have liked to have gotten a better view of her new appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, we had a soccer match. To my disappointment, Leah wasn't there. She had texted everyone and said that she had a family emergency and wasn't able to be there. Elina was there, however, and she was awesome, putting five goals in the back of the net for a 5-1 victory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the pub to celebrate another victory, she sat next to me.The conversation turned to dreaming. Had Leah talked to her? She didn't seem to be giving me any knowing looks or pointed comments, so I didn't think so. It was probably coincidence. Just before we wrapped up and went home however, she told those of us in the conversation that she had read that people dreamed every night. They just didn't always remember their dreams. That had caught my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up the next morning without having dreamed. I thought back to Elina's comment, though. Maybe I had, and I just didn't know it...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was still short at around 5'2\" probably, but her hair was full, wavy, and chestnut. Her brown eyes sparkled with excitement. Her face had gone from horsey right past average and cute to pretty. Actually, I would probably give her beautiful, not just pretty, now that she was smiling. I was right about her chest having expanded to D-cups. They looked huge on her petite body! She wore a skirt today with no tights or pantyhose, and her legs looked lean and toned. Her ass pushed the fabric of the skirt out nicely. I wondered idly what her abs looked like. I had no doubt that they were nice, just like the rest of her body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually seemed more shy than normal, as we engaged in our normal morning banter, which was odd. I would have thought the beauty boost would give her more self-confidence than less. Then, I found out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So I was wondering if you wanted to see that Star Wars movie this Friday. It's coming out this weekend, and I already have two tickets...\" She blushed. Man, she was so cute! Did I want to go out with her? Hell, yeah! She was fun to be around, and she looked great. What was there to think about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" I said. My enthusiastic response made her smile broadly. She looked a little relieved and more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Wanna pick me up for dinner beforehand?\" she ventured, her confidence growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. How about 6:00?\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then, Walter...\" she winked. She was getting the pretty girl thing down fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! I was so looking forward to Friday now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she wasn't even at the match today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElina was warming up, looking as strong and fast as ever. I didn't see Leah yet... Wait! There she was. She looked businesslike as she jogged onto the field. She chatted with a couple of others on the team, but didn't say anything to me or even look in my direction. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match started, and Elina scored within the first 10 minutes to make it 1-0. The next time we possessed the ball, Leah streaked down the field, dodging defenders. I stared. She began to gain muscle and definition, just as Elina had. She put on at least as much muscle, probably a little more. It looked great on her. She had been fit and beautiful before--now she looked as if she put 4 hours a day in at the gym. She looked like a beautiful fitness model. Her speed increased. She flew around the final defender and buried a shot in the net so hard that the goal keeper looked scared to get in front of it. 2-0!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah looked down and seemed to notice that her legs were longer, leaner. Striations appeared with every step as she jogged back to our side of the field. She looked up and found my eyes, giving me a radiant smile along with a wink. She looked incredibly happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Elina had been playing at close to a professional level, Leah could easily have started for Portland's pro women's team. She dodged and darted, placing the ball with ease. Scoring with ease. She looked like Lionel Messi out there. The combination of Leah and Elina completely overwhelmed the other team. We won 10-0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the match, as I threw my things into my gym bag, Leah walked right up to me and kissed me on the lips. In front of everyone. She felt amazing. Her back felt firm with muscle. Her hips, the same. Her breasts, though, were soft and felt so good against my chest. My body tingled with the sensation from breasts and lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally let me come up for air. \"I'm glad I'm your dream girl again...\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the team ooo'd and ahhhh'd. Tim made a smooching sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was disappointed when Leah hadn't shown at the pub after the match, but Elina told me she was still dealing with some family stuff and couldn't make it. I had wanted to check out her new fitness model build. Oh well. There was alway Saturday at practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as I went to bed, I thought about the events of the day. I realized that I didn't remember having that dream about Leah! I thought back to what Elina had said about dreams happening whether we remembered them or not. I wondered what else I might dream into reality without even being aware of it. I couldn't wait to find out. Then, I fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had gushed about the new movie that we were going to watch and tried to pry the secret of where we were going for dinner beforehand out of me. I had held firm, however, mostly because I didn't know yet. I needed to make a reservation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned to my computer to make a reservation at a nice restaurant online, my phone buzzed. I had received a text. It was Leah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, dreamer! Wondered if you wanted to go to dinner with me tonight? If you're lucky, you might find out what this new body of mine can do... ;)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit! Leah wanted to go out with me! God, I had dreamed about that for so long! I mean, not premonition-dreamed, but just metaphorically-speaking regular-dreamed. Daydreamed, I guess. You know what I mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah. Leah! But Rachel! Shit! Shit! Shit! Should I cancel the date with Rachel? Tell Leah I couldn't go? What should I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI considered. I really liked Rachel, and she was definitely pretty now, despite her 5'2\" height. Leah was more like 5'6\" and incredibly athletic now. She was pretty too, and I had wanted to go out with her for so long. Leah had a certain sensuality about her. But Rachel was so easy to talk to. I agonized over what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't necessarily have to choose right now, I supposed. I mean, we were talking about first dates here. It wasn't like I was in a committed long-term relationship or anything. I still couldn't believe I'd gone from dateless with nothing on the horizon to having two beautiful girls interested in me! I just couldn't decide who I wanted more. So, keep the options open it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI texted Leah back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't do tonight, but how about tomorrow? I can't wait to check the new body out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to hit send and hope that this didn't screw up my chance with her, when I had another thought. Leah loved the idea of becoming better, stronger, more beautiful. Something like that. So let's throw that in there. I added one more sentence to my text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't do tonight, but how about tomorrow? I can't wait to check the new body out. Especially after Saturday's practice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sent it. Then had second thoughts. What if I didn't dream anything tonight? What if nothing happened? Well, I would just have to deal with it. The text was sent now. My phone buzzed with her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww :( Making me wait, huh? Okay, Saturday it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI practically shot out of my chair with excitement. I had pulled it off! I was seeing Rachel tonight, and Leah on Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, I took Rachel to a nice Italian place. She wore a low-cut dress, and her d\u00e9colletage left me drooling. The date went wonderfully, the conversation was natural and easy flowing. She was fun to be with. We both enjoyed the movie as well. She gushed about how much she had loved it--and our date--afterward. We shared a chaste kiss at the end, and she skipped back up to her apartment, throwing me a last look with a dazzling smile as I turned to walk back to my car. This date was going to be hard to top. Maybe I should just call it off with Leah and focus on Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, soccer practice came Saturday morning...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leah greeted me with a smile on Saturday. I rolled in a little bit late after my wonderful date with Rachel. I didn't remember dreaming last night, though I remembered that this didn't necessarily mean that nothing would happen today. It just meant that I didn't know what, if anything, would. I thought about killing the date tonight with Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah looked so good, with her athletic form, her new breasts, her beautiful face. She had the whole \"mysterious, sexy\" thing going for her that Rachel was just too straightforward and eager to achieve. Bottom line--I just couldn't kill the date. I just couldn't bring myself to end what I'd wanted for so long with Leah before it had even begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe began to practice, and she put that body to work. This time it was Elina that was gasping for breath and trying to keep up with Leah! None of the rest of us were all that close to those two. When we did our four laps around the field in the middle of practice, those two lapped us. Leah very nearly lapped the rest of us twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at Leah. It happened. As she was making a play on the ball, her legs grew longer. She tripped and fell, landing hands first, then swelling breasts second. She looked confused as she lay on the ground, then realization seemed to dawn on her face--a face which was rapidly making the move from beautiful to flat-out gorgeous. She instantly looked up at me. When she noticed me staring, she gave her most beatific smile yet. It was knee-weakening! Wow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she got up and used the two extra inches of leg to catch up to the play and score. She jogged back, looking as much like a fashion model now as a fitness model. She shot me a smoldering gaze, and I had to jog off the field for some water--and to hide my growing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of practice, she came up to me and gave me a passionate kiss, drawing cheers from the rest of the team. After the kiss, she smiled, leaned over to my ear and whispered, \"Thanks! I'll make sure you get a good view of the new bod at dinner tonight. See you at 7:00...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back, bit her luscious lower lip in a mischievous expression, then turned and jogged off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim, one of the other guys on the team, smacked me on the arm and said, \"You lucky dog!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I pulled up in front of Leah's apartment building a few minutes early, so I waited in the car. Leah really, <i>really</i> seemed to love improving. I couldn't believe she had gone from not wanting anything to do with me (outside of friendship), to kissing me publicly in front of the team before we had even gone on a proper date! She was already a beautiful girl, had been before any of this started. I wondered idly why she wanted so badly to be better than she already was. Normally, I would have imagined that someone small and plain--like Rachel used to be--would have that kind of burning desire to be prettier, taller, and stronger. But it certainly seemed like Leah was enjoying it even more than Rachel was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced at the clock in my car and saw that it was 6:59. Time to see Leah. I burst of excitement zipped through me as I wondered what she would be wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to the door of the complex, found her apartment number in the directory and buzzed on their old-fashioned intercom system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's voice crackled over the tinny speaker. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Walt!\" I shouted into the intercom, not sure whether I would be heard if I spoke in a normal voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Walt! I'll be right down...\" Leah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she came down, and the normal first-date butterflies in my stomach turned into eagles. My jaw dropped so fast I was afraid it might have come unhinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was used to seeing Leah at soccer, hair in a ponytail, soccer jersey on, face makeup-free... and she looked great that way! Seeing her in a sexy cocktail dress, hair done, makeup perfectly applied... she was breathtaking. Her light brown hair was done up in a French bun. Her eyes were smoky and suggestive with bold eyeliner and charcoal eye shadow. Her lips were an audacious ruby red, matching the color of her dress and shoes. Her dress was strapless, and, while it didn't show much cleavage, it pushed her now-significant breasts into shapely swells under the taut fabric, commanding my eyes to look in their direction. From there, the dress narrowed to cling to her athletic waist. I had never seen her abs, but the way the dress hugged into her midsection, I could tell they were tight and firm. Her hips pressed the dress outward in delicious curves that my eyes traced from hip to nearly to knee when the dress came to an end. It left just a sliver of tantalizing, tanned thigh before putting her toned calves on display with three-inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeautiful, athletic, soccer Leah had transformed into sultry, sexy, model Leah. She looked elegant and hypnotic. God, was I a lucky man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can breathe now,\" said Leah with a playful, crooked smile, clearly pleased with my reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Because you're breathtaking!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har, har, Mr. Cheeseball Pickup Line.\" she said with a light punch to my arm, soccer Leah showing through a bit. \"Now where are you taking me for dinner on this fine evening, sir.\" she said, batting her eyes as she shifted from soccer mode to mock-prim-and-proper mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall be dining at a fine French establishment. If you would but follow me, miss,\" I said, playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took her to the restaurant, and we spoke and laughed over wine and excellent food over the course of the evening. As the evening wore on, I realized that I was enjoying Leah\u2019s company every bit as much as Rachel\u2019s.  It was different, not quite as comfortable as talking with Rachel, but not at all uncomfortable either. She was just more\u2026 dynamic. More risky somehow. I was not quite as comfortable, but conversation still flowed easily. There was just an underlying sexual tension there with Leah that wasn\u2019t the same with Rachel, as beautiful as she now was. The date with Rachel was somewhat like being with one of the guys\u2014just a very pretty \"guy\". The date with Leah left no doubt that I was with a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we arrived back at her place, she invited me upstairs. The butterflies were back in my stomach\u2026 in a serious way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unlocked the door, and walked in. Before I noticed anyone else in the room, Leah\u2019s expression turned to one of shock, and she said, \u201cVeronica! What are you <i>doing</i> here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah quickly regained her composure, her expression turning icy. She turned to me, and said, \u201cWalt. Meet my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my attention from Leah to look.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I looked at Veronica, I had a much better understanding of Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica was young, and Veronica was gorgeous. Her eyes were the clearest blue I\u2019d ever seen. And her body? Awesome! Even with Leah\u2019s recent improvements, her sister had her outclassed. Her ripe figure and elegant curves belonged on a magazine cover!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah bit her lip in concern as her eyes shifted back and forth between Veronica and me. Was she worried about losing me to her sister? Or that her sister would seduce me? Or that I would think her sister was more beautiful than her... um, I might be guilty on that count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was picking up the vibe that Leah was accustomed to losing some sort of competition with her sister. The confident, sexy girl that I had just hit it off with on our first date (and whom I was pretty sure was going to go to at least second base with me this evening until this happened, damn it!) now seemed nervous and unsure of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica, on the other hand, seemed as confident and as sure of herself as could be. She strode over to me and offered her hand, which I shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you, Walt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise, Veronica,\u201d I said, trying hard not to seem too interested in this girl under Leah\u2019s nervous gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to come to my birthday party tomorrow? I\u2019m turning eighteen...\u201d Veronica said, a glint of mischief in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to say to that. I fired a questioning glance over to Leah, who seemed lost in thought. Leah gave no helpful indication as to what my best course of action was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... sure, I guess so,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t help it! It\u2019s hard to say no to a pretty girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I can\u2019t wait to see you there...\u201d Veronica said with a quick smoldering glance and a wink. Man! This girl had the sexy seductress act down! Was this where Leah got it from? Was Leah where Veronica got it from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica turned to Leah and said, \u201cSee you tomorrow, sis. Don\u2019t forget my birthday present!\u201d Her eyes flashed to me as she said that. I wasn\u2019t sure that I wanted to know what that meant. Or maybe I did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Veronica closed the door behind her, Leah scolded me. \u201cWhy did you tell her you would come to her party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I mean... I didn\u2019t know what to say!\u201d I defended myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah looked angry, though I had a feeling that I wasn\u2019t its actual cause. I just happened to be the one here right now to take the brunt of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then, I guess that I\u2019ll see you tomorrow at her party then, won\u2019t I?\u201d Leah walked over to her door and opened it. It was clear that she was ready for me to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd our date had gone so well...until Veronica had happened. Shit!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I drove home, I thought about Leah and her sister. Should I bail out on Veronica\u2019s birthday party? Go to it? Evidently, Leah would be there. Maybe I could go there, apologize to Leah, and ignore Veronica. That would be easier said than done. Veronica was sooo hot! But Leah was the girl that I had a chance with. Veronica wasn\u2019t. Besides, Veronica was barely 18! I had enjoyed Leah\u2019s company on our date, and couldn\u2019t wait for that display of her new body that she\u2019d been dangling like a carrot in front of me for the last couple of days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Or I could scrap the whole complicated situation with the sisters and just focus on Rachel. She was fun to be with and attractive now. That would definitely be the easier path. Of course, I\u2019d be going to soccer three days a week to be with Leah, who would probably hate my guts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned the options over and over in my mind, until I finally decided what to do. I wasn\u2019t ready to give up on Leah. I was just too attracted to her. She was fun and sexy and tempting, and this whole sister competition thing was too intriguing to just walk away. I wasn\u2019t prepared to let go of Rachel either. I needed to keep things going with both of them until I could really make a final decision on who I wanted most. I had also committed to go to the party, and I kept my promises. If I said I would go, I would go. I would do my best to ignore Veronica and apologize to Leah. I would patch things up. If the whole thing went to hell, then my decision would be made for me, and Rachel it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved at having come to a decision, I slept. I didn\u2019t dream\u2014at least, not that I remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived at Veronica\u2019s party on Sunday afternoon. It was quite an event! Clearly, Leah and Veronica\u2019s parents were well-to-do. The house was a borderline mansion, there were folding tables and chairs setup in the back yard, a band was playing covers of the latest pop hits, and there was a catering company serving hors d\u2019oeuvres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wandered through the back yard, searching for Leah. I was fairly certain that my presence caught Veronica\u2019s attention, but she was in the middle of a conversation with friends, and I made every effort to avoid looking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally saw Leah. She was talking to a middle-aged woman and man. Her parents, maybe? I began to walk toward her. As she noticed me, a slight scowl formed on her features. So much for letting bygones be bygones. Hopefully, my apology would help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited patiently until the middle-aged couple walked away from her. She walked over to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I see that you showed after all,\u201d Leah said, crossly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2014if I say I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019m just here to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes looked slightly hopeful at my comment, but her scowl remained. Did she really think that I just came here to check out her sister? Well, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t mind, but I wasn\u2019t a complete horndog. I was after Leah, not Veronica. I needed to make sure that she knew it. Why was Leah so much this way? She must have lost a boyfriend to her sister before? It was the only explanation I could think of, anyway. Eventually, I would try to pry that story out of her. Today, however, was not going to be that day. I thought about asking <i>why</i> Leah\u2019s sister was at her apartment but thought better of that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry about yesterday. I was just kind of caught off guard by your sister being at your apartment. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say when she invited me, so I said yes. I thought about canceling last night, but I hate doing that when I say I\u2019m going to come. Besides, I knew you would be here, and I wanted to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah\u2019s expression began to soften.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you at all. I thought that accepting an invitation to come to meet your family and seeing you again might make you happy. If I had known that you didn\u2019t want me to, I never would have accepted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah\u2019s eyes began to become a little glassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that our date was perfect yesterday, and I just want to forget about this little hiccup in things, if you\u2019re willing, and move forward. I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah cut my off with a hug. Then, she gave me a quick kiss. \u201cApology accepted. I\u2019m sorry. I know that you\u2019re probably confused, and I\u2019m sorry too. It\u2019s just that my sister and I have a\u2026 history.\u201d She wiped a tear away from her left eye after she released the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeah, would you mind helping me with something?\u201d came a voice from the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Leah said, giving me an apologetic look, then walking back toward the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leah disappeared into the sliding door of the house, I felt a soft flesh press graze my left arm. I turned. It was Veronica. She was standing extremely close to me, the side of her large right breast touching my arm tantalizingly. My gaze shot back from her full breast to her large, beautiful eyes. God, she was so gorgeous, probably the most beautiful girl I\u2019d ever seen in person. Once my brain finished processing, I jumped back, afraid Leah would see us together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, handsome!\u201d Veronica said. \u201cYou\u2019re cuter than most of Leah\u2019s boyfriends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sincerely doubted that were true, but I certainly didn\u2019t mind a compliement from a beautiful girl. \u201cVeronica, look, I don\u2019t think that Leah would like\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026me talking to you. You\u2019re right. She wouldn\u2019t like it at all. I\u2019ve stolen every boyfriend she\u2019s had since I was 13 and she was 17. It\u2019s like a game we play,\u201d she interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into me again, brushing her breasts just close enough to my chest to send charges of sensual electricity straight to my rapidly rising erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her voice to a throaty whisper. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very good at our game\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in Milan next week for fashion week all week, but when I get back, I intend to play for keeps\u2026\u201d Veronica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave me a wink of her long lashes, then smiled like the Cheshire cat, and skipped away to rejoin her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. This girl was all kinds of hot. All kinds of sexy. All kinds of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly remembered Leah and glanced furtively around. I saw the sliding door of the house open, and Leah came out, finding me with her eyes and smiling. I let out a breath. Thank, goodness! She hadn\u2019t seen that exchange between Veronica and me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah came over and nudged me with her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s get something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the party was relatively uneventful, though I did notice that Leah avoided introducing me to her parents. I wouldn\u2019t really expect her to after just one date, and I wasn\u2019t offended at all\u2014meeting the parents is always awkward\u2014but I did notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah gave me a chaste kiss before I left, but I was certain that I had patched things up. At least until her sister came back to town at the end of the week. But I would have to deal with that whole situation then. For now, I was back to being in good graces with both Leah and Rachel. Relieved at how well the day had gone, I went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered if I would have another dream tonight, and if I did, who would I dream of\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These dreams were growing more intense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, I would see Rachel for the first time since our date, and I would see Leah at tonight\u2019s soccer match. I couldn\u2019t decide which I was looking forward to more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was already in the office when I arrived. She looked uncertain whether to kiss me or hug me, probably not sure how I felt about PDA, but I went straight to her and hugged her. I know that girls really love the whole PDA thing, so I went for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clearly the right call. She was beaming when we released the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was the rest of your weekend, handsome?\u201d Rachel said, the final word a bit out of character for her. She was growing bolder as she grew accustomed to her new beauty, I noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was alright, gorgeous. It would have been better if you were with me\u2026\u201d I said with a wink. With all of my recent dating, I guess I was getting better at the flirting thing too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny you mention that. I was wondering if you wanted to come over to my place and watch a movie tonight\u2026\u201d she said, a bit uncertainly. I guess her confidence hadn\u2019t completely caught up to her beauty yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would love to, but I actually have a soccer match tonight. If we win, we usually go out for drinks after too.\u201d I gave an apologetic shrug. \u201cRain check?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I just meet you after the match at the bar? Maybe you can show me off to your teammates,\u201d she said with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d I started, but my boss had approached behind me and tapped me on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of an issue, Walt, and I need you to get on this right away,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the rest of my day on a company emergency. I won\u2019t bore you with the details, but it sucked. I never had a chance to speak with Rachel the remainder of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI missed the entire first half of the soccer match too, but I subbed in during the second half, long enough to watch Elina score once and Leah score twice in our 7-2 win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the match, Leah jogged up to me and gave me a hug and a kiss. She definitely didn\u2019t have a problem with PDA and did not lack for the confidence to express it! There was tongue in that kiss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere were you, lover boy?\u201d she asked, referring to my late arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was tied up at work. Sorry,\u201d I said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork, work, work. Any time for play tonight?\u201d she asked, the spark of hopeful excitement decorating her beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to\u2026\u201d I said. I think she noticed my sudden eagerness because she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy place. After our victory drinks,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds perfect\u2026\u201d I said, leaning in for another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team went to the bar and downed our usual shots of J\u00e4ger. I sat next to Leah, and she leaned into me, her arm draped around my back and on my right shoulder, breasts pressed into my left arm. If this body language were any indication, I was in for a gooood night tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim informed me that it was my turn to go to the bar and get the next round for the group, so I reluctantly untangled myself from Leah and strode toward the counter of the bar. As I walked I heard the telltale jingle of the bell above the door and looked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly fuck! <i>It was Rachel.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She approached... oh how I hoped Leah wasn't looking my way. I glanced back to check, ready to cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah wasn't looking... yet! Thank God! I caught Tim's eyes just as Rachel threw her arms around me and gave me a big kiss. His eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see him mouth \"What the fuck?\" to me with his shocked expression. I shrugged, as much as I was able with Rachel wrapped around me, attached to my lips. The wheels were visibly turning in Tim's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's head began to turn toward me. Tim grabbed her hand and turned her toward him instead, saying something that apparently had her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI relaxed. I owed Tim a beer. Hell, I owed Tim ten beers... which I was sure he would collect at the earliest opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rachel released me, I said, \"It's hot in here. Mind if we get some air?\" I walked her outside--and, more importantly, out of Leah's visual range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you <i>doing</i> here?\" I said, \"Not that I'm not incredibly happy to see you!\" I added. I knew I was startled off my game when I began speaking in double negatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you told me once before where you hang out after your matches, and since we didn't really have a chance to finish talking today, I decided to just come down and meet you here!\" Rachel shrugged, smiling up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And I'm so glad you did!\" I hoped that sounded genuine... and that she didn't detect the slight bit of tension that I knew was in my voice. \"But I was actually just about to leave. Are you still up for that movie at your place tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure!\" she looked slightly confused but still happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! How about you head back to your place and get everything started, and I'll just pop back in and tell everyone goodbye! I'll be right behind you...\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" she said as I gave her a goodbye peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you soon...\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel turned, jumped into her car, which was parallel-parked immediately in front of the bar, and drove off. My shoulders slumped, and I breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a tap on my shoulder, and, instantly tense again, whirled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leah!\" I said, and I kissed her immediately. Leah stiffened in surprise, then melted against me, enjoying the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we pulled apart, she asked, \"Why are you out here?\" She looked around as if trying to determine whether someone was out here with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just needed some air. It was feeling stuffy in there,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you some air,\" Leah said with a wink before devouring my mouth with hers. God, was she ever a great kisser!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we finished, our mouths still within an inch of each other, I said, \"I definitely saw some air. I think that I felt some tonsils and maybe the interior of a lung in there somewhere too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah laughed, and I put my arm around her, walking her back into the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked back to our seats, I told Leah, \"We had a bit of an emergency at work today, Leah.\" That much was true. \"And I just got a text from my boss saying that he needs me to get a couple of things done from home tonight. I know we were planning to spend the rest of the evening together, but I don't think I can. It's why I was frustrated and had to get some air. I'm so sorry, but could I make it up to you tomorrow?\" Okay, so I lied. I'm not proud of it. But I knew that I wanted to be with one of these two ladies, and I still didn't know which one... In the grand scheme of things, one little white lie wasn't so bad, was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's too bad. Yeah, I guess so,\" Leah made an exaggerated frown, turning out her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll have to make it up to me?\" she gave me a sly smile and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a promise,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wished everyone goodbye, quietly told Tim, \"I owe you one, brother.\" Then, I gave Leah a hug and a kiss and went back to my car, zipping to Rachel's place as fast as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rachel answered the door, she was in an over-sized men's t-shirt. It left her sexy legs bare to upper thigh, and her breasts made pleasant swells in the soft cotton. She looked both coquettish and nervous, as if she were trying to look sexy but too nervous to quite pull it off. This is what I loved about Rachel. She was so cute, getting used to her new sexy appearance and everything. Leah could give her some lessons on the proper way to pull off this whole seductive thing, but I really liked Rachel's genuineness, her innocence, her lack of guile. That last thought sent a pang of guilt through me as I remembered my deception at the bar. I really needed to decide between these girls soon. It wasn't fair to them if I didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged Rachel and gave her a long kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love the look,\" I said in a soft, low voice. She blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed her butt through the t-shirt, and she slapped my hand away. \"You are evil!\" she said in mock outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you have to punish me?\" I said with a wink. Her blush intensified. It was so fun to tease her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" she said, trying to play along, clearly not accustomed to banter like this. \"Why don't you lie down on the couch--the movie's ready there anyway--and I'll decide on your punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I said and did as I was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel went to the kitchen and grabbed a bag of popcorn, setting it on the coffee table next to the couch. She climbed onto the couch, on top of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suffocation,\" she said, her voice becoming slightly husky, \"that's what I decided on for your punishment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed me harder than she ever had before. My hands, still for a moment, as she caught me off-guard, finally found the sides of her torso and began to run along her sides, feeling side-boob along the way. My eyes shot open as I stared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This was my dream!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts swelled another inch or two, pushing into me. Her lips became softer as our kiss continued, becoming increasingly urgent and passionate. My hands trailed down to her hips, feeling as they filled out further in sensual firmness. The greatest changes were in her legs, which added six inches of tanned, toned flesh and gave her height comparable to Leah's. My hands roamed their silken length, as my arousal escalated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel ended the kiss to let out a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God,\" she breathed, clearly aroused as well, nipples tenting her t-shirt. The changes in her body clearly magnified her desire, and she was practically panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walt, do you have a condom? I think I want to... you know,\" she said, clearly ready to give into her passion, her desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gorgeous. Finally an even match with Leah. Not as athletic and toned, but clearly more buxom. I really wanted to do this with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I couldn't. I was stringing along two ladies. Two gorgeous, wonderful women. It was one thing to be just dating casually. It was another to take our relationship to another level before I had decided. I couldn't do this. Not unless she was the one... but I wasn't sure of that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy decision might have been different if I were with Leah, but this was Rachel. Cute, innocent Rachel. I couldn't do this to her. Not if it could mean breaking her heart later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! I can't believe I didn't bring a condom!\" I lied for the second time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I should probably have one here too, but I just don't normally...\" she trailed off, embarrassed to say any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kissed her on the forehead, my hand moving lightly to the back of her head. \"It's fine, Rachel. It's probably a little early in our relationship for this anyway. You know what they say... everything happens for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked disappointed--and a little relieved--as we settled down to watch the movie. I put my arm around her, and she snuggled up against me, legs tucked under her. I kept sneaking glances at her even fuller breasts and long, luscious legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered again how I had gotten so incredibly lucky to have shot with a woman like her...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I awoke the next morning in my bed, I knew I had had a dream. The wisps of the dream evaded the grasp of my memory, however, and I couldn't hold on to what it had been. By the time I was conscious enough to really think about it, it eluded me. The dream was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work, I was still dealing with the fallout from the emergency of the previous day, so I didn't have much time to interact with Rachel, but she shot me a dazzling smile each time I passed her desk, which I returned. I'm not sure whether she noticed, but male eyes followed her as she walked past, now that she was taller and looked like she could make a decent living as an Instagram model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still working when she left for the day, giving me a wink as she walked by, but seeing that my boss was at my desk talking with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI needed to turn my attention to Leah. I had bailed out on her the previous night when Rachel had shown up at the bar unexpectedly, and I wanted to make it up to her tonight. So I texted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still pretty hammered at work (still here now), but would like to get together tonight. Maybe I could bring pizza and a glass of wine to your place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm staying at my parents' place this week, but you're welcome to come over. Pizza and wine sounds great. Come in the guest cottage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I had been at Leah's parents' house for Veronica's birthday party, I had noticed the \"guest cottage\" across the back yard, so I knew what she was talking about, at least. I wasn't used to mansions with guest houses--my family, growing up, had not even had a guest room, let alone house! A pull-out sofa was what we had available for guests. I was grateful for her family's guest house, though, as it would allow us a bit more privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wrapped up the work that I needed to do today, ordered pizza for pick-up online, and went to the grocery store for the wine. Once I had picked up everything and driven to Leah's parents' house, I tucked the wine and flowers I had bought under one arm and balanced the pizza precariously in that hand. I used the other to knock before catching the pizza, just as it began to fall. Leah opened the door to see me wobbling an unbalanced pizza box with one had and trying desperately to maintain my grip on both wine and flowers in the other. Her eyes widened, and she grabbed the pizza box to help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was nearly a disaster,\" Leah said with a smile and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda like my work right now!\" I said, grateful for her help. I walked in the door and took off my shoes. The place was elegant, but comfortable, not cold as many modern homes tended to feel. Dark wood and deep reds in the trim and decor helped to balance the bright, harsh white of the walls and floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah looked gorgeous. She had clearly prepared for my visit, with light makeup accentuating her amazing features. She wore one of those tight, form-fitting sweaters that both covered everything and showed everything. Her athletic, muscular legs and ass stretched incredibly tight black faux leather pants into extremely pleasant shapes that my eyes eagerly drank in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set the pizza down on the dining room table, where two candles flickered warm light over her lovely features, then came back to the kitchen to me. I suddenly regretted my choice of meal. Pizza was probably more of a Rachel thing than a Leah thing. Judging by this house, she was probably more accustomed to steak and lobster, but I knew her from her tenacious, down-to-earth soccer personality. I was still trying to understand the wealthy, privileged family side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came back to the kitchen, I set down my phone on the counter to hand her the flowers. She accepted them, smelled them and thanked me, finding a vase to put them in water, while I looked for a wine opener.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed perfectly content with the pizza and pleased with the grocery store flowers I had given her, however. She may be accustomed to the trappings of wealth, she didn't really strike me that way. It was almost as if the beautiful house and grounds were new to her too, not what she was really used to. I was very curious and decided to ask about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leah, I had no idea that your family was so wealthy! Your parents' home is amazing! And a private guest house for us to spend the evening in? I'm not used to this kind of thing! Don't take this the wrong way, but you always seemed so down to earth, not like other rich girls I've known... and that's a compliment!\" I hoped that she wasn't offended, but I was very curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this isn't really what I'm used to. I'm enjoying it, but it really isn't how we grew up. My sister...\" Leah stopped, mouth turning to a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" I said, prompting her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister got a modeling contract four years ago, and that paid for all of this,\" she said, not looking at all happy any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister is a model?\" As I asked it, I realized that it made sense. She had mentioned something about being in Milan for fashion week this week. I just hadn't really thought about it before, thinking it was some sort of rich person thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! She was <i>discovered</i> and signed a huge contract with this major modeling company. Since she's a minor, mom and dad have control of the money, and she wanted them to use it to buy this place, so they did.\" Leah's voice was sarcastic, her expression hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! that's cool!\" I said, trying to think of how to assuage her obvious jealousy of Veronica. \"Have you thought about becoming a model yourself? You're more beautiful than any model I've ever seen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the right thing to say. Her full lips spread into a smile, and the candle light danced in her eyes. her faux leather pants creaked as she walked toward me. She embraced me and gave me a long, slow kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes you're such a guy, Walt, but sometimes you can be so sweet,\" she said. I thought about responding, but decided against it, enjoying the kiss instead. Occasionally, I knew when to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, my phone, which I had set on the counter, buzzed. I picked it up and held it where we could both see. I didn't recognize the number, but when Leah looked down, her face twisted in anger. She began to walk aggressively toward me. I began to back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leah's face blazed with rage, it grew even more beautiful. Her eyes were becoming truly mesmerizing, but her burgeoning breasts were able to pull my gaze from them. She looked beautiful and terrible, her ascending beauty and explosive temper combining to give her the aura of an avenging angel. I was awed by her changed, confused by her reaction, and caught off guard by its vehemence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could properly appreciate the rest of the changes to her body, I realized that she had been walking me right out the door and that I was now outside. The door slammed in my face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ding of a new voicemail came from my phone, and I looked down at the screen as I tried to come to terms with what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held the phone to my ear and listened to the voicemail. It was Veronica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Walter. I'm bored over here in Milan, and I was just thinking of you. I'm thinking of all kinds of things that we could do together. We'll have so much <i>fun</i> together, Walter. I can hardly wait. See you soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck!</i> Things with Leah surely didn't come easily. Veronica always seemed to pop up just in time to mess everything up between Leah and me.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On Wednesday, I was again consumed with work, Rachel's looks in my direction became more frequent and more intense throughout the day, as she was unable to get to me with the constant stream of people and meetings of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday was much the same, except when I excused myself from a meeting to go to the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked past a dark conference room on my way to the restroom, a pair of hands shot out and pulled me inside. The door closed behind me. Lips found mine in the darkness. I breathed in, recognizing the floral smell. It was Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the passionate kiss finally ended, I said, \"Fancy meeting a nice girl like you in a place like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur lips still slightly touching, I felt hers turn into a smile. \"Well, a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do! You've been so busy lately that I haven't been able to get time with my man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Hopefully this craziness will be wrapped up by the end of the week...\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it better be,\" she said in a pouting voice. \"Because I have plans for us this Friday night.\" Our faces were so close together than I could feel the brush of her long eyelashes against my face as she winked in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another movie?\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe as the appetizer... but I think that I'm ready for the main course this time.\" She gave me one more long, passionate kiss, her voluptuous breasts pressing into me in the darkness. I could feel her nipples hardening, poking into me. I could feel my cock rising. I'm sure she could too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My place. Seven. Don't be late...\" With that, Rachel slipped out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remained in there for a few more moments, trying to let my erection subside before I walked back out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday night, I was again late to the soccer match, having been tied up at work again. I watched Leah's entrancing form that looked as if a Victoria's Secret model went a little overboard on her workouts and dropped all of her body fat except in her breasts. I considered further. Okay, maybe her breasts were a size too big to be a Victoria's Secret model too. She was so incredibly sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too bad that she seemed to be going out of her way to avoid looking at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I subbed in for the second half, Tim told me, \"You are the luckiest man ever, my friend.\" He gave me a pound, and I smiled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's expression was cold and clinical through the whole match as she dispatched the defenders that continued to come at her. We crushed the opposing team again, the combination of Elina and Leah insurmountable as they combined for six goals tonight. After the victory, Leah jogged off the field, eyes straight ahead, never once giving me an opportunity to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to the bar aftward, but Leah wasn't there. I kept Tim supplied in alcohol for the night, making good on the debt I owed him for his aid on Monday night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Thursday night, I dreamed of Veronica. This dream was different. I couldn't see her, but I knew something was happening to her. I felt frustrated but aroused. Very aroused. I woke up sweating and feeling nervous. My member was harder than I could ever remember it feeling. I wasn't sure why, and I was a bit alarmed at this dream. It felt more like a nightmare than the pure pleasure of any of the previous dreams. But it wasn't quite a nightmare either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard my phone buzz on my nightstand. I reached over and unlocked it. It was a text. From Veronica's number. A picture with no words. Two lush, ruby lips were pressed together in a kiss that filled the entire frame of the photo. <i>Shit! This girl was trouble. Soooo much trouble, </i> I thought. <i>No wonder she always breaks up Leah's relationships...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to the bathroom, splashed water on my face, and looked at myself in the mirror. It was Friday morning, and I had a feeling that my life was about to get even more complicated.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unsure of whether I'd be working late, I instant messaged Rachel and lined up our next date for Saturday night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least I didn't have to worry about lining up dates around my time with Leah right now. She wasn't speaking to me after that call from her sister during our last date. I wish I did, though. Leah's body looked absolutely incredible at soccer yesterday. What I wouldn't give to touch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walt! Are you paying attention?\" my boss said, looking right at me. <i>Shit! How long had I been zoned out thinking of Leah?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure whether I should try to pretend I'd heard what he said, I finally decided to go with honesty. \"I'm sorry, boss. I was zoned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave me a glare and repeated himself. This time I forced myself to pay attention to the balding man rather than the lush curves of Leah's... <i>Stop that! Pay attention to the ugly little man!</i> I told myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy decision to move my date with Rachel from Friday to Saturday proved wise, as we worked until nearly 8:00 PM to wrap up the terms of the nearly imploded deal. I rolled up the sleeves on my shirt, wrinkled and crinkled from a day of huddling around conference tables and pouring over figures. Hopefully this would be the end of this deal. I was ready to wrap this project up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo tired to cook for myself, I stopped at my usual takeout place for some Chinese. I thanked the cashier and tipped her, then placed the steaming paper bag in my car and drove home. I put my key in the lock of my apartment door and turned. A smell alerted me to something out of the ordinary before anything else could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was floral. Feminine. It smelled <i>really</i> good. Like, <i><b>really</b></i> good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door creaked open, my eyes scanned my living room. They didn't scan for long, however, stopping abruptly at the seductively smoldering silhouette on the couch. Lit by the neon colors of the storefronts outside the window, sleek, sexy curves flowed to a full, ebony mane and ruby lips that smirked in a suggestive semi-smile. My knees went weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Veronica. She was even more beautiful than she had been last weekend. Far more beautiful...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell you\u2019ve certainly been busy,\u201d Veronica purred as she rose from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea that my plan would work so well. You have a very active imagination. I\u2019m so glad I made you the dreamer\u2026\u201d Veronica said, her sensual model\u2019s gait was like that of a panther, languid and predatory. It was simultaneously casual and menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled a hungry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she was gorgeous. I had thought Leah a match for her beauty yesterday, but I had never been so wrong. I willed my mind to think about something other than seductively flowing curves, legs than wouldn\u2019t qui\u2026 STOP THAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had she said about the dreams? She made me the dreamer? She had said something like that with those perfect, luscious, scarlet lips\u2026 STOP! THINK! What did that mean? That meant that she was responsible for the dreams that had so improved Rachel and Leah\u2019s looks? Why would she want that so much? She seemed to be in competition with her sister. Why make Leah tougher competition?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica was to him now, lightly touching her delicious body to his. She smelled so good. Her scent alone was irresistible. The light touch of her breasts against my chest, her nipples\u2026 all thoughts about anything but her slipped out of my mind like water through a colander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica\u2019s lips brushed his in the lightest of kisses, tantalizing. My simmering desire began to smolder with raging heat as this insanely attractive girl stoked its flames with gallons of erotic fuel. I desperately tried to resist, knowing that if I gave in, it would end all hope with Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel the movement of her lips as she smiled a like the Cheshire cat. \u201cSuch a fighter,\u201d she said in a husky voice. \u201cMost men melt into desperate lumps of need before I can even touch them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m glad. Because I like touching you,\u201d Veronica said, dragging a perfectly manicured fingernail along the side of my arm. I shivered with desire, trying not to break. God, how I wanted her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica cocked her head coquettishly, and stepped into me. Her breathtaking breasts swelled into me as she breathed in, her nipples sending tingles of sensation through me like an electric current. My rising member became steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to think of anything else, to try to resist her suggestive body, her enchanting dark eyes, but my need for her was mounting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like kissing you,\u201d she said. Her lips pushed forward, their pillowy softness feeling as heavenly as they looked. Her kissing was suddenly torrid, I felt her teeth clench my lower lip. It hurt. It was ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue undulated along my lips before it found my tongue, swirling and dancing into my mouth, its touch titillating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like having you,\u201d she finished, her lips pausing mid-kiss but still close enough for me to feel their full, slick surface against my own as she formed the words. She resumed her assault on my mouth, but began a slow gyration of her hips, grinding into mine. I was aching for her now, desperate with desire. I would do anything to have her. My resolve was gone. All that was left was want, need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow my pants were off. Lost in her hypnotic touch, her luminous eyes, I didn\u2019t even realize that had happened... I guess. The way things were happening, it was almost like I was in a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! Was this a dream? Pants didn't suddenly disappear like that in real life. As I kissed Veronica, I glanced to the floor. Were they down there? I didn't see them anywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brain began to engage again, now that I understood that I was dreaming--despite the raging of hormones flowing through me from the erotic touch of Veronica's irresistible body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had said something about making me the dreamer, right? I tried to bring my mind back to that thought. If I were dreaming right now, then maybe she was using me to make herself more beautiful. Maybe the benefits to Rachel and Leah were just unintended consequences of my own desires? That seemed reasonable. But what should I do about it? If this dream were any indication, then Veronica was going to be so gorgeous as to be overwhelming to any man (and maybe a decent percentage of women). She would have incredible sexual power... and this might not even be the end! What if I dreamed about her again? What if I dreamed that she could control anyone with her hungry lips, prodigious breasts, endless legs... STOP IT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I started going down that path, I was just going to make Veronica even more beautiful, more powerful. Same thing, I thought, momentarily musing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so Veronica's big rival was Leah. If I made Leah even more beautiful than Veronica, would that stop her? Would that stop the dreaming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure, but I decided that I would rather take my chances making Leah more beautiful than Veronica. At least Leah wasn't as manipulative and power hungry as her younger sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I felt a hand shaking me. I pried my eyelids open. Where was I? What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Leah's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" I muttered, turning my head to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you dream again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" Had I? I didn't remember dreaming. All I could remember was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dreamed of Veronica, didn't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Veronica. Shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he did, sister of mine,\u201d came another voice, but her ambrosial scent told me her identity before I could place the voice. \u201cWhat man wouldn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes found Veronica. They wouldn\u2019t be leaving her anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs \u201cupgraded\u201d as she had been last night, or in my dream--I wasn\u2019t sure which it really was--she seemed even more beautiful now. As I watched her approach, she seemed to grow more gorgeous with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crossed a leg in front of the other in a catwalk gait, it seemed to gain an inch of shapely, feminine muscle. Another step from the leggy beauty; another inch to her legginess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour more steps gave her the most unbelievably sexy legs I could imagine. Leah, athletic beauty that she was, stepped between us. Her head tilted up to look up at a younger sister whose insanely long legs now gave her the height advantage between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica laughed in a dulcet tinkle that sent shivers racing down my spine. Her voice alone could now arouse me more than could any other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah raised a hand to slap her across the face, but Veronica caught it in mid-swing. She laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeah, when are you going to learn? Everything you are, I am and more. Far more now and gaining by the second, thanks to Walt here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah shot me a glance packed with more anger than I\u2019d ever seen from her before. It was almost <i>hatred</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had seen Leah\u2019s performance at soccer. She was stronger than most of the guys on the field. Yet Veronica forced her hand downward with ease. I felt a strange sort of deja vu as I seemed to recall this scene playing out once before. Had it happened\u2026 (gulp)... in a <i>dream</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped to the side, eager, in spite of myself, to see what was happening to Veronica. Her legs seemed to gain another inch in length, looking so smooth and sleek as to appear polished--at least until she moved. Then, striations of muscle seemed to carve into her sculpturesque stems until fading into smooth perfection as movement ceased. Her legs looked strong. Leah\u2019s did too, but after her display with the slap, I was willing to bet that Veronica was far stronger than her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mini--more of a micro now with the growth of her interminable legs--clung to her firm, rounded hips for dear life. The perfect, pert hemispheres of her voluptuous ass molded the tight fabric into breathtaking, cock-hardening curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tight, cropped scoop-neck top left the sculpted ravines of her abs plainly visible. They already looked so exquisitely shredded that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a heavyweight boxer\u2019s best punch came to a swift and sudden end against their ridged perfection\u2026 and their crevices seemed to be chiseling, impossibly, into \u00fcber-perfection under my attentive gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were absolutely spectacular, their succulent cleavage making my mouth water as I imagined tasting the flawless flesh of their upper slopes. By the time my eyes made it to her lips, I absolutely ached for her. Those lips curled into a smile as she watched my languidly rising ogle. I knew it, yet I could do nothing about it. I was helpless under the power of her erotic spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my eyes finally met her magnificent blues, I shuddered under their long-lashed intensity. I couldn\u2019t seem to move. I was hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught Veronica\u2019s hand shove outward in my peripheral vision. I heard the bounce of bed springs. Veronica must have thrown Leah onto the bed. She was no longer standing where she was. I wanted to look, to make sure she was okay. But I couldn\u2019t. My eyes couldn\u2019t leave Veronica\u2019s. They became more and more luminous as I watched.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She moved toward me, leaning to give me a clear view of her burgeoning breasts which were beginning to stretching her top into increasingly interesting shapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Walt,\u201d she said casually as she lingered, luscious body now only inches from mine. \u201cWhat do you like about the new me?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy gaze dropped to her cavernous cleavage for an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh...\u201d What should I say? I liked pretty much everything about the new her, physically anyway.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she said, tapping her toe, bringing my gaze down her lengthening and oh-so-shapely legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed hard and my voice came out hesitant, shaky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well,\u201d I stuttered, \u201cyou have really nice legs.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShould I say anything about my concerns about her seeming enjoyment of her power over me, over her sister? Where was Leah anyway? She must still be on the bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm. Okay...\u201d she said, clearly wanting me to continue. \u201cSee anything else you like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes tried to rise back to her face. They simply couldn\u2019t make it past her breasts. Her absolutely fucking amazing breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour breasts,\u201d I said in a low, slurred drawl that made me sound like some sort of zombie. \u201cI like your breasts.\u201d There. That second time sounded slightly more human and less undead. As I finished speaking those six words with what seemed like extreme effort, I breathed in again. She was so close now that her heady, floral scent was completely overpowering. I began to swoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my breasts are getting pretty spectacular aren\u2019t they?\u201d she said pushing the soft globes into my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t respond. Those full perfect swells sent fireworks of sensation from my chest through my entire being. My powers of speech were gone. I vaguely noticed that my heart was racing as if I had just sprinted 200 meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCat got your tongue, Walt?\u201d she said after a moment, huge eyes staring up at me, delicate finger running down along my arm, rippling another wave of sensation through me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWalt, there are a lot of men that would like to be the one I\u2019m pressed up against,\u201d she purred. I felt her hips roll into mine, touching me as they swelled into erotic perfection. Arousal surged into my cock, making it rise into unbelievable hardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Leah give a soft yelp. Oh yeah! Leah! Please God, don\u2019t let me cum from her sister\u2019s touch right in front of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt Veronica\u2019s silky calf rub against the back of mine, and I moaned audibly. It just felt sooo good. She shifted, and I could feel her hardening nipples scrape across my chest. I quivered. I wasn\u2019t sure how much longer I could hold out against Veronica\u2019s sensual onslaught. My cock was so engorged it was practically bursting, her warm hips brushing against it, sending electric shocks of pleasure to its pulsing tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I felt Veronica rip away from me. As I gaped, Leah\u2019s arm came across her flawless stomach, her shoulder driving into the supremely sexy girl\u2019s body in a tackle. Leah\u2019s momentum carried them both to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah turned her beautiful face to mine and cried out with a level of urgency I had never heard from her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun, Walt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gaped for a second longer before my Veronica-addled brain processed her words. I took off in a sprint out of my bedroom, still in my t-shirt and shorts. I snagged my jacket from the hook by the door on my way out, hesitating at the doorway. Should I leave Leah here alone with her sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI considered. Would I even be able to help Leah in a struggle against Veronica? One look from those insanely gorgeous eyes, and I was toast. I knew it. I knew she knew it too. Leah was Veronica\u2019s sister. She wouldn\u2019t hurt her, right? I decided to heed Leah\u2019s advice and take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran down to my car and put the key in the ignition. Where should I go? I could think of two possible destinations--Leah\u2019s and Rachel\u2019s...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I smiled. Rachel was awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a pleasant surprise on a wonderful Saturday morning!\u201d she said, beaming as she opened her door, dressed in just an oversized t-shirt. Her legs, bare to upper thigh, look absolutely amazing. Her face looked positively radiant too with that gorgeous smile on her lips. I walked right in and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you, Rachel,\u201d I said, then released the hug to hold her shoulders. \u201cI have something to tell you.

She said that she \u2018made me the dreamer.\u2019 Of course, I\u2019m not really sure whether she said that to me in reality or in a dream. I\u2019m not even entirely sure that it matters anymore. I just\u2026\u201d I rambled before trailing off. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say next. I wasn\u2019t sure what to <i>do</i> next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! What? Leah\u2019s sister? Veronica? Who exactly are we talking about here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s right! Here I was talking to Rachel about people she didn\u2019t even know! I was just so rattled by all of this. As I gathered my thoughts, I caught a scent that seemed familiar. It smelled of flowers and vanilla and all sorts of pleasant\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOLY FUCK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica! That was her scent. I let go of Rachel and whirled just in time to see Veronica saunter through the open door to Rachel\u2019s apartment. Stupid! In my unsettled eagerness to see Rachel, I hadn\u2019t even closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my eyes revealed Veronica\u2019s new appearance to me, I felt a click as my jaw muscles involuntarily went limp and gravity swung it open unresisted. She was divine, an absolute fucking goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dazzling eyes shifted between Rachel and me, and to my surprise, she strolled right up to the shocked, t-shirt-clad girl and kissed her deeply, amused eyes finding mine. What the hell was she doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had I involved Rachel in all of this? She actually seemed to be kissing Veronica back! Was Veronica so spellbindingly sexy that no one could resist her? I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to. My knees were weak from her scent alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my cock rising and turning to iron Rachel seemed to lose herself in Veronica\u2019s succulent lips. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I felt a thrill rock me, and I flung a hand to the wall to help me stay upright. Veronica was impossibly sexy, and\u2026 oh my God! How was it possible? She was still growing sexier before my eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica\u2019s legs added another shapely inch\u2026 then another. I watched her take her rounded calf and slide it up the outside of Rachel\u2019s smooth, sexy leg. Rachel\u2019s head tilted upward as she kept her lips on Veronica\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched Rachel\u2019s breasts bulge outward inside her shirt as Veronica\u2019s firmer, larger breasts swelled into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica took her slender fingers and pulled the other girl\u2019s shirt over her gorgeous body, the cloth breaking their kiss for a mere second as it rose over Rachel\u2019s head. She flung it to the side, leaving Rachel naked, save for her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a soft moan come from Rachel as Veronica\u2019s body continued to tighten and lengthen. I think I moaned too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica wrapped her arms around Rachel\u2019s lower back and pulled the now-shorter girl into her heartbreakingly perfect curves. Rachel gasped as her feet left the ground, and Veronica walked her into her bedroom, lowering her with ease to the soft sheets. I watched Veronica\u2019s incredible display of strength with a hard gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to glide over Rachel\u2019s body, every kiss from her magnificent lips causing the older girl to shudder. Rachel\u2019s eyes were closed, but her long eyelashes fluttered with every one of Veronica\u2019s punctuations of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I stalked toward Veronica, drawn by the magnetic pull of her sensuality. I reached around her and pulled her over to land on her back next to Rachel, who was still quivering from escalating waves of rapturous sensation, close, probably to climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lunged my mouth at hers. She gave me a Cheshire smile a split second before my mouth crashed into her heavenly lips. I savored their pillowy softness as they seemed to caress mine. I knew why Rachel had been so overwhelmed by them. And her scent. Her celestial fragrance gave me goosebumps as it bathed me in concupiscent feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly of their own accord, my hands reached down to her top and tore it open. She wore no bra, and her impossibly gorgeous breasts bounced free of their confines. I suckled her nipples, feeling them harden under my suction and darting tongue, as my hands felt their way down her elegantly sloping contours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica was so fucking gorgeous. My heart raced. I couldn\u2019t resist, couldn\u2019t pull away. I felt Rachel stir to my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt Veronica\u2019s plush lips push into my neck, her tongue licking my flesh. My iron, engorged cock, pressing into her smooth, slippery inner thigh, practically vibrated with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt Veronica moan into my neck as much as heard it, her husky purr sending vibrations through my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Rachel nibbled on my ear, sending still more fireworks of sensation into me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy vision dimmed as blood rushed everywhere in my body\u2026 other than my head. I almost couldn\u2019t take the pleasure, fighting to maintain consciousness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I\u2019m not even sure what happened next. My mind was lost in a shimmering haze of sensuality. I ran my fingers over her silky skin. My shirt was off. My lips traced voluptuous curves. My pants were gone. Veronica\u2019s crimson lips fondled my upper body. Her sexy, slender legs clenched me in a sinuous snare of satin steel.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI spasmed for the first time as my tip touched the delicious entrance to the sensual inferno within her. I felt her full lips smile against my cheek on their way to my ear. I heard a sultry whisper that electrified my body with its tantalizing purr. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop now, lover boy. Wouldn\u2019t you just love to truly make me the woman of your dreams? Just imagine what I could truly become...\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI shuddered as I thought of it: Veronica transforming into the wicked enchantress of my deepest, darkest carnal desires. I couldn\u2019t visualize it, couldn\u2019t even comprehend it, but something primal within me lusted to turn her into consummate sexual perfection. It knew how, and it <i>wanted</i> this.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGod help me. I gave in to it. Rippling tendrils of my desire coiled around her body, tasked with making the nubile girl even sexier than she already was. I felt a flare of heat from her skin as the shadows of my soul began to mold her into the final, living embodiment of my most visceral erotic dreams.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe let out a throaty moan, barely audible at first but gradually becoming louder and more urgent.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI watched as her breasts, perfect before, rounded into hypnotic hemispheres of irresistible feminine power. I sculpted the flawless complexion of her face from breathtaking to awe-inspiring.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHedonistic euphoria wracked her, sending her body into a rivetingly provocative dance over the sheets. I watched her slim, willowy arms writhe in elegant grace, her sleek abs twist in suggestive clefts and striations.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy hands, underneath the muscles of her toned back, felt it round into polished perfection. As she squirmed in my grasp, however, my fingers slipped to the upper slopes of her spectacular ass. I felt my dick swelling to titanic proportions again as I pressed each digit into its supple splendor. Her strong legs gripped me with impossible strength, slithering and quivering like liquid steel as she angled her hips into my rigid shaft.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI sucked in a tremulous breath, her rapturous scent intoxicating me. My body responded in animal fashion, the sensory bath of her erotic perfection driving primordial instinct that I could no longer control. I plunged my hips into her as her sizzling body shaped itself into increasingly obscene levels of perfection.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI felt the searing heat of her insides surround me; I felt her torrid breath on my skin as she gasped. I drove myself into her, her panting moans punctuated by shrieks. She was incredibly tight, her inner walls clenching me with excruciating force, grinding against my cock as I thrust. Ecstasy and pain whirled into a mind-blowing vortex of dark elation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer wailing voice had a velvet, mesmeric quality now, gaining orders of seductive magnitude as powerful as her body. Every groan of pleasure from her succulent lips blasted thrills into my overtaxed heart, which was beating faster than I had ever imagined possible.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy hips thrust harder, slamming into her delectable core with all the force my body could muster, burying me to the hilt in her taut, blazing folds.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs my tip smashed into her womb, I exploded into her ravishing body with a euphoric scream of my own. Her head rocked back, midnight hair splayed in a whirling maelstrom around her, and she came with the earth-shattering force of a dark goddess coming into her full power.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI had nearly forgotten about Rachel until I heard her cry out with a climax of her own, perhaps from simply watching the two of us.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy attention swiftly turned back to Veronica quickly, however. It was impossible to remain distracted from the enthralling lines and smoldering touch of her divine form for long. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter a few moments, her quaking, crunching abs began to relax. My eyes found hers as they flashed in the blackness. She bit her lower lip with sharp, brilliantly white teeth as her eyes bore into mine with such intensity that it bordered on ferocity. She breathed out a sultry snarl.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI felt her move beneath me with liquid, feline grace. The slithering movement--and the impossibly perfect shape of her body brought me to raging hardness even in the immediate aftermath of two successive climaxes. She felt unbelievably strong, far stronger than me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe moved like a predator, flipping me to my back and sliding over my body with the languid tension of sleekly powerful muscles. My heart fluttered with anticipation as the charged contact between her soft flesh and mine thrummed with electric sensation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe undulated down my torso, the exhilarating curve of her breasts dragging down my chest and stomach as her spherical derriere rose into my line of sight. Her scarlet mouth kissed each brick of my abs as it was my turn to squirm under her touch.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer eyes met mine as her mouth approached my cock, savage passion burning inside them. Our eyes remained locked as she slipped the fullness of her moistened lips over my shaft, enveloping it in steaming ecstasy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe moaned as she took me into her mouth, her sultry voice vibrating my cock even as her long, nimble tongue savored it like a confection. I felt the rapidly building pressure of another climax coming under the onslaught of her overwhelming ministrations.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy vision dimmed as I realized I had stopped breathing, my entire body consumed with aching need for this girl as she coaxed arousal out of every cell within it. I sucked in a lungful of air as she dragged her bottom teeth along the underside of my dick.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe slipped her mouth off my shaft, just as I was about to explode, and I quivered silently in near-release. She held her sensual lips a millimeter from my tip, so close that I could feel their warmth but not their touch. I gasped out a raspy plea.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe smiled hungrily but didn\u2019t move. As my need for release simmered, her hot tongue darted out for a quick swirl. Then it was gone, leaving me, impossibly, even closer to climax. I waited in exquisite torture at the razor\u2019s edge of bursting. This time, her pink tongue licked me like an ice cream cone. I teetered at the brink.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d I whispered, unable to speak properly as a ball of trapped desire lodged itself in my throat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer blood-red lips curved into an enigmatic smile, cobalt eyes dangerous. As I whimpered in blissful agony, she ran her tongue slowly around her lips until they glistened in the darkness. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWithout warning, she dove her moist lips down my entire length, I shrieked as her oral stimulation set every nerve ending on fire.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI screamed as my entire body tensed at once. My back arched, and my muscled arms clutched feminine perfection, pulling her toward me. I convulsed in carnal joy until I passed out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nVeronica was too much for me now. She was probably too much for anyone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But there she was - naked and beautiful as ever. As sexy as she looked when Veronica was overwhelming her. And that's when it began. A long, shapely, impossibly desirable leg snaked around Rachel's waist and then began to run down her legs caressing them with it's perfection. And before my eyes, that perfection bled into Rachel's amazing legs, taking them to the same awe-inspiring length and splendour. A hand and arm then came around Rachel's waist from each side and began trailing up her mid section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverywhere the hand touched was graced with the spectacular abs that would make a bikini model weep with envy. Further up they continued to briefly cup her full breasts, molding them into a march for Veronica's in every way - and then further up still they drew her arms above her head as one hand traced each arm to draw them out into the sexiest limbs I'd ever seen, save for the legs attached to the same torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the face of Veronica pressed through Rachel's own face, reshaping it in the devilishly sexy form that had so recently overwhelmed my senses with those blessed lips. The only trace of Rachel that remained was that the tresses flowing behind her head were a rich chocolate and not a midnight black. And when her eyes opened they were hungry and all consuming. They drew me to her faster than my legs could carry me and I found myself drawn into a passionate kiss I could not break despite it just being our lips pressed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had dreamed Rachel into a form as desirable as Veronica, I thought with joy, as I felt her tongue assault my mouth with passion for but a moment before she broke the kiss and looked me deeply in the eyes and I realised that what looked back was no longer Rachel. My dreams of Veronica were so powerful I had just made Veronica herself a contagion inside my head - as I looked at my dream Rachel and knew that she would become this in reality when next I saw her.

I thought of Veronica's soft, full breasts pressing against him and imagined that Leah's were that and more, expanding into feminine perfection. I thought of Veronica's tender lips, hungrily consuming my own, then made Leah's even sweeter and more supple. I thought of Veronica's rounded hips, pressing against mine with forceful exuberance, and I thought of Leah's athletic body and made it stronger, her hips curvier--even more dynamic than Veronica's. I felt Veronica's sexy, sinuous legs snaking against my own, and I made Leah's even longer, shapelier, sleeker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Leah in my mind's eye and imagined her as the one against me, the one all over me in passion. I could barely contain myself, but somehow I managed. My God, she was a sight to behold. If Helen of Troy was beautiful enough to start a war over, Leah could inspire a nuclear holocaust. Had I overdone it? I didn't really care. I wanted so badly to see her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something strange happened. I was still in the dream for the moment, and despite just having elevated Leah to goddess-like beauty, my thoughts turned instead to Rachel. I thought of her as the breathtaking beauty she now was. I thought of her down-to-earth attitude, her comfortable banter, her wholesome brand of sexiness. In spite of the seductive power of the dueling temptress-sisters Leah and Veronica, I was even more drawn to Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned in my dream as I thought about her geeky enthusiasm and her increasing confidence with her new beauty. My heart swelled as I thought of her, and I knew, for the first time, in the middle of a ridiculously hot make-out session with Veronica, after just imagining Leah a sexual goddess, that I was in love with Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo figure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't even want to change her any more. She was already so beautiful, so fun to be with, such a good person, that I just didn't have a desire to do it. I just wanted to be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the verge of climax with Veronica, I felt my desire for her outrageously sexy body wane. I needed to wake up, to get to Rachel, to tell her I loved her. The thought consumed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica, in my dream, pulled back, noticing my sudden drop in enthusiasm. She cocked an eyebrow and gave me a confused look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke in my bed in the middle of the night in a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped up and ran to the living room. Veronica wasn't there. I rubbed the back of his head, ruffling my hair. Okay, it really had been just a dream. Glancing down, I realized I was naked. With that realization came another. It was cold in here. Really cold. I walked back to my bedroom and sat on my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, what should I do now? I knew the answer as soon as I asked the question. Find Rachel. I needed to get to Rachel, to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I looked down at my naked, sweaty body and shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so maybe a shower and some clothes first. Then, Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the bathroom and started a hot shower, looking forward to warming up in the steamy torrent of morning water as I thought about what I would say. I practiced my speech to Rachel, my profession of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter my shower, I put on my clothes and combed my hair. I left my house, and headed to Rachel's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pounded on her door, running my speech through my mind one more time. After a minute, I heard footsteps come to the apartment door and saw the peephole darken. Then, I heard the sound of the door chain sliding and the deadbolt unlatching. The door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was there--gorgeous, sexy, awesome Rachel. Her eyes were half-open in the groggy haze of a 3:00 AM awakening, and she was in the middle of a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI forgot my speech, took her in my arms, and kissed her passionately. She stiffed, then relaxed and kissed me hungrily back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked her to her bedroom, our mouths and bodies locked together the entire time. We made love. At 3:00 AM. Our bodies making more clear to each other how we felt than words ever could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we finished, I said simply, \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy arms pulled her delicious curves tightly against my body, and I smiled as she kissed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later, as I went the coffee maker to make Rachel and I some coffee, I looked at the headline as I opened the news app on my phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supremely Beautiful Sisters Take Modeling World by Storm, Compete for Sexiest Social Media Star!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, got up, and kissed my beautiful Rachel as she walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank God I had chosen her.</span></div></div>",

I had already dreamed of Veronica once since the last time he'd seen her - and now I'd already spent much of the night dreaming of her. And my foolish attempts to replace her image with that of Leah, all it did was further emphasise the difference between Leah and my new dream Veronica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to how I had been worried about going down the path of making Veronica more beautiful I realised I was well down that path already. This dream form of Veronica was already controlling me - manipulating me - easily turning my thoughts always back to her. Her hungry lips, which my dreams could make able to devour men's souls. Her prodigious breasts, which my dreams could make even fuller and more intoxicating. Her endless legs, which my dreams could make longer and shapelier yet. I could turn Veronica from a veritable goddess into a true goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered if it was true what dream Veronica had said - about her making me a dreamer. If she knew the power she would have over me, and knew the end result. A lilting laugh drew my attention and I began to wake. That floral scent - more intoxicating than before greeted me and I remembered that I had come home to find Veronica in my house. The wildly gorgeous Veronica from the start of my dream had been no dream. Sometime during that encounter I must have passed out and began to dream. And with that recent image of Veronica's perfection, how could I hope do do anything but dream of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the sound of her laugh drew arousal from the very core of me - forcing me to open my eyes.</span></div></div>",

A voice that was the sound of wind through beautiful chimes, and the roar of a sea of ecstasy all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, lover, while you didn't melt into a pool of desperation before I could touch you, it seems one kiss melted you into vivid dreams.

I want to haunt your dreams - you knowing you're making me more beautiful and sexier, but unable to see the effect. And when you're awake, seeing the impact my increased beauty is having on the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I heard a door open and close and realised I'd been paralysed with lust the entire time that voice spoke. Could Veronica be right - could she be so beautiful now that I'd only ever be able to dream of what she looked like, I'd never in my imagination be able to envision her more beautiful? What did she mean by the impact she would be having on the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than before I knew that I had to do something about Veronica, even if my body was still betraying me with feelings of ecstasy from the memory of her kiss.

Their names have power over them, boss told me once. That\u2019s how he calls them, I think. I decide to give this one a name. How about Roy? Roy McThunderdick. I look at his large penis, feeling laughter welling within me, but I surpress it. Laughing at a demon would not go well for me.  It dulls the fear for the moment, though. A slight smile leaks out to my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon\u2014Roy--cocks his head. \u201cNot even scared is she? She\u2019s smiling and trembling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I can sense the reason for her tremble. It is not fear, it is lust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy smile disappears. Oh, fuck no! My fear is back, with a vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, young one. I do not do\u2026 <i>that</i>. Do I appear as if I need to?\u201d he gives a dazzling smile. My arousal jumps to new heights with his smile and his masculine scent, which I am beginning now to smell. He seems to know what I am thinking or, at least, feeling. I am beginning to feel moisture between my legs. <i>Thank the maker,</i> I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe won\u2019t do at all,\u201d he turns to my boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord, she won\u2019t do <i>as she is</i>, but I have heard that your kind can\u2026 how should I put this\u2026 <i>make alterations,</i>\u201d my boss replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, that <i>would</i> be interesting, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d The demon begins to walk around me. I feel the hairs on my arms rise as his gaze washes over me from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery interesting indeed,\u201d he says as if considering. I wish I knew what they meant, but I stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis delicious smell intensifies. I\u2019m dripping now. I want him so badly I can barely stand. What <i>is</i> this demon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has some willpower, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Roy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d my boss acknowledges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, it shall be as you suggest,\u201d the demon says. His smell seems to instantly fade, and I am able to remain standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy boss hands Roy a knife. He flicks it across his finger. Blood wells up. Roy walks over to me and holds his finger in front of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrink it up, girl,\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do <i>not</i> want to do this. I <i>really</i> do not want to do this. But I know I have no choice. I look up at him. I know my eyes are expressing fear, disgust. I don\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI place my lips around his finger, and I drink.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As his eyes traced the sexy lines of her nubile figure, he was suddenly very glad he had joined Candace and her close friends for this party at the quarry pond. He didn\u2019t normally attend these sorts of things, but they would be going to different colleges in a few weeks, and he wasn\u2019t sure he would have another chance to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had had a crush on Candace since the eighth grade. Nearly everyone at school had known it since the Valentine\u2019s Day incident of 2016, Candace included. Since that day, she had loved to tease Sam, giving him tantalizing glimpses of her developing, gorgeous body at every opportunity throughout high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shriek erupted from Megan nearby. Sam\u2019s attention was pulled from his reverie to see the playful aftermath of something. From the red mark on Megan\u2019s firm, swimsuit-clad butt, Sam guess that Rob had pinched her. He grinned. Those two were always enjoying frisky flirtation. Why couldn\u2019t he have that with Candace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew the answer, of course. Candace was the untouchable beauty, school president, captain of the cheer team, wanted by everyone and had by no one. She had gone on the occasional date, never lacking for suitors on homecoming or prom. But she had never developed a serious relationship. He hadn\u2019t either. He had never wanted anyone but her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, the quarterback of the football team and one-time Candace homecoming counterpart, handed Sam a beer. Sam had never had one before, and he almost refused. A surge of what-the-fuckness on this, his final opportunity to see Candace, made him accept it. He cracked the can and gulped a mouthful. It tasted awful! Seriously? This is what beer tasted like? Why on earth was the stuff so popular?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughed at Sam\u2019s sour expression, slapping him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProud of you, man! We\u2019ll make a proper partier out of you yet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded to the affable athlete, his pursed lips relaxing into an easy smile. He couldn\u2019t prevent his gaze from wandering back to Candace, whose shapely calves were disappearing under the water as she waded in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt followed Sam\u2019s gaze to the beautiful girl in the pond. He leaned down and mussed Sam\u2019s hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it up, man. Better men than you have tried and failed. Namely me\u2026\u201d Matt plopped in the sand next to Sam. His longing gaze looked remarkably similar to Sam\u2019s as both young men watched Candace continue into the warm water, which was now up her slender waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara came up behind them both, smacking them on the backs of the heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDumbasses,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone knows Candace is gay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Matt, grabbing her arm and pulling her on top of both guys with a tangle of toned, athletic limbs. Mara was the school\u2019s star soccer player and self-proclaimed class clown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tickled her flat stomach, and she flailed, kicking Sam in the face a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d he said, annoyed as he skittered further away. \u201cGet a room, you two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt ceased tickling for a moment, turning to Sam to respond, when he noticed something dropping from the sky. It looked like a person! No, there were white wings! Was it a bird? No, it was a person. Two people! Locked together in some kind of struggle. The white wings seemed to be tangled with black wings. Was it two parachutists who had tangled their chutes? It had to be. They must be white and black parachutes, partially ejected. They just looked like wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could really get a proper look at the falling figures, they crashed into the surface of the pond with a huge splash. The pond glowed with a swirling black and white pattern as a pulse of what appeared to be electric power crackled over the surface of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace gave a startled cry, then slipped beneath the rolling wave from the parachutist strike in the center of the pond.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rooster tails of sand flew behind each foot strike as he instinctively raced toward the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was up nearly as fast. The two splashed as they ran to thigh-deep water, then dove in. They swam to Candace\u2019s last location, swallowed one last breath, and dove downward. Spotting her quickly, they snaked their arms around each side of her limp form. Securing their quarry, they kicked hard, driving upward until they broke the pond\u2019s glimmering surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth young men extended one arm with the other wrapped around each of the beautiful girl\u2019s bare shoulders. They swam their precious payload to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they dragged Candace out of the water and onto the beach, Matt looked directly at Sam and gave him a quick, questioning nod, breathing heavily from exertion. Then, he gave a brief tilt of his head toward the pond and slapped his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gave a quick nod in reply, understanding exactly what he meant. Upon receipt of Sam\u2019s nonverbal reply, Matt sprinted back into the lake to find the two parachutists. Sam turned his attention to Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the urgency of the situation, Sam felt a thrill shoot through him at the prospect of giving the beautiful girl mouth-to-mouth. He mentally chided himself. He needed to focus on saving her life right now, not his own desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed his lips to hers, forcing his mind to the task, not the sensation. He began heart compressions as the others formed a circle around him. Sam gave a silent prayer of thanks that his gym teacher had required CPR certification as part of their requirements as he lowered his mouth to hers once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam removed his lips from hers a second time, Candace sputtered a splatter of water right into his face. Never in his life had he been so glad to be blasted in the face with water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace twisted her svelte abs and cleared her lungs of the remaining liquid into the sand. Giving Candace a bit of space, Sam permitted his relieved eyes the reward of a momentary linger over her glistening curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she was gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her coughing subsided, grateful emerald eyes found his. Tunnel vision enveloped Sam\u2019s gaze, only her warm, beaming eyes existed for a long moment. Until she reached up and pulled him into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s lips broke into a huge grin, his eyes aflame with delight as her breasts touched his bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Sam,\u201d she whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould this day turn out any better? Candace in a bikini? Beach party? Candace in a bikini? Beer? Rescuing his dream girl from the brink of drowning? Okay, he could do without the beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he thought of Candace in a bikini already? Hugging him? Grateful to the boy who had saved her life? Yeah, that. And that. And that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace heard his exhale and released the hug. Her eyes found his inane expression, their corners crinkling in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, are you okay, Candace?\u201d Mara asked, reminding Sam that the rest of the world outside of Candace did, in fact, still exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s grin began to fade as he realized that Mara\u2019s reaction was probably more appropriate than his. It didn\u2019t diminish entirely, however. This was much too marvelous a day for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace. Bikini. Hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose three mental images would keep a smile on his face for a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group heard a splash and five pairs of eyes turned back toward the pond. Sam sprang back to his feet, remembering that Matt was still out there attempting to save lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to be struggling to pull something to the surface of the water. Apparently, he couldn\u2019t do it, though, because he slipped back under the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam dove back into the water to help the athletic quarterback. Sam submerged and scanned ahead as he swam. After a moment, he spied Matt with a tangle of bodies in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his eyes, the tangle vanished! He paused mid-stroke in utter astonishment, then continued toward Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt didn\u2019t need help getting himself to the surface, however. A shocked expression on his face, his cheeks puffed to release a few bubbles. After glancing around and below for his lost targets, he kicked upward. Sam surfaced with him, took a deep breath, then both of them swam down, searching the area down to the pond floor, finding nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more such fruitless sorties, both boys swam back to the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you find them?\u201d asked Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d huffed Matt between breaths. Sam shook his head in confirmation, dropping to his knees as he gulped air. \u201cThey were there\u2026 and then... they were\u2026 just\u2026 gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned his palms toward himself and examined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatcha doing? Your hands okay?\u201d asked Megan, furrowing her brows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Matt, dropping his hands suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob and Mara helped Candace to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to go to the hospital, Cand,\u201d said Megan to her friend. \u201cYou stopped breathing for a minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel fine. Great, actually\u2026 Thanks to Sam here,\u201d said Candace, bathing him once again in the warm glow of her dazzling smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget Matt,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth of us pulled her out of the water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded at Sam, appreciating the acknowledgment. Candace\u2019s eyes never left Sam, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right! Nice work, both of you. You saved her life!\u201d said Mara. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Sam enjoyed the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob cut her off with a trademark pinch of her toned ass. Mara whirled and smacked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!!!\u201d she cried in mock outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob gave her a crooked grin as Megan took Candace\u2019s elbow and guided her back to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the gang brushed off sand and hustled to the cars as well. As they pulled out of the parking lot to head toward the hospital, bubbles rippled the surface of the pond.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you certain that her heart stopped?\u201d His eyes rose again to drill Sam with intensity. His mouth curled to one side as he awaited the young man\u2019s response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I think so\u2026\u201d Sam said uncertainly. \u201cIt all happened so fast!

There just\u2026\u201d He stopped suddenly, glancing around, noticing that he was speaking his thoughts aloud. In front of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor spun suddenly and walked away from the group of friends, his white lab coat, swishing around his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was weird,\u201d said Rob, hand working its way down Megan\u2019s lower back toward her shapely ass. She slapped it away, giving him a <i>\u201cnot right now!\u201d</i> glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. She definitely wasn\u2019t breathing. I mean, who checks each vital carefully when your friend is laying there <i>dying</i> on the fucking ground!\u201d said Mara, laying a hand in the center of Sam\u2019s back and rubbing circles of comfort into him. \u201cYou did good, Sam. You did really good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned to her and managed to turn the corners of his mouth into a fleeting smile while he focused the majority of his attention on ensuring his chin didn\u2019t quiver. He just hoped Candace was okay. Baffled doctors weren\u2019t a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said a silent prayer for the target of his unrequited affections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wish I knew what happened to those parachutists,\u201d said Matt, rubbing the outside of his bulging bicep compulsively, his expression troubled. His face was flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too,\u201d said Sam. \u201cI saw them for a minute, but then they just\u2026 vanished into the water. It was so weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you guys are real heroes anyway, saving Cand and all,\u201d said Mara moving to comfort Matt next. \u201cBy the time I realized what was going on, you guys were already in the water!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shifted uncomfortably, and Megan took his hand in hers and squeezed, sensing his guilt over not helping the others. She knew the reason--he couldn\u2019t swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt swooned momentarily, then sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d asked Mara, grabbing his arm to steady him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Fine. Just a lot to take in, you know?\u201d Matt smiled weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Mara. Sam and the others nodded their agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more hours, the friends were draped over the waiting room chairs in various stages of bored, trepidatious, faux-relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Candace!\u201d said Mara, seeing the doctor coming back out, Candace in tow, a worried parent clutching each of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friends leapt up, bodies instantly taut with the internal turbulence of anticipated news even as their expressions went slack with relief upon seeing their friend upright and headed away from the emergency room entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s father walked up to Sam, plucked his hand from his side and gripped it with his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, son,\u201d he said with grateful eyes and a weary smile. \u201cFrom what Candace says, I owe you my daughter\u2019s life. I won\u2019t ever forget that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, too stunned to speak, simply stood there, shaking the man\u2019s hand weakly. The older man nodded as he released Sam\u2019s hand, then moved to Matt to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt Candace\u2019s eyes on him. He returned her gaze, unsure exactly what he found in her eyes. He held her eyes in silence for a long moment as her father walked back to her and joined his wife to walk their daughter out to their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam let out bated breath as their eye contact finally broke. What had that look meant? It had been intense, sending his stomach writhing. He had never seen anyone look at him like that before. It was\u2026 confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, he followed the others, who were now chatting and moving toward the exit to the hospital waiting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s mind continued to work on the puzzle that was Candace\u2019s look as he made his way home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Candace\u2019s iridescent eyes lingered in his groggy retinas, an unsettling vestige of turbulent dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay on his bed for a long moment, consumed, as he often was, with Candace in his waking mind. His memory drifted down her bikini-clad body, relishing the delicious sight of the sexy, soon-to-be-coed before all of the craziness yesterday. His breathing grew deeper as he felt the thrill of arousal quicken his heart. He lay on the bed, lost in the hazy remnants of his covetous subconscious as it played desirous cinema through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips pressed against hers urgently, the tension of the life-giving moment metamorphosing into a different sort of excitement in his fantasy-shaded memory. He quivered with exhilaration, held taut by the strings of infatuation like a dancing marionette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped his hand downward to rub himself when the spell that dream-Candace had woven around him was suddenly shattered by a knock on his bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up, sleepyhead!\u201d came his mother\u2019s voice. \u201cBreakfast\u2019s ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to indulge himself, but no longer in the mood, Sam slid his legs off the bed and stood on wobbly legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly slipped on a comic book on this way to the dresser, kicking it away. It skittered to a halt across the room. Arriving at his dresser, he put on some sweats over his underwear and slipped a t-shirt over his bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he plopped at the kitchen table, his mom circled him and ruffled his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Sam,\u201d she announced affectionately. \u201cSaving that girl and all? You\u2019re growing up to be quite a young man. You remind me so much of your father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s heart rose at the former and fell at the latter of his mother\u2019s words. He had never known his father, a firefighter who had died rescuing a family in a final act of heroism. Sam swallowed away the lump in his throat, attempting to forget the well of emotions that his mom\u2019s words had tapped as he picked up his fork to dive into the steaming pancakes before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a large mouthful, his mouth forming a crooked grin as he chewed airy, maple-soaked goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, mom!\u201d he mumbled as he took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother simply watched him eat, proud warmth crinkling upward the corners of both eyes and lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam slammed the car door shut, making his way past clusters of uniformed people, sand shifting under his feet. As he approached the pond, he saw the divers coming out of the water shaking their heads. The lead diver pulled off his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he told the surly police officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn. That Matt kid said he was certain they had to be in there somewhere. Said he had \u2018em in his hands\u2026\u201d The large man responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam stepped toward the lapping water, he drew the cop\u2019s annoyed attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing? he said, pointedly, to Sam. \u201cGet away from there! Did you see the police tape?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPolice tape?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it! Murphy! Did you forget to put up the damn tape again? We\u2019re expecting to find bodies for God\u2019s sake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother man, presumably Murphy, piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me to\u2026\u201d The senior man cut him off, still staring at Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to tell you every little thing to do? Now put up the Goddamn tape!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, kid, get lost. Police business,\u201d he said to Sam, pointing back toward the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hung his head and complied. It was too bad. For some reason, he thought that if he were present for the discovery of the bodies, it might give him some closure on the world-rattling trauma of yesterday\u2019s extraordinary events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached his car, he watched Matt pull up in the space next to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said as Matt got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Sup.\u201d Matt surveyed the scene, grimly watching Murphy struggle to untangle police tape that was caught on some bushes at the edge of the beach. \u201cThey find \u2018em?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sam said quietly. \u201cThey tried divers, I think, but they came up empty. I think I heard someone say they were going to try dragging the pond next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt said nothing, staring ahead toward the hurried uniforms on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt remained silent for a long moment, not looking at Sam, eyes still unfocused, gazing directly ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel\u2026 strange,\u201d he said. \u201cEver since yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too,\u201d replied Sam. \u201cSeeing all that? Not finding those parachutists? It\u2019s got me feeling pretty weird too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t just mean emotionally. I mean physically too,\u201d said Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhysically?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt seemed to break out of his trance and finally looked toward Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-forget I said anything, \u2018kay?\u201d he said, eyes darting between Sam and the sand at his feet a couple of times as he spoke. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Matt got back in his car and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooookay?\u201d Sam intoned aloud. That was\u2026 odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked to his own car to leave, he heard the ding of a text message on his phone. He fished it out of his pocket and looked at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was from Candace.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wanna come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s thumbs trembled in excitement as I texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! W&amp;w?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMall @ 3\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC u then\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace had asked him to go to the movies with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Candace</i> had asked <i>him</i> to go to the movies with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh. My. God.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Mara would also be there did nothing to temper his enthusiasm. He was going to see Candace again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe beamed as he got into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam paced in front of the theater as he waited for the girls to arrive. Getting there twenty minutes early was probably a little overboard, but he didn\u2019t want anything to prevent him from meeting up with Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked his phone. No texts. It was 3:01. Where <i>was</i> she? He mentally chided himself for the thought. <i>One minute? You\u2019re seriously going to worry about her being a single minute late?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked up, he caught sight of them, Candace\u2019s hair glowing like satin embers in the afternoon sun. She was deep in conversation with Mara as they climbed the steps to the theater entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Candace saw him, she smiled. Sam reflexively returned it with a lopsided grin of his own as he studied her viridian eyes. The look appeared again, maybe not as obvious as before, but it was there nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bit of mischief, a bit of gratitude, and a bit of something else. He couldn\u2019t quite\u2026 No! It couldn\u2019t be, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a look he hadn\u2019t seen in her eye before, certainly not for him. He shook the thought away. Wishful thinking. That\u2019s all it was. If he wanted to see desire, he should just think of her and look in the damn mirror. Then he could see what <i>desire</i> looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara\u2019s eyes moved from Sam to Candace and back again. Her mouth momentarily fell open before she clamped it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was <i>that</i> all about? What had Mara noticed? Could Sam have been right? Had she seen desire in Candace\u2019s beautiful eyes too? He was going to have to have a chat with her if he could manage to get a moment alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for coming, Sam, my knight in shining armor\u2026\u201d She let those words sink in, a coy look on her face, before continuing. \u201cMara here wants to see Bloody Murder 3, but I was thinking more along the lines of Teen Shenanigans Part 2. Maybe you can break the tie?\u201d she asked, holding her hands behind her back and twisting slightly from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed conservatively, but it was difficult to hide the swells of her nubile breasts behind anything, let alone tight, thin fabric. Could she make it any harder for Sam to concentrate, pushing them outward like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d he said, tearing his eyes away from Candace and focusing them on Mara, so he could recover from his vision-induced bout of babbling idiotitis. \u201cHow about Teen Shenanigans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s smile broadened as she turned toward Mara, a victorious sparkle in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? Sam has good taste. He doesn\u2019t go for that lame slasher movie stuff.\u201d She gave him a wink. Were her lashes thicker? Sam had spent many hours memorizing Candace\u2019s features, and he had always thought of her eyelashes as thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Like that dumbass, raunchy comedy is going to win an Oscar or something,\u201d said Mara in mock outrage. \u201cBut whatever. If you guys want to see an insipid high school comedy written by some fifty-seven-year-old guy in Hollywood, so be it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friends bought their tickets and popcorn then walked into the theater to take their seats. Finding the seats that matched their tickets, they sat down, Candace in the middle, Mara and Sam to each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s skirt slid up her leg as she wriggled into the seat, giving a tantalizing view of the milky skin of her upper thigh. She didn\u2019t seem to have noticed. She didn\u2019t brush the cloth back down, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam glanced sidelong at her legs, attempting to evade notice. It didn\u2019t work. She noticed anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, with a questioning smile, turning toward him, inadvertently shifting her skirt further up her thigh. Sam fought the urge to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. Just wanted to make sure you\u2019re comfortable,\u201d he recovered nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, silly. But thanks for checking,\u201d she said with a grin, then shifted toward Mara to continue their debate the relative lameness of teen romcoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention elsewhere, Sam was free to ogle her slender legs. Which he did. As often as possible. All movie long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie, Candace ran off to use the restroom, and Sam had his chance to question Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMara, outside the theater, when we first met up, you seemed surprised for a minute. What was that all about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara\u2019s eyes widened briefly at the unexpected question, and she paused for a moment before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just thought I saw something. No big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What did you think you saw? Was it me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah it was you. You were looking at Candace like a lovesick puppy! I almost had to throw you a doggie treat or something,\u201d she said with a wicked grin. \u201cBut that\u2019s not\u2026\u201d She trailed off, expression changing to look almost troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what?\u201d Sam said, growing exasperated by her reluctance to come out with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that I thought I saw something in Candace\u2019s expression, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaw <i>what</i> already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace was walking back toward us. If Sam didn\u2019t get her talk now, he would lose his opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe seemed into you for a sec. I know, crazy right? Candace is never into anybody...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace came within earshot then, and Sam couldn\u2019t ask Mara any more details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara greeted her and the two got to talking again. Sam\u2019s world tilted as he absorbed Mara\u2019s words, confirmation that he hadn\u2019t been imagining things when he\u2019d seen her look himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould Mara be right? Could Candace actually be into him? He staggered behind the two girls, thoughts swirling in a tantalizing vortex, as they walked toward the mall to grab a bite to eat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were bickering about food choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you eat that stuff and keep that figure of yours!\u201d said Mara. \u201cI\u2019m playing sports all the time, and I think I still have higher body fat than you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Candace shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you want to eat? Please don\u2019t tell me you want a salad or something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about Chipotle?\u201d Sam chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls turned to face him, both considering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a bad idea\u2026\u201d said Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d said Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get a table first,\u201d said Mara, winking at Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam saw her wink and gave her a questioning look. He didn\u2019t get it. Mara rolled her eyes at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Candace sat down at the table, but Mara remained standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the food mule. I know what you want, Cand. How about you Sam? Burrito? What are your toppings of choice?\u201d Mara winked at him again. Sam simply gave her another clueless look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam rattled off his preferences, Mara circled behind Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished, he noticed Mara mouthing words in exaggerated fashion. She was using both hands, raised over Candace\u2019s head to point to her. It looked as if she were trying to pound the same letter on a keyboard with each index finger repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dude! This is your chance!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam finally understood what Mara was telling him. His heart swelled in gratitude as she left to get their food. Then it plummeted to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, my God! The pressure was on. Now he had to a few minutes to do something to impress Candace. Or maybe ask her out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis palms began to sweat as he fidgeted with his fingers under the table, the pair sitting in awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was completely blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was blowing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 how are you doing since the whole\u2026 you know\u2026 thing at the pond.\u201d <i>Smooth. Real smooth. Fuck!</i> Sam fought the urge to clunk his head on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace reacted unexpectedly strongly to the question, lips curling downward and eyes darting down to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling\u2026\u201d she started before pausing to shift in her seat. \u201c...kind of <i>different</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDifferent? How?\u201d asked Sam, nervousness fading as his curiosity rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, um, don\u2019t really know how to explain. Sometimes I feel lighter\u2026 like more positive, more grateful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace still didn\u2019t meet Sam\u2019s gaze. Sam had never seen her like this. She was usually so confident. She normally had this friendly aloofness that made her approachable but not relatable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had asked her about how she was feeling\u2014a routine question, really\u2014she had become hesitant and unsure of herself. It was so unlike her. She seemed to want to say more but was having trouble getting it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ve also been having these <i>thoughts</i>, you know\u2026?\u201d A blush blossomed on Candace\u2019s cheeks, but she seemed to be forcing herself to continue. \u201cL-like, um\u2026 God, this is so embarrassing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Candace? You can tell me\u2026\u201d Sam attempted to help her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt backfired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace met his eyes briefly, then looked away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Really. I\u2019m fine.\u201d She gave an insincere smile and crossed her arms under her breasts, making them more visible under her movement-tightened top. Sam hadn\u2019t realized quite how big she was getting up top. Her breasts had always been nice, but they seemed fuller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara arrived with a tray, and Sam let out a breath. It was the end of his moment alone with Candace. He now had more questions than answers. And he hadn\u2019t impressed her. And he hadn\u2019t asked her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had begun to confide something in him\u2026 though he wasn\u2019t entirely sure what. That was something, though. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara looked from one to the other and furrowed her brows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBurrito time, guys!\u201d she announced, shrugging away her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate their burritos, chatted for a bit, wandering through the mall, then went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sam flopped in his bed to think over today\u2019s events, his phone dinged with a text from Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWTF happened lover boy? Xoxox XD\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFU\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat good huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe started to talk then got embarrassed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo no xoxox?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFU\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLol\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause for a few minutes, then another text from Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU me Cand tomorrow her house at 3. Thank me later\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeeling sick. *Cough* *Cough* Might just be u2 ;)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU = rockstar\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\":)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam cracked a huge smile.

Do you know if they found those parachutists?\u201d came Matt\u2019s voice on the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe people who fell into the pond! Do you know if the cops found their bodies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d said Sam, growing more awake by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019ve been feeling weird ever since I touched them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. Just more extreme, I guess. And when I was lifting this morning with the team, I could lift like way more than normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat <i>is</i> weird. What do you mean by more extreme?\u201d Sam sat up in his bed. Matt had his attention now. Hadn\u2019t Candace said something about feeling strange as well? Maybe their feelings were related...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026 nevermind. Anyway, let me know if you find anything out, \u2018kay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hung up the phone and thought about Matt\u2019s words for a moment. He was feeling strange. So was Candace. Matt said he was stronger too. Maybe that was unrelated. It sure didn\u2019t seem like it would have anything to do with the events at the pond.  Candace hadn\u2019t mentioned anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam thought back to two days ago at the pond. When those skydivers had hit the water, there was a static electricity discharge or something in the water. That\u2019s what had stopped Candace\u2019s heart. Or at least he assumed that\u2019s what it was. It had all happened so quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his chores around the house, Sam looked at his phone. It was 2:00! He had an hour to shower and get ready to see Candace. There were two texts as well. Both from Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMember 3pm\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Cough* :)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled. Mara was so awesome. He felt a surge of appreciation for the athletic girl. She was going out of her way to help him with Candace. She always was a bit of a matchmaker, and he guessed that the appeal of finally setting up Candace with someone appealed to her. It was like the ultimate matchmaking challenge. He was just glad she had decided that he was the best candidate! It didn\u2019t hurt, he supposed, that they had been friends since pre-school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam showered, donned his favorite t-shirt and shorts, then sprayed a few puffs of the cologne he\u2019d received as a graduation present. He didn\u2019t want to overdo it, hence the t-shirt and shorts, but he did want to make a good impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to Candace\u2019s house. She didn\u2019t live far away, and he was there in a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gathered himself for a moment, smoothing out his shirt and checking his breath before ringing the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the door practically flew open, a surprised Candace standing in the doorway. She seemed to recover quickly, smiling and moving to the side, motioning for Sam to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in, Sam. I\u2019m glad you could make it,\u201d Candace said. She was wearing a green tank and white short shorts, and she looked <i>amazing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the invite\u2026 unless Mara was making things up\u2026\u201d Sam smiled at her, focused on keeping his eyes on her face\u2026 which wasn\u2019t particularly difficult, since her complexion was looking more flawless than usual today. Candace laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMara actually said she was sick\u2026 but I think she just wants to see Matt. I think those two have been going on runs together or something. She was all thirsty for him this morning after she saw him with his shirt off. Called him \u2018Mr. Nummy.\u2019 She\u2019s so funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Mara\u2019s great,\u201d said Sam, laughing as he imagined Mara drooling over Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked into Candace\u2019s bedroom, she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can sit on the bed if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam did as indicated. Rather than take her desk chair, the only other seating option besides the bed, Candace sat next to him on the bed. Sam felt his pulse begin to race as a long, silky leg touched his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace brushed a lock of her ginger hair behind her ear, shifting slightly toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a guy in my bedroom before. Especially not one as good-looking as you\u2026\u201d Candace placed her hand on his arm, her eyes finding his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam jumped up from the bed, suddenly uncomfortable. This was <i>so</i> unlike her. It was also too good to be true. He had barely dated in high school. And now the school\u2019s hottie extraordinaire\u2014looking better than ever\u2014was coming on to him? What was going on here?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh my God,\u201d said Candace softly. She looked absolutely mortified, eyes on the floor, crimson circles growing on her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sam. I don\u2019t\u2026 I-I don\u2019t know what\u2019s getting into me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Believe me, I don\u2019t mind! It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Sam searched for the right way to say this. \u201c...<i>this</i> doesn\u2019t seem like you. That\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been feeling weird since the whole thing at the pond.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace rose from the bed and walked over to the window, staring out through the glass, fingertips touching it lightly as she continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting these... urges.\u201d Her voice was so quiet that it was barely above a whisper. With her facing away from him, Sam had to strain to hear her. Clearly, this wasn\u2019t easy for her to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspecially around you\u2026\u201d she gave him a hesitant glance and a brief smile before turning back to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. I just\u2026 I feel so grateful. I mean, you saved my life and everything, so it makes sense, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at him timidly again, seeking confirmation. Sam nodded, eyebrows high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve just been feeling really, um\u2026\u201d She licked her lips. \u201c...<i>sexy</i> lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe circled the bed until she was on the side opposite Sam. Her eyes met his, not looking away this time. There was something vaguely predatory in that look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince the pond, you said?\u201d Sam didn\u2019t know what to say. Those were simply the words that escaped his lips. At least he had said something. He had been worried he might just stand there looking at her dumbly. She had clearly been expecting a response\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace seemed both slightly pleased and slightly disappointed at his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I just feel different in all kinds of ways,\u201d she said, her eyes losing some of their intensity. She clasped her hands in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStronger?\u201d Sam wasn\u2019t sure why he said it. Matt\u2019s words from this morning\u2019s phone call had been percolating in the back of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam thought about telling her that Matt was experiencing the same thing, but he liked his new role as Candace\u2019s confidant. If he told her Matt was going through the same thing, it was likely that would change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he were truly being honest with himself, he didn\u2019t want to send her to such a good looking rival for her affections either. Thinking quickly, he managed a different response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe door. When you first let me in. You really pulled that thing open hard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace blushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that obvious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 but your reaction was,\u201d Sam said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI really need to get used to it. I broke my toothbrush handle this morning too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on her door. Sam heard Candace\u2019s father on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, you have a doctor\u2019s appointment, hun. We have to leave in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! Thanks, Dad!\u201d Candace called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Sam. I forgot all about that! The doctor wants to see me again to go over the results of some of the tests they were doing, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. Talk more later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! I\u2019ll hit you up tonight.\u201d She smiled. A little too widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Candace led Sam out of her room, he noticed her father\u2019s eyes on him. He waved. Her father waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam pondered his interaction with Candace, mulling the whole thing over in his mind time and time again as he drove. She seemed far more forward than she had ever been. But she also seemed embarrassed by that. Her behavior had seemed to pendulum from shy to flirtatious. He remembered the doctor saying something about her hormone levels at the hospital. Maybe that had something to do with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must just be having a strange reaction to nearly dying. That <i>had</i> to be pretty crazy, right? Sam could only imagine the impact that might have on him. But the strength thing was a little weird. Maybe leftover adrenaline from the events of the other day? He\u2019d heard of some pretty incredible feats of strength by people in life and death situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled into the parking area by the pond, he was distracted from his thoughts by a man in black standing outside the police tape. There didn\u2019t seem to be any police here. Just him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam got out of the car, and the man turned toward him. When he did, Sam noticed the white trapezoid along his collar. This man was a priest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood evening!\u201d he told Sam, extending a hand. Sam shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame to you,\u201d said Sam. He searched for something to say but couldn\u2019t think of anything. He hadn\u2019t been expecting to run into a priest here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad they closed off the pond, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said the priest, thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I was hoping to find out whether the police found the bodies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh they won\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t\u2014find anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? I was there. I saw them fall in. They have to be in there somewhere.\u201d Sam thought back to when they had just seemed to disappear from Matt\u2019s grip. He had assumed that it was because of the haziness of the water. But maybe\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d The man smiled cryptically. The corners of his eyes didn\u2019t crinkle. \u201cI must be going, but it was nice to meet you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Father Ryan. It\u2019s very nice to meet you, Sam. Good evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched him go. What was <i>that</i> all about? He wondered if Father Ryan was right about the police not finding the bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Sam got back in the car. This whole thing was becoming stranger by the hour.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Candace had said she would call him, right? He debated whether to call her. It was almost 9:00 PM. No. She had clearly said <i>she</i> would call <i>him</i>. He just needed to be patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if she didn\u2019t?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam put his hands on his head and leaned back in his chair. This was useless! He had read the same page of his orientation packet a dozen times and still had no comprehension of what it said. His mind was clearly elsewhere\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fumbled for it instantly, knocking it to the ground. It rang again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it!</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rang a third time as he got out of his chair and ducked under his desk, fishing around with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it rang a fourth time, his hand brushed against it. He pulled it out. It was about to go to voicemail! He hit the green button just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d he said, breathless from his brief struggle with the phone\u2014and the excitement of finally receiving the call he\u2019d been waiting for all evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! Catching you at a bad time?\u201d asked Candace, probably picking up on his huffing and puffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all!\u201d he said, a little too eagerly. He mentally kicked himself. <i>Calm down, you idiot!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to call so late, I just got some news from the doctor, and my parents and I weren\u2019t exactly sure what to make of it. They\u2019re pretty worried, and I\u2019m a little freaked out too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d Sam\u2019s heart lurched at the possibility that there might be something wrong with Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, really. They just said they found something unusual with my blood. They want me to do a bunch more tests. They said that it wasn\u2019t like I had a disease or anything. They apparently aren\u2019t really sure what\u2019s going on with me. I feel great, though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your parents are worried?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re like freaking out, even though I keep telling them I feel totally fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you tell them what you told me? About how you\u2019re feeling and stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding? Of course not. They\u2019re already in overprotective mode. If I tell them about anything strange, they\u2019ll assume that it\u2019s a sign of my imminent death or something. They\u2019ll probably never let me leave the house again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. If I were them, I\u2019d probably do the same thing.\u201d Sam cursed himself mentally. That was a stupid thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, \u2018cause you\u2019re my guardian angel,\u201d Candace said, her voice taking a husky, velvet tone that sent shivers all the way to Sam\u2019s fingertips. Okay, so maybe that hadn\u2019t been such a bad thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause as Sam tried to think of what to say next. The change in Candace\u2019s voice had made him think of a lot of different things. Words weren\u2019t among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the part where you ask me out,\u201d said Candace, her voice now turning more playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsk. Out? Was this for real? Three days ago, if this phone conversation had happened, Sam would have believed he were being pranked by a radio station. Okay, so he still half expected a \u201cjust kidding\u201d coming in the near future. But that was a risk completely worth taking for the mere possibility of a date with Candace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did you have in mind?\u201d Sam said. He didn\u2019t want to suggest something she didn\u2019t want to do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner maybe? Tomorrow night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Absolutely! How about 7:00?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great! See you then. I promise I\u2019ll wear something nice\u2026\u201d she said, her voice taking on that same sexy purr for the last part. He could practically hear her wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was sweating as he hung up the phone. This was beyond his wildest imagination. The girl he\u2019d had a crush on for the last four years was practically asking <i>him</i> out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flopped on his bed, butterflies not only fluttering but having a full-on flapping contest in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart was filled with that best kind of dread imaginable.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he checked, he saw that it was from Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise :)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could respond, he heard the doorbell ring. Shit! That must be Mara!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished putting on his pants and ran out of his room to answer the door. As he was pulling the handle, he realized he\u2019d forgotten to put on his shirt. Oh well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara\u2019s mouth opened to say something, but as her eyes dropped to his bare chest and abs, it snapped shut again without a word. After a short moment, her eyes returned to Sam\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when did you get to be Mr. Nummipants?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have pecs and abs, buddy! And they\u2019re pretty nice!\u201d said Mara. \u201cYour arms could use some work, though. Kinda skinny\u2026\u201d She wrinkled her nose, nudging him with her shoulder as she came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt a blush rising. Freaking Mara!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the sitch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sitch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith Candace, dumbass!\u201d she said with an evil grin. \u201cYou tap that yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s blush deepened. His face had to be crimson by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going on a date tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Mara looked as if she were waiting for a punchline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMFG! You\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you!!!\u201d Mara\u2019s eyes were wider than he\u2019d ever seen them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sam said, grinning, desperately hoping his blush would fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck your bad self out, lover boy!\u201d she said with a wide grin. \u201cI get the assist, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, yes! Thank you so much, Mara! You are the greatest friend in the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara\u2019s grin widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove is in the air, I guess\u2026 I have my own date tonight\u2026\u201d she said, eyes alight with obvious happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongrats!

Wow! You must really like him!\u201d Sam teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara smacked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at Sam\u2019s room, Mara plopped on his bed, bouncing on the bedsprings.

Who knew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam picked his damp towel off the dresser and threw it at her. She caught it and flung it back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, though. I\u2019m asking you <i>because</i> you\u2019re a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you looked pretty good in that bikini the other day\u2026\u201d said Sam with a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d she said, then growled in mock-exasperation. \u201cDid you not hear the word <i>serious</i> in my statement?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! I don\u2019t know! Guys like boobs and butts and legs and pretty much anything you want to give us a view of!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I should dress like a slut, then\u2026\u201d she said, a mischievous twinkle in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Don\u2019t you always?\u201d Sam said, unable to contain his laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara grabbed his pillow and flung it at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucker! That\u2019s it. I\u2019m leaving. Some help you were!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smacked him on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cText me later. Let me know how it goes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRT\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam nearly crashed the car as he pulled up to Candace\u2019s house. She was absolutely incredible! And incredibly distracting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a tight white dress that hugged every curve and white sandals. Her breasts, which looked far larger than they had even yesterday, jiggled as she ran toward the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped in before he could even get out to hold the door open for her, giving him a brilliant smile. He noticed in his peripheral vision that the short, tight hem of her dress was pulling up again, uncovering precious inches of her sleek thighs. That sight was only peripheral because the majority of his attention was focused on her mouth-wateringly delicious cleavage. Her breasts bulged over the low-cut top of a dress that was clearly made for a less impressive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached her slender fingers over to Sam\u2019s thigh and squeezed as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go. I don\u2019t want dad to see me wearing this while I\u2019m out with you. He won\u2019t be happy. He\u2019s pretty protective\u2014especially these days\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost didn\u2019t comprehend what she said, her cleavage and fingers as distracting as anything he could think of. Her words sinking in after a long second, he pressed the accelerator and began driving toward the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers didn\u2019t leave his leg as he began to drive, however. Instead, they rose even higher on his leg, progressing toward his crotch. He felt his pants begin to bulge as her warm hand moved closer. He glanced over to her nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long lashes\u2014significantly longer than they were at the movies when he had first noticed\u2014 were half-lowered, her eyes focused on her rising hand. She was leaning toward him now, giving him an even better view of her magnificent breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a honk and turned his eyes ahead just in time to swerve back into his lane. Candace didn\u2019t seem to have noticed that he had crossed the center line into oncoming traffic. Thank God for small favors! Insted, she was too intent on the movement of her fingers, now so close to his package that he could practically feel them touching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair on the back of his neck rose in anticipation. <i>What was she doing?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to think the same thing at exactly the same moment because her hand suddenly shot back to her own lap. Sam stole a glance at her. She was staring straight ahead, shrinking into her seat, clearly mortified. She clasped her hands tightly together\u2014so tightly that the skin on the back of her hand around her fingers turned white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey said little on the rest of the drive to the restaurant. Candace seemed preoccupied by her own thoughts, and she had certainly given him plenty to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they pulled up to the restaurant, however, she seemed to relax. They both climbed out of the car when they arrived, and Sam got his first proper view of her in her revealing dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes lingered over her hourglass shape\u2014was it more exaggerated than he remembered? His eyes found supple hips flaring from a firm, tiny waist and breasts that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam suddenly realized he was blatantly ogling her. His eyes flashed up to hers, which, fortunately looked merely amused and not annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctors said that I have massive amounts of estrogen and some other stuff that they\u2019ve never seen before in my system,\u201d she said, coquettishly. \u201cI guess it\u2019s causing some changes to my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking vaguely embarrassed, she reached behind herself and scratched at her upper back for a moment. When she finished her eyes moved to something on Sam\u2019s upper chest. She walked up to him and  brushed a piece of lint from his shirt, then looked up at him and smiled. He noticed that the top of her vibrant red locks came up to his eye line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re taller!\u201d Sam said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my legs have been growing\u2026\u201d she said with a seductive wink before turning and climbing the stairs to the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...And they\u2019re not the only things that have grown</i> he thought, as he watched the perfect spheres of her backside shift their way up the steps before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching her swinging hips for a moment longer, he rushed to catch up with her, then scurried ahead to hold open the door. She nodded to him in acknowledgement as she walked inside. Sam smiled at Candace briefly before advising the hostess of his reservation. She grabbed two menus and took them to their seats.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Candace took her seat, her posture upright and rigid. As her eyes found Sam, they were warm and friendly, containing none of the fire that he had seen earlier in the car. They certainly didn\u2019t seem like the same eyes as those of the girl who had been moving her hand up his thigh. Her body language and behavior were all over the place right now. He didn\u2019t know what to make of it. It made him wonder again about her doctor\u2019s appointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said something about the doctors finding \u2018other stuff\u2019 in your body before. What other stuff did they find? Are you going to be okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace seemed to appreciate his concern. She placed her hand on his. He still felt a bit of a thrill from the skin contact with a beautiful girl, but with accompanying eyes that were affectionate rather than fiery, it didn\u2019t have quite the same impact. It did, however, set him more at ease. She felt\u2026 comforting\u2026 right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. They found something that affected the body sort of like adrenaline, and another thing that might be changing my RNA... or maybe DNA\u2026 or maybe the RNA was changing my DNA\u2026 I don\u2019t remember. I couldn\u2019t really follow it all. They didn\u2019t seem worried, exactly. More like curious. Excited even. They said they had never seen anything quite like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pretty young waitress stopped beside their table to take their drink orders. Candace paused in her explanation to order an Italian soda. Sam just ordered water. It was less expensive and healthier. He was surprised that Candace had ordered a sugar-packed drink. She was usually a bit of a health nut. He supposed that she might need some extra calories to support all the growing she\u2019d been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes dropped again to her luscious figure and the way it filled out her dress. She was beginning to look as if she should be auditioning for television roles and modeling gigs rather than heading off to a dorm room on a college campus in a couple of weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid the doctors say that anything might be affecting your personality?\u201d Sam gave her a slightly pensive look, unsure how she would react to the unsubtle implications of his words. He did want to know, though. She certainly hadn\u2019t been acting like her normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she said, the look in her eyes transforming. The friendly warmth in them changed as her eyelids dropped slightly. Her chin lowered, her eyes remaining locked on him in what almost looked like a challenge. He felt a bead of sweat form on his forehead under the intense heat of her gaze. \u201cDo I seem different to you? Better? <i>Sexier</i>?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers dug into his hand like painful claws, but, Lord help him, he welcomed the pain. Something about how she was looking at him made it feel\u2026 wonderful. She gave him a Cheshire smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you like the new me. I can <i>taste</i> it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam blinked in surprise. His reaction seemed to jar her, and she straightened again, the fire in her eyes extinguished. Her grip on his hand relaxed, though she left it, covering his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCandace, I hope this doesn\u2019t upset you, but you have been acting really weird tonight. I\u2019m a little worried about you. You\u2019re just not acting like yourself!\u201d There. He\u2019d said it. He didn\u2019t want to ruin his chances with Candace, but he couldn\u2019t just say nothing, could he? What if something were wrong with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t offended at all. In fact, she seemed eager to discuss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThank you so much, Sam. I really appreciate how you\u2019re always looking out for me and taking care of me. You\u2019re such a good friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes left his to focus on his hands as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>have</i> been feeling strange since the day at the pond. Sometimes, I feel on top of the world, like everything is wonderful, like I could just rise up from the ground and\u2026 <i>fly</i>... or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a fleeting moment, Sam almost thought he saw a faint, hazy, white outline of what looked like <i>wings</i> behind her. It was gone before he could be certain, however, evaporating into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther times, I feel so dark, so aroused, so\u2026 <i>sexy</i>... I can barely contain myself.\u201d Her eyes darkened for a moment as she finished her sentence, flicking back to his with almost palpable fierceness. It quickly faded, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s just some kind of side effect of my heart stopping or something?\u201d she finished, emerald eyes remaining on his expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sat there, open-mouthed, unsure what to make of what he had just seen. It was as though two different sides of her personality were being pulled apart and magnified, and she was penduluming between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to be imagining things. His mind was probably playing tricks on him in his concern for Candace\u2019s health. A <i>lot</i> had happened to him these last few days. He\u2019d had to save Candace from drowning. He\u2019d started hanging out with Candace and Mara. He was on a freakin\u2019 date with Candace for goodness\u2019 sake! <i>Candace!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was bound to loosen his grip on reality a little, right? It\u2019s not like girls grew suddenly prettier over the course of a couple of days. It\u2019s not like outlines of wings magically appeared then poofed away. It\u2019s not like his dream girl would suddenly be coming on to him after four years of aloof obliviousness to his obvious crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was his subconscious doing cartwheels and making him exaggerate things, see things that weren\u2019t actually there. It had to be. She was acting a little strange after having been through a near-death experience. That\u2019s probably why she had agreed to go out with him too\u2014some sort of feelings of indebtedness. It\u2019s not like they had really done anything beyond touch hands, though after all. He was just reading too much into it. Some combination of wishful thinking and stress. It all made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam let out a breath, his shoulders slumping slightly. He hadn\u2019t realized he had been tensing them, but he <i>had</i> been getting pretty worked up as they talked, he supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I think that\u2019s exactly what it is. We should probably just take it easy tonight and relax. You\u2019ve been through a lot these last couple of days, and the strange news from the doctors probably has you ill at ease.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace smiled at him and squeezed his hand in appreciation, withdrawing it, however, as the waitress approached the table to take their orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like two orders of spaghetti\u2014with the garlic bread on the side\u2014and a bowl of soup, a side salad, and some breadsticks. Thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress scribbled it all down, then glanced uncertainly over to Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, did the lady order for both of you, or\u2026\u201d the waitress asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was kind of wondering that himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no. I\u2019m just really hungry tonight\u2026\u201d said Candace with a smile. The waitress gave her an appraising look. Sam could almost see the wheels turning. <i>How did she eat like THIS and look like THAT?</i> He stifled a laugh and gave her his order, grinning in spite of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I have the linguini please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like a side salad with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace shrugged, then grinned as the waitress walked away in bemused wonder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think Dad wants to delay it as long as possible. He still thinks of me as his little girl,\u201d she smiled, her eyes becoming radiant and distant. \u201cHe\u2019s so sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was reading my orientation materials earlier today. It\u2019s a lot to get used to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s eyes focused on him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is. But we have time before all of that. I\u2019ve been thinking about volunteering at the church some before I go. To leave a positive mark on this place before I move on, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Wow! I never knew you were so into that kind of thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been. But as I think about leaving, it just feels <i>right</i> somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell good for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace looked at Sam imploringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was kinda hoping you might join me\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019d love to! I\u2019m all for any chance to spend more time with you before we head off to school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam winced internally. He didn\u2019t want to come across as overly eager. He should probably be trying to play it cool right now. So much for that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace giggled and clasped her hands together in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad!\u201d she said. Her face seemed to take on a slight golden glow. It was probably just the lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hands across the table on his again for a moment, pulling them back as their food arrived. As various plates and bowls were placed in front of her, covering every available inch of table, she flushed red and shrugged. Sam laughed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should volunteer at the food bank instead, so you can, um, snack\u2026\u201d he winked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blush deepened, but she began to nibble at her food. As she continued to eat, she began to really dive in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She must really be ravenous!</i> thought Sam, slowly munching his own dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they each finished, the waitress came back to ask if they wanted any dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m full, and I can\u2019t imagine that Cand\u2026\u201d Sam trailed off as he glanced at his date, noticing the disappointed look written all over Candace\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...but I stand corrected. Dessert menus it is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace clapped her hands together in delight, tapping her fingers together as she pondered her choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like the devil\u2019s food cake, please,\u201d she said with a dark glint in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one?\u201d the waitress asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point. Make it three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-three! Yes. Got it,\u201d said the waitress, fighting a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll take one as well,\u201d said Sam. Candace gave him a hungrier look than the one she gave her food earlier. Her eyes were glued to his. Sam shifted in his seat, slightly uncomfortable under the intensity of her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d The waitress snatched up their menus and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love it when a man knows how to indulge himself,\u201d Candace said, eyes still burning a hole through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, me too,\u201d Sam agreed. Wait! That didn\u2019t sound right! \u201c...A girl\u2026 who knows... I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace gave him a languid smile. Sam felt beads of sweat forming on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes me wonder what <i>other</i> indulgences you enjoy\u2026\u201d she said, her voice dropping slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like watching movies and stuff, you know,\u201d said Sam. He wasn\u2019t exactly sure what she was after here. She was moving more slowly, with a vaguely sensual grace. It was difficult to describe, but it was slightly mesmerizing. If he didn\u2019t know better, he would think she was insinuating something sexier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched his hand with hers again. It felt completely different, her fingers glided along the slopes and valleys of each finger as if she wanted to take her time enjoying the sensation. Sam shivered as the contact ignited a spark of desire inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat <i>kind</i> of movies?\u201d she said. Did her lips look redder than they had a few moments ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, like comic book movies and stuff\u2026\u201d Sam said, his eyes slightly widening, locked, still, to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, I liked comics. Can you just imagine me in one of those skimpy little outfits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell? She really was coming onto him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, yeah\u2026 you\u2019d look amazing in them. You always look amazing,\u201d Sam replied, relatively pleased at how he\u2019d fielded her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was about to say, something else, our desserts arrived. She licked her lips and made short work of the three chocolate confections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the ride home, Candace was quiet. She seemed to be thinking to herself. As he pulled up to her house, she turned to him with conflict in her eyes. He was a bit conflicted himself, unsure whether to kiss her or hug her or\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned toward him and gave him a quick peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night!\u201d she murmured rapidly, then got out of the car and hurried into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, decision made, I guess,</i> thought Sam, slightly disappointed after their dessert conversation, but happy that she still seemed to like him. Dinner seemed to have gone well. That was all he could ask for. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived home and entered his room, his phone pinged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo howd it go ladykiller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mara.

How bout yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c;)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay youve got to give me more than just an emoticon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kissyface emoticon appeared on his screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow bout two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam laughed. Leave it to Mara\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt is seriously yummy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was high praise coming from her. \u201cYummy\u201d was even higher on the hotness scale than \u201cnummy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo did you do him?\u201d Sam smirked as he sent the message, knowing this was bound to provoke a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG fucker. First you accuse me of dressing like a slut, then you accuse me of BEING a slut? Dont make me hurt you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didnt say NO,\u201d Sam smiled in anticipation of her next message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didnt... but I may have wanted to ;)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam laughed again, happy that Mara was into someone now, just as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongrats. Invite me to the wedding, K?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft. So you and Cand working on your first baby yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOof. Turnabout was fair play, he supposed. Sam considered what to tell her. He had gotten some pretty mixed signals from Candace tonight, courtesy of her recent brush with death, or whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaving that for the second date\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood so you didnt screw up the first one too bad?

His family didn\u2019t really go to church, but when Candace had asked him to volunteer with her today, he wasn\u2019t about to say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam!\u201d came a voice from behind him. He whirled. It was Rob. And Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, guys!\u201d said Sam, relieved to see some familiar faces in the strange environment. \u201cAre you here to volunteer for the kids\u2019 fundraiser too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. But only \u2018cause Megan made me,\u201d said Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I didn\u2019t, you would just play X-Box all day,\u201c Megan said with a smirk before elbowing him in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on something behind Sam, Rob\u2019s eyes began to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Look at Candace! Her body is goals as fuck!\u201d Rob gave a quiet wolf whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan glared at him with the stare of death, fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, I\u2019m standing right here. Second, don\u2019t say the \u2018f\u2019 word when we\u2019re standing in the middle of the <i>fucking</i> church. Third, I\u2019m standing <b><i>right here</i></b>,\u201d she said in a hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt a soft hand grab his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou made it!\u201d squealed Candace\u2019s excited voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, turning to her as he felt her hands reach around him in a hug. He hugged her back. Her body felt so good against his, her floral scent filling his nostrils and fragmenting his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam reluctantly released the hug, Father Ryan came up to the group with a broad smile. There was something odd about his expression, but Sam couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore volunteers? Wonderful!\u201d He shook each of their hands. \u201cI\u2019m Father Ryan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to Father Thumbe?\u201d asked Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s no longer with us,\u201d said Father Ryan quickly, a dark look flashing across his features before he changed the subject. \u201cWe could really use the help getting the bake sale stuff wrapped.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Sam awoke to a clatter on the window of his second-floor bedroom. He heard a startled shriek as his eyes shot to the source of the sound and caught the edge of a translucent white shape dropping from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot out of bed and ran to the window, sliding it open and sticking his head out to investigate. Looking down, he saw Candace, wearing a white, lacy nightgown. She was tangled in the branches of the tree outside his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d she cried, looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down and took her hand, then pulled upward with all his strength, bracing himself against the wall inside the room. Her grip was so strong that it was painful. His hand was going numb! There wasn\u2019t much he could do about it, however. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to let her go. Grimacing, he continued to pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to pull her the rest of the way up and into his room. She landed on top of him, her dazzling green eyes staring directly into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat on earth were you doing out there?\u201d Sam asked, breathing heavily. Her lips rose and fell with the rising and falling of his chest, coming tantalizingly close to his with every exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know. I was in my bedroom falling asleep, and then I just woke up just outside your window hanging in the air somehow. As soon as I realized where I was, I fell into the tree!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam saw fear in Candace\u2019s glassy eyes. He wrapped his arms around her in a firm hug, instinctively moving to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his arms pulled her body more tightly into his, however, her eyes began to change, becoming darker. Her eyelids lowered slightly, the fear disappearing, replaced by something else. Sam breathed in her scent and felt carnal desire rise within him. He felt her delicious body shift sinuously over his, her smooth, bare calf rubbing along the inside of his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam swallowed hard as he saw the predatory look in her eyes\u2026 right before she pressed her full lips into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt wonderful. And wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t right. Candace\u2019s personality shifts seemed to be getting more\u2014not less\u2014extreme over time. That couldn\u2019t be good, could it? Did she really want this, or was this the result of some kind of post-trauma thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, how he wanted this, though. He felt the softness of her breasts against him, the velvet touch of her legs entwining with his. Her lips slid along the sensitive flesh of his own. His entire body quivered with desire for the girl he\u2019d been pining over for years. This was his chance wasn\u2019t it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had wanted this for longer than he could remember. Who cared why she was doing it? Why should he give it up now? She clearly wanted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thoughts ran through Sam\u2019s mind, Candace laced her fingers into his and slammed his hands down to the floor violently, his arms outstretched to each side of his head. He struggled and pushed upward, but her hands didn\u2019t move an inch, overpowering his with ease. She bit down on his lower lip, mixing the bitter taste of pain with the sweetness of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it! This was like her at all. He needed to do something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCandace, what are you doing? What is all this?\u201d he whispered. His words seemed to change something in her, and she blinked once. Twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam?\u201d she asked, then shook her head. She released his hands and sat up, straddling him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what came over me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose to her feet and stepped away from him, offering him a hand. He accepted it, and she pulled him into the air, a good foot off the ground. He landed on his feet, knees bent, astounded at her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been working out!\u201d he commented, but she didn\u2019t seem to hear him. She seemed lost in her thoughts again. When she finally turned to him, her lower lip trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, can I stay here tonight? Sleep on the floor, I mean? I just\u2026 don\u2019t feel like myself, and I\u2019d love it if I had my guardian angel watching over me,\u201d she said, eyes luminous and hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t say no. Not when she looked at him like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you sleep on the floor. Here\u2026\u201d He fluffed the pillow and straightened the blankets, then gestured for her to take the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace walked up to him, rose on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, Sam,\u201d she said, then gracefully slipped under the covers. She smiled, then closed her eyes. Sam watched her for a moment longer. She looked so serene, so beautiful with her red hair splayed across the pillow in the moonlight, face relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam lay on the floor, shifting until he found the least uncomfortable position. He lay there with his eyes open for a long time, jealous of how easily Candace had seemed to fall asleep. He supposed that having a bed helped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awakened slowly, hazily to the light of the morning sun streaming in through the window, realizing that he must have fallen asleep at some point. He rose stiffly to his feet to see Candace in the same place he\u2019d left her, sleeping peacefully, long lashes still resting on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sunlight descended to touch the top of her head, turning her silky hair to glowing embers, Sam gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace began to rise from the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating to a vertical position over the bed, her bare feet remained several inches above the bed, toes pointed, as diaphanous white wings coalesced behind her. Her wings extended as she floated forward toward the window, toward the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam circled around one of her wings and waved a hand through it. It passed through unobstructed. Her wings were ghostlike but plainly visible. He glanced over to the rest of her ethereal form, ivory nightgown hanging from its shapely curves. Her milky skin glowed, her ginger hair aflame as her body bathed in the amber vibrancy of the sunrise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes had never gazed upon anything so beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked\u2026 angelic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BAM* *BAM* *BAM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken from his reverie by the knocking on his door, Sam tore his gaze from the gorgeous girl floating in front of his window to look at his shuddering door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam? Sam? Is Candace in there with you? She wasn\u2019t in her room this morning, and I\u2026\u201d came Candace\u2019s father\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam\u2019s stomach dropped from this surprise, he suddenly heard a hideous shriek from the opposite direction. His attention shifted back toward Candace until it found the source of the sound. It was black as night, with batlike wings, and it was hovering just outside his window, staring right at Candace.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The firmness of his abs was somehow noticeable under the shirt despite its relative looseness around his waist. Mara could tell that they were cobbled perfection without even seeing them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But oh how she wanted to see them. She daydreamed. Maybe she could get him to take off his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Matt asked, giving Mara a knee-weakening smile as his eyes sparkled with that insanely sexy sense of mischief that drew her to bad boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jawline seemed stronger and more chiseled than usual. It was as if everything masculine about him had been turned up to eleven on a dial that maxed out at ten. He had been a good-looking guy before\u2026 Now? Fuggedaboutit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026? Oh, yeah. That? Nothing\u2026 just, yeah\u2026 nothing.\u201d stammered Mara, thankful that her light brown Indian skin hid blushes relatively well. Blushing? That wasn\u2019t like her. She was a take-charge kind of girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen had Matt gotten quite this good looking, anyway? She\u2019d been flirting with him for most of senior year, and he hadn\u2019t given her the time of day. Then, yesterday, out of the blue, he\u2019d asked her out! And today he\u2019s better looking than ever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Not that she minded. Hell, looking like this, if he wanted her to have his little Matt babies, she was totally in! Yay! But she better start talking so he didn\u2019t think she was some sort of puppy dog pining over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn\u2019t need to know that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are we going anyway?\u201d Mara asked, finding her footing as she avoided Matt\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise\u2026\u201d said Matt with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill there be babies involved?\u201d Had she just said babies? Omigod! Fuck! \u201c...Baby carrots. Like at dinner? \u2018Cause I love me some baby carrots!\u201d she recovered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara was thankful that she could think fast on her feet! She bit her lip as she looked up at him. Had he bought it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was giving her a confused look. A little bemused, maybe, but not a knowing smirk. Good! Confused was good. Better than completely fucking laughing at her or lording it over her. She would take confused. Whew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby. Carrots,\u201d he said, as if tasting the words on his tongue. Maybe they would make more sense if he could taste them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Who doesn\u2019t love baby carrots? Orange is the new black, right?\u201d Mara continued, not really paying any attention to what she was saying. Man, his arms were looky tasty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that show making a reference to a prison uniform or something?\u201d said Matt, furrow deepening on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh! Of course!\u201d Mara shook her head as if she knew something he didn\u2019t. What had she said again? Oh well. It didn\u2019t really matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatevs. So anyway, quit dodging the question! Where are we going for dinner?\u201d Mara smirked. A good knowing smirk was the best way to overcome awkwardness. Just pretend like you\u2019re in on a joke that the other person didn\u2019t get. Worked every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, sometimes, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara held her breath, gauging Matt\u2019s reaction. He seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with her, now looking completely baffled. That was okay. She liked cluelessness. It was one of the qualities she appreciated most in a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo before we talk about dinner, should I come in and say hello to your parents?\u201d he asked, shaking his head at the odd conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt just stood there, dumbfounded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents are sorta traditionalists. They already have me lined up to marry some dude in India named Sandeep. <i>Them</i> meeting <i>you</i> would not go so well for <i>me.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?! Does that mean you\u2019re engaged?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara sighed and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am! But I\u2019m not going to actually go through with it. I\u2019ve never even met the guy! No big\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s go have some fun, shall we?\u201d she said, grabbing his sinewed arm and walking him down the steps, away from the door. She noticed Matt\u2019s uncertain look and hesitant walk as she half-dragged him toward the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously! No worries, Matt! It\u2019s all good. Me here. Not-going-to-happen fianc\u00e9 thousands of miles away.\u201d Mara gave him a brilliant smile and pulled him harder. He relented and stumbled forward under the force of her pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMara, has anyone ever told you you\u2019re quite a handful?\u201d said Matt, a dazed look in his eye and a chagrined smile forming on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean besides my family, friends, and casual acquaintances...? Not really.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cNow come on! Let\u2019s go before Dad sees us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head a second time already as he started the car and they drove away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Golf,\u201d he said, nodding to punctuate each word with smugness dripping from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that supposed to, like, be impressive or something?\u201d asked Mara with a vaguely disgusted look before breaking into a laugh. \u201cJust kidding, Mattso. Sounds like fun! Let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bounded out of the car energetically. Mara pretty much did everything energetically. She liked to think it was part of her charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMattso?\u201d said Matt, crinkling his brow as he got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve been bulking up! But not in a bad way; in a totally good way\u2014all muscular and shit! Have you been working out, like nonstop since school got out? You look like you\u2019re going to audition for Thor or something! Is Chris What-his-name retiring or something? If so, you\u2019re a lock!\u201d Mara said before pausing to take a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking you may have had one too many red bulls, Miss Bedi!\u201d said Matt, putting his arm around the bouncing girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! You don\u2019t even want to see me on Red Bull!\u201d she said, giving a straight-armed jittery impression before turning to him in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn that, we agree,\u201d said Matt with a wink. As crazy as she was behaving tonight, he was beginning to really like this girl. She seemed a little more manic than usual, but he was sure that was simply a function of first-date nervousness. He felt a bit of it himself, though he wasn\u2019t quite as hyper-spastic as Mara was at the moment. Of course, her normal <i>was</i> fairly crazy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked to the entrance, Matt paying a round for two. He handed her a green ball and club, taking the red ball and a second club for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is a little embarrassing, but I\u2019ve never actually played this game before\u2026\u201d admitted Mara, sheepishly. \u201cBut it\u2019s a totally great date idea, and I love it and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me show you how it\u2019s done,\u201d said Matt, making a show of walking to the tee. He set down the ball, pulled the club back and struck it. The ball flew off the tee with the power of the strike, ricocheted off the far wall, and flew straight up in the air, landing on the far sidewalk and beginning to roll away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt ran after the ball and recovered it, then jogged back to Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d said Mara smugly. \u201cYou were saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I just don\u2019t know my own strength these days,\u201d Matt said, giving her a smoldering gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara felt its heat and fanned herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it getting warm in here?\u201d she said, with a nervous giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Matt took the shot a second time and sunk it in the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d he said, retrieving his ball and tossing it as he returned to watch Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara mimicked Matt\u2019s stance, swung her club, barely catching the ball. It dribbled about a foot before it came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d she said. \u201cOkay, for real this time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, eying her technique, hustled over behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me show you,\u201d he said, scooching behind her until their bodies touched, draping his upper body over hers, his carved arms over hers. Mara felt desire flooding through her from the touch of his body. As his hands came over hers to show her the swing, she caught the scent of his cologne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, my God</i> she thought. <i>He smells so fucking good\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally one to pick up anything involving skill or athleticism with ease, Mara didn\u2019t even try this time. She was too caught up in the spell woven by Matt\u2019s athletic body wrapped around hers, by the fragrant smell of his face next to hers. When he swung, she didn\u2019t even know it had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMara! You need to swing too! I was just trying to assist!\u201d said Matt, as the ball dribbled another foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssist away,\u201d Mara said with a sultry smile, their faces less than an inch apart. She began to lean in. He saw her motion and matched it with a dark smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his lips touched hers, it felt incredible. As her lips reached out for his a second time, she felt his hand gliding along her toned stomach to come to rest on her hip. She could feel him begin to harden against her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara turned into him, snaking her arms around his sculpted back. She gasped as she felt the hardness of his muscles. He pulled her into him with a strength she had never felt before, gasping as his arms clasped around her, pulling her lower back upward and inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to kiss passionately until they both heard a child\u2019s voice cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Mommy! Look at them kissy facing! Maybe we should skip this hole and go to the next!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt broke the kiss and stepped back, embarrassed. He nodded to the child\u2019s mother sheepishly, and she returned a rebuking expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara\u2019s eyes remained closed for a minute longer, savoring the sensation. She rolled her soft lips inward to suck the vestiges of his taste off them. As her eyes fluttered open, Matt\u2019s eyes locked to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 good kisser?\u201d he intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best,\u201d she breathed before coming to her senses. She couldn\u2019t let his ego get too big just yet. \u201c...you know, of the middle of the pack. Not the best of the best, but definitely above average. You\u2019ll have to show me a couple more times to move into the top tier\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara teetered a little, and Matt reached out a hand to steady her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. Needed that. Maybe, um, yeah,\u201d said Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughed, holding her until she seemed well-grounded once more, then continued their game. Mara began to get the hang of it a few holes in. By the time they finished, she lost by just one stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Mattso. I was coming for you. If you hadn\u2019t been playing dirty with all that kissing, I woulda had you\u2026\u201d she said, with faux sternness, waving a finger in front of Matt... until she couldn\u2019t suppress her smile any longer. It bloomed brilliant and huge over her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt picked her up with ease and twirled her around a few times while she giggled and smacked him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut me down, you big oaf!\u201d she said, gasping for breath between chortles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey returned their clubs, joking and laughing all the way to the fish and chips stand nearby. The pair enjoyed their dinner at the picnic table, then got back into Matt\u2019s car to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a great time, Matt,\u201d said Mara, her eyes intense, showing her rare serious side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot Mattso?\u201d Matt asked with a crooked grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaw. I think you earned a \u2018so\u2019 removal,\u201d she said, leaning in for a kiss. Matt\u2019s eyes darkened as the sensitive flesh of their lips slid together with an almost magnetic pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara felt Matt\u2019s almost unnatural magnetism, breathing in his ultra-masculine aroma. Her kisses grew hungrier, more passionate. Her hand rose to his cheek, and she ran her soft fingers over the ruggedness of his five-o\u2019-clock shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned into his mouth, her body moving toward his, but unable to touch across the gear shift between them. Mara felt herself tremble with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt slipped his powerful arm around her, lifting her body from the passenger seat toward him. As her breasts touched him, she felt a jolt of sensation thrill her heart\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMara! Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her father\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara instantly broke the kiss, the promise of her father\u2019s wrath enough\u2014for the moment\u2014to break Matt\u2019s hold over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta go,\u201d she whispered, breathless, with a parting grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran toward her father, just outside the door, Matt watched her go, his smile disappearing before it turned to a scowl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>**BACK TO THE PRESENT**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s father was just going to have to wait, Sam decided. The black mega-bat seemed the more urgent problem to Sam at the moment. He leapt in front of Candace, bumping into her with the movement, concerned only with putting himself between the floating redhead and the creature. Her eyes snapped open from the jolt, and she instantly dropped to the ground, stumbling and falling backward onto the bed with the surprised squeak of a bedspring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing\u2019s ebony eyes narrowed, and its hand fired through the glass, showering Sam with sharp crystalline fragments as its razor-sharp claws sunk into his shirt and the skin of his chest. It pulled him through the frame of the window, crackling wood rending and bruising Sam\u2019s face and chest as he flew outward toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature clutched Sam to its body, still hovering outside his bedroom window with powerful flaps of its leathery wings. Struggling valiantly to free himself, Sam found he could do nothing as the beast\u2019s arms clasped him in an impossibly strong bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opened its mouth to reveal rows of sharp teeth then bit down on his neck. Searing pain burst from its bite, agony washing though the young man, causing his squirming movements to momentarily cease. The sensation was like nothing he\u2019d ever felt, touching him at a deeper level than merely his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat <i>was</i> this thing? Some weird, massive species of humanoid bat? A vampire? A demon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a two-second eternity, Sam felt its mouth unclamp from his skin. The bite still burned, and, to make matters worse, he could see the satisfaction in its hollow eyes as its head pulled back from him. Seeing this thing with that dark, gratified look on its face sent shivers through his bones. It couldn\u2019t be a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he saw its eyes widen, and its black arms released him. He dropped to the ground, feeling the blossom of dull pain in his ankle as he landed. His knees collapsed and he rolled onto his back, coming to rest in the grass with the monster still hovering fifteen feet above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Candace jump from the window, wings no longer visible, but an angry look on her face. The bat-thing shrieked as one of her arms hooked over its shoulder and the other rocketed toward its stomach, delivering a powerful blow that seemed to knock the air from its lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt twisted violently, raking at Candace\u2019s arm and dislodging her from its body. She dropped to the ground next to Sam with a thump. They both watched as the thing flew away in an erratic motion, its huge wings whipping as it gained altitude until it disappeared in the morning sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Candace lay on the lawn, stunned, peering at the thing until it was lost in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA head popped out of the mangled window above them, and Candace\u2019s father\u2019s face came into view, staring down at them wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck was all that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head disappeared inside once more, and he ran toward them across the lawn as Candace rose slowly to her feet. Both she and her father checked her over for signs of injury, but she seemed unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved to check Sam next. He had been unable to stand, but he was sitting upright, a strange black wound on his neck. His shirt was torn and bloody from the glass of the window, and his hands were clutching his ankle, which had been twisted or sprained, at a minimum, from his long fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s father placed his hand on Sam\u2019s battered chest and pushed gently to lowered him back to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be moving after a fall like that. We need to get you checked out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out his phone and dialed 911 for an ambulance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam could hear Candace and her father talking, but he was feeling woozy and weak from the odd bite on his neck. He couldn't follow what they were saying at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, the world seemed to come back into focus, and he heard Candace\u2019s father speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s traveling. She\u2019s not around for a couple of days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have her number?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. In my phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone. He read the contact number to the man and heard him leaving her a message. As he exited his contact list, he noticed a new text message from Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning,\u201d it said. Sam texted a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning. A giant bat bit me. Headed to the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure and pigs can fly\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo but Candace can\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLol\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put away his phone as the paramedics arrived, answering their questions with a concerned Candace and her dazed-looking father standing by. He didn\u2019t see the subsequent texts that appeared from Mara after he didn\u2019t reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy so quiet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really heading to the hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. Heading to hospital now. If this is joke, will slap you silly\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hope Sam\u2019s okay! I wonder what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Mara. She hadn\u2019t told him about the strange texts Sam had sent, still unsure whether he was joking or hallucinating or\u2026 whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two stopped at the nurse\u2019s station to see which room Sam was in, Father Ryan passed by, talking on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt eyed the priest with a furrowed brow as he walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would a priest be\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened, and he turned to Mara with sudden urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think Sam was the one that needed a priest do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara whirled to see the departing priest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmigod!\u201d she whispered, her hands beginning to tremor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the nurse gave them the room number, Mara ran to find it. She burst through the door to find Sam lying on the hospital bed with a serious look on his face, speaking to Candace and her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara let out a breath, then hustled over and hugged Sam tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank God you\u2019re okay!\u201d she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful!\u201d Sam grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released the hug, her eyes a little glassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was so worried when you didn\u2019t respond! And then we got here and Matt was, like, freaking out when he saw the priest with this grim look on his face. And then he told me, and I saw him, and he got me all freaked out. And then I ran all the way up here. And then I just about cried when I saw you were okay. And now I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re not dead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Mara! Breathe!\u201d said Sam with a grin. \u201cThe reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara punched him in the arm, a stern look remaining on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for making me worry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s grin widened while he rubbed his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you too, Mar.\u201d<br>\r\nMatt walked in a moment later with Rob and Megan in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook who I found on the way here! News travels fast apparently\u2026\u201d He winked at Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>may</i> have told a few people to come to the hospital right away, but it\u2019s all Sam\u2019s fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>My</i> fault?\u201d said Sam, incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Mr. I-was-attacked-by-Batman! What was that all about anyway? What really happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam glanced at Candace, who shrugged in response. But it was Candace\u2019s father who spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was some sort of huge batlike creature that attacked Sam, but Candace fought it off. We don\u2019t actually know exactly what it was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA huge bat, and <i>Candace</i> fought it off?\u201d asked Mara, throwing a disbelieving glance at her ginger-haired friend. Her eyes lingered, giving Candace an appraising look. \u201cDamn, Cand, fighting giant bats must be good for the skin. And the hair. And the boobs. And\u2026 geez! You look freaking amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace didn\u2019t respond. Mara noticed that Candace was looking toward her, but not <i>at</i> her. She followed her friend\u2019s eyes to\u2026 Matt? And Matt was staring right back at Mara\u2019s increasingly gorgeous friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara waved her hand through the invisible string that connected their eyes. Neither seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarth to Matt\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a tingle of jealousy, Mara punched his arm, much as she had Sam\u2019s a moment earlier. This time, however, her eyes were dark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he snapped out of it, blinking. He turned his eyes toward Mara, seeing hurt in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Mara, pushing past Matt, Rob, and Megan to leave the room. Matt stood there for a moment before following her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude!\u201d said Rob once the door closed. \u201cMatt\u2019s gotta be more discreet. As hot as Candace is, he can\u2019t just ogle her right in front of his girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook who\u2019s talking, dumbass!\u201d said Megan with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s different!\u201d said Rob apologetically, suddenly remembering his wandering eyes from the other day. \u201cThat was at\u2026 church\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s better because...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Rob stammered, glancing over to Sam in desperation. Sam gave a slight shrug from his bed. He didn\u2019t really blame the other guys for admiring his girlfriend. He snuck another furtive glance himself. She <i>was</i> pretty spectacular-looking. It was more of a badge of honor than a concern for him. He knew, however, that Mara would feel differently. He knew that he would have some best friend duties to do when he got home and could charge his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stood there, frowning and tapping her foot. When Rob said nothing more, she gave him a disdainful glare, then walked over to Sam, leaving Rob standing by himself by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to your neck?\u201d she asked, touching the black, charred skin on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe thing bit me,\u201d said Sam without further explanation. He shuddered, still feeling the deep, dull burn inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw,\u201d she said, jerking back her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and all of them turned to see who it was. A figure in a white lab coat brushed past Rob, striding to the side of Sam\u2019s bed. He flipped a page in the chart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour ankle is mildly sprained, so we\u2019re going to get you into a boot. The lacerations on your chest aren\u2019t deep and none of them require stitches,\u201d the doctor took a breath before continuing. \u201cIt\u2019s this \u2018bite\u2019 that is unusual. It\u2019s almost like a burn, but not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, then shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...it\u2019s definitely unusual. But you should be able to go home. Once we have the biopsy results, we\u2019ll give you a call. It didn\u2019t seem to be poisonous, so no worries there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded, relieved that he could go home. But a worry remained. <i>What was that thing, and what had it done to him?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re fucking incredible-looking just like Candace.\u201d Her burning eyes flitted down his impressive physique before finding his blue irises once more. \u201cI\u2019m sure she wants to fuck you as much as you want to fuck her! Good luck, dude! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get serious cred for tappin\u2019 that luscious ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun on her heel and continued half-running, half-walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Mara!? That\u2019s not fair!\u201d Matt called after her. \u201cMara!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t break stride this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she smashed her hands into the door of the hospital to launch it open, she realized that she didn\u2019t have a ride home. Just <i>great!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday had started poorly with the crazy texts from Sam, and it had only gotten worse\u2026 other than the fact that Sam was okay. At least there was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts turned again to Matt. Just when she thought she had a chance with him, her own friend screws her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped to the brick wall of the hospital next to the bank of doors to the emergency room and slumped to the ground. Dropping her head into her hands, she began to cry in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had Candace become so fucking jaw-dropping anyway? She had always been pretty, but <i>fuck!</i> She looked like she could grace a magazine cover now! She wouldn\u2019t mind so much if she hadn\u2019t finally landed the guy she\u2019d been interested in. Why did it have to happen now! And what about Sam? How could she do that to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Calm down, Mara! They didn\u2019t actually do anything. It was just a look</i> she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA really long, really intense, really smoldering look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween two of sexy-as-fuck model-perfect hormone-packed teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam would say she was overreacting. He might be right. She hoped he was right. He would probably call her tonight to convince her of that. Part of her hoped he succeeded. But Sam, bless him, was really stupid about people sometimes. Something had passed between Candace and Matt. Something wasn\u2019t nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should talk to Matt about it? But if it was as she feared, he would just lie about it. He had to be attracted to Candace. I mean, what guy wouldn\u2019t be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should talk to Candace about it. Now there was a thought. The more she considered that, the more the idea appealed to her. She could at least see about one end of what looked suspiciously like the blossoming of a new love connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat ending thought sent a fresh wave of loss rolling through her, and Mara felt more tears come.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn\u2019t doing so well these days with her. Oh, well. A bouquet of grocery store flowers should solve that problem\u2014if he could remember to do it. He wasn\u2019t all that great at the romantic stuff. Or being considerate. Or tactful. He mentally shrugged. Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJogging down the hall, he caught up to Matt and tapped him on the shoulder. Matt looked up, a distraught look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! You look like you accidentally sent your dick through the wood chipper!\u201d said Rob, with a nearly serious look on his face. <i>Nearly</i> serious was about as serious as he was able to get. \u201cWhat\u2019s the what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Mara. She got upset about me looking at Candace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssht. How can she be mad about that? Candace is looking fine as fuck these days! She\u2019s got to give some kind of allowance for the Y-chromosome factor\u2026 speaking of which, think Sam would mind if I take Candace on a test drive? You know, test the brakes and the steering? She how she handles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Fine. Not a good idea, then. But geez, man, look who\u2019s talking! You were the one that got totally outed for staring at her gorgeous ass\u2026\u201d Rob sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour girlfriend is like 100 feet down the hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but she knows that my masculine impulses control me. It\u2019s part of my charm,\u201d said Rob with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy girlfriend gets all pissed because I just <i>look</i> at another girl. Meanwhile, you\u2019re talking about <i>fucking</i> said girl, and you\u2019re not even worried about Megan\u2019s reaction. Unbelievable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the <i>World of Rob</i>, dude. W to the O to the R. Rose-colored glasses are the only fucking kind I own,\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to admit, that was quite a look. Mara did the whole hand wave and everything, and you still didn\u2019t break ogle. That\u2019s some serious eye-wanderage, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d sighed Matt. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what happened exactly. It was just, like, <i>electric</i> somehow. Like we were connected outside of our bodies or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa. That\u2019s some deep shit. So you, like, zen-fucked her or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZen-fucked her? That\u2019s a new one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob\u2019s eyes twinkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOR, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiiiight,\u201d Matt replied. \u201cBut no, it wasn\u2019t like that. It was just\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m talking to you about this. You have the libido of a stallion combined with the brainpower of a peanut. You make everything about sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, dude,\u201d said Rob, clearly taking Matt\u2019s comment as a compliment. \u201cAnyway, if you want me to talk to Mara for you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! God, no!!\u201d interrupted Matt. \u201cThanks for the offer, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! What are bros for?\u201d Rob reached up to give Matt a light slap on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt returned the gesture, but Rob went flying to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, dude! You didn\u2019t have to go all Rocky on my ass!\u201d said Rob, rubbing his shoulder as he rose to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that! I\u2019ve just been getting stronger lately. All those workouts finally paying off, I guess.\u201d He shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob eyed him warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should probably lay off the steroids, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt just gave him a sheepish look, and they went back to join the others.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing she knew was that it wasn\u2019t good. She had been in Sam\u2019s bedroom. Most of the night. She was amazed her father was as controlled as he was, though she was sure she would hear about it once they arrived home. She hadn\u2019t done anything with Sam. If she was honest with herself, though, she\u2019d wanted to. Desperately. She had been ready to go all the way with him for a minute there! She felt a rush of desire again at the thought, casting smoldering eyes at Sam, who didn\u2019t seem to notice. His eyes were fixed on the two boys coming toward the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t know what was going on with her hormones lately. One minute they would be raging, and the next she was feeling serene and distanced from them. It was the oddest combination. The shifts in her feelings seemed to be occurring less often today, at least, but the intensity of them was just as strong, if not stronger. The doctors had said that the emotional impacts of the near-death trauma would wear off with time, but they weren\u2019t! She didn\u2019t know if she should tell them and have them order a dozen more tests or just keep the fact to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Rob rejoined the group, and they all walked through the halls, lost in their own thoughts until they reached the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Mara!\u201d said Matt, his eyes finding the girl quickly as they reached the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to walk toward her, but Matt put a hand on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Not now. Let her cool down more first. Trust me,\u201d said Sam with reassuring sincerity in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gulped, then nodded, but his eyes remained fixed on Mara sitting in the grass, back against the brick wall, face in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive her a call later tonight,\u201d Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace smiled as she watched the interaction. Her eyes dropped as she thought about the reason Mara was upset. She wasn\u2019t really into Matt.  Mara was more than welcome to have him. She had just\u2026 She didn\u2019t know what had happened, exactly, but it wasn\u2019t like she was trying to steal Mara\u2019s man. Matt was nice eye candy, but there wasn\u2019t much more to him than that, in her opinion. Except\u2026 there was something about him now. Something that hadn\u2019t been there before. Something that drew her to him. She shivered as she remembered the feeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! She had Sam, her guardian angel. That was more than enough! Eyes rising under half-lowered eyelids to gaze at him, her mind wandered to the things she wanted to do to him. She moistened her lips with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCandace?\u201d came Sam\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she startled, her lascivious thoughts interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I just\u2026 I should talk to Mara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam considered, then nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might be a good idea,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace walked over to Mara and sat down next to her, leaning over to bump her friend with her toned shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you,\u201d Candace said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away!\u201d said Mara in a muffled voice, face still covered by her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMar, I just wanted you to know that I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 stare at Matt like that. I know you and he are going out, and I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was some pretty intense ogling, Cand. I couldn\u2019t even break the connection by waving a hand through it. If it didn\u2019t mean anything, then what was it all about?\u201d Mara said, turning her moist eyes toward Candace and withdrawing her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I just felt this, like, connection. Like we were alike. Like we were the same somehow...\u201d Candace knew it was a mistake to say it as soon as the words left her lips. She watched in horror as Mara\u2019s eyes flashed with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you were meant to be together and want to have lots of sex and babies? If you wanted him, Cand, why didn\u2019t you just tell me? You didn\u2019t have to be a bitch about it and let me start dating him before you try to go after him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Candace heard the insult, as justifiable as it was under the circumstances, she felt a wave of haughty anger crash through her. Mara! The girl was nothing compared to her. Candace could have any man she wanted. It was time to let this pathetic girl know it. Part of Candace recoiled at these thoughts. <i>This wasn\u2019t her.</i> But she couldn\u2019t seem to fully control it. Before she knew it, her lips were moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think I couldn\u2019t have him if I wanted him? You should be glad I don\u2019t have any real interest in him, Mar. He\u2019s all yours...\u201d she laughed out the words as if to prove the point of its absurdity. Of course, it wasn\u2019t exactly the message Mara wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara glared daggers at her. Candace should have felt horrible for making such a condescending comment. Part of her did. But the part that seemed to be driving at the moment was unconcerned. Feeling herself smile, she rose to her feet, looking down at her shorter friend. She spun on her heel and rejoined the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked heartbroken as the two women in his life clearly hadn\u2019t made up. In fact, it looked like whatever had been said had made things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t go well, huh?\u201d he said as Candace returned. The words seemed to trigger something in Candace, and her expression changed from almost disdainful to horrified in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my God. What did I do?! I can\u2019t believe I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d led Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I said something wrong. Something I shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Candace stammered as tears began to fall. \u201cYou have to tell her I didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace hugged Sam for support. It was difficult for him to concentrate as her lush body pressed against his, but he knew this was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will. Promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched Mara rise to her feet and run away as he held Candace. He hoped she would be okay.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He paced his room fretfully, despite the plastic medical boot on his foot. It ached a bit, but he wasn\u2019t concerned about that right now. The bite on his neck still hurt far worse than his ankle, anyway. After several more minutes of pacing, he decided he couldn\u2019t take the silence any longer and picked up his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there,\u201d he texted Mara, then waited for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Not a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam frowned, then tossed his phone to the desk in frustration. This wasn\u2019t like her at all. When she was happy, she was chatty. When she was angry, she vented. When she was sad, she was desperate to talk. Stretching his memory, he couldn\u2019t even think of a time she hadn\u2019t been communicative\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled onto his bed, then propped his hands behind his head, crossing his legs, losing himself in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should call Candace? Find out what happened? But that led to another whole set of problems. What <i>had</i> that look she\u2019d exchanged with Matt meant? <i>Was</i> she really into him? And she had floated last night! Right in front of him. Right out of the bed. With weird, ethereal wings. That was <i>not</i> normal. Something had clearly happened to her at the pond. But <i>what?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe played back the events in his mind. Candace there, looking gorgeous in her blue bikini, the parachutists falling from the sky\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that was it. That <i>had</i> to be it. Everything had been normal until then. There had been that static electricity discharge when they hit the water... Their bodies hadn\u2019t been found\u2026 everything that was happening had to have something to do with <i>them</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it, though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could continue to puzzle it out, however, he heard a tap at his window. His eyebrows jumped as his eyes opened and focused on the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace hovered outside wearing nothing but a black nightgown, bobbing up and down as if floating in the water, translucent, dark wings framing her magnificent hourglass shape. Every time he thought she couldn\u2019t possibly become more beautiful, she somehow managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched him swallow hard, she gave him a coy smile. He rose quickly, then opened the window. As she climbed in, he couldn\u2019t help but admire the athletic but elegant definition in her lightly muscled arms and long, sinuous legs. As she rose inside, he realized she was nearly as tall as he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes shot momentarily downward to the flawless skin of her chest, the dramatic swells of cleavage clearly visible in the low-cut nightgown proving irresistible to his masculine instinct. When his eyes returned to her face, he noticed that her full lips were smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun on her heel, her incorporeal black wing swinging around, and he jumped back, instinctively. It brushed past his face with a wash of swirling air, seeming to have a more substantial presence than it had the day before. He reached out to it. His hand still passed through, but it was slightly viscous this time, providing some measure of resistance to his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace strode over to his bedroom mirror and gazed into it, the hint of a smile crossing her full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m beautiful, aren\u2019t I?\u201d she said in a soft, tender voice that sent a shudder through Sam\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou always have been,\u201d he replied, approaching her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m prettier now, right?\u201d she asked, eyes moving to track me through the reflection in the mirror. \u201cI just feel so, like, turned on these days\u2014especially around you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stopped about a foot behind her, his fingers twitching with the desire to touch her, especially after that comment, but his mind remained uncertain as to whether he should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re pretty much perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widened, and her eyes returned to their self-examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething is happening to me, Sam. Each time I look in the mirror, I\u2019m more beautiful\u2026\u201d Her voice lightened, becoming breathy. \u201cAnd I can fly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam breathed in her scent. It was like an exquisite perfume, but\u2026 somehow better. He felt his desire rising. Unable to help himself, he reached out a hand, grasping a stray lock of ginger hair and tucking it behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocked her head toward his hand, causing his fingers to slide down her thick tresses, along the rim of her ear. He stroked her hair until his fingertips touched her neck. He felt her shiver under his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels good,\u201d she said still facing the mirror, voice almost a whisper. Her words emboldened Sam, and, as much as he wanted to ask her more about what was happening to her, he couldn\u2019t fight his desire. Having her here before him, heartbreakingly beautiful and trembling\u2014it was too much for him to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathered her shimmering, fiery cascade of hair, poured it over her other shoulder, then leaned down and kissed her neck. He heard a halting breath escape her lips. He kissed her there again. And again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers progressed down the smooth muscles of her toned back, feeling that ghostly resistance as they reached the place where her wings connected. They found the string that held up this side of her nightgown and pushed it outward until it fell over her rounded shoulder, coming to a rest at her bent elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced up toward the mirror, seeing the delicate, lacy fabric at the front of the nightgown fold over, exposing more of one luscious breast. She shivered. Despite the cool summer-evening breeze wafting through the open window, he didn\u2019t think that it had anything to do with the temperature in his room. On the contrary, her skin felt warm to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the side of her arm, his fingertips traced the slopes and crevices of her feminine muscles. His kisses progressed along the ridge of her shoulder, just above her clavicle. He heard her sigh again, the muscles in her arms tensing slightly under his hand, letting him know that she was enjoying his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she began to rise. He took a startled step backward and looked down. Her bare toes were the only part of her feet that still touched the carpet. She pushed off gently, like a slow-motion temps lev\u00e9 in zero gravity. She was floating, completely suspended in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide-eyed, Sam watched her slender fingers find the other spaghetti strap of her nightgown and remove it. The thin garment dropped to the floor, baring the entire expanse of perfect, milky skin to him. He stepped forward once more, drawn to the statuesque curve of her magnificent shape, placing his hands on the outward flow of her nude hips. He felt the spherical swells of her voluptuous backside press into his firm stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips pursed as they moved forward, eyes closing. He kissed the center of her back. She continued to rise, and he trailed kisses down her back as she did. When he reached the small of her back, he firmed his grip on her hips and pressed down gently. Sensing his wishes, she began to descend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands moved to his, covering them as they remained on her hips. She wrapped her fingers around them as she slowly descended, then pulled them forward to her taut lower stomach, just above her low-rise panties. The action pulled her toward him, tucking her torso inside his arms until her back touched his chest. Sam moved his face to the crook of her neck, mouth beside her ear and whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d said Sam, noticing the husky desire in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I want to amaze,\u201d she rasped, ruby lips hypnotic in their movement as he watched them reflected in the mirror.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sam reached his head around her swan-like neck and touched his lips to hers, kissing her hungrily. He felt her tongue slip skillfully between his parted lips, swirling sensation into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of the most unbelievable thrill of his young life, Sam came up for air. The gentle huff of heavy breathing breaking the nighttime silence, Candace turned in his arms, her bare breasts brushing against his arm and chest as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt his already rigid cock turn to absolute steel as it pressed into the warmth of her tight stomach. Her lithe arms glided around him, hugging the back of his neck, pulling his mouth toward hers once more. Despite the delicacy of her touch, he could feel the power in her arms as they pulled him inexorably in for more. Not that he had any desire to resist her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the soft smacking of their lips as they continued to kiss. His hands roamed the satin skin of her back, brushing against her hair, which had fanned back over her shoulder to again cover the upper half of her back. Caught up in the moment, he moved his hands down and across the upper slopes of her luscious ass to rest, once again on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the thin fabric of her panties under his fingers, he began to push the sheer fabric downward. One inch. Two\u2026 when suddenly her hands released his neck and shot to his fingers. She pulled his hands\u2014and her panties\u2014back up to their original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s eyes snapped to hers questioningly, his feelings slightly hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought\u2026 It just seemed\u2026\u201d he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Yes, I know. I mean, I <i>don\u2019t</i> know what I was\u2026\u201d she stuttered in reply, her face more embarrassed than seductive for the first time that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze shot to the floor, darting about until she found her nightgown. She turned away and bunched it up in her hands before letting it fall over her head. She turned back to him as she adjusted the thin straps to their original positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was both crushed and relieved. He wanted this\u2026 <i>really</i> wanted this\u2026 but wasn\u2019t entirely sure he was ready. Apparently, she wasn\u2019t ready either. He didn\u2019t want to rush things. Well, he did in a way\u2026 but he certainly didn\u2019t want Candace to regret anything, least of all her first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the beginnings of a blush paint her cheeks and forgot all of his other feelings for the moment. His only concern now was comforting her. He opened his arms wide and wrapped them around her, this time in a friendly hug rather than a lovers\u2019 embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tensed for a moment, then, realizing his intent, relaxed. He felt the tension leave her body, and she dropped her cheek to the downward slope of his shoulder, eyes facing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Sam. I didn\u2019t mean to, you know, tease you or anything,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with me lately. I mean, I love what\u2019s happening in some ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt her cheek pull back into a smiler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese changes have me feeling pretty good about my body. And being able to fly? As Mara would say, \u2018so freakin\u2019 cool!\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone changed almost imperceptibly, becoming darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that I get these <i>urges</i> sometimes. And they feel so good. Sooo right\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her head from his shoulder to look directly at him, she searched his eyes. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if they really are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her head to his shoulder once more. \u201cAll I know is I feel safe when I\u2019m with you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it Matt?\u201d Sam asked suddenly. He probably should have led into that question more smoothly, but it had been on his mind and just slipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head shot up, eyes finding his once more, brows furrowed in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Are you more attracted to him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! I tell you I feel safe with <i>you</i>, and your next question is about <i>Matt?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSafe isn\u2019t attraction, Cand. The friend zone is safe. And I\u2019ve been there so long. I have a pretty good idea what it feels like\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s eyes rolled before coming back to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you not feel me, like, all over you a second ago?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you said it was just because of some urges that you\u2019re not so sure about! I mean, what am I supposed to think when\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut him off with another kiss. Less sensual than before but more enthusiastic, more <i>passionate</i>. He could feel the emotion behind this one. It felt more authentically her, though it was difficult to know for sure. Candace had been acting so peculiar lately. Whatever the case, he enjoyed it even more than he had the others. It felt more\u2026 <i>right</i>... somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t break the kiss until Sam was nearly to the point of suffocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that answer your question? I\u2019m <i>attracted to you</i>, Sam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam considered. It <i>had</i> been pretty compelling evidence\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you and Mara patch things up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s eyes fell to the floor, and her jaw tightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam heard the front door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was home!</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
