Her mom caught a sight of her daughter's rounded, doughy belly and smiled sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone is going to need some new pajamas soon!\" She said and walked into Wendy's room.

Wendy looked down and saw one of the buttons that was trying to restrain her stomach had given up, and now was across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy put the plate down and rubbed her hard, full stomach with her pudgy hands. It was noticeably bigger, even after a day. Wendy squeezed it gently and enjoyed the feeling of the fat under her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull and satisfied, Wendy slept better then she had in days.</span></div></div>",

Quiet, trying not the make a noise, she silently moved through the hall and into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for her on the table was another plate of chocolate chip cookies, the same as the last batch, with a note, \u201cThought you might be hungry in the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a bottle of lemonade from the fridge, sat down at the table, and hungrily devoured the cookies, crumbs flying out of her mouth. The buttons on her top were under even more strain with every bite; all too soon she was out of cookies. She got up, reached into a cupboard, and found three bags of crisps, and these went down in fistfuls with the last of the drink. Another look in the cupboard yielded a few more chocolate bars, which she greedily consumed.</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to heat up the pies she simply took several scoops of ice cream and put them on each pie until it was covered. Then she brought the first pie to her mouth and devoured it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite just being taken out of the fridge the pie wasn't hard or uncomfortably cold and although she would have prefered it nice and warm she still liked the taste of this pie now identified as cranberry. She siftly downed the pie the ice cream and cranberry causing a mess on her face and pyjama shirt. After that she moved on to the next, lemon morang, then the last one, blueberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned and sat down in the kitchen chair to let her rub her belly. She looked over at the ice cream pail which still had some icecream in it and decided to finish it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took scoop after scoop greedily gobbling up the creamy treat almost getting her face right in the pail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally finished she put down the pail and pulled up her shirt fully explosing her swollen tum. She resumed rubbing it as it made it's digestive noises finally satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should get back to bed if I want to be awake in time for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned as she got up off the chair and removed all the garbage she had created then went to the bathroom to clean up the pie and icecream stains from her face. Although slightly disressed about the ones on her shirt she felt that her mother wouldn't mind, not the way she was now and resigned herself to another blissfull sleep.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust five minutes later her mother returned with two more trollies packed with treats. The first trolly was stacked high which at least two-hundred donuts, eclairs and assorted pastries. The second trolly contained a pitcher of water and tarts piled nearly as high as the other cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meer sight of it all made Wendy drool and she licked her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother moved the trillies so that one was on each side of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in Wendy.

Although she did like the feeling of a big full belly she cared most about eating so the more room in her belly the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to cover herself up with her sheets but her bloated gut took up too much leaving her feet and shoulders exposed. At first frustrated she started to admire the large mound of flesh that was her belly and smiled. She felt a great sense of accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling back down she ignored the lack of coverage and drifted to sleep eagerly awaiting lunch when she would eat more.</span></div></div>",

Swollen to over 500 pounds in just three weeks, the girl she had been was unrecognizable under the pile of belly-centric blubber she was now. Wendy wasn't sure she had seen anyone as fat as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to the tryouts, almost two hours on the highway, was the hardest part. Wendy's mother, worried about her daughter stuffing herself before the big moment, only stopped for food twice, and even then she limited her daughter to two large combos and two extra-large milkshakes. By the time they reached the arena where the competition was being held Wendy's stomach was crying out for food. Hunger had become a foreign concept to her, almost unbearable after being able to let loose so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had parked Wendy's mother helped her behemoth daughter to the registration area, Wendy huffing and puffing after weeks of inactivity. Standing at the table where her mother was filling out paperwork, Wendy detected the faintest aroma of food coming from behind the double doors to her right. She almost had to stop herself from following her nose, and as she and her mother had to wait another ten minutes before being called time almost came to a stop. When her name was finally called Wendy was ravenous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the headset-wearing intern to the double doors, Wendy found herself in a large room in front of three judges. A couple banquet tables covered with food were between them and her, with three chairs on her side. It took remarkable restraint for Wendy to not rush the tables and begin chowing down, but a sudden attack of nerves as three pairs of eyes stared at her kept her in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was directed to a chair and told not to start eating yet, and once she was seated two other contestants were brought in. One man and one woman, Wendy sized up her competition.</span></div></div>",

All of her clothes were huge one-size-fits all sweatpants, sweat shorts, and shirts with her all girl's school name on them.\"Oh my god, I'm huge!!!\" <br>\r\n\"Wendy, come downstairs, you're going to be late for school!\"<br>\r\nWendy put on her sweat shorts and shirt, but no shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy reluctantly goes downstairs to see a huge spread of breakfast on the kitchen table.

There was a rascal scooter with an extra wide cushioned seat, a leg rest, a cup holder, and a pouch on the side with snacks. She sat down in it. It was practically a recliner on wheels. It had the words \"Lazy Chair\" on the side. She didn't even have to move a finger, it just drove her out of the door and to her bus stop, where all her friends sat on their own Lazy chairs in the same outfit as Wendy. They were all just as fat as her. And none of them had shoes either. Well, they didn't really need shoes because their chairs would keep their feet off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus came and they all got on and went to school.<br>\r\nIt was then she realized this was no dream.</span></div></div>",

As her eyes slowly opened, she saw her mother was carrying her usual platter of pre-breakfast treats \u2013 a stack of pancakes glistening in butter, a huge pitcher of creamy milk, and a stack of peanut butter sandwiches. The tray was placed down at her side and she eagerly began to tuck in, shovelling the food into her mouth. After five minutes, the food was gone, but she was still hungry; she pulled open a draw on her bedside table and reached in, her fat fist pulling out a handful of candy bars. She eagerly unwrapped them, pushing them into her mouth and chewing on the chocolate and caramel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only thing that could convince Wendy to move quickly was food...she slid out of bed, still holding a candy bar in her hand, and waddled towards the door. The week had an obvious effect on her; her pyjama top was bulging at the seams, and a trace of belly could be seen reaching over her waistband. Moving through the door, she shoved the candy bar into her mouth and dropped into her seat. A huge platter, loaded with bacon, sausages, fried bread, and eggs was placed in front of her, along with a large fork; she eagerly began to dig in. A large bottle of coke was placed by her side that she took swigs from in between bites. As the tray began to empty, she gasped out, \u201cMore, Mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait honey, before I bring over your cereal, what do you want to do today?\u201d</span></div></div>",

After she had finished the last of the food on the table, she pushed herself up, took a last swig to finish off the bottle of Coke, and went back to her room to change; her mother was already out getting the car ready. Eventually she staggered into a pink tracksuit, which revealed a sizeable muffin top; she grabbed another handful of chocolate bars to eat on the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip took a long half-hour, and she eagerly anticipated lunch; at this point Wendy could not conceive of not being full, and patted her eager belly expectantly. She walked into the shop and up to the counter, and began to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr...four Big Macs, a dozen McNuggets, make that two dozen, make that five Big Macs, with three milkshakes, and supersize it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the cash over the counter, with her mum simply ordering a few McNuggets, and was rewarded with a tray loaded with the greasy food she loved. She dropped the tray on a table and began to pig out, stuffing fries into her mount with a snorting noise and gobbling away at the burgers, in between slurps of milkshake. She did not notice the attention that she was getting from the rest of the customers, nor noticed that her top was rising up over her belly. She gasped for breath after her third burger, but went back to finish with a resounding belch, and patted her now full belly happily.</span></div></div>",

The smooth ride lulled her gently to sleep, her mouth filled with chocolate, and her hand patting her contented belly, and she began to dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was no longer in the old Toyota; she was now sitting in the back of a huge limousine, a pink tracksuit straining to contain her belly \u2013 which was now somewhat larger than before, and could clearly be seen. By her side was a huge tub of popcorn and another filled with chocolate bars; to her other side was a row of buttons, each marked with the logo of a different fast food restaurant. She stabbed her finger down on the Pizza Hut button, and the limo started up, heading at high speed down the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noted a drinks fountain in front of her, and some litre-sized plastic cups in a holder. She pushed a tab, and cola came flooding out of it. She filled the cup to the brim, and started to drink it down in quick gulps. After a few minutes, the limo stopped, and the window came down \u2013 to reveal a Pizza Hut attendant bearing five pizza boxes. Wendy eagerly snatched them, and the window quickly wound up. Each was hawaiian, her favourite, and she hungrily began to scoff them down. Tomato juice and melted cheese ran down her double chin as she gnawed away, but within only a few minutes, she found that she was on her third pizza. She quickly stabbed the 'Taco Bell' button, and the limo speeded on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just run out of pizza, and let out a loud belch that sent the fabric of her tracksuit vibrating, when the limo pulled up again. Wendy dumped the boxes out of the window, almost on the foot of the attendant who gave her a paper bag filled with a dozen tacos. She knew that this wouldn't last, so she pushed the McDonalds button almost as she started to eat, chomping away at one taco after another, sauce flowing onto her top, even onto her belly itself \u2013 which remarkably hardly felt full, though it was stretching the material a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer greasy fingers slipped and hit the wrong button \u2013 instead of McDonalds, she was heading for home. She sighed, and chewed the last of her burgers, but after a few minutes, the windows came down and she was heading through some ornate gates, over which was written 'Wendy's', and a huge mansion lay ahead, as the limo crunched down the gravel.</span></div></div>",

Tired from her meal, she happily sat in the chair, and was surprised \u2013 but pleased \u2013 when a servant placed a huge bowl of chocolate mousse with a ladle on her lap. She began to gulp it down as the chair went down the drive, and her stomach began to slowly expand with the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered the mansion, she gasped for breath, sending chocolate dribble flying through the air. To her right was a swimming pool filled with Coca-Cola, fizzing away as if inviting her in. To her left were hot plates spilling over with delicious food, and a dozen attendants with trays ready to leap into action. A huge chocolate fountain filled the centre of the room, and spread on every remaining surface were platters loaded with cakes, chocolates and sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair moved forward to a large throne at the head of the room. While she was on her way, the empty bowl cluttered to the floor, and a pair of attendants brought up platters loaded with cream cakes and chocolate pies; she eagerly dug in, grabbing one with each hand. Sitting on the throne \u2013 which was huge \u2013 more attendants came forward \u2013 one with a tray filled with burgers, each of which went down in two bites, another with a dozen milkshakes which went down in a few gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach began to rise like dough in an oven, and a large muumuu \u2013 extremely loose \u2013 was placed over her head, briefly interrupting her feeding. Four different attendants were holding up trays for her now, and her hands were becoming a blur. It no longer seemed to matter what she wanted \u2013 there was always an amazing greasy treat within reach. She began to get fatter and fatter, and could feel her old clothes tearing under the muumuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo attendants then brought up an enormous cake, five tiers high, covered in chocolate sauces. One held up a cake fork, but Wendy just looked up in disbelief before grabbing bits off with her mouth. After a few minutes, even this was not fast enough, and she dived in with her face to grab anything within reach. All too soon, it was gone, and she lay back on her thrown, panting, as a dozen attendants waited to serve her more delicious food.</span></div></div>",

This had become a nearly-daily visit for mom, but Wendy hadn't been here for a couple of weeks. As she reached for a trolley, she heard a fanfare over the speakers, and then a man in a suit came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations!

Reaching up with her arms, she pushed boxes upon boxes of chocolate bars into the cart, followed by bags and bags of jelly treats. Two shelves were rapidly growing emptier as she made her way further up the isle, to pull huge bags of crisps into her cart. She had managed all this in just three minutes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sugar craze was upon her...she pushed her trolley, now half full, up to the bakery section, pulling a dozen and a half boxes of delicious doughnuts down, before reaching the fresh-baked section. Cakes, cream puffs, eclairs, dozens of such treats found their way into her cart, as she rapidly emptied out the section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with three minutes left, she looked back at the biscuits section, quickly depositing a dozen bottles of milkshake into her cart. Tube after tube of biscuits found their way in, and the cart was becoming dangerously full. Only two minutes left, and she found herself in the frozen food section \u2013 junk food heaven. Dozens of pizzas, fried chicken, burgers, pies, chips, all the greasy food she could grab, and the trolley was heaped with produce as the stopwatch ran out.</span></div></div>",

Still her stomach was rumbling when the doorbell rang, and she made her way to the door, sending a collection of wrappers flying. The door opened to reveal the pizza delivery guy \u2013 which whom she was growing better acquainted, lately \u2013 holding three pizza boxes. She grabbed them out of his hands, and mumbled a thank you as she closed the door, making her way to the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping only to grab a couple of bottles of Pepsi, she dropped the boxes on the table and opened the first one. She wolfed down the first few slices, tomato and cheese running down her cheeks, the started to swig down gulps of Pepsi, giving off loud belches. She rolled up the last slice, and chomped away as it went into her mouth, giving off a sigh of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second box yielded a Hawaiian pizza, which rapidly began to go the same way as the first. An empty bottle cluttered to the floor as her greasy fingers struggled to open another. Slice after slice went down, and her belly purred with satisfaction. Two slices at a time, the pizza went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the third box. She was gasping a bit at this point \u2013 horror of horrors, she almost felt full. A full meat pizza sat there, tempting her to dive into its cheesy goodness...and she just could not resist. Her hands reached in, grabbed three slices, mashed them together into a sandwich, and began to chow down. Three slices at a time, she could not resist any more, and belched her way through the last pizza. Her stomach had pushed her T-shirt up still more, and she slowly waddled to her room, collapsing onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, there was a knock on the door, and her mum walked in carrying four shopping bags \u2013 the contents of which she poured over the bed \u2013 dozens of chocolate bars, packets of eclairs, doughnuts, bags of crisps.

What was this feeling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she recognized it as indigestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom, hang on a sec,\" Wendy gulped, taking time out to relax her bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, anything for you, my sweetie pie,\" her mother said, resting her hands on her daughter's shoulder. Her fingers pressed into her flesh, and, soon, Wendy came to realize something was a tad off about her touch. It wasn't like this was the first time her mother had rested her hand on her shoulder, but right now, there was just something strangely unsettling about her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though she were measuring just how much flesh she had on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas her mother fattening her up? That was a silly idea, really. What reason would she have for trying to plumpen up her own daughter into a butterball? Was it perhaps to teach her a lesson for wanting sugary junk so often? That would seem a little extreme of a response, wouldn't it? Even so, it was odd how she'd magically just change her tune overnight like that. Or what if her parents right now were really lizard people disguised as human beings, fattening Wendy up just so they could eat of her flesh!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...nah, that'd be stupid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though, by eating her full she'd be playing into her mother's plans, assuming her paranoia had even a thread of truth behind them.

As her mother passed her the last chocolate bar, she was gasping for breath, but she managed to cram it in, chew, and then lie back on her bed. Her pants were struggling to contain her jiggling belly. She licked her chocolate-covered lips as she slowly drifted off to sleep, her hands \u2013 and her mothers \u2013 slowly rubbing her soft stomach, kneeding in the food as it rapidly turned into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome glorious smells woke her up a few hours later. She struggled to get out of bed, and waddled out of her room into the kitchen. Her stomach was rumbling, and strangely enough, despite her feast, she was starving; she looked at the clock in the hall to find that just three hours had passed. That wasn't right; where the flowers had been this morning, there was a bowl full of doughnuts. They looked so tempting, she couldn't help put eat one; it exploded in her mouth like a puff-ball of sugar, and she grabbed another one as she headed into the kitchen. The table was set for one, and her mother was frantically moving around between the microwave, grill and oven; the smells were amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit down, dear, I'll serve you now!\u201d, Wendy's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sat down at the table, and grabbed a knife and fork; dropped in front of her was a tray filled with sausages, which she speared with her fork and shoved into her mouth; grease ran down her face \u2013 past her rapidly developing double chin, and down onto her already messy top. Five, six, seven, eight, all went into her mouth one after the other, each tasting better somehow than the last. There were still three left on the plate when her mother snatched it away, and she quickly forked one more. She felt a tearing sound as the seat of her pants began to gave way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaced in their stead was another platter, filled with cheeseburgers, all huge and loaded with toppings \u2013 onion rings, hash browns, but without even the slightest trace of salad. Wendy struggled to get her hands around the first of them, and struggled even harder to get it into her waiting mouth; there was an eruption of fat and grease, spattering across the table, as she took the first bite. And there were five of them to finish. She gulped and gasped her way through the first one, then reached down for the second, chewing and chomping the greasy meat down her throat. Once again, the plate was taken away before she had quite finished \u2013 she reached down and grabbed the fourth burger, hastily beginning to cram it into her mouth. She gasped a deep breath, and a button flew off her top, exposing more of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot dogs! Two dozen of them! Loaded with onions and mustard. These went in one at a time, and she was almost able to slide them into her mouth. A little voice at the back of her head was telling her that she had eaten enough, to stop, but a louder voice from her greedy belly demanded more, More, MORE! Ten, twelve, fourteen; she had one hot dog in each hand now, but again they were taken from her before she was quite finished. The waistline of her pants gave out, and her stomach began to roll across her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaced in front of her now was a huge blancmange, made of chocolate, almost eight inches high and about as wide; it was about as big as her head. With a spoon almost as big as a ladle in her hand, she tucked in, shovelling the chocolate into her mouth in huge gulps, traces running down her chin, sliding down the grease from the previous courses. Wendy barely stopped to breathe, not wanting this to be taken away before she had finished, and she attacked it vigourously, while her stomach continued its march forward. Finally, she dropped the spoon into the bowl, hearing it clatter against the bottom, and sat back on her chair, gasping for breath. She held her newly-enlarged stomach in her hands, moaning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou go and have a lie down, Wendy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed no further encouragement, and staggered back into her room. The doughnuts didn't tempt her this time, and she only had one on her way back to her bed. Running through her mind was a sense of triumph at having eaten so much, and other thought of just how big she was going to get if she kept on eating like this. She pushed open the door of her room \u2013 and found a tray of cupcakes waiting on her bedside table, calling to her...</span></div></div>",

Everyone was looking at her, though; she strode down the street in killer heels, the latest fashions, and covered with jewels. A man walked out of a shop with a box of a dozen doughnuts \u2013 that wasn't right, they were supposed to be hers. She strutted over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose are mine. Give them to me.\u201d, she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, he passed her the box and walked on. Gripping the box with one hand, she began to wolf down the doughnuts with the other. A street vendor walked past, with a tray of hot dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want some of those. Make me four of them.\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, without a word, she was passed four hot dogs, loaded with onions and mustard. They went in, one after another. This was fun. Her stomach began to swell slightly. Looking around, she saw a McDonalds \u2013 a group of teenagers were coming out of the store with their food. Not theirs \u2013 hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive all that to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed the food \u2013 five Big Macs, fries, and Cokes \u2013 over to her; she went back inside, sat down, and started to eat, tearing the burgers around. She began to grown again, her clothes expanding to encompass her. Letting out a huge burp, she reached over to the next table and snatched an uneaten burger from another customer polishing it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweets now. She walked over to a news vendor, and just began to help herself to chocolate bars, eating one after another. When \u2013 unusually \u2013 she came across one she didn't like, she simply threw it aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like my Danish, ma'am?\u201d, said a old woman who walked over to her. Now they were getting the idea. She snatched it away and ate it in one, and looked down to see that her belly was getting larger and larger, as was the rest of her. She was growing fatter by the minute, and loved it. </span></div></div>",

So we counted up how of it we had to sell to buy you a year's worth of chocolate, and that's what we did! I hope it's enough for you, my love\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy gradually became aware that the two sofas, double-wide chair and two bean bags had been replaced by a fairly simple, but well-cushioned chair, that could just about fit two average-sized butts. Wendy had, of course, far surpassed average-sized, as her tight dressing gown and jiggling flesh reminded her at that moment, but she still fit pretty snugly into that chair. She examined the pile and discovered that her parents had bought her all of her favourite treats. And yet in the back of her mind, she found herself almost disappointed. Really, a year's worth? Sure, it was a huge pile, that covered a quarter of the entire living room and rose high towards the ceiling, hundreds of lbs worth of chocolate. But Wendy was salivating looking at the pile and her belly, despite still being full from yesterday, gave a huge groan of desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her arms to scoop up as much as she could carry, Wendy collapsed into the chair, which was quite comfortable around her swollen derriere, and began to snack with the TV on, in much the same routine that she had enjoyed for over a week now. She had quickly grown used to having her enormous appetite constantly catered to, and she wondered how on Earth she had ever managed to survive on so little as 3000 calories a day. Thank heavens for this sudden change of heart! In the back of her mind she was a little troubled by the strange dream that she could quite remember from the previous night, and also the fact that her parents were selling off their belongings in order to fund her superhuman consumption. But in those moments her eyes drifted back to that enormous pile of chocolate, and her greed overtook her. She wanted to eat it all, she imagined having a mouth and throat twice the size so she could eat twice as quickly. That was Wendy's thought process ever as she gobbled her way through a mountain of chocolate. \"Not enough\". \"More chocolate\". \"Quicker\". \"More full\". \"More food\". \"More\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours began to pass in a chocolate-stained blur, during which Wendy came to the decision to tell her mother something very important...</span></div></div>",

There were plants growing in the grass that had not been there before. And on the plants... food! Wendy couldn't believe her eyes. Fast food literally growing right in front of her. There was a plant with pizza slices hanging off it, another with chunks of chocolate cake, one with burgers, another with huge meatballs drenched in sauce... Wendy was in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did hear her parents saying to her \"we saw the news, apparently there are hundreds of these plants growing all over the world!\" but Wendy paid only a little attention to them. She had already started plucking food from the first one, the burger one. She shoved a burger into her mouth... it was amazing! Had Wendy thought about it she might have realised that a burger plant growing directly from natural would be made of natural ingredients and not mass-produced with chemicals the way fast food chains made them. She didnt think that, though. She just grabbed a second burger and tried to fit that into her mouth whilst the first was still in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, breakfast was finished.

Lips were stained with grease, bellies were pushing out from underneath shirts, satisfied expressions revealed the sated bellies of a handful of the people who had been lucky enough to come across free fast food. Some skinny teenage girls at the back of the bus were looking around disgustedly, so Wendy decided to walk to the back and sit right next to them. Her flabby butt covered the seat and spilled over onto the girl next to her, who recoiled slightly, but didn't say anything. Wendy burped contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a struggle for Wendy to get up and walk around, not just because of the fullness of her belly and the thickness of her thighs, but also because her clothes were so tight around her, the pants especially causing her a lot of discomfort. Wendy's mum had confessed to setting aside a \"food budget\" for making sure Wendy was constantly fed, but with the food trees appearing, had given her a large wad of cash for spending on clothes instead. Wendy bought herself several tops in three different sizes, the largest of which looked like it was made for a whale but made Wendy salivate when she thought about how much food she would have to eat to fit into them. She bought herself a full new wardrobe and asked the store to deliver them to her home because of the number of bags. Wendy didn't want to carry a thing, it sounded like exercise! She did however put on a baggy red shirt and a pair of denim short shorts so as to get out of her old tight clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was walking around the mall, Wendy was starting to notice people carrying food, donuts and burgers and pizza that all looked very similar to the ones she had seen that morning. Her stomach had, apparently, finished digesting all the food from yesterday and that morning, and Wendy begun to realise just how long she had spent at the mall. A whole three hours had gone by without any food at all, and Wendy began to feel an intense hunger swell from the pit of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" she said to a chunky blonde in her 20s who was wolfing down on some pepperoni pizza. \"Can I ask where you got that pizza from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman pointed to a fire exit nearby, not wanting to wast a second of eating time talking to a teenager. Wendy rushed off towards the exit, trying to find where the free food was. She felt a pain in her belly that was unmistakeably demanding. She was starving! Wendy had rarely felt such a hunger, she usually kept herself too stuffed to ever feel hunger like this. Maybe she was getting so fat that even a couple of hours without food brought out these pains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after following the empty coridoor to the end, Wendy found a patch of grass with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The plants seemed to bend towards the bench, making it the perfectg seat for stuffing. Wendy was enthused by this idea, lazing on a park bench in the warm sunshine, stuffing herself constantly on food that was practically forcing itself on her, nobody to disturb her gorging, it was like a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe parked her large rear down on the bench, and grabbed from the plant on her left hand side. Hot dogs, just like the ones she had dreamed about the previous night, full of onions and covered in mustard, the dog itself was huge and plump, and Wendy moaned as she slid it into her mouth and took a colossal bite. She finished it off in two more bites, and had already plucked another one off the plant and moved it to her mouth. She kept grabbing greedily at them, blissful in the sun, until she found she had emptied the plant's contents. It had been twenty minutes and she had eaten lord knows how many hot dogs and yet there was nobody about. It was almost eerie. Free food, out in the open like this, and so much time had passed with nobody around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy kept going, massaging her belly from time to time to free up some room in her stomach so that it could handle as much as she desired, which, as she already knew, was an almost unlimited amount. The time came, eventually, as it was approaching evening, when every plant was empty of food, all the pizzas and cakes and donuts and calories had finally ended up in Wendy's belly, and she looked down at herself, belly completely bursting with fullness, finally satisfied. She was huge and the shirt she had bought just earlier that day was now a snug fit rather than loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly grumbled...</span></div></div>",

Wendy wasn't a math genius but did a few basic sums and come up with an approximation... she had eaten enough food for thirty meals! Well, Normal Person meals anyway, which is a completely different amount to Wendy meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she felt fairly satisfied, and least a reasonable amount considering her epic gluttony. She would be sated for several hours. Well, two hours... maybe one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had to take a deep breath and concentrate hard to be able to get herself to her feet, and even then she nearly fell right back down as her centre of gravity shifted around her huge full belly. She began to take pondorous steps, back the way she came, when she realised the fire exit was not empty. There was a group of people standing wtching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er, don't get up,\" one of them said, a young-ish male with glasses. He walked over to her, took her hand and went to support her weight. \"Sorry for this but, er, we want to help.\" He looked sheepishly at Wendy's puzzled expression. It was lucky for him that Wendy was full and had muddled thoughts or she may well have reacted worse to his intrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was led back down the fire exit by a group of five people, each helping her take each step, one or two of them seeming to caress her flesh as they did so. It was a struggle for Wendy to form an emotional reaction to all this, it was creepy and weird but certainly less weird than fast food appearing out of the ground, and she really did appreciate the assistance in walking. As she walked, the guy in glasses was talking, nervously, it seemed, but sort of adoringly at the same time, in a way Wendy liked even if she didn't rally know what to make of the words coming out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and when we realised what the plants were it started changing people, on the one hand you had people who become gluttons, who started gorging themselves on as much food as they could, and on the other hand you had people like us, who suddenly developed an obsession with watching people eat. I got here first, and I couldn't take my eyes off you. You ate like food was the air. That you needed it in you constantly just for survival. Just an excess of consumption that I felt attracted to without understanding why. Every now and again a person appeared, I would either turn them away or allow them to wtch you with me. We became...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy drifted in and out of the man's words as she was led down hallways and coridoors and stairs... had there been stairs earlier? She didn't know, she could feel herself being complimented, being assisted, treated like a celebrity, a queen even. She allowed herself to wallow in the decadent treatment of those that desired to serve her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was led on, in her food stupor she daydreamed of an endless line of servents carrying food plants, walking a long red carpet to a golden throne the size of a house upon which she sat, forever being fed huge quantities of food by adoring slaves, never having to lift a finger, queen of gluttony forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was snapped out of this by the sound of a door shutting behind her and she found herself in a room with...</span></div></div>",

She'd been led into a small simple room, with a few chairs and a single window, as if this were an old abandoned classroom. Seated on one of the chairs, or more precisely, two of the chairs, was a very fat woman nibbling on a chocolate cake. She waved to Wendy and swallowed the mouthful of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy, please\", she said, reaching into one of the many plastic containers that surrounded her seating. \"I have some chocolate cake you can eat while we wait. It's got chocolate sprinkles on top of white chocolate icing and there's a layer of caramel icing and I think cherry liqueur as well.\" She took out a fist-sized slice and crammed it into her mouth. The cake looked decadent, until it was smeared all over the mystery woman's mouth, that is. There were food stains littering the top of her body giving Wendy the impression that she had been eating for a long time, but unlike Wendy herself, betrayed no signs of fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy introduced herself timidly, as the woman handed her a plastic container. \"A girl your size at such a young age\" the woman chuckled, \"ah that takes me back to my youth. My name is Sydney, and maybe in ten years you can catch up with me.\" She took a bite out of the cake that made Wendy gasp. How could so much food fit in one mouth? How did she not choke? \"Impressive, don't you think?\" she winked, \"I'm 450 pounds, I've always been huge but in the last couple of years I've decided, to hell with it, I may as well go at top speed. Food is the only thing that drives me into the next day. What is life about if not self-pleasure?\" Sydney pondered to herself. \"You're not eating your cake\" she added at Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to appear ungrateful in front of such esteemed company, Wendy began to nibble at the slice, ignoring the protestations from her midriff, but insisted to herself she would have no more. However, having idly chatted to Sydney about her day-to-day life, and school, and the miracle of these food plants, Wendy soon found had devoured four slices of cake and was unwrapping a fifth. Her gluttony was so uncontrollable she was consuming on auto-pilot, and the thought of continuing made her even more desirous for food. Unfortunately, once the fifth slice had disappeared into her monstrous, but now comparatively undistinguished, belly, the pair found that they had finished all available food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guys promised us more food, you know\", Sydney said, \"What was it that they told you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have to confess, I zoned out a little,\" Wendy said blushing, \"I'm sure they said something but I was, well, fantasizing at the time\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I get that a lot too.

She wanted more, even with how much she had already eaten all she could think about was, MORE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of doing the reasonable thing and going to the mall for clothes, Wendy decided to find more of the free food.

Increasingly, food was coming to completely dominate her life, and she hugged her growing belly tightly while she slept. She woke up with a start, the room filled with a delightful combination of smells, all manner of deliciousness. Her stomach began to rumble, and her mom pushed the door open, bearing a large platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPre-breakfast for you, dear! Two stacks of pancakes, some jam sandwiches, some peanut butter sandwiches, and another pitcher of milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice what she had eaten for pre-breakfast yesterday; her stomach rumbled in anticipation. The platter was dropped down on her lap, and she began to gulp it down. A fork loaded the pancakes into her mouth, two at a time, syrup running down her chin; another hand alternated between the jam and peanut butter sandwiches. Every few minutes, she took another gulp from the pitcher of milk. There was a slight creaking from her pyjama top, the buttons beginning to complain at the new strain they were facing. She ran her fingers across her chin to collect some of the syrup, and discovered her burgeoning double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she ate, her mom brought in another three bags of chocolates, crisps and other snacks, and piled them onto her desk and bedside table, before bustling out. Soon the smells from before intensified, and she hurried to finish her first snack. The last of the sandwiches was gone, and the last of the milk \u2013 somehow she was still hungry, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, and moved to the door \u2013 waddled would be the best word for it \u2013 slothful and filled with food. Outside, the hall table had a pile of eclairs \u2013 she grabbed one, gulping the creamy goodness into her mouth, before taking a second one. She was still holding it as she entered the kitchen, when her eyes boggled at what lay in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was once again laden with food. Bacon piled high on a plate, sausages on another; it looked like an entire pig had been sacrificed at the altar of her appetite. A stack of waffles filled another plate, loaded down with maple syrup, and a heaped pile of cinnamon toast covered another. Ten fried eggs were arranged around what looked to be a whole loaf of toast, all swimming in butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down at the table, grabbed a large spoon, and began to shovel in the greasy, fatty food. Remembering dinner last night, she bolted it down, hardly even stopping to breathe; she was eager to eat every mouthful of the delicious food. Grease swam down her chin as she abandoned the cutlery to eat with her hands; she hardly noticed when her mom refilled the sausage and bacon plates after she had finished them, only aware that there was more food, more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pyjamas gave up after the cinnamon toast; while the buttons held, the seams did not; the tearing noise barely registered; she was pouring a bottle of orange fizz down her throat at the time. All of a sudden, the food had run out; Wendy sat there, gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooohhhh....\u201d, she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo and have a lie down in the sitting room, watch some television. I'll bring in some snacks for you to much on while I get lunch ready.\u201d Her mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore food?\u201d, Wendy said, half interestedly, half uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs much as you want.

Patting her massive belly, still glutted from her breakfast feast, Wendy waddled unsteadily into the kitchen where her mother was unpacking 5 incredibly greasy pizzas and bags and bags of Mcdonald\u2019s treats, as well as a large stack of giant burritos. Wendy gulped greedily and plopped herself down onto the creaking chair with a loud *GLOP*. Giggling at her appetite and ravening hunger, she dove into the mountain of food without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizzas were the first to go, Wendy giving them her classic treatment of mounting three at a time and shoving them into her mouth. all four meat-lovers pizzas rapidly disappeared into Wendy\u2019s burgeoning gt, and she had to rest for a few minutes as this new feast slammed directly on top of her monumental gorging from breakfast. Wendy belched happily and chugged her second two liter coke and gave her gurgling gut a few heavy, happy slaps. Damn, pizzas were delicious, she thought, its too bad there are only four of them here. All the fattening greasy meat and cheese made her food-clogged heart just sing with joy. Wheeling back into a sitting position with soft gurgling emanating from her ponderously glutted stomach, Wendy resumed her lunchtime feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burgers, fries, chicken tenders and burritos, all topped off with mountainous trays of cookies and fudge and gallons of ice cream, passed in a food-induced blur for Wendy. She greedily shovelled more and more into her ravenous gullet as if her indulgent mother would take it away from her. Her overencumbered stomach compliantly spilled ever more gelatinous-ly over to her knees and her three mammoth tire rolls bloated out with gorging into a single massive, shaking, burbling spare tire of quaking lard. Finishing her meal finally by managing to shove two entire mammoth cheesecake into her belly (of course smothered in whipped cream) in record time, Wendy unexpectedly hiccupped loudly and she let out a thunderously rich and oversatisfied belch, allowing her superstuffed stomach to churn her fantastic gluttings in weary, resigned indigestion. Leaning back tiredly in her chair, Wendy gave another unexpected hiccup and wearily patted her giant belly woozily: \u201cHIC...UUUURRRPPPP...oooooofff That was good, Mom! Damn I can\u2019t believe I ate that much...HIC...even two cheesecakes. TWO, mom! That was unbelievably rich, but I feel like my belly\u2019s gunna bust...BUUURRRPP HIC HIC.\u201d Wendy\u2019s mother smiled indulgently: \u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it dear. I gotta go shopping to get stuff for dinner, remember last night? That\u2019s going to happen again. Go to the couch and lie down and I\u2019ll bring you some snacks before I leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy hiccupped again and squealed: \u201cHIC...eee! more food? my belly\u2019s favorite thing...HIC!\u201d She delightedly struggled to heft her newly-grown form out of her chair and she carefully plodded to the couch where she collapsed with a thunderous *GURGLE GLOP*, punched the remote, and slowly wheeled her overgorged form into a reclining position and immediately jiggled her churning gut happily to make room for more food. Grabbing as much of her lard-filled gut as she could, she sloshed her rich eatings back and forth in a slow wave-like motion that calmed some of the churning indigestion in  her superswollen stomach. Wendy\u2019s mother wheeled in her trolleys of treats and left the house, saying: \u201cBye Wendy, enjoy your afternoon of gorging!\u201d Wendy\u2019s eyes glinted greedily as she stuffed a quarter of a cheescake into her mouth. She certainly would.</span></div></div>",

She looked at herself in the mirror; an almost perfect pear shape looked back at her. Double chin wiggling, with a few greasy stains left over from breakfast, huge belly sticking out, jiggling slightly under her too-tight sweat top, huge butt, and wide legs. She sighed, stepped off the scales, and waddled into the TV room, plopping herself down on the couch. Next to her was a big bowl of popcorn; she turned the TV on with one hand to one of her Spanish soaps, while taking gulps of popcorn with her other hand; some kernels dropped out of her mouth, leaving greasy marks on her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFancy a little snack, dear? Brunch will be about half an hour.\u201d, her mom said, as she dropped a couple of bags down beside the popcorn, already almost running out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalf an hour? That's ages.\u201d, Wendy whined. She reached into the first bag, coming out with a box of doughnuts; more jam and cream, little sugary bombs dropping into her stomach. She began to daydream of having as much food as she wanted, whenever she wanted \u2013 trays and carts of it, brought forward by servants to feed her ever-growing belly. All she ever thought about was food, nothing else seemed to matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doughnuts ran out while she was having her daydream, but she mechanically switched to the other bag, filled with chocolate bars. She unwrapped them with one hand while eating them with the other \u2013 chocolate, nougat, caramel, a dozen different flavours. Twenty chocolate bars disappeared, and she was \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 sated, and began to concentrate on her show. She could already smell cooking from the kitchen, and another little feast would soon be hers. But she wanted a big feast, huge rooms filled with food, and all for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio began to play, music dying away to an announcer reading something out. Just news. As long as the price of sugar didn't go up, why should she care? After a minute, she realised that the sounds of cooking had stopped, and she heard running footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy, it's amazing! We've won the lottery! Fifty million, and all ours! I just checked. And it's all going in that belly of yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dreams were getting a little closer...</span></div></div>",

And two kitchens, which was most important \u2013 and four chefs, which was even more important. Only just up the road was a huge food court, one of the best Wendy had ever seen. A month of non-stop eating of the most fattening foods she could find; she'd gained two pounds from the celebration binge alone. Nothing but the best, and all she could eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it showed. Wendy lay sprawled on a divan, her three chins jigging as she pushed in chocolate after chocolate from a silver tray laid by her side. Her huge belly sprawled outwards, almost off the divan \u2013 another, larger one was already on its way \u2013 and her flabby arms bulging out of her velvet top. Legs almost seeming useless, covered in fat. Around her fat neck were a dozen necklaces, with precious jewels mounted; a diamond-studded tiara was perched on her head. Not that she cared about the finery at the moment. Pictures of feasts stared down at her from all the walls. A clock ticked down to her next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had fallen into a new daily routing fairly easily. Pre-breakfast and breakfast were served in her palatial bedroom, her four-poster bed designed to make it easy to get platters of food in and out. The two meals were increasingly running into each other. Brunch she had on her divan, usually. She had lunch in the huge dining room, at least three fattening courses. Afternoon tea would be back on the divan \u2013 she was waiting impatiently for this now \u2013 and dinner and supper would be in the dining room again. With snacks throughout the rest of the day, of course; the servants scattered platters of sweets around the villa for her to eat wherever she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hot day, and still half an hour till her next meal \u2013 she had raced through lunch today \u2013 and so she decided to head for the pool. She quickly changed \u2013 she looked like a huge stuffed sausage in her bathing suit \u2013 and then slowly waddled outside. On her way she stopped for a pile of bonbons, taking the platter in her hands and dropping it to the ground when she was done. She stepped into the pool, and reclined back onto an airbed; the bed dropped precariously as her bulk fell onto it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her maids, also in swimming costume, came out with another try of snacks \u2013 mostly cream cakes. Wendy grabbed the first one, and shoved it into her mouth greedily, and quickly followed by a second. A large eclair this time, oozing with cream that ran down her flabby fingers. She licked it off, more and more for her belly. Lying there in the sun \u2013 another tray of food already on its way out to her \u2013 she was in a palatial heaven of food. But the best was yet to come...</span></div></div>",

Her food-dazed brain could hardly comprehend how much she had eaten, but that was the definite figure. She slapped her huge belly, hanging down with an enormous muffin top, before waddling back into the dining room for another mammoth day of eating. The day passed by in a blaze of food, junk food all \u2013 no pretense at health food was allowed anywhere near her. Soon it was time for the highlight of the day, dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collapsed on her chair in the dining room like the mountain of blubber she had become, and grunted for her food. The greasy, calorie-laden grub was dropped in front of her \u2013 two plates of fried chicken, and another loaded with links of sausages. A big basket of french fries. No knife or fork were present; Wendy just dived into the food with her hands. She took a huge bite out of a piece of chicken, licking her fingers clean, while a fat fist dived into the french fries. Grease ran down her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled as the second course was placed in front of her. More fried food \u2013 three sirloin stakes, half a dozen pork chops, half a dozen eggs. Again she dived in with her hands, dropping the bones to the floor when she had finished, eagerly diving into the next piece of fried meat. Half way through, the steak plate was refilled; she must have eaten half a cow by the time she had done. Her top began to ride up again, exposing more of that flabby belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third course \u2013 lasagne. Served in what was almost a small trough. Garfield's delight, she joked to herself. This time she needed a spoon, and she had one almost as big as a ladle. There was no time to really taste it, she just focused on shovelling it into her mouth \u2013 pasta, meat, tomato and all. Three baguettes of garlic bread were placed on a side, and she dunked it into the rich sauce, taking big gulps. A straining noise could be heard from the seam of her pants, trying to contain her growing fat ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lasagne was gone. Time for dessert. Still her favourite part of every meal, so she'd told mom to make it part of every meal! This came in courses just like everything else. The first course was three cakes \u2013 chocolate, strawberry and vanilla, loaded with cream and oozing with food. With her hands she began to shovel them in, alternating bites to mix up the flavours, taking occasional swigs of fizzy drink. Two side dishes contained pastries \u2013 mostly eclairs, but stuffed with lots and lots of cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the final course \u2013 a mountain of ice cream. Must have been forty scoops, with a dozen different flavours. This would have to be eaten quickly, it was already starting to melt! Ladle first \u2013 shovelling the cream in, getting a periodic brain-freeze but ignoring it for the delicious tastes. Then she began to shovel it in with her hands, digging out huge scoops and pushing them into her throat. Finally, as the mountain became a hill, she simply dived into it with her face, gulping it down in huge bites. She lay back on her chair, gasping for breath, holding her belly with her hands. She panted, to look up and see her mom with another platter, loaded with sugary treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was all she could do to stop herself going face-first into the mountain of snacks laid out before her, but she looked up at her expectant mom and asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you giving me all this food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom turned away, and presented a second platter, this one loaded with hundreds of chocolate bars, all unwrapped and ready.

Her pyjamas began to protest again, the buttons straining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished the top layer, she reached for the second layer. In huge platters, this had stacks of pancakes, with jugs of syrup, melted butter and cream. She liberally poured the over in huge rivulets, and for good measure poured the remainder into her waiting mouth. More forkfuls of pancakes, one after another, she grunted her way through the syrupy, greasy mess. Once she finished, the voices in her head screamed in protest, but her stomach felt happier...and then the door opened, and a second trolley came into the room, laden as heavily as the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snatched slice after slice of heavily buttered toast from the platter, daubing them in honey, jam and peanut butter, mechanically consuming every crumb on the plate. Then cereal \u2013 but the most chocolatey cereal she had ever seen, turning the full fat milk brown as soon as the first flakes touched it. A small trough of it went into her mouth, shovelled in with a small ladle. She was gasping for breath, and only two buttons remained on her pyjamas. Sweat beaded up on her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay back on the bed again, deeply breathing in and out. Both her hands were on her stomach, failing dismally to wrap themselves around it. She must have gained another pound from that, she thought, but it was not yet over \u2013 as a third trolley was pushed in. This one was her dessert \u2013 a hundred doughnuts, a great stack of cream cakes, a jelly as big as her head. The last trace of self-control faded away, and she reached for the sugary treats with both hands, scoffing and cramming into her gaping maw of a mouth. A sheen of sugar covered the grease stains around her triple chins, jiggling up and down; finally she was scooping the jelly with her hands, and the second to last button went on her top, leaving only one complaining one left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll bring in some more snacks in a minute.

She was pretty full from her day of eating, but her midnight snack was looking pretty temping. As the last bit of restraint was lifting before she started eating again, she reasoned with herself that she loved food and there was no problem with how much she was eating or with how her parents were acting. Wendy did want one thing though, and it was to get out of the house. After that thought she couldn't hold back and started to gobble down all of her deserts snacks causing her to really tip over the end of fullness. The big full girl drifted right to sleep and was only woken up by the sound of her breakfast being wheeled into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom I want to go out today!\" Wendy said as she started to sit up and reach her hand out and grab her breakfast tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing honey, I'll prep her car.\" Wendy's appetite meant that she car needed to be fully stocked with food for their trip. The glove box full of cookies, back seat full with bag of chips and candy, Tupperware containers with brownies and cakes, and of course Wendy needed plenty of room for her massive belly. Wendy ate all of her breakfast before jiggling out to the car. The toasty sun beat down on her pale skin. Wendy had not been out side in the longest time. She never had time between meals and snacks for much of anything. She even struggled to find time for her weigh-in's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's wardrobe was non-exsistant. She had gained 200lbs in a month and nothing fit her. Her parents had found a bra that could contain her large boobs, and a shirt that covered them too. No pair of pants could fit up the girls chunky legs so they had custom made  a skirt she could slid on. The thing was so small and was tightly covered across her huge ass. Her belly was fully exposed and hung way over her waist band. The mass shifted and jiggled as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom lets go to the mall and get some clothes. I bet I can find some cute boys too.\" They sped off in the direction of the mall, Wendy snacking all the way. First stop was the big teen girl store. They had all the latest fashions for teen girls Wendy's size. It's was a popular destination at the mall, especially when the moved it next to the food court. Wendy chomped on some cheese burgers they had aquired as they walked to the store. Wendy picked out some tops and some pants and her mother paid for them. Her hunger had come back so they went and got a large bag of tacos. Wendy continued to stroll around the mall eating taco after taco out of her bag as she walked. All the boys couldn't help but notice Wendy as she walked by. They were used to big girls around here but not as big and beautiful as Wendy. She started getting food offers from all the cute boys. They'd bring her ice cream, or smoothies. She's flirt with one boy until her treat was gone and then she'd move on to the next. She got offerings of cookies or fast food, and would gobble them up right in front of her male compatriots. She started making dinner dates and movie reservations with all the boys. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights were all booked up. she could picture it now, getting picked up by a cute boy and taken to a fancy restaurant where she could eat plate after plate of fancy Italian food. She was getting giddy from the thought of it. After a few last hours in the food court she reconvened with her mom and they went home. Her mom went straight to work on dinner, while Wendy went to work finishing the car supply of food. She then tried on some of her new clothes.

Her face was covered in the remains of her second pre-dinner snack, and food wrappers and discarded scraps lay on the floor around her. One hand patted her huge stomach, peeping out through the buttons of her top, while the other trailed a selection of cupcakes from a large bowl by her side into her eager mouth, dropping them in one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer increased appetite meant that she needed a full-time cook to keep her full, as well as the output of some fast-food restaurants. As the last cupcake dropped into her mouth, and as she prepared to give out a massive scream for more food, her mother pushed the first dinner trolley into the room, pushing it to her side. On it was a huge stack of burgers, hot dogs, and steaks. There was no cutlery, Wendy simply began to tear into everything with her hands. A massive vat of french fries loaded with sauces was dropped in front of her and she began to gorge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the food ran out, it was replaced with different delicacies \u2013 the burgers were replaced with fried chicken, the hot dogs with kebabs, the steaks with fried pork chops. A constant flow of food trailed into her mouth, before she dropped her greasy arms to her side, sending streaks down her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't move. Feed me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother summoned a maid and taking one side each, they began to take food to her waiting mouth. Wendy closed her eyes \u2013 she didn't care what the food was any more, just that it went into her belly. She could feel it pushing against the buttons on her top, feel it slowly expanding. Suddenly the tastes changed, and she could see a huge vat of scrambled eggs being brought in, a huge ladle scooping it up into her mouth.</span></div></div>",

As the month passed and loads of food passed by Wendy's lips, her friends were getting larger by the minute. Although they were not as womanly as Wendy had become in her more than 400lb state, they still ate with the same passion she did. Wendy met with her friends constantly. They would come over, she would go visit their places. She was the least mobile, so most of the time the girls came over, but she liked to get out and visit each of their houses. Of course when the girls did meet up they ate. They ate like there was no tomorrow. Wendy's favorite thing about going over her friends houses was the fact that their parents always served a variety of foods. It mixed up her palette to have different cooking from what her mother made. At home she mostly got American foods, burgers, pancakes, donuts. When she was at her friends she was treated to mostly Chinese at one house, baked goods at another, and her third friend always had good southern foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the girls loved to eat, they did talk too. It was good to socialize. Food was a popular topic, but other things popped up from time to time. The girls talked about clothes too. Being in love with food has its draw backs when you out grow your clothes. Since Wendy was the biggest she was always giving her smaller clothes to her friends. She could always see stains that she had made when she still fit into them. 'Aww I remember when that bowl of pudding fell on me and stained that top...' Even though the girls traded clothes to fit their expanding form they still usually fit pretty snug. Wendy was always spilling out of her tees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the month passed the girls grew. Bellies were rounder, legs were thicker, but stomachs were never empty. The girls were happy. They not only had each other, they had their favorite thing in the whole wide world... food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls grew up...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wendy's parents provided the burgers, another cooked fried chicken, another had fried rice and sushi, and the last baked wonderful treats. The girls had put to use their freshman 15 that first month but had done it again in just one weekend with their parents. Each girl was now checking in at 450. The eating continued until all their parents had to leave. The girls cried, they were going to miss the constant feast they were just allowed, back to waddling to the cafeteria every time hunger struck (which was all the time obviously).

She shushes her stomach telling it, it will be fed soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to rock her massive body back and forth trying to get herself out of bed. After a few minutes she is able to stand her body up and makes her way over to the bathroom. Feeling her hips brush against the door frame she looks herself in the mirror for the first time in a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was large before, now she is huge. Fat slabs of meat make up her breasts as they ooze past her belly. Her butt is the size of an overinflated beach ball that is dimpled with enough cellulite to connect the dots. Her thighs are two tree trunks that are as thick as she once was. However, everything pales in comparison to her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly is still wobbling a minute after she got in here and it is no wonder. Her stomach hangs to her mid thighs and shirts have failed to cover that pale doughy orb a long time ago. Her stomach is broken into two rolls with her bottom roll being riddled with stretch marks from her extreme binging these past couple of months. She gives a good meaty slap  to her belly and she steps onto her scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breaking her last scale, her parents bought a new scale where the weight is sent to her phone. Taking a look at her phone she sees 551 flash on her screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c551!?,\u201d she screams internally, \u201cI have gained hundreds of pounds in only a few months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast time Wendy!\u201d Her mom yells breaking her train of thought. \u201cMaybe I should ease just a little,\u201d she decides to herself as she waddles over to the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to the dining room, she plops her body on the bench feeling the wood bend and creak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go Wendy, I got your favorites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at the table and sees...</span></div></div>",

Instantly, her mother was by her side- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, sweetheart? Aren't you hungry?\" She asked, looking at the pile of food spread out before her daughter- who hadn't even bothered to get out of her ill fitting pajamas. Wendy's sleeveless top barely coverer her massive, doughy chest- a fair amount of both cleavage and underboob pouring out from the top and bottom of the fabric. Her pillowy arms that hung low and wobbled as she moved them were free to open air. Similarly, her bottoms- which had been long pants- only reached about halfway down her calves, and the waistband cut into her doughy butt, two semicircles of pale flesh pouring over it in the back. She was completely barefoot, probably unable to squeeze her feet into her old shoes at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No- no-\" Wendy said, \"of course I'm hungry, it's just...\" She gave her mother a questioning look, her features framed by large softball sized cheeks and five thick chins. \"It just seems...n-nevermind, actually,\" Wendy said quickly, beginning to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no utensils, as usual- they only slowed Wendy down. She grabbed mitfulls of bacon, grease dribbling between her fingers as she made short work of the platter. It must've been two or three pig's worth of the stuff, since it was piled a foot high and a few feet long, on one of those massive serving platters usually reserved for parties. Wendy shoveled it down as quickly as she could, before tackling the omelets. There were ten of them, each one a twelve-egg omelet, packed with ham, cheese, caramelized onions, but no bell peppers or mushrooms- those veggies, even as components of one of these monsters, would be far too healthy to pass Wendy's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, she was stuffed- especially since her stomach was still partially full from the midnight snack her mother had brought her in bed last night. But that didn't matter. Wendy knew how to ignore that full feeling and just keep binging. She grabbed a gallon of chocolate milk, hoisting it to her lips and messily guzzling it. There were several gallons on the table, as one would by no means be enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plate of butter caught her eye- about fifteen sticks of it, unwrapped and stacked up. Without a second thought, Wendy's pudgy hand darted out and started grabbing them, as she ate them like chocolate bars- one after another. Naturally, she then moved on to the cakes. Five of them, four layers thick each, three being rich devils food cake and two being light angel's food cake. Wendy messily tore out fistfuls, shoveling them into her mouth- licking the icing off her fingers. Immediately after finishing all five cakes, she chugged another gallon of chocolate milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she went on- working her way through a pile of thirty super fluffy pancakes, emptying four containers of whipped cream in the process. Rich, juicy sausages, thicker than her fingers, chains of upwards of twenty vanishing between her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was over, Wendy was actually tired. It took a lot out of her to keep it together, and just keep stuffing and stuffing more into her mouth- she almost felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when her mother came up, and cheerfully said \"oh, you're done! So, that means you're ready for the second course!\"</span></div></div>",

Each are coated liberally with cream cheese frosting and powdered sugar. 24 pieces of grease soaked French Toast next to a large bottle of...high fructose corn syrup? And lastly an extra large mixing bowl filled with oatmeal that she sees her dad mixing in an entire two pound bag of brown sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer faces grows more flush thinking about the food in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I think I\u2019m pretty f-\u201c Wendy starts to say before a large, almost inhuman growl comes from her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know dear you are still hungry, let me know when you are ready for more,\u201d She says walking away leaving Wendy to her second course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sluggishly starts with the muffins taking huge bites of each decadent calorie bomb before switching to the cinnamon rolls. Her previous course putting a strain on her feeling some heartburn coming along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her sweat off her face, she takes a big swing of her jug of chocolate milk before starting with the French toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at the bottle of high fructose corn syrup and yells, \u201cHey mom, what happened to the maple syrup?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe accidentally bought the wrong bottle sweetie. Once it\u2019s finish we can go back to maple syrup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging her shoulders she douses  her French toast with half the bottle and begins chowing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she did not mind the new syrup and it goes well with the new bacony, greasy taste of the French toast. The syrup makes the French toast even easier to eat feeling it slide down with only minimal chewing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she finishes the French toast stacks she is really feeling full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom,\u201d Wendy whines, \u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d Her mom walks back into the dining room and sees the oatmeal untouched with half a gallon of milk left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense sweetie you have so much food left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy starts to complain, but her mom comes over and starts rubbing her tummy. She quietly burps, when then her mom slaps her belly hard causing her to loudly belch for 5 seconds straight. Seeing an opportunity her mom starts to feed her the oatmeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee if you have space for air in there, you have space for food.\u201d She takes another huge ladle full of oatmeal and feeding it to her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy closes her eyes and slowly swallows the slop feeling her belly get tighter and tighter with each subsequent ladle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s barely tastes the oatmeal other than to notice how sweet and rich it tastes. Eventually her mother reaches the bottom of the bowl scraping up the last of the oatmeal giving it to her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s mom commands her to open her mouth which she does with hesitation. Her mom takes the rest of the gallon of milk pours it into the bowl and takes the bowl tipping it to Wendy\u2019s awaiting maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick streams of milk and oatmeal drip down the side of her mouth onto her shirt as she glugs down the last bits of her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom takes the bowl and feels Wendy\u2019s gut as taut as a tire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy how do you feel now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFull,\u201d she gasps trying to catch her breath from all that eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat why don\u2019t you move over to the living room while dad cleans up and I start on lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy nods her head, as she carefully gets up from the bench waddling her way over to the living room. Feeling dazed and seeing spots she looks down noticing her stomach has lost most of her rolls and does not sag anymore due to her fullness. Feeling a little proud of herself she plops herself down on the love seat. The love seat creaks and groans ominously as she feels her hips touch both sides of the seat. She wipes the sweat off her brow and turns on some cartoons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a swig from a 2L bottle of soda next to her to help refresh herself after that walk and falls asleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She groaned and stretched out her arms to try and get the sleep out of her body. Wendy reached down to her stomach finding that the previous bursting feeling is gone and replaced with hunger. She smiled at her hungry belly and started to rock herself out of the couch in order for her to start her lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Sweetie,\u201d Wendy\u2019s Mom said to your daughter, \u201cI hope you slept well and got some more space in that tummy of your for lunch. Today you are having lasagna, chicken Alfredo, cheesy garlic bread, fudge with icing on top, and some extra thick butter milkshakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry mom, this stomach works quick and I have a bunch of space for delicious food,\u201d Wendy replied while she shook her stomach causing loud belches to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy got on the bench and enjoyed hearing the sound of the bench bending and creaking under her heavy load and began to dig into the food. She started with the two trays of lasagna looking at the greasy meat stuffed pasta with a look of a predator who caught her prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ravenously dove into the food and started scooping as much food as she can barely taking breaths inbetween her mouths of these cheesy goodness. She plowed through the lasagna with ease using the garlic bread to mop up any extra cheese and grease she may have missed. Next, she moved onto the two big pots of chicken Alfredo and licked her lips in anticipation for the next part of her lunch. She dug into the food with the same gusto as the lasagna using the garlic bread to scoop up any missing bits of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy started to sweat and pant after the amount of exertion she used to eat and the food weighing heavily in her stomach. She reached over and grabbed a pitcher of milkshake to quench her thirst and started on the two trays of thick chocolate fudge with chocolate frosting on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the thickness of the fudge and the richness of her pasta her eating speed slowed dramatically. She labored through the trays taking large swigs of her milkshake to help cool her body off from the exertion of eating and digesting her food. Eventually she reached the end of the trays and took the last swig of milkshake feeling BLOATED and FULL. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom,\u201d Wendy pants, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s mom walked over and saw all the plates and trays free of any food. \u201cGood job sweetie, why don\u2019t you watch some TV as your dad and I start Dinner,\u201d she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s stomach let out an angry gurgle at the idea of more food but Wendy patted her stomach to quiet it down. \u201cOkay, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy started the slow process of getting out of her bench while her stomach tried to anchor her down. After a five minutes she beat gravity and got her body up and moving. She slowly waddled to the couch with bursts of gas leaving her stomach and bum. She looked at the couch with her eyes already closing and plopped her body down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point two noises were heard simultaneously. The first a large SNAP that indicated the couch could not support her weight anymore. And the second a loud bassy belch that lasted 10 seconds from the Wendy as her stomach was jostled about. Than a third noise was heard after the first two of loud snoring coming from Wendy as the exhaustion of eating and moving 15 feet overcame Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents looked at their daughter with large smiles from the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the days ticked by and the exorbitant proportions of dangerously decadent meals filled out Wendy's figure more and more, her quickly and continuously fattening body rapidly outgrowing every new clothes size, her parents worked extra hard to support her growth- spoiling her as much as they could. Wendy began to spend a majority of her time almost entirely nude, except for a very overstretched 4XL t-shirt, which looked like a sports bra on her at best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, Wendy's pale tremendously obese figure was on full display- her expansive fat serviceable enough in preserving her modesty, not that the bloated behemoth babe ever went out in public. She spent her days lazily lounging in the comfort of her living room, parked in front of the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her gigantic fat butt already broke the sofa, and taking the stairs back up to her room was out of the question, Wendy's doting parents had painstakingly moved her bed down the stairs and into the living room, allowing their obese daughter to lounge on it all day and night, growing lazier by the minute, as they brought her immeasurable amounts of food, waiting on her hand and food. Of course, Wendy soon broke the bedframe beneath her weight, but she still had the nice comfy queen sized mattress covered in pillows to sit on, as her ever growing gut spilled out onto the floor in front of her! Plus, she soon became so fat, that her enormous butt and back rolls served as the perfect backrest for her to recline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy went for weeks without having to move a muscle- her parents encouraging their daughter's laziness, advising her to avoid exercise completely, so that she doesn't burn any of those precious calories! Wendy thought it was a bit weird that they were so eager- but she absolutely hated exercise, so she was more than happy to comply. Even without moving around, Wendy's breathing was heavy- and she was sweating an awful lot from all the junk food she ate, plus how warm her fat was. Wendy was beginning to develop a noticeable ripe body odor because of this. She also never bothered to wipe away the odd stain or crumb that fell onto her pudgy face or bust as she put away her monstrous meals. She didn't care about her hygiene though- as long as she could relax and live her life in maximum comfort- eating all she wanted of the unhealthiest foods she could! Her parents did everything they could to enable and encourage her, making sure she got bigger and bigger portions every day- hand feeding her so she didn't have to lift a pudgy finger, adding dessert to all three meals so she never had to wait too long for sugary rich decadent sweets, and in between meals making sure she was almost always snacking on something! They would even give her belly rubs, back massages, and footrubs whenever she asked. It was like her house turned into her own personal five star resort!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, about a month since she first broke the couch- Wendy was actually up and walking for the first time in weeks! And not having had the time to adjust to her weight, the poor girl wasn't taking it very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuggggghhh-<i>huff...huff...</i> mooOOoom! <b><i>urrrp</i></b>\" Wendy whined, sweating buckets even harder than usual as she painstakingly waddled along, shuffling one heavy leg at a time which wobbled from the motion, her fat bare feet squishing against the floor like bags of dough with five pudgy little toes poking out, every step making the floorboards creak. \"Couldn't you....have just....<b><i>bwoOOorp</i></b>...put me on it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had gotten utterly enormous- her belly being a foot or so wider than a single doorway, and hanging down past her knees, to her shins. As she waddled along now, her father was holding it up for her- to make it easier- using both arms and straining from the effort. Wendy's hips were even wider than her belly- pillowy thighs going out a good few feet, even as they hung weighed down by their own fat- and she had a butt to match, her surprisingly rotund rump that quivered with every step, resting on her own thigh fat, big enough to comfortably fill out a loveseat. Her torso was wrapped in a thick cocoon of lard- twin rolls of love handles bulging out to her sides, resting on her hips, so much that her arms (which were extremely fat themselves, too much to bend at the elbow fully) rested on them- like she was doing a droopy T-pose. Her chest was beyond any cup size, straining the shirt she wore so much that it looked like they'd need a small hammock to replace it- breasts that were each as big as her belly once was sloshing with each labored step. Her face was framed by soft tender chubby cheeks and a tire of neck fat, which wobbled gently whenever she talked, belched, or ate. Heck- all of her jiggled whenever she did anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, sweetheart- we can't lift you!\" Wendy's mother said, walking alongside Wendy- every few seconds, reaching over her daughter's immensity to feed her a whole donut- sometimes giving her swigs from a bottle of soda. She hoped it would be enough to replenish whatever weight poor Wendy lost walking all this way. \"The scale is only two and a half feet away, sweetie- you can do this!\" Wendy's mother encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy groaned- letting out pants and gas in between her glacial steps- before eventually- they managed to get her on to the industrial scale, meant for weighing shipments in a warehouse. Wendy sighed, relaxing as her dad gently put her belly down- feeling it rest comfortably against the front of her legs, and she eagerly scarfed down the entire pot of chicken alfredo which her mother presented her as a reward- washing it down with a gallon of chocolate milk- sauce and milk dribbled down her fat roll of a chin- which in and of itself was bigger than most girl's waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright- now let's see!\" Wendy's mother said, turning on the scale and waiting with bated breath. After a moment, she grinned, happily and proudly reading out \"956!! Amazing- congratulations sweetheart!!!\" Wendy's mother squealed, hugging Wendy- sinking into her pale, sweaty flab. A hug her father joined, laughing loudly. Wendy couldn't help but smile, in spite of herself. It <i>was</i> pretty impressive, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gained more than four hundred pounds this month! Just this <i>one</i> month!\" Wendy's mother said, quickly doing some calculations- \"and that means....<i>gasp</i>- You're gaining more than ten pounds a day! Heck, probably more than fifteen pounds a day!!!\" She exclaimed, seeming almost bizarrely gleeful. Wendy was still smiling, still proud of the size her dream lifestyle had given her- but she found her mother's level of excitement to be...odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing so amazing, Wendy! Why- at the rate you're going, I think we can aim for fifty pounds a day next month!!\" Wendy blinked, her smile faltering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fihhh....fifty pounds...every day..?\" She murdered- trying to count in her head. That means a hundred pounds every two days- and six days, three hundred- plus another fifty..every single week?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! It's exciting, isn't it?\" Wendy's mother cut off her train of thought. \"I didn't think we'd be here 'til the month after next! And- I know it may seem like a lot of food at first- you may start to feel full- but you can push through and keep on eating! And it'll all be worth it in the end.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's mom noticed Wendy's hesitation. Smiling warmly, she leaned in- patting Wendy's enormous belly, sending ripples through the fat. \"Hey- don't worry! Just because there's <i>more</i> food doesn't mean it'll be lower quality! Your father and I are still gonna make absolutely sure every crumb that passes your lips is as sugary, fatty, greasy, and calorie dense as possible! And you can still relax all day! Just eating and eating and eating-\" she smiled, lovingly, as Wendy started to sweat for a slightly different reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the junk food in the world...Isn't that what you <u><i><b>want,</b></i></u> Wendy?\" She asked, sweetly.</span></div></div>",

Wendy reached out for one last burger, before taking a sigh and reaching for the chicken. The buttons on her shirt were growing more and more strained, and her double chin was rapidly changing into a triple chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just five minutes, Wendy was making rapid inroads into the pile of chicken, sauces dribbling down her chin and on to her complaining shirt, gulping down chunks of meat as fast as she could. Hearing footsteps, she looked up to see another friend, Danica, walking towards her bearing another platter, loaded with pizzas \u2013 there must have been a couple of dozen scattered on the plate. She hurriedly worked on the chicken, but Danica took the platter away before she had quite finished, leaving her to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was having some trouble now with her tight shirt; the buttons were really digging in, and the fabric was complaining, but she quickly dived into her pizzas, hurriedly tearing off chunks and stuffing them in, usually two or three at a time. Her belly swelled still further, and flab was hanging from her arms; the only noise she could hear was the constant munching and chomping of her mouth, working overtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her mom came walking towards her with another tray, loaded with Chinese food of all varieties \u2013 more fried chicken, prawns, spring rolls, noodles, and a mountain of rice covered in sauce. The last pizzas were taken away, with Wendy straining over to reach them but failing as her huge belly began to get in the way, and she began to shove fistfuls of food into her eager mouth, slobbering away as quickly as she could. Her belly was beginning to push her away from the table now, and she redoubled her efforts, eventually just going head-first into the mountain of rice and gobbling away like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tracey, Danica and her mom came again, taking away the food and replacing it with heaped mountains of desserts. A huge pile of doughnuts on one side, a massive, jiggling blancmange on the other, and a towering gateaux in front of her. She quickly reached for the doughnuts with one hand and grabbed at cake with the other, cramming them in. Her huge, swelling body was finally too much for her shirt, which ripped and tore down all the seams, and then with a loud creak, the chair gave way beneath her. She could see more trays coming as she was pinned to the floor...</span></div></div>",

She tried to push herself up, but couldn't; nor could she reach the food waiting for her on the table. Seeing her distress, her three maids \u2013 their outfits seemed to have changed to those of domestic servants, began to bring food to her. Danica was loading the blancmange into her mouth, while Tracey held a plate filled with cream cakes in easy reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the food was taken away, and the three of them brought in new platters loaded with more fast food \u2013 dozens of burgers, stacks of pizzas, fried chicken. Wendy's greedy belly was slowing rising, and was higher than her head; it felt warm and comfortable. For the first few minutes Wendy used her hands to shovel in the food, but before long Tracey and Danica were pushing the food into her mouth as her belly continued to rise. As one platter was finished, another was brought forward, each time growing bigger and bigger. Her belly grew larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mum then brought in a funnel, shoved it in her mouth, and began to pour lemonade down her throat in two-litre bottles, four of them, before the food resumed \u2013 this time a huge tray of cream cakes. The cream spread around her mouth as she continued to feed, though she was no longer stopping to chew; there seemed to be a void in her stomach that she had to keep filling, and the quantities of food continued to increase as her belly continued to grow...</span></div></div>",

She heard rumbling sounds from either side, and was able to see Tracey and Danica pushing trolleys loaded with food, stacked as high as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore food! I need more food!\u201d, she cried out, and the two complied, pushing snack after snack into her mouth. She eagerly chewed on more and more of the greasy food, no longer caring what it was, simply wolfing down burgers, pizzas, pastries and cakes without regard, as well as the occasional huge bottle of fizzy drink. Her belly jiggled as the food came in, five, then six, then seven trolleys full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething at the back of her mind was telling her that this wasn't real, but it felt so good that she did not want the dream to end. The portions kept on growing bigger and bigger, and she could swear that her bulging mass of a belly was continuing to grow. She could no longer feel her toes or her fingers. She gasped for breath as a huge hoagie was shoved into her mouth, almost a foot long, and she chewed it down rapidly, giving off an enormous stomach-jiggling burp.</span></div></div>",

Her sweet tooth started to feel satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done she rubbed her belly. The pancakes had filled it up and it was warm to the touch. \"It's ok little belly I'm going to take good care of you. I know how much you like sweets and I'm going to give you as much as you want.\" Wendy put her empty plate on the floor and got out of bed. Her belly jiggled as she jumped out of bed.

As she stretched her arms up her tank top rode up her belly. She loved having it exposed so she just let it show. Wendy's mom had left for the store but left a note next to a plate of brownies. She read the note as she fed her self brownie. ;Be right back with your treats, Mom' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what happened between last night and today that totally changed my parents mind.

Hold on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy did not believe her friend Danica. Danica had always been 130 pounds with any barely any fat on her. Wendy went to her computer and logged into Friendster. She found Danica's profile and the proof was in her picture. The picture showed Danica at a pleasant 170 pounds. A rounder belly hung from her waist and her boobs pushed out her shirt. 'What is going on' Wendy thought in her head. She went back and picked the phone back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my mom just got home with some groceries so I gotta go. We should hang out later. 4PM?

She moaned in ecstacy as she turned to face Wendy, only to pull her into a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Wendy replied, struggling to hide her confusion.

Wendy stared in awe as her mother nodded, and handed the girl three donuts. Her mother then turned to Wendy, and gave her the same amount, which she stared in, awe struck. It wasn't like she was afraid to eat it or something, it was just she was in awe that something as miraculous as her mother allowing her to eat like this regularly  could occur.

It looked as though she was the only one aware that anything had changed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight as well enjoy this while she could, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls left the house, bags on their backs, Wendy glanced at her now plump friend, and asked, gently, \"Hey, Tracy, I have a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you always been this big?\"</span></div></div>",

At once, everyone got up and filled their plates with food in a buffet line that went around the whole cafeteria. Wendy just followed along. <br>\r\nThere was no fruit or vegetables, just deep fried foods, burgers, pastries, pizza, and pastas. <br>\r\nWendy followed along and filled her plate with burgers, fries, soda, and a few slices of cake. She sat down and started in, like all the other kids. She then helped herself to seconds, then thirds, and so on. This went on for six hours, before school was finally dismissed. All the students were handed slips of paper with grades on them. She read hers.<br>\r\n\"A+, 15,000 calories consumed. Great work, Wendy!\"<br>\r\nShe looked down at her shirt. It was bulging at the buttons and it looked like they could pop at any moment. She was completely stuffed. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for Wendy to get used to her new school curriculum, as it was her new lifestyle. Spending six hours a day eating was little different from what she was doing before and after school, only here she knew she was being graded on her intake. Around the cafeteria the men and women she recognized as her former teachers monitored the students, estimating the calories in all the food each student took from the buffet and tallying them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first day Wendy had just eaten to eat, taking more food because it all tasted so good and her belly called for it. The grading part struck her as unnecessary, but only because she wasn't paying attention that first day. The second day, as she was handed another paper with another A+, she noticed a couple dozen classmates still sitting around the tables, most rubbing their bellies and moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like Carla has detention again,\u201d Danica commented. \u201cWhen is that girl going to learn how to eat properly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetention?\u201d Wendy said, the idea of being punished for not eating enough striking her as odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Well, I guess you've never had it, have you?\u201d And she slapped Wendy's large, pale belly with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe students who can't reach 10,000 calories on their own need to stay after class,\u201d Tracy explained, wondering if her friend really was unfamiliar with the concept, \u201cThey'll be able to go home once they get to the minimum, though this will go on their record.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy pondered that as she went home, her mother greeting her with a table full of Danishes and sizzling sausage she couldn't resist. All the adults in her life pushing food on her, her friends turning up fat like her, school being no more than an extended meal? It was fun, no doubt about that, but the lack of answers or greater logic behind this was putting her ill at ease. Part of her feared there was something sinister afoot, though what kind of evil plan involved fattening up teenagers she couldn't imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next week Wendy went along with things as she was expected to, which also happened to be doing what came naturally to her: eating all day, every day. On the third or fourth day she started to fear she would get sick of the endless stream of the greasy, the salty, and the sweet, but it never came. Every day her mother or her school provided a fresh, ever-changing menu, and Wendy eagerly dove in to whatever new thing was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly was suited for this new world. Every day she received an A+ on her intake, her teachers (in this world they were referred to as 'nutritionists') always offering her compliments on her capacity. She wasn't even trying, she was just giving in to the gluttony and hedonism she had always craved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even with her exemplary 'academic' performance, she was still more or less a face in the crowd, just another student among hundreds. But that changed when</span></div></div>",

She was suddenly interrupted by Tracy. \u201cTake a look at that guy. Quickly now,\u201d she said, pointing over her shoulder. Looking, Wendy saw a tall, thin, blonde haired human male with his back turned to her. \u201cThere is nothing to see,\u201d she said, turning back with a doughnut in her mouth. \u201cThere is not now, but a moment ago he was looking at you. With a look of lust in his eyes,\u201d Danicia interjected. \u201cYeah, so what. There are plenty who want me,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cIndeed. That is true. But that is John Stevens,\u201d Tracy said.. \u201cHe is unarguably the best feeder in the entire school. And when I say that, I mean it,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe's thin, however. I doubt he eats the required 10,000 calories a day,\u201d Wendy responded. \u201cYes. Both of those are true, but his ability to feed others is quite amazing. That's actually the whole reason he has not flunked out of school. Do you see Joan Li over there?\u201d Ai said, pointing to another table. Looking there, Wendy saw a tremendous women who, although she could not have been over five feet, appeared to weigh at least 900 pounds. And she sat among other, similarly large women shoveling food into their mouths. \u201cJust a few short months ago, she was anorexic, only weighing 200 pounds. And she was also always in detention for not eating enough. Every day.\u201d Ai paused. \u201cEveryone tried everything to try to get her to eat. Special force feeding summer camps. Stomach enlargement surgery. Multiple times. Threatening jail time. Nothing worked. And then John decided she was worthy of his attention. Having tried everything, the teachers decided to let him try. They thought he would fail. And in 10 months, he made her into what you see.\u201d \u201cAnd?\u201d Wendy asked. \u201cEvery woman who was sent to John has had the same transformation happen to her. In fact, you the whole table you saw was made of women he fed.\u201d Awestruck, Wendy got back to gorging.<i>I better eat really well today,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, and school was dismissed. But Wendy made sure to clear her plate first in case John was watching her. As she staggered to her feet, her swollen belly dragging her down slightly, she felt a hand under her shoulder. \u201cHello,\u201d came a voice. It was definitely masculine. \u201cI saw you eat today,\u201d it continued. Turning around, Wendy saw a man who could only be John Stevens. Tall, thin, and very angular in the face. \u201cAre you John Stevens?\u201d She asked. \u201cYes. The miracle feeder, as you heard today.\u201d John said.<i>Might as well be blunt.</i>\u201cDo you like me?\u201d Wendy asked. \u201cIndeed,\u201d John responded. \u201cIn fact, I want you to be my girlfriend. You will be well fed.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was even more gorgeous up close than she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry if I am direct,\u201d John said. He was casual but self-assured. Wendy could sense a hint of entitlement about him. \u201cBut I don't care much for games or teasing, pretending to not be interested in someone and hoping that makes them want you more. I believe in forthrightness: if you want something, go for it.\u201d He looked down at Wendy's belly, swollen taut and peeking out from her shirt. \u201cAnd I think you share my perspective. I've seen you eating for a while now, stuffing yourself every day not because you have to, but because you want to. You want food. More food. Always more food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Wendy felt her face flush. It was disturbing to hear someone voicing the desire that had been growing in her during her time in this world, but also so damn sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to be fatter?\u201d John asked. \u201cTremendously obese, possibly even immobile?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- I hadn't thought about it. I just love to eat.\u201d She was whispering, even though the cafeteria was almost entirely empty. Only her friends were still there, hanging back far enough to give John and Wendy privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fatter you get, the more you can eat.\u201d John was leaning closer now, his flat torso bumping against Wendy's fat stomach. \u201cIt's a testament to your gluttony, a symbol of pride for you and a source of envy for others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not that fat,\u201d Wendy protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d John took Wendy's hands in his own, \u201cBut I've seen women smaller than you become the fattest in their neighborhoods, and they didn't have a fraction of the drive you do. My gift is to help women become all they can be. I've spent years honing this talent, refining it as I helped the frightfully thin become living works of art. And you... You're the one I've been waiting for. The woman who can use my talents to the fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe my girlfriend, Wendy. Be my &lt;i&gt;raison d'etre&lt;/i&gt;, and I will make you the fattest beauty to ever grace this Earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake me huge,\u201d Wendy whispered, breathy and with all the sensual desire of another woman saying 'Ravish me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will make you titanic,\u201d John smiled, stroking her cheek with the back of his hand. Then he put a hand on Wendy's belly and pressed. There was give. \u201cAnd we'll begin now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Tell them you will be late coming home from school.\u201d John said, helping Wendy to her feet. \u201cAs you wish\u201d Wendy responded. She waddled, panting heavily, into the hallway. Reaching into her pocket, she grabbed her phone and dialed her mom. \u201cHello Wendy. What's up?\u201d Her mom said. \u201cI am going to be late coming home.\u201d Wendy responded. \u201cBut what about your first and second after school snacks?\u201d countered her mother. \u201cLater. A situation has developed that does not allow me to go right back home.\u201d \u201cWhat situation?\u201d her mother asked, her concern obvious in her voice. \u201cThe best feeder in the school asked me out on a date!\u201d Wendy shouted excitedly. \u201cGo. I have no interest in interrupting your fun,\u201d her mother replied. \u201c\u201dI'll eat my snacks later,\u201d Wendy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling back to the cafeteria, she saw her friends staring at John with a look of lust in their eyes.<i>He's mine.</i> Wendy thought. John displayed no interest. \u201cWendy, I see you have finished,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen am I going to start eating?\u201d Wendy asked. \u201cIn earnest, not until later. But I would like to see how you eat. At an all you can eat buffet\u201d John responded. \u201cAll you can eat? I can eat a lot\u201d Wendy said. \u201cI doubt you can out-eat an all-you-can-eat buffet,\u201d John responded. And with that John and Wendy got into a pickup truck and drove off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn drove down many miles of road. Then he spoke \u201cThere. This is my preferred buffet,\u201d he said, pointing out the window. Following his finger, Wendy saw a giant warehouse with a sign. \u201cThe benchmark buffet,\u201d she said.<i>What a weird name.</i>\u201cThe portions there will put you through your paces.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wendy and John entered the benchmark buffet, she could not help but notice the weight based pricing. \u201cwhat is with the weird pricing...\u201d She began. \u201cOh. The weight based pricing,\u201d John interrupted, laughing. \u201cThat's a funny story. The short form of it was that my mom and sister found this place, and they so enjoyed it that they ate here frequently enough they almost bankrupt it. So they instituted weight based pricing to make enough money off of them to stay in business. And also to deter them from coming. But let's see how much you weigh. Strip down and get on the scale so my friend may charge us,\u201d he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy removed all her clothes and got on the scale. John stood with a notebook. And the cashier stood by to charge them And John wrote down a number. \u201cthree hundred pounds. Not bad. But also not good,\u201d John said, handing over twenty five dollars to the cashier. Wendy put her clothes back on and was measured by John in all the relevant statistics: height, waist size, hips, butt, and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy and John sat at a table. \u201cI'll grab all the food and drinks you need. Do you want anything in particular?\u201d John asked. \u201cNo. I want you to surprise me,\u201d Wendy responded. He returned with a staff member helping him carry 2 party sized pizzas, a dozen milkshakes, and ten heaping bowls of salad. These were not the salads Wendy knew from before the world became so fat friendly. These were spinach and avocado salads covered in bacon and cheese, and absolutely drenched in dressing. \u201dEnjoy,\u201d John said.<i>I'm actually scared.</i> Wendy thought.<i>How am I going to eat all of this.</i>Seeing her concern, John said \u201cyou don't have to. I just wish to see how you eat.\u201d Wendy dug in. \u201cconsider myself surprised,\u201d were her very last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant the very first bite touched her lips Wendy felt an incredible hunger greater than anything she had ever felt. It was a ravenous beast that was bent on consuming everything in its path. And she let it loose. John sat in awe as Wendy dumped an entire milkshake into her gaping maw in one move. He was amazed when, a moment later, she took two of her salad bowls and began eating from them. He practically died when she drank the remaining salad dressing from each bowl, burped, and then turned to the pizza without slowing down, eating up to five at a time. She then alternated between pizza and salad. She vaguely remembered saying \u201cMore please,\u201d to a shocked John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy reached for a plate of burgers, only to discover there were none. She looked around in amazement, only to discover a table covered in empty plates. And Jack, obviously struck by something. \u201cWhat is on you mind?\u201d Wendy asked. \u201cNothing. You just ate the most of any girl of your weight I have ever seen,\u201d John responded. \u201cWhat did I eat?\u201d Wendy asked. \u201cTen bacon and avocado salads, twelve gainer shakes, two party sized pizzas, and twenty burgers,\u201d John muttered.  \u201cThat explains why my belly hurts. Would you please give me a belly rub?\u201d she responded. \u201cOf course,\u201d John responded, rubbing the back of his hand slowly over her stomach. \u201cdo you require any more food.\u201d \u201cNo, I cannot eat any more,\u201d she responded. \u201cWell then I suppose when you are able to move I should get you back to your parent's house.\u201d \u201cI want to see what I weigh and measure first,\u201d Wendy muttered. John then proceeded to weigh and measure her and record them, muttering to himself in approval.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just really like to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Hood cocked an eyebrow. Was this girl implying she was approaching her schoolwork as a lark? That she could eat even more, even faster? She had to get her on the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy,\u201d She put a hand on Wendy's shoulder, leaning closer. Her face beamed with excitement. \u201cI think you have the makings of a great eating champion. You could possibly go pro. And I'm not just blowing smoke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, uh, really?\u201d 'Professional eater' sounded almost like a joke, but in this world it probably was an actual thing. And what else would Wendy strive for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I'll level with you, Wendy.\u201d Her voice lost a layer of enthusiasm, \u201cCarlson has to fly to New Hampshire for a funeral, and we'll be short a woman this Saturday. If you say yes now I can get you on the roster in time. Would you at least try it out, see if you like it? It would be a tremendous help just to do it this once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had already made up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm your girl, Mrs. Hood.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Wendy arrived at school toting an already stuffed belly but determined to eat as much as possible today. But as she got in line Mrs. Hood found her and pulled her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're on the eating team now, Graham. You get priority.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she led Wendy down to the front of the line, where a couple other girls were loading up two trays apiece to overflowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake as much as you can carry, then take a seat there,\u201d Mrs. Hood pointed to a table with a 'Reserved' sign on it right in front of the start of the buffet. \u201cYour training begins now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy copied the girls in front of her, a redhead and a Latina who were as much belly as they were woman, piling as much food onto her plates as she could and (carefully) carrying them to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you're taking Kari's place this week?\u201d The Latina said, already tearing off half a doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm Wendy. I'm kind of surprised I was asked, but I guess-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGraham! If your mouth is empty put food in it!\u201d Mrs. Hood yelled. Startled, Wendy crammed an entire strip of Canadian bacon into her mouth, struggling to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't talk with your mouth empty,\u201d the redhead said around some sausage. \u201cWe're not here to chat, we're here to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d Wendy said, swallowing some bacon and replacing it with a fresh strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next six hours the three girls ate and talked, sometimes talking but always eating. Wendy learned quickly that even though her appetite would carry her past the required 10,000 calories, she was now being expected to consume as many calories as possible, however many that would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls \u2013 the redhead was named Cassandra and the Latina was Nicole \u2013 explained the rules of the eating competition to their new teammate. It was actually as simple as it sounded: two teams of three girls would be given an hour to consume as many calories as possible, a panel of judges inspecting all the empty plates to estimate the total number of calories eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a group effort, the final score for each team being a combined number, but special point bonuses could be awarded by each judge for admirable bouts of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdmirable bouts?\u201d Wendy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting creative, or just greedy. Like this.\u201d Nicole said, grabbing a couple strips of bacon, then a jelly doughnut, and then running both through a bowl of sausage gravy she had in front of her. Opening her jaw as wide as possible, she took a bite that would have choked a lesser person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d Cassandra said, \u201cis to take in as many calories as you can. Combining stuff like this not only gets more into you but makes for a better 'show' and wins the judges over. There have been matches where the calorie count is close enough that the judges decided the victor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through the school day Wendy was at her limit, and her teammates came to her help again, telling her to take some soda or milkshake and nurse it while she digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don't stop putting something in your mouth,\u201d Nicole said. \u201cHave to keep your momentum going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy did as instructed, eventually taking to looking at the clock every five minutes and waiting for the day to be over. She never thought she would reach the point she couldn't eat, much less didn't want to, but it had happened. She was struggling to chew, struggling to reach for more food and struggling to keep it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief did come, though, the bell for the day ringing and most of the students getting up to leave. But neither Wendy nor her teammates could think of moving, all three teens rubbing their bellies and concentrating on their breathing. Wendy's skin was pulled tight,  and she feared any jostle would make her split open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table, Cassandra was leaning over and... talking to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a good job today, sweetie. I'm so proud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole caught Wendy's confused look and explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe thinks talking to her belly soothes it and helps it digest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy nodded slowly. Oooooooookaaaaay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job,  Graham.\u201d Mrs. Hood said, though a bit reluctant to be too encouraging. \u201cStill got work to do stretching your stomach, but we'll get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an hour before she felt ready to move, her discomfort easing as she burped and belched and relieved pressure.  But it was so painful, and the idea of eating becoming a chore, something she had to do, worried here. At that moment, she wasn't sure if she could do this for the rest of the week or on Saturday. Perhaps she should go to Mrs. Hood and bow out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time she was walking home Wendy had almost convinced herself to stick to it. Sure there was discomfort now, but wouldn't there be pain and fatigue if she was training for an athletic sport? Like Mrs. Hood said, with time she would get her stomach stretched out and be able to eat more. And the actual contest would only be an hour, a fraction of the school day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she arrived home Wendy was determined to stick through for the rest of the week and go through the match on Saturday. It's not like she had a permanent spot on the team, anyway, so at the very least she should fulfill her favor to Mrs. Hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the week Wendy pushed her intake to the max and practiced the tips and 'cheats' Mrs. Hood and her teammates taught her. Breathing was the big thing; when she got too full or had her mouth filled with stuff it became easy to start struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Saturday came. Per Mrs. Hood's instructions Wendy ate a breakfast just big enough to take the edge off her hunger but not enough to make her full, and then she headed to the school for the match. In the locker room she changed into a spandex one-piece in the school colors \u2013 blue and silver \u2013 that hugged every curve of her body. She tugged on it experimentally; it was nice and loose, giving her belly room to bloat and expand as she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo of you already know I'm not much in the way of pep talks,\u201d Mrs. Hood said when the three eaters were changed and assembled. \u201cSo Graham, I'll just say that all you have to do is what comes naturally. I'm not expecting you to carry the team after just a few days of practice, but I believe your natural talent will give us a real shot at winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, we're against Woodridge and they brought Jessi Reynolds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra and Nicole both groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. But we're early in the season, so there's not a lot riding on this. Just go out there, do your best, and then we'll look ahead to next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho's Jessi Reynolds?\u201d Wendy asked, but before she could get an answer a middle-aged woman in a navy blue skirt and jacket came in, looking at a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy Graham?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to do a weigh-in. Hop on the scale, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy did as instructed, the woman (an official of some sort) looking down at the readout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c284 \u00bc pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy hadn't thought about her weight since waking up in this world, but the fact that she had gained almost 25 pounds in less than two weeks was surprising. Not worrying, not troubling, but surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she was being ushered out of the locker room to the gymnasium. The stands had a generous amount of spectators, but Wendy's eyes were drawn to the center. A couple banquet tables were set in the middle, both laden with more food Wendy thought could be eaten in an entire day, never mind two hours. To one side another table was set up, with three officials already seated; the woman who had weighed Wendy and two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the gym the opposing team was coming out. Dressed in red and white spandex, Wendy initially thought they looked a bit... skinny for an eating contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she got an answer to who Jessi Reynolds was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was massive, at least twice as big as Wendy, carrying a belly in front of her the size of a dump-truck. Her neck was hidden by multiple chins and she could only take slow, lumbering steps. When she settled onto the bench there was a sense of finality to the action. She wouldn't be getting up anytime soon, or easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting in the middle of her team, and by chance Wendy ended up sitting across from her. Because of the mound of food on each table Wendy didn't have a clear look at her, but she was already intimidated. The girl looked like she could be her own team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a chance,\u201d Cassandra said, \u201cThe Woodridge coach likes to rely on Jessi's appetite, to the point that she gives her so much leeway she has trouble keeping anyone else on the team. Nobody can stand being around her. Neither of those two look like they'll contribute much, probably roped in just this week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy contrast, Nicole and Cassandra had shown themselves to be true eaters. As Wendy sat and waited for the starting whistle, she tried to prepare herself mentally. If she could get a good pace and keep it going for the full hour, if she could carry her own weight, their team might win. Or at least not be trounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the officials stood up, microphone in hand. After the traditional welcomes and introductions, he told the timekeeper to set the clock to 60 minutes. The digital clocks set along the walls read 1:00:00.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCompetitors, get ready. Get set. Go!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy, Cassandra and Nicole all leaned across the table and grabbed platters of food, bringing them to the table in front of them. The closest thing to a strategy the team had was each girl picked a different item and they left the food within reach of the others so no one had to try to eat a dozen servings of just one item. Variety of tastes was important in a good binge, Mrs. Hood had taught them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was a variety, Wendy couldn't deny that. The first 'course' for the three eaters was soft shell tacos spilling out meat and sour cream, bacon-wrapped balls of gouda, and \u2013 to Wendy's pleasant surprise \u2013 deep-friend cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach portion was giant-sized, even for this world of junk food and gluttony, another potential intimidation for Wendy. But she just pushed through this, taking a giant bite of cheesecake, chewing rapidly, and then swallowing. With her free hand she grabbed a taco; some of the filling spilled out, but she ignored it. The tacos were in front of Cassandra: it was her job to scoop up the remaining bits once the platter was cleared just as it was Wendy's to clean off any crumbs leftover from the cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the officials were that precise when assessing how much food was eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood in each hand, Wendy alternated giant bites of each item, getting into a rhythm of bite, chew, swallow, bite. After a while she was able to turn her attention elsewhere, taking in how her teammates were doing, and risking a look across the banquet tables at the other team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra's prediction wasn't off: the two 'skinnier' girls were stuffing their mouths as best they could, but before long they were flagging. They were forcing themselves to eat, their chewing was slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real problem was Jessi. In contrast to Wendy's team she was going forward with single-minded abandon. She would grab a platter of food, perch it on her belly, and hoover everything into her mouth. Once a plate was clean she swapped it for a fresh one. There was no rhyme or reason to what she ate; she just grabbed the nearest plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 20 minute mark came, the Woodridge team down to one member plowing through her food and two people there for show. One of the girls had stopped trying to eat proper servings and was playing clean-up with Jessi's cast-aside trays, scooping up all the crumbs and sauce and remaining bits. The other girl was holding a giant glass of soda, holding it up to Jessi every now and then so she could replenish her fluids. Occasionally she would grab some food for herself, but she wasn't a factor anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's team was still going strong, Nicole and Cassandra's determination boosting her own drive. They had cleared the first round of platters, moving onto deep dish pizza, bacon cheeseburgers and brownies the size of bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final seconds of the first half hour counted down, Wendy and her teammates trying to summon their second wind. Halfway there, and Wendy was feeling the contents of her stomach like a lump of concrete. She still had room, she wasn't in pain, but the pressure was building. She put it out of her mind and grabbed another brownie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the tables Jessi was apparently slowing down, taking her time with each bite now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople in the audience started cheering, most of them rooting for the hometeam. Wendy wished she could get a boost from that, but all she could do was concentrate on the food in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked across at Jessi, still cramming food into her mouth. Neither of her teammates were eating now \u2013 Jessi was cleaning each platter herself \u2013 but with Jessi's speed Wendy didn't believe victory was assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the immense girl paused mid-chew, a hand going to her belly. Could this be a lucky break for Wendy's team?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi released a thundering belch, temporarily silencing the cheering crowd. And then she was back to stuffing food down her mouth, her speed a little quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing softly, Wendy went back to her own food, forcing another bite. The pressure in her own belly was climbing fast, she could feel it churning and storming, and then<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEEEEEEELCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing was a little easier, the pressure eased. Hit with inspiration, Wendy grabbed a can of soda, chugging half of it in one go. The pressure started climbing again, and with a free hand Wendy started rubbing and slapping her belly until another burp came. And then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe worked fast to fill the empty space forming in her belly, finishing another slice of pizza and dunking the crust in garlic sauce to make it go down easier. And then, as she strained to reach over to grab more food (a difficult proposition, considering the state of her belly), another burst of inspiration hit. Grabbing a large bowl of gravy, Wendy fell back into her seat, breathed in and out a couple times, and then brought the bowl to her lips. Not stopping to think, she began drinking the gravy in great gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience began cheering again, clapping and stomping their feet, and Wendy pushed herself forward, draining the bowl. There was still enough stuck to the bowl itself, and with all the determination she could muster Wendy grabbed a brownie and began wiping the bowl clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n21:01 read the clock. Not yet at the two-third mark. When the bowl was practically spotless Wendy tossed it aside and tried to catch her breath. The crowd was almost screaming, but Wendy could only moan. She was struggling to breathe, her legs spread apart by her belly, and she didn't think she had any room left in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp nudge hit her side. Nicole, her mouth full of cheeseburger, shot her a look. 'Don't stop. Find something to nibble, something to sip. Every calorie counts.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying, Wendy grabbed a cheeseburger and took a bite. She took a hefty bite and chewed, chewed, breathed and chewed. She swallowed, took another bite. She wasn't tasting it, but she kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's teammates seemed to be doing better than she was, but they had reached their own hurdles. Still, none of them stopped chewing or eating entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her burger was half done Wendy reached for a bowl of ice cream. By this point, more than two-thirds in, it was a bowl of soup, allowing Wendy to dunk her burger and making it easier to chew and swallow the second half. Grabbing another burger she repeated the process, building up something like momentum and carrying herself through the next ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the tables Jessi had come to the end of her initial burst, her speed slowing down and each bout of chewing taking longer. But she wasn't in pain like Wendy was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten minute mark approaching, the brownies and pizza were gone. When Nicole grabbed the last burger, dunking it in a bowl of BBQ sauce until the bread was mush, Cassandra grabbed a bowl of potato chips. She and Wendy began taking handfuls, letting them melt in their mouths before chewing once or twice and swallowing. Every mouthful swallowed made Wendy hurt more, but as the final minutes counted down her desire to finish strong started to build. Knowing the end was in sight she was able to ignore her brain shrieking 'You've had enough!' to keep shoving chips into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes to go, all three were forcing themselves past the point of pain and common sense, taking giant bites of whatever was closest on hand and eating what they could. Their bodies were on autopilot now as the crowd counted down the last ten seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTIME!\u201d The official called, and all the competitors held their hands out and dropped whatever they were holding. No attempts at eating after the fact would be tolerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all the girls sat back and relaxed the referees gathered all the platters, both empty and those that had any food taken from them, for calorie counting. What felt like an hour (but maybe it was just 15 minutes) passed before the judges called for everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe final tally,\u201d the main official began, \u201chas Woodridge at 22,850 calories consumed, and Miller High at 21,900 calories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy started to groan, but then she noticed her teammates and the audience were still sitting expectant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor bonuses,\u201d the official continued, \u201cwe are awarding 500 calories to Woodridge for dedicated gluttony, and 2,000 calories to Miller for creativity and dedicated gluttony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wendy asked, the crowd around bursting into wild applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe won,\u201d Nicole said, \u201cRemember what I said about bonus points for combining different foods?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was you drinking the gravy straight from the bowl that put us over,\u201d Cassandra said, slapping Wendy on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy supposed they should stand and soak up the applause, but her belly was so large and so heavy all she could was lean back, looking at it rising before her like a hill coming before a road. Her teammates were in the same boat, and for half an hour the three just sat there as their classmates and other fans came to congratulate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat job, Graham!\u201d Mrs. Hood said when the three of them finally shuffled to the locker room to change. She threw her arms around Wendy, being careful not to squeeze too hard. \u201cI have to say, I have never seen a rookie perform like that. Any chance you'd want to join the team permanently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Kari?\u201d The girl Wendy was there to replace for this contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're not limited to just three members,\u201d Mrs. Hood said. \u201cWe can only enter three people in each contest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the discomfort still bothering her, Wendy had to admit she had enjoyed this. Nothing could break her of her love of eating she now knew, and the cheers of the people watching and the praise of the other eaters and Mrs. Hood made her feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Wendy hadn't been able to hang out with her old friends much over the past week. Her 'training' during school left her too stuffed to meet up with them after class, and she felt/feared she was drifting away from them. The answer wasn't that clear cut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSure, I'll join!\u201d Wendy said enthusiastically. Or as enthusiastically as she could given her still packed belly and labored breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d Mrs. Hood said, and the other girls slapped her on the back, welcoming her to the team proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she met her mother in the parking lot, and after her mother had swooned over her daughter's performance, she settled in to the car, ready to go home and sleep until Monday morning. It was almost off-handedly that she mentioned to her mother she had joined the team as a permanent member, garnering another round of ecstatic glee from Mrs. Graham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home Wendy trudged to her bed and was out as soon as she hit the mattress. When she woke up the sun was sending its last bits of light through her window. She wanted to stay there, lying back and enjoying the warm feeling, but her belly had other ideas. Despite the pressure it had endured that morning, it was empty enough now that it not only could accept more food, it was demanding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was not one to disappoint. Heaving herself up, she made her way to the dining room to find her mother had already predicted her daughter's hunger (or maybe she just wanted to have plenty of food on hand to tempt Wendy). The table was filled with greasy, fatty dishes waiting for the growing teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Wendy sat down and started on a plate of French fries and pile of teriyaki burgers. Then she had some caramel bites, then a key lime pie, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate with less determination than she had shown back at the match, but with no less enthusiasm or appetite. The empty plates piled up, a hint of pride entering Wendy as she had a growing tally of her gluttony sitting right there in front of her. It helped push her to keep eating after she was sated, an informal desire to take this as far as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful, Wendy,\u201d her mother said, bringing in a plate of thick slices of ham. \u201cKeep it up. I've still got another pie in the oven, plus some onion rings and curly fries coming up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, mom. I don't know if I can eat all that,\u201d Wendy said; already she was starting to feel the first forceful signs of fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, I know you can.\u201d Her mother leaned down and pressed on Wendy's belly, feeling how much give there was. \u201cBesides, if you're going to be a competitive eater you have to treat every meal like a training session. You can't just eat for fun anymore, you have to take it seriously. Stuff that belly, don't stop until you can't swallow another bite. I know there's a champion eater waiting to get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's encouragement was odd, but effective. Buckling down, Wendy continued cleaning plate after plate. But she had her limits, and as her mother brought in the promised pie Wendy could feel she was at the end. Maybe a slice of pie and that would be it. It looked too good to leave sitting there untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut a moderate size, but when Wendy brought the first forkful to her mouth something happened. Tasting the delectable meringue and fruit filling and graham cracker crust, she was hit with a sudden and undeniable desire to have it all. The whole pie. The idea of leaving food uneaten before her became shameful, but really she was just... greedy. Wanting more for the sake of having more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if her stomach was on the same wavelength, either emptying or expanding itself or doing something to allow her to not only eat the slice she had cut for herself, but the rest of the pie as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you had it in you,\u201d her mother said, beaming at her daughter and the table full of empty plates. \u201cWe won't even have any leftovers tonight. That's a first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her belly, Wendy was both confused by the new level of gluttony she had reached and eager to simply enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, mom,\u201d she burped, \u201cis there any ice cream left? I could still go for more dessert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Her mother didn't hide her shock, nor her glee to see her daughter so gluttonous. \u201cWait right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the kitchen, then returned with three cartons of ice cream: rocky road, peanut butter, and mocha. Grabbing a serving spoon, Wendy dug in. When her mother came back with bottles of chocolate and caramel syrup, Wendy simply drank several chugs from each other, in-between spoonfuls of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done Wendy felt properly stuffed, but without any of the pain or discomfort she had grown accustomed to after weeks of indulging her appetite to its utmost. Looking her belly, looming large before her eyes like a monolith of flesh, she felt only a pleasant fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if she could eat even more, but by this point it was almost 10:00 and she was starting to feel tired after a day spent sitting around, doing nothing but eating. Carrying herself to her bedroom, the full weight of all the food she had eaten for dinner pulled her along.</span></div></div>",

Starting 'slow,' Wendy pulled a bowl to her and began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, she thought about her plans for the day. It would be good to call her friends and try to meet up with them. She felt a little guilty not having time for them in the lead-up to the match. She would call them after she was done eating, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did not stop eating. As she cleared one plate or bowl her mother brought another in, and Wendy's hunger would roll over each time, space in her stomach appearing as if by magic. When she looked over at the grandfather clock in the hallway and saw it was coming on 11 she did a double-take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then her mother came in with a rotisserie chicken, and Wendy's thoughts snapped back to food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast turned into lunch, Wendy's belly expanding slowly but noticeably as she continued feeding a hunger that would not be satisfied, and as her mother continued cooking for a daughter she was never more proud of. When the lunch hour was passed the afternoon was spent with various snacks and finger foods, and then dinner signaled a stream of full-course dishes that could suit a family, but which ended up in the belly of one person: Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was too tired to continue eating, Wendy's belly was twice as large as she had ever seen it. Whatever impossible power was allowing it to empty in time with Wendy filling it was nonetheless required to follow at least some train of logic. Wendy's belly has swollen bigger and bigger as she ate, until it was a boulder filling her lap and pushing her away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had no idea what was going on, but stranger still was her acceptance of it. Falling onto her bed, laying on her side, she went to sleep feeling as content as ever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monday and back to school, which for most students meant eating but which meant for Wendy and her teammates hours of stuffing without let-up. Her introduction to Kari, a blonde junior who was the fourth (and smallest) member of the team, was restricted by the fact that the girls needed to have food in their mouths at all time, leading them to keeping their conversations to a minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich suited Wendy fine, because just like Sunday and Saturday evening her stomach was just not filling up. Back and forth she went, from the cafeteria line to the table reserved for the eating team, carrying two overflowing platters at a time and clearing them as fast as she could. At one point she took to getting giant bowls of chowder and melted cheese (the latter intended for nachos or fries), drinking them in quick chugs, hoping to fill herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doing. Her stomach expanded throughout the morning and afternoon, never giving the slightest hint of having enough. Even as the other girls at the table hit their respective walls and fell into 'nibble and sip' mode, Wendy was still taking full-sized bites of food to be quickly chewed and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for the other girls to notice their teammate's ungodly appetite, so used to unwavering gorging were they. But once they saw Wendy stand up and walk to the cafeteria line for another calzone and more mozzarella sticks and more eclairs, while they were all leaning back, stroking their bellies and taking small bites of food that had turned cold, they began paying closer attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Nicole who broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, girl. It's almost 2:00 and you're still shoving food into your mouth. Do you have a tapeworm or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another bite of calzone before she answered, Wendy replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know what it is, but since the weekend I just haven't been able to get full. I eat everything in front of me and I just want more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls laughed at this, Cassandra saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I thought I liked to eat. No wonder Mrs. Hood wanted you on the team so bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not even the eating,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cI see food and it's like, I just have to have it. Call it greed, but I want it all. I want everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped talking as she finished her calzone and started on her mozzarella sticks. The other girls laughed again, but it was a less joyful, more subdued laugh. One by one they looked at the plates in front of them, which seemed more and more appetizing as the solidness of the food in their belly died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, each girl grabbed what they had been picking at and took a real bite. Not a massive one, but a real one. As they chewed their stomachs felt better, less crowded, and they took another bite. Bigger this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long all three were eating as if they were starting a regular meal, no pains of fullness or weariness of food bothering them. When Wendy stood up to get another round of food for herself, Kari and then Nicole followed, Cassandra only a moment behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the cafeteria was rather inert; at this point in the day most of the students couldn't dream of eating any more. So the sight of all four girls going up for more food drew a few curious stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone more curious than Mrs. Hood, the coach of the eating team. When the bell rang signaling the end of the day she went right to the team's table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, I don't know what got into you but that was astounding. If you can keep up that level of dedication we might... I don't want to jinx it, but we might have the best season we've ever had!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all smiled and said nothing, the oddness of what had happened sinking in with Nicole, Cassandra, and Kari while Wendy simply transferred her remaining pizza to a paper plate so she could finish it while leaving. She wanted to see if she could catch up with Tracy and Danica, since she wasn't able to hang out with them the day before.</span></div></div>",

Wendy trotted over to them, her food-swollen belly bouncing this way and that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! Guys!\u201d she waved, stuffing down the last slice of pizza as she called to them. They both turned to her and, happily, did not immediately turn away. \u201cI am soooooo sorry for not meeting up with you yesterday, it was just-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's cool, Wendy,\u201d Danica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I'm so sorry I was distracted with the eating team. Please don't hate me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy grabbed her two friends into a bear hug, quite a feat given her own girth. Tracy started to laugh as Wendy's drama queen act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don't hate you, Wendy. We know you were busy. And you did great on Saturday, by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two saw me?\u201d Wendy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were in the audience,\u201d Danica explained. \u201cGuess you couldn't hear us cheering, but you gave the blonde whale a run for her money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, keep that up and maybe you'll go pro,\u201d Tracey added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now I'll be happy just hitting the mall. I've had enough food for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the words were proven to be false, because by the time they got to the mall Wendy's belly was starting to protest the empty space inside it. The teenager thought she was used to her appetite's growth, but she honestly felt a little intimidated that her stomach, still inflated like a balloon by all she had eaten at school, was not just ready for more but demanding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she could refuse it. The thought of eating, once in her head, could not be shaken off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you two...\u201d she started, a little embarrassed, \u201cDo you mind if we hit the food court first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanica laughed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? After an entire school day you're still hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tracey, turning pink, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I could go for a shake, myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let's get some grub.\u201d Danica said. But though she trailed behind her other friends as they made their way past the shops and kiosks, she subtly swung around past Wendy when the food court came into view. Wendy said nothing, though she stifled a laugh at Danica wanting to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy went first, thoughts of a lone milkshake replaced with a need for a full meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, can I have a double-triple burger with extra cheese and bacon, upgrade my fries to chili fries, and a large mozzarella sticks on the side? Also an extra-large strawberry shake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, scanning the menu for anything that did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; look tasty, turned her attention to her friend's order. Her intrigue only grew when Danica stepped up and ordered roughly the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I'm not the only one still hungry,\u201d she said to Danica when it was her turn at the register. \u201cBut let me show you how a lady truly eats.\u201d She turned to the cashier. \u201cI'll have two triple-triple burgers, with extra bacon, cheese and onion rings on each burger, extra-large combos for both, the fries upgraded to chili fries with both, two large orders of mozzarella sticks, two large orders of chicken strips with sweet chili sauce, three biscuits \u2013 make sure to include extra honey and butter \u2013 three large chocolate shakes, two large strawberry and I'll take half a dozen of the key lime pies and half a dozen cheesecake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends could only shake their heads when they heard all that, and again when they saw Wendy balancing the two trays of food as she waddled to an open table. But as they watched her make her way through that small feast, steady and never wavering, humorous disbelief turned to awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey and Danica finished their own food well before Wendy did, and when they were done they continued to enjoy the spectacle of their gorging friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you putting it all?\u201d Tracey asked at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn here!\u201d Wendy slapped her belly, the sound like some sort of drum. Danica reached out a hand and pressed her friend's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful you don't explode.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a moment later, Danica stood up from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll be right back. I just want some more dessert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you just saying to Wendy?\u201d Tracey called, but the laugh in her voice died down as she herself got up and went to get more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the second time today Wendy had seen the people around her become hungrier. Not quite a pattern, but as she continued with her own meal she started to muse... What if she was the cause? What if she had the power to make people hungrier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded preposterous, but after spending so much time in this world Wendy was learning to be a little more open-minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends came back with new meals (smaller ones, but more than just a dessert each), and Wendy herself made a run on the Chinese food place before she was satisfied. During all this time eating she was thinking, thinking of a way to test this theory out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's call Helga,\u201d she said, referring to a friendly acquaintance of the three but not an actual friend per se. \u201cI think she mentioned wanting to visit Bebe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d Danica said, leaning back to give her engorged belly some room and texting the other girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met her at the store, all three moving a bit slow under their full bellies. Helga was a tall yet robust girl, not a gifted eater but able to avoid detention on any given day. She carried most of her weight in her breasts, and a fair chunk in her ass. When they got near Wendy made sure to embrace the taller girl in a hug, wondering if physical contact could enhance whatever magic she was unwittingly working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then began shopping and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After waddling around the front of the school for ten minutes, the stream of students falling to a trickle, Wendy gave up on finding her friends. It was when she was halfway home that she thought about texting them. Danica answered first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSORRY WEN, TRACY HAS TO BABYSIT HER SISTER AND I WENT TO THE LIBRARY. BUT TOMORROW, DEFS. MEET US AT THE BUSSTOP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied her friends weren't angry with her, Wendy practically skipped home, finding another feast waiting for her, courtesy of her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was routine for her now, Wendy sitting down and not leaving until she had eaten everything her mother made for her, empty plates and bowls piling up before her. She wasn't sure, but she could swear her mother was preparing even bigger dishes now. To match her daughter's growing appetite, or to trick Wendy into eating more without realizing she was? If the latter it was pointless; Wendy has no qualms about spending all day, every day stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was borne out at school, as Wendy continued to spend the full day cleaning out trays of food and replacing them with more with regularity. Only now she was joined by the other girls. As if infected by Wendy's unexplainable appetite, the other three members of her team were no longer hitting a wall after a few hours of binging. Now they were also cleaning their plates and getting more from the start of school until the bell sounded at three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from what they were telling Wendy, their gorging was carrying on after school as well. Nicole and Cassandra did not have family members mooning over their constant stuffing the way Wendy did with her mother, but both had parents who understood and were willing to indulge their daughter regardless. The fridges and pantries at their houses were being kept continuously full, despite their best efforts to clean them out every evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari, meanwhile, was perhaps the most ecstatic about this change (other than Wendy, of course). Coming from a family of big women, Kari had always been seen as the 'runt' of the family. She had three older sisters, a mother, and four aunts who were all immense. She could not remember a time when there had not been at least one person in the kitchen cooking or in the dining room eating growing up, and when her appetite never got as big as theirs she began to despair. Joining the eating team had been a last-ditch effort on her part to awaken what she felt should be her true appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that it seemingly had happened, she was over the moon. It took forever to draw her story her story out of her, so intent was she on eating as much as she could at every moment, but eventually Wendy found a kindred spirit in the growing blonde girl; someone who wanted to gorge and get fatter, and was loving the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Thursday Mrs. Hood stopped the girls before they left at the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember girls, there's another match on Saturday. It's a home game again, so be here at 9 AM, ready to eat.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cWho am I kidding? You girls are always ready to eat, aren't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho will be competing this time?\u201d Nicole asked. The rules restricted a team to only three members in a match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, Graham and Carlson. Shaftoe, you'll be on the bench this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra nodded, no sign if she was disappointed to not be competing or if she was understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Saturday Wendy came to the locker room ready to eat. She had to fight not to raid the pantry for more food after the 'small' meal her mother had served her, the promise of a buffet of treats the only thing keeping her appetite in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear this wasn't as tight last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari was pinching a fold of the spandex suit competitors wore, tugging on it and testing its elasticity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've been doing a pretty good job eating this past week,\u201d Nicole said, \u201cHop on the scale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari did so, Nicole coming around to read the digital display hidden by Kari's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c265 pounds. You've definitely gained.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you read mine?\u201d Wendy asked, suddenly seized by curiosity. Kari stepped aside and Wendy took her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c304 pounds. What were you last week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c284.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn. Twenty pounds in one week? You should think about going pro, or at least trying for a scholarship. Here, read off for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c289.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're all getting big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy did not have much time to muse on her gains, for before long she and the other two were summoned to the gym for their match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike last week's opponents \u2013 made up of one immense woman and two fairly skinny ones \u2013 the team they were facing this time was made up of a more balanced trio of girls. Other than one having a distinct pear shape, all three were in the mid-to-upper 200's. Wendy looked at herself and her teammates, then back across the table. In a pound-to-pound contest, she thought her team had the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of appetite, it was no contest. When the starting bell rang she, Nicole and Kari were at it immediately, stuffing themselves for all they were worth. So was the opposing team, but the impression of a neck-and-neck battle turned to a mirage, then a dim memory, as the hour passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no different than a normal day of school; Wendy and her teammates could not get enough, determined as they were to try. For the first ten to fifteen minutes the other team was eating about as fast as they were, but one by one (the pear first) they started to flag. Taking longer to chew and swallow, taking smaller bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the twenty minute mark Wendy grabbed a tall metal pitcher of milkshake and chugged the entire thing in one go, then grabbed a meat lover's pizza and folded it in half, eating it like a taco. Across the table her counterpart was practically nibbling at her burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari and Nicole were doing similar damage, the three bellies of their team swelling outward and straining their spandex suits to prevent even a temporary slowing of their eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the halfway point was reached the contest was over, and everyone could see it. The audience, predominantly Wendy's classmates and their families, was cheering for the home team, but it seemed redundant. The girls did not need encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 40 minutes the audience had quieted down, the cheering giving way to a surprised yet awestruck silence. Wendy, Nicole and Kari were still going at it as if they had just started. There was no hint of competition for them, they weren't worried about the other team getting their second wind, they were just hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact it was a competition was not forgotten, but they had no reason to care. Noticing a tray of deep-fried cheesecake practically untouched, Wendy shoved the rest of her garlic bread into her mouth and took a swig of cola. Speaking around the food, she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither of you want any of the cheesecake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbecause the typical 'strategy' of a match was to eat a variety of food, keeping your taste buds energized by never giving them a chance to get tired of one thing. But the match was won, and Wendy wanted to indulge her sweet tooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls waved her on, so Wendy pulled the tray closer to her and, picking up a piece in each hand, began shoveling the fattening confection down her throat, cleaning the entire platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari took a cue from Wendy's single-mindedness, grabbing the tray of fried chicken and stripping all the skin off before dunking strips of meat into barbecue sauce. Nicole was fine picking and choosing, but when she picked something she would grab two or three servings before moving on to another dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the final minute was called Wendy got a little more serious, because once time ran out they would have to stop eating. The other girls were similarly concerned, picking up the pace as the seconds counted down. It was frustrating to have to stop, but the assurance of victory and the cheers of the audience made Wendy feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't full, of course, and after accepting all the personal congratulations and praise from the spectators Wendy was eager to get home and continue eating. It was as if the match was just a change of venue for her only passion in life: stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome Monday, she received surprising news</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the rest of Saturday and all through Sunday Wendy ate, almost forgetting what it was like to have an empty belly except for those brief moments when she first woke up but had not started eating. On Monday her mother didn't let her leave without a taking a basket of muffins, something to tide her over on the busride to school. She certainly understood her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't the only one needing something to carry her between eating at home and eating at school. The rest of her team was still as insatiable as her, Kari in particular happily enjoying something at any given moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for the eating competitions themselves Wendy wasn't sure she would notice one day differing from the other. It was all one stream of food, broken up only by sleep or moving between school and home or at times the mall. The only thing that really changed was what she was eating, or who she was eating with. At school she was with her teammates, and at the mall she would be with Danica and Tracy, who also seemed to be influenced by Wendy's appetite. Not as big as her teammates, they were still eating more, turning rounder and passing the average size of their classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was aware she was growing fatter, unsurprising given how much she was eating, but it did not mean that much to her. It was just a byproduct of her binging. And with her teammates also getting fatter at a relative rate, she had little frame of reference for how much fatter she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was two months into her new life before it started to truly resonate with her. Every week her team had gone against another school in an eating competition, the contests becoming less and less competitive as time went on. It was not that noticeable, but Wendy had picked up on her appetite becoming even greater as she got fatter, a change echoed in her teammates. The margin of victory got larger each week, as did the difference in size between Wendy's team and their opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was their seventh match of their season, their first after a bye week, with Wendy, Kari and Cassandra taking on Woolridge in a rematch of Wendy's first eating match. She still remembered the rush of joy from pulling out a win over the giant of a woman Jessi Reynolds, possibly the fattest person she had ever seen. The sheer magnitude in size difference between Wendy and Jessi had made the victory all the sweeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo imagine her surprise when she was sitting across from Jessi and two other, much smaller women, and she realized that not only herself but Kari and Cassandra were in the same realm as her, size-wise. It was surreal, looking at the sumo of a girl before her and then looking down at her own body. Her hips and butt spread across the bench she was sitting on, her belly pushed her legs apart, her arms rested on her hips, snuggling into the folds of her fat a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jessi was almost a mirror of her. Larger, yes, but the 'David and Goliath' vibe from two short months ago was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi provided more of a challenge than any single competitor her team had faced since Wendy joined, but there was the same problem as last time: her horrible nature meant her team was made up of two newbies, somehow roped in to serving alongside the pushy, selfish girl and unlikely to return later. Compared to the three huge, gluttonous girls of Wendy's team, the contest was still a no-brainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hour elapsed, Wendy's gaze kept returning to Jessi. It was not a team-versus-team contest; Wendy was pitting herself against the behemoth personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Wendy, Jessi seemed to have no limits. Once or twice she seemed to slow down, but then she would let out a tremendous belch and resume eating at her initial pace. Wendy, for her part, never stopped eating either, but there was something about Jessi that made her feel... small. Not just in the physical sense, but as if all of Wendy's gluttony was a child pretending to truly eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's team won, but she was left without any feeling of satisfaction for either the victory or her performance. She wondered why it was. Was something missing? Had she grown too used to curbstomping other eaters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bus back to her school, where her mother was waiting to pick her up, Wendy thought it over, never finding a right answer. All through the evening she continued to eat and ruminate. She thought about it going to sleep, she thought about it when she woke up. It still bothered her Sunday night, and she knew she needed to do something about it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On Sunday Mrs. Hood called Wendy and told her to come to school early on Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey way you girls have been growing, we need to update our records. No way are you 284 pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy showed up an hour early, before the other three showed up. Mrs. Hood was already there, so she went with Wendy to the locker room to weigh her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c434 \u00bd pounds. Keep this up and you'll have doubled your size.\u201d The admiration was plain in Mrs. Hood's voice, but Wendy was not as satisfied as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, coach? Do you know how big Jessi Reynolds is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Hood eyed Wendy, a sly grin coming to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWondering how you stack up to her? Off the top of my head I don't know for certain, but it's definitely above 500 pounds. The quarter-ton mark is goalpost few high school students reach, but she passed it over a year ago. She has to be even larger now. I'll find out her actual number, the coach at Woolridge and I know each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you? I-... I'm just curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's good to have a goal, Graham. I'll let you know before the end of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the afternoon that Mrs. Hood came up to the eating team's table, leaning down to talk to Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust got off the phone with the coach at Woolridge. Jessi Reynolds was weighed at 610 pounds even a month ago, but her weight has not plateaued so she should be a little bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy could feel a hole grow in her belly at the news, a yawning chasm. It was not the room for more food she was perpetually living with; this was true hunger. She had a number now, a comparison point between her and Jessi. She... she didn't know why, but Wendy had to beat that girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate faster. She selected the most fattening fare and then covered it with whatever sauce, cream or syrup she could. She grabbed several milkshakes and drank them down. Liquid calories were easier to consume. She filled her mouth to bursting before chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls watched her, curious but by now used to Wendy's appetite. Attempting to break tension, Kira turned to the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how big have you gotten?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c340 pounds,\u201d Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c359,\u201d Cassandra beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm up to 375. Want to hit 400 before the end of the semester.\u201d Kira said, proudest of the three. From the smallest to the second-largest, she had transformed into a proper member of the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll have no problem,\u201d Cassandra said. \u201cHow big is Marcia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira's next oldest sister was 425 pounds, give or take. A good goal to aim for, she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut when you're sharing a house with my mother and aunt Clarissa, you always feel skinny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Wendy. How big are you now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy spoke around a mouthful of pancake and syrup. The first time the other girls didn't understand her, so she had to swallow and quickly repeat herself before cramming another forkful of pancake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap, really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd look at her still go. Are you really that hungry, or are you trying to get even bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's going pro, like I told her she should. Look at her. Not even Gina McKenzie can eat like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy could barely hear them, her mind was on her food. For the rest of the school day she ate like she had the metabolism of a hummingbird, and when the bell rang she made one last trip to the cafeteria line, filling her mother's basket with burgers and fries to eat while on the bus home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home she had already cleaned out the basket, getting anxious as the minutes passed by without anything to eat. She practically barreled through the door in her hurry to get to the dining room, stopping short when she saw her mother standing at the table, a sad expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d Wendy asked, expecting some horrible news about her father or other family member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, Wendy, but the oven broke this afternoon. It's an old thing, and the cost of repairing it isn't justifiable when it would make more sense to buy a new one. Dinner tonight is going to have to be takeout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy exhaled. Was that all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you like me to order: Chinese or pizza?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wendy said, a tone of finality in her voice. Her mother laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. Let me place the orders, and if you want to start with dessert there's plenty of ice cream and cake ready as well. You feeling hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm always hungry, mom. I-\u201d She paused, cutting herself off. She had adapted to this new world pretty well, rolling with the unreality of having her dreams come true like this, but she hesitated before saying what she was about to say. Why? Why had it been so easy to accept her mother's change in personality and take advantage of it, but so difficult to open up to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother turned around to look at her, an expectant look on her face. Frack it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always want to eat, mom. It's why I joined the eating team, they let me do what I want to do all day at school. I don't know if you can ever make enough food for me. You can order the entire menu from Pizza Hut or Panda Express and I'll just want more. All I want to do is eat, all day, even day. To be the biggest, fattest woman who ever lived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother did not react for a moment, and Wendy wondered if she had gone too far.</span></div></div>",

Closing the distance between the two of them, she embraced Wendy in a bearhug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've wanted to hear that for so long. I never wanted to push you, but I've been waiting for you to become a true glutton. Don't worry, we'll have you fattened up in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smiled wryly. She couldn't be disturbed by her mother's excitement, when it was what she herself wanted, but it was still odd, her level of enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd 'odd' became something of a thread over the next week. Using the broken oven as an opening, Wendy's mother remade the entire kitchen into something appropriate for a restaurant. Knocking out the wall dividing it and the dining room, she brought in a second, larger refrigerator, a rotisserie oven, a stove with eight ranges, and a deep fryer fit for a McDonald's. She ordered cooking oil wholesale, cases of it coming in each week as she was experimented with deep-frying anything and everything she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was going overboard, Wendy was not about to complain. She loved the greasy taste of it all, often ordering seconds of things she particularly liked. But better than the taste was the results: Wendy's weight skyrocketed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom 434 pounds she reached 450 before the week was done, then 476 by the following weekend. When spring break came Wendy did not even need to lose eating time traveling from her house to school and back. She would just wake up, shower, dress, and go to the dining room, where she passed the entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy and Danica would come by almost every day, as well as her teammates on the eating team. They were all astounded by Wendy's gains and insatiability, but being around her they were unable to feel a growing hunger themselves. There was always plenty of food on hand, Wendy's mother deathly afraid of ever leaving her daughter hungry, so more often than not the visiting girl would pull up a chair and spend an hour or so stuffing themselves alongside Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the first Monday back at school, the results of this regiment were obvious to anyone. Wendy stepped off the school bus like a hippo padding down the street. Her clothes, bought weeks ago, strained to keep her in line with the school's lax dress code; it looked like one sneeze would leave her naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a part of her not buried under flabby flesh, from her face with its shrunken eyes and perpetually full cheeks down to her feet, the tops of them rising out of her pumps like bread rising in the pan. Her elbows and knees were gone, as was her neck. She was a stack of rolls on top of rolls, a pile of fat given human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teammates almost looked svelte next to her, and Nicole, standing near the school entrance when Wendy arrived, intercepted her before she reached the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe've got to weigh you,\u201d she said, Kari and Cassandra following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I'm hungry,\u201d Wendy said. That wasn't entirely the truth; she was always hungry, but that's not why she tried to fight back against being steered to the locker room. The truth was she was worried. Worried she hadn't gained enough, worried she was still a full step down from Jessi Reynolds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt'll only take a minute. Get on the scale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy stepped gingerly on the scale, holding her breath as Nicole tried to bend over and  read the results.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't letting it show, but inside she was a storm of emotions. Joy and elation at passing Jessi, a slight tinge of caution (perhaps Jessi was bigger than her official record), and a lingering sense of unfulfillment. Was it enough to be bigger than her? Should she try to make her victory more real somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate the day away, Wendy thought it over. Would there be another rematch against Jessi's school? Wendy hadn't actually learned about the eating season and how it was carried out. And what about the playoffs? Were they playoffs? Jessi's school usually qualified, she had heard. Maybe she could meet her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't enough. Wendy wanted something more personal. A one-on-one match. She should find Jessi's number, challenge her directly somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of smallness that had haunted Wendy for weeks now was replaced with a feeling of immensity. She could feel her body's size and weight better than ever, and the knowledge that she built this, that she had transformed herself, filled her with pride. And it made her hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bested herself that day, cleaning more trays of food than she had ever done before and always returning for more. Wendy was still a girl on a mission, besting Jessi Reynolds, but with victory looking possible now she was not slacking off. She was more eager than ever to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, Wendy found Mrs. Hood and asked about how the competitive eating season was carried out.

There would be an actual chance our school could get through the first round, maybe the second. Making it to the quarterfinals would have been amazing. Our school hasn't done that well in decades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut now you're on the team, and I don't know what it is but you've brought the best out in your teammates. To say nothing of your own dedication.\u201d Mrs. Hood gave an approving look at Wendy's girth, practically bursting out of her clothes. \u201cI think we have a chance to go all the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoodridge is on the other side,\u201d Wendy observed, keeping her thoughts private, \u201cSo we might have another match against Jessi for the finals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, maybe not. Reynolds' lack of team spirit often undermines her team as a whole, and the past couple years they've been knocked out in the semifinals because the opposing team knew they only needed to beat one person to win. That's a powerful mental boost, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Wendy was already treating this as a one-on-one contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Mrs. Hood. I know this is my first season on the team, I'm not as experienced as the other girls, but I was wondering... If we make it to the finals, and we're facing Woodridge, can you promise to put me on the starting roster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Hood filled the room with her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEager to face off against Reynolds again, Graham? I know what you're thinking, I know that look in your eyes when I mention Reynolds. You've got a rivalry with that girl. I'm certain it's what's been driving you these past couple months, and I'm not about to let that go to waste. Start you in the finals? Graham, I'm starting you in every match of the playoffs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Hood clapped a hand onto Wendy's massive shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're the backbone of this team. The other girls are always trying to play catch-up with you and your appetite, but you keep pulling ahead. I'm not going to bench you during the most important part of the season.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy almost blushed, pleased as always by the support of her coach, but inside she was still conflicted. Yes, she wanted another match against Jessi; she wanted to not only best her but destroy her. But if Woodridge didn't make it to the finals she would... what, wait until next year?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. No. She couldn't wait that long. But what could she do to make sure Woodridge advanced? Nothing, unfortunately. All she could do was concentrate on her own matches. The first one would be in two weeks, with three others after that, and she couldn't stand the idea of getting knocked out before she had a chance to face Jessi again.</span></div></div>",

As the days to the start of the competitive playoffs counted down the change she experienced was not in herself, but in everyone around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiller High had qualified for the playoffs more times than not in recent memory, but had never made a real showing. But now they were dominating the other schools in the region, and it was sinking in that they could actually win this. Not just getting to the quarter- or semi-finals but winning it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knew who was responsible for it: Wendy. Her popularity at school was going up in leaps and bounds as she assumed the title of 'star athlete,' a new experience for her. She wasn't surprised by the guys inviting her on dates or the popular kids trying to draw her into their circle, but like so much else in this world these outings were always focused on food. The most popular kids were either the fattest (aside from Wendy, of course) or ones whose families owned buffets or fast food places in town, or often both. Access to the fattiest, most delicious food was one's ticket to social status in this world; Wendy picked up on this when a couple girls and guys would try to subtly impress her by offering her a free meal at this or that restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her classmates were subtle compared to their parents. Like football back in Wendy's old world, competitive eating was a beloved past-time from professional on down to high school, and Miller High had its own booster club for the school's team. They hadn't been too active recently, but as the team's chances grew with Wendy's waistline so did the club's interest and membership. This meant even more invitations to free meals, but by people less shy about putting as much food in front of Wendy as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of them seemed to be trying to get Wendy fatter than she was, but she quickly allayed any misconceptions about needing outside assistance getting ready for the tournament. She was too polite to outright say 'Just keep bringing me food, I can't get full,' but when a parent or restauranteur was showing a pronounced interest in her she went into competition mode, clearing plates and platters in record time and subtly implying they weren't feeding her fast enough. People caught on quick that Wendy was no flash in the pan (or that she was pregnant, a rumor that spread for a while to explain her leaps in appetite).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was getting all the food she could want at home, her mother more or less living out of the kitchen by this point, Wendy welcomed the change in menu afforded by eating out. Even if it meant being surrounded by various admirers, hangers-on and bookies sizing up the competition in the coming playoffs, constantly interrupting her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there any competing eaters you're particularly worried about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question came from a reporter for the local paper. Wendy was at a Chinese buffet, the hostess/owner bringing her trays of food so she didn't have to get up herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy thought the question over, absentmindedly stuffing her cheeks with Peking duck and chewing. She had kept her preoccupation with Jessi secret so long she was afraid to voice it now, either because no one would think Jessi posed a threat or because she wanted to keep her major goal \u2013 best Jessi \u2013 private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take every contest seriously,\u201d she said, choosing a neutral route. \u201cSome girls may be better eaters than others, but to me I always try to visualize them as bigger and hungrier than me. My appetite seems to kick into overdrive when I have to call upon it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny plans to go professional? There's been word that several college recruiters are coming to town, and everyone thinks you're the reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven't even finished a full season yet, but yeah, I can definitely see myself trying to go pro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

She tensed- it was Jessi, Jessi was <i>here!</i> And judging by how suddenly she'd cut herself off upon walking in- she'd spotted Wendy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was nervous- but the media was still crowded around her, so she didn't let it show. But...she hadn't seen Jessi in so long. She had no idea how big she was at this point- and she was afraid to find out, in case she didn't like the answer. But...she had to know. She just had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the titanic teen turned her head- trying to keep it cool so it looked like a casual glance. She was too fat to turn her head that far- too many chins and rolls of neck fat, and her cheeks were too big- blocking her peripheral vision. Fortunately, Jessi had moved into the restaurant a bit- so Wendy didn't have to strain or move her blubber too much to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1,500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course- she had no way of knowing that- but she had a gut feeling Jessi's weight was around that number. The girl was huge compared to how Wendy remembered her- Wearing a massive pair of jeans that were barely covering her large doughy butt, and riding up to her shins. Her fat, doughy arms rested on her love handles- and her belly poured out in front of her, to the point where she needed a sort of cushioned shopping cart or wheelbarrow looking thing to hold it in as she waddled along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi was acting aloof, not looking at Wendy- so she couldn't get a read on how she felt.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sly smile slowly spread across the teen superstar's face, as she quickly returned to the sprawling banquet laid out before her- digging in and stuffing her face almost faster than the eager crowd could replenish her supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi was getting big, and Wendy still looked forwards to facing her and beating her once and for all- but looking at their progress compared to one another made Wendy's anxiety about the match melt away. Heck, it was almost sad! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere currently wasn't a chair under Wendy's enormous, voluptuous, blubbery rump- as no chair in the whole restaurant would be capable of holding it. Even if they had a loveseat or sofa on hand, it wouldn't withstand Wendy's wonderous weight. For that matter, Wendy's rump was bare- her pale flesh on open display. Nobody cared about her modesty, of course- they were all too amazed, and people were more likely to fawn over her figure than tell her to cover up. Especially since most people were understanding that even the largest pair of sweatpants you could custom order wouldn't do much good. Each of Wendy's thighs- heck- each of Wendy's <i>calves</i> were thicker than a fully mature tree trunk. Even her feet had grown too big to be covered, poking out of her calve fat like big bags of dough, with five cute pudgy toes coming out from between a fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing Wendy had in the way of clothes was a quote unquote 'shirt'- which at this point was barely a bra. Wendy's breasts were enormously oversized- billowing out in front of her, wobbling with her breaths- being just barely constrained by so much fabric you could make a hammock out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole section of the restaurant had been cleared out to make way for Wendy- several sets of tables and chairs being pushed aside and put in the back, creating a cleared out area you could park a couple of cars in- which Wendy's blubber filled a majority of. Her glorious gut was pouring out in front of her- so big that she was not only able, but forced to eat off of it instead of a table- the crowd bringing her tray after tray of more and more food setting it on the surface of her belly. Wendy merely reaching out, straining slightly to reach around her bust as her arm fat squished up against it, grabbing mittfulls of food and shoveling it into her mouth, between the two large chubby cheeks which were fatter than some girl's bellies- and over a staircase of five proud jiggly chins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was able to waddle around laboriously with the help of several wheeled palettes- like they use to carry shipments of crates in a warehouse, but cushioned for her comfort. Two were under her butt- one for each cheek- since it was so big it would've rested on the ground when she stood up. Meanwhile, three were under her belly- all lined up next to each other, all laid vertically- because her belly went out in front of her several feet as well as being several feet wide. In fact, Wendy had grown too fat to fit through double doorways. But nobody minded- everyone just loved her more for it- and all the restaurants in town quickly remodeled to include a triple doorway, hoping for the honor of Wendy choosing their establishment to eat at. Heck- some places were getting ready to install quadruple doorways- anticipating the teen's continued growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically everywhere Wendy went, she was swarmed by a crowd of admirers- advocates- reporters and supporters- all clamoring to get a glimpse of the amazing athletic champion, the pride of their town- and her glorious ever growing body. The papers were full of close ups of her rolls and fat folds, cataloging how they seemed to get thicker and more plentiful by the day, as she was practically worshipped- the crowd awed by her gluttony, and eager to indulge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Wendy?\" One of the reporters asked, snapping the utterly enormous fifteen year old back to reality. It seemed he'd noticed her look at Jessi. \"Who was that? Someone you know? A competitor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smiled, pausing for a moment in her endless binge, her smiling face framed by blubber on all sides- the girl was so unfathomably fat her head almost appeared submerged in her own fat, as if in a sea. \"Yeah- I've faced a lot of people, after all-\" she replied, keeping her cool, neutral air. \"It makes sense I'd see a few of them out in the open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Wendy continued eating- her newfound assurance that she was far ahead of Jessi not slowing her down in the slightest. If anything, it made her wanna eat more- get bigger faster! She was proud of herself for achieving such a size- surpassing someone who was once a real challenge. And she wanted to keep it up! Of course, it didn't hurt that everyone loved her for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what if Jessi was 1,500 pounds? Heck, she could be generous and put Jessi at 2,000!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot when Wendy's latest weigh-in put her at 9,670 pounds. And that was <i>before</i> she'd had her breakfast that morning~</span></div></div>",

If her mother had eaten even more then this, it was no wonder she was so huge. Wendy still felt full from her previous feasts but once she sat down she started to feel a little better. And once she started eating it felt like she hadn't eaten the whole day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sat in the kitchen eating the mountain of food for a couple hours. During that time her mother had come in from time to time to snack on few handfuls of fattening foods and to comment on how it was so good to see Wendy growing into an attractive young lady. Finally after getting through most of the food Wendy started to feel the effects of the food she was eating. Her belly felt huge and it was starting to get hard to finish the meal so her mother had to help her get the last bites in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Wendy, what kinda of a mother would I be if I let you leave your plate empty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Wendy had finished her meal she slowly made her way to her bedroom. She was finally able to get out of her clothes that have been constraining her growing body the whole day. Wendy looked so much fatter after this long day of stuffing her face. She wasn't sure if she had any clothes that could fit her, But right now she was too tired to think about that. Wendy plopped her massive bloated body down on her bed and fell fast asleep. </span></div></div>",

The entire school looked at her in admiration. Across from her, Ai looked from behind her own platters and spoke. \u201cLooking good Wendy,\u201d she said. Slowly Wendy staggered out of the cafeteria supported by her friends Danicia and Tracy. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Tracy asked. \u201cMy mom planned a feast for all of us after school.\u201d Ai responded. <i>Is all I need to think about eating?</i> Wendy wondered. \u201cMore food sounds good to me,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cMe too.\u201d said Danicia. \u201cMe three,\u201d said Wendy. \u201cThat settles it. To my house we go.\u201d Ai clipped. Motioning towards a car in the parking lot, she began walking. All of her friends climbed in. \u201cOh how the suspension sinks under our weight!\u201d Tracy shouted excitedly. Getting in, Ai drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy remembered vaguely that Ai was came from a big family, but she did not expect the family to be the size that it was. Her father weighed about what she knew the last time they met, but her mother at least 1800. And each of her three sisters weighed 900 each. When the girls walked in, their mother was sprawled out on the couch watching sports. Competitive eating was on. \u201cMom. I brought my friends over to eat,\u201d Ai said. Slowly getting up from the couch, staggering under her folds of fat, her mother responded, \u201cGood for you. I will make sure to feed them right. They look so skinny,\u201d she said, grabbing a fold of fat on each. \u201cWhen I was your age, I was twice your size,\u201d she said to Wendy. The four girls walked over to the dining room table and saw platters of food on them. \u201cI apologize for the size of the feast. More will come,\u201d Ai's mom said. The girls began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis chicken fajita is the best I ever tasted!\u201d Wendy exclaimed. \u201cGlad you like it.\u201d To show her appreciation, Wendy devoured another two plates of fajitas at incredible speed. Tracy and Danicia ate at similar rates. It seemed only 30 minutes later, all the food on the table was eaten. And robots were serving the next course. \u201cWhat's with the robots?\u201d Wendy asked. \u201cBecause this is too much food for one human to carry and I don't want to burden my husband that much,\u201d Ai's mom responded' grabbing a bowlful of rice as a robot passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal continued, and eventually everyone had eaten their fill, or more accurately gorged themselves to the point where they could not even move. Wendy ate 40 platters worth of food. Tracy 39. Danicia 30. And Ai 60. Her belly bulged out from her generous clothing, spilling out onto her lap. Then Wendy got an idea, \u201cHow about if we have a weight gain contest?. The one who gains the most at the end of the month wins, in two categories.\u201d she said. \u201cGood idea. What categories?\u201d \u201cPercent of starting mass and absolute numbers. Prize to be determined by the winner.\u201d \u201cOkay. Let's all go home and start this.\u201d the girls gain in unison. </span></div></div>",

She patted her warm belly, then proceeded to the next cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later, she waddled out of her room, her fat belly nearly protruding a foot from her body. She groaned in ecstasy, still in a sugar-high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the house was in much the same fashion, and she found her arm picking up a doughnut, or a candy bar lying around on the tables and floors, lifting them up to her face. She stopped chewing only to talk and breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom,\" she said through a mouthful of Milky Way. \"Where'd all the food come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother, now probably obese, looked at her in confusion. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food all around the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's always been there. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But, where's it all come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just appears. You know that.\" she repeated. Wendy gave up. She needed more fat to think properly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has surrounded by many doughnut boxes containing any type of doughnut you can think of. Her mom looked very soft; around the 260lb mark at least. Her arms, originally toned and defined, were now very chunky and flabby. Same goes for her butt, legs, thighs and of course, her fat tummy. Wendy's mom was wearing a new cyan fabric shirt that hugged her new tummy, and jeans which gave her a sizable muffin top. Before junkfood took over the minds of everyone Wendy knew, Wendy's mom used to gain from 10-25 pounds over thanksgiving break and she always looked a bit more chunky. Wendy always wondered what would happen if her mom just kept eating, relaxing, and kept putting on the pounds. On multiple occactions, Wendy encouraged her mom to eat more to maintain her thanksgiving figure, but these schemes were shot down. Now Wendy knew what would happen if her mom let go (more or less), and Wendy actually liked her mom's new plushy figure. It made her look more girlish and playful.<br>\r\n\"Hello dear, how was your day?\" Her mom asked. Wendy thought this was cute. Dispite her mom eating like a pig and being surrounded by food, she still used her polite language that her entire family uses. \"My day was delicious, mother.\" Wendy replied. \"That is wonderful to hear.\" She said. \"I hope you still have room for doughnuts!\". Wendy's mom handed Wendy a box of chocolate caked doughnuts. Wendy smiled, sat down next to her mom, and dug in.<br>\r\nWhen she was finished, Wendy discreetly examined her mom's exposed love handles that were escaping and bulging out of  her cyan shirt. She even brushed her soft muffin-top with the tips of her fingers. \"Hehe! That tickles, Wendy!\" Her mom girlishly said. <br>\r\n\"Oh! I have to tell you something!\" Wendy's mom started.</span></div></div>",

She plucked some cupcakes from what looked like a rosebush, and gobbled them up quickly. Just as they looked, they were wonderful. Taking longer than usual (due both to her size and frequent stops for food), she finally came to amy's house and rang the doorbell, which oozed chocolate sauce. The door opened, and there stood her friend Amy, fattened to a huge size. She had to be at least 250 pounds! Huge boobs tried to bust out of her tank top and a big belly with two rolls covered her waistband. Her hips were wide and soft looking, and her thighs were thick and smooth. This was not the volleyball-playing Amy of the normal world. Wendy's mouth dropped and her eyes widened as she took in the plump girl standing before her. \"what are you looking at?\" said Amy, laughing slightly. \"You!\" Amy said. \"you're fat as a pig! You used to be skinny and now you're plain huge! What happened to the Amy who played volleyball and dieted like crazy?!\" she exclaimed. From the looks of it, you ate her, Wendy thought to herself. \"uhm.... She never existed, thats what happened to her,\" Amy laughed. \"I've never been skinny, and neither has any other girl. Only the guys are skinny. You know that. Now stop being weird, and come in for some breakfast.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Heavenly Delights was a bakery just outside the mall. Normally the bakery was small and compact, serving delectable desserts to a handful of regulars and the occasional office worker who had forgotten donuts on the way to work. Now, the bakery stood three stories high, with multitudes of cakes and baked goods scattered throughout the store. Naturally, this all was free for the customers (and workers) to eat and enjoy, which a large group of people were already doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that when Wendy and her gang showed up, Wendy was surprised, though that was slowly fading away as she grew accustomed to this new world, by the large amount of patrons gorging themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here we are. Let's get to it,\" Tracy said as she walked across the floor to a particularly appetizing cake, crammed with melted chocolate, and began stuffing her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count me in,\" Danica was already starting her lunch with a collection of eclairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, for her part, looked at her two best friends with some confusion. <i>Why are they just letting themselves go like that? This can't be real, no business would just give away free stuff like this.</i> But as her friends ate on, Wendy quickly realized that this business was definitely not normal. And so, with some hesitation, she began to look over a pile of doughnut holes, glazed and sugared varieties about as big as her fist, gingerly reaching out a hand to take one with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nom, fheh Wenfdy, juf starf eatin'.\" It was hard to hear Tracy over the sound of cake in her mouth, but the girl's lack of manners aside, Wendy took that as her call to dig in and did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste was <i>glorious</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Wendy had always enjoyed junk food, as represented by her size, but these doughnut holes were putting all of her chips and cookies to shame. It was like a paradise in her mouth, with combinations of sugar and glazing mixing together to form a combination that would make any sweet-tooth cry. Wendy was just that sweet-tooth, and though she may not have been crying, her mind was screaming out in pure ecstasy. Never had she been able to enjoy something so profoundly delicious, and never again would she not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne pile of thirty soon became two piles, then three, then four, then a blur of frantic eating to stuff as many delicious little holes as she could into her mouth and down her gullet. Small burps made extra room for more food, as a glass of milk somehow appeared next to Wendy as she ate. But it wasn't just doughnut holes that were being devoured, soon entire pies were finding their way into Wendy's stomach. The pants she was wearing, which had been tight that morning, had been completely opened in order to make room for her burgeoning belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ugh, never - Urp - again.\" With the maximum amount of food stuffed into her tummy, Wendy had stopped to let the mass digest. An intense stomach ache was the reward for her eating, but she could live with it, considering the food had just been so <i>good</i>. \"It's like a rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Wendy was doing bad, her best friends were in worse shape. Whereas Wendy had stopped at a reasonable (albeit still risky) amount, her friends had kept going, pulling their own bellies taunt in order to fit the absolute maximum amount of food. Groans and gurgles filled the area as the girls waited for their lunch to settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it?\" Wendy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around 3:00, we must've been in here, what, a good three hours?\" Danica replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something, oh, like that,\" Tracy moved her self into a sitting position, resting against the bottom of a cake stand for support. Her belly reached out past her mid-thigh, defying conventional physics by still somehow sticking straight out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was the girls gurgled their way to sleep, letting the exceptionally fatty food make its way through their figures, filling fat cells around their poor bodies. Needless to say, the trio had a big future ahead of them.          </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sweatpants are a great invention. Not only do they conceal any unwanted bulge, they are also extremely comfortable and somewhat cheap while also being fashionable. Right now, Wendy was really digging sweatpants. Considering her four sundae dinner last night, complete with around a full gallon of milk, her stomach refused to fit well into any of her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, as Wendy got on the bus, she witnessed roughly three-quarters of her classmates wearing sweatpants or yoga pants or some other stretchy bottom that would comfortably hold their girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Wendy!\" Towards the back of the bus sat Danica and Tracy, both of them were munching on chocolate bars, with Danica also eating from a bag of chips. Their own bellies were slightly visible underneath their shirts, peaking out to say hi to their laps and the world. Danica let out a small fart, \"Excuse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus ride was normal, or rather the new normal, every person on the bus was eating <i>something</i>, letting out small burps and farts to relieve the excess gas in their stomachs. Wendy had more or less stopped questioning this new world, after all, eating donuts for breakfast (along with more ice cream, some waffles that were closer to syrup than actual dough, and a half a cake) was not a bad thing to her. So what if her belly was constantly gurgling and her pants didn't fit her anymore, good food was constantly coming her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her school, Wendy knew the bus ride could be considered a prologue to the amount of food and eating that was present in her school. Without missing a beat, Wendy followed her friends and grabbed an assortment of cookies from the cart located at the entrance. Sugar cookies, chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies, all six inches across, all delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st period Geometry was no different, learning about tangent lines had never been as much fun as it was with a belly full of apple pie. 2nd period French was great with some eclairs, oui. 3rd period health class was a joke by this point, as the teacher had simply given her students liters of soda and to quench their thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Wendy noticed something unusual by 4th period. Whereas the hallways had been the same example of kids walking to class they had always been, now they were full of students with full tummies. And walking with a full tummy was rather hard to do. Wendy, Danica, and Tracy were all resting on the stairs, along with roughly forty of their chemistry classmates (some were sleeping off the food), eating some fried cheese. \"I didn't know they had something like fired cheese, but it is pretty great!\" Wendy said. \"You bet! Nothing like some -pft- oh, 'scuse me, cheese to hit the spot.\" Tracy rubbed her belly, which was starting to feel the effects of constant junk food. \"Oof, I think I might need to use the bathroom, seed you two later,\" she got up and slowly made her way towards the end of the hallway, cradling her upset stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of 4th period, Wendy wanted to simply fall asleep and not do <i>anything</i> for a while. Her body was trying to find some form of energy in all the food she had consumed, but all there was was fat, grease, and empty calories. So, when a thirty minute break came around, the whole school was in fact ready for some downtime, which they got and promptly used. Wendy slept for about fifteen minutes before her nose picked up a sour fragrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out eating nothing but junk food all day has some adverse side effects, as with what happened with Tracy, but there was more. Wendy's belly had consumed just a little too much grease for one day, and the gas build-up in her bowels wasn't the only case of that. Surrounded by her classmates, all in the same predicament, the amount of foul air was quite high. Additionally, some girls had snapped their pant's button off, and needed to find some new bottoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch was the same as before, filled with junk, Wendy and her friends tried to gorge themselves on the meal, and they all made it through three servings before their full stomachs had reached maximum capacity. Shuffling through the rest of her day, Wendy was in a complete haze. Food induced sleep plagued her throughout her classes and constant gas kept her belly bloated. By the end of the day, Wendy felt she had gained five pounds (which may have been accurate).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing home, Wendy followed her classmates as they plodded out the front door, completely stuffed and bloated. Tracy had just used the bathroom for the third time that day, Danica was experiencing a wardrobe malfunction after ripping her bottoms down the crack (though she wasn't the only one), and Wendy was just in general reeling from the junk-filled day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The past week had quickly gone from cool to terrible. The constant junk food had left Wendy bloated, lethargic, and gassy all the time. Even worse, she was constantly hungry, and being surrounded by junk food only made the problem worse. She hadn't done anything in school except eat, then she would snack until dinner, stuff herself to the max, then go to sleep. \"Why does it have to taste so good?\" Wendy's stomach growled, she was hungry again, but she knew that eating would just increase her worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her worries was currently rising and falling slowly under the covers. Her belly, which had been big even beforehand, had absolutely exploded over the past week. Her mom had bought her clothes on Wednesday and she had outgrown them by Saturday, as evident by her pajamas, which were straining to keep her behemoth belly in check. Her pants were overridden by her massive size, giving way to the globe of fat that stuck over them, practically consuming them. And Wendy's belly wasn't the only problem, her butt had fluffed out to form an extra cushion when she sat, and her thighs were permanently stuck together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, your breakfast will melt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Mom!\" Wendy tried to sit up, and after the fifth attempt she made it. Her belly splayed out across her lap, making the chore of getting out of her bed that much harder. If it wasn't for the desire to stuff her face with ice cream, Wendy may have never left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudging across her bedroom, Wendy was stopped by the sight of her bathroom scale. Wanting to know just what the week had done to her figure, Wendy stepped onto the scale. The cold plastic startled her, but the real issue was trying to see past her tummy, which had hidden the numbers and most of her feet from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter bending over to see, Wendy was shocked by what the scale read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n262<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had gained 22 pounds in a week. Or maybe it was just bloating. Either way, the numbers told her what she already knew: She was getting fat, and quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was Wendy supposed to do? All the food in her world was junk food, exercise was out of the question as she was so bloated all the time that even walking was difficult, and trying to starve herself was out of the question. A loud grumble from her stomach interrupted Wendy's thoughts, she would have to take care of breakfast first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was like a feeding trough. A collection of sundaes, cones, waffle bowls, and ice cream pints was set on the counter. \"Morning honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Wendy had gained some serious weight, then her mother was gaining at the speed of light. Though her mom's figure had never been perfect, it certainly wasn't the corpulent women she saw today. A butt that was round like two watermelons, a stomach that was pooched out by her pants, and a chest that pushed her bra to the limits, all in all, Wendy's mom was filling out her clothes to the breaking point. And seeing her mom stuff another Twinkie into her mouth made Wendy realize that she wasn't stopping anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sat her blossoming backside on a chair and began eating the sweet confection. She was used to the usual feast each morning, but her mom had been slowly upping the amount of food each day, to keep up with her daughter's new habits. And seeing how her daughter set about eating her breakfast, it wasn't without reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy couldn't keep track of the food as she procedurally stuffed it into her gut. Flavors mixed together into a cacophony of tastes, all delicious, and left a gentle buzz from how cold they were. Chocolate syrup and whipped cream made the experience that much better, and before thirty minutes were up, Wendy had eaten through the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRPPP, oh the was good. Thanks Mom.\" Wendy let out a few small burps as she waddled to the couch to watch the tube. And for the next four hours that was where she sat, letting the food settle while letting out small belches. She had gotten up, after some difficulty, to grab chips and soda, but other than that her morning was spent in a post-breakfast haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy had almost expected the mall to have undertaken a similar transformation to the previous one. It seemed like everything in this new world was developing a more and more extreme attitude towards forcing junk food onto its greedily willing citizens. As it was, the same three story Heavenly Delights complex was still standing like a great monolith just on the entrance of the northern side of the centre, and the layout in general seemed to fit her previous knowledge. Wendy marvelled how, even before the alteration to reality, how the mall was geared towards slovenly behaviour, excessive consumption, and idle, frivolous expenditure of resources. It just seemed that in this new world, people were less inclined to be self-conscious or subtle about it. Now, hedonism was not just encouraged, but revelled in. But no matter how carefully designed the world was to cater to the voracious mouths, human biology was not so well-equipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanica and Tracy were waiting for Wendy to arrive, and they both appeared to be dealing with the unlimited junk food even worse than Wendy herself. Though Wendy had at least made the walk, and was feeling tired but still basically capable of putting one foot in front of the other, her friends seemed to be really struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Wendy I don't...\" heaved Danica, in a seated position and not willing to get up just yet, \"I don't understand why I feel like this. I'm normally OK with this much food\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was not inclined to admit that \"normally\" was just an imaginary myth, and that in fact the world had not always been this way. But she helped her friend to her feet, amazed by the chub around her arms and midsection. Wendy had a chuckle to herself as she thought about how her \"social circle\" was finally growing. And being more circle-like by the day too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gluttony and desire that Wendy felt before the reality change a few days beforehand was what separated her from her friends. They were gaining weight but they didn't have the willpower and single-mindedness to eat through the pains of a full stomach. Even though Wendy had eaten a huge breakfast, her mind was already hovering into the realm of her next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the food court next\" Wendy interjected as the girls were standing outside a jewelry store staring at the plus-size rings for chubby fingers. Danica and Tracy were both a little wide-eyed at Wendy's suggestion, given how clear it was that the threesome were still digesting their respective massive morning meals. But by the laws of the new universe, they each had to give the impression that this was normal, that it was lunch time and therefore food must be consumed prolifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman biology might not be infinitely malleable, but it can certainly stretch some way, and more than anything, it's very good at gradually getting used to new circumstances. So when Wendy shuffled into the food court, expecting to be greeted by waves of fullness that would have prevented her from enjoying her meal, she felt surprised to feel something different. Hunger. Not just a little big of hunger. Real desirous waves of hunger. Huge pulsating spasms of food-lust. Not only did her appetite return to her, but also her energy, that should not have been there given her weeks meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy went to the first place in her eye-line, a taco stand, and ordered two extra large burrito meals. As the words came tumbling out of her mouth she felt a disorientation, and greedily demanded more and more. Nachos, and a beef taco, and ice cream and churros, and a milkshake, no two milkshakes. And make everything large. LARGE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy turned to her friends as she waited for her order to see the looks on their faces... </span></div></div>",

On to the chapter all ready in progress.) And is suprised to see everyone was doing the same thing as her. She went to her friend Tracy and she said:Oh Wendy you hear the news as we'll? Wendy was confused by these and said:No I haven't what's up? Tracy told her that the U.N have made a global bill that allows everyone to only wear underware or panties for woman and for girls bras! Wendy was surprised by this news and was less embarrassed by her attire so she went to class and ate food all day as usual the new bill help many people who were having wardrobe malfunctions have an easier time eating not haveing much to hold theme back like ridding up shirts and spilt pants and as an added bonus(for us the readie of course!) they did not know when to stop eating for only when they bell rang they know when to stop at lunch people were eating like mad! They were eating one whole item of junk food a minute Wendy was all ready on her 20th serving everyone else was close behind that there 16th a couple of bras pop of as breasties grow bigger and buttes growing battling to break out of there cotton prisons. Everyone's guts gained a third or forth chin and there checks grow 10 inches in length and diameter. Plus there stomachs insides grow by a whole 2 feet to contain the Sir plus of junk food in there bodies They only know when to stop when there Titanium chairs broke and they all fell in unison cossing a minor earthquake in the area around then all the gas in there bowls(which in my estimate is about 20 gallons worth a person so you can possibly understand what is going to happen next.)

As such, I have left the option to continue the story below but I am treating the chapter below like the last chapter never happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy woke up to the growling sounds of her belly. \u201cUggghhhh,\" Wendy moans as she started to rub her belly, hoping to calm it down a little.  \u201cMaybe the late night fried cheese balls wasn\u2019t the best idea before bed,\u201d Wendy thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy, c\u2019mon dear, breakfast is made and you have to still get ready for school,\u201d her mom called from the kitchen below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing mom!\u201d Wendy bellowed. Wendy got out of bed with a few grunts and burps escaping. She slowly walked over to the bathroom to freshen up.  She looked over her body in the mirror and picked up her belly and then letting it drop and wobble for a few seconds. \u201cI must have put on at least 5 pounds over the weekend,\u201d Wendy said while patting her belly affectionately. Wendy thought back to all of her meals over the two day binge that was her weekend. After the ice cream breakfast she feasted on heavy pastas, greasy pizzas, and thick cheesecakes moving only to get more food, go to the bathroom, or sleep. Her stomach grumbles at the thought of all that food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes her way over to the dresser and looks through her clothes. She then realized that her sweatpants and t-shirt she wore to bed were the only pieces of clothing to fit. Her t-shirt failed to cover her lower half of her doughy middle that hung over her waistband and sweatpants that looked close to being painted on. But they would have to do. \u201cI should ask mom for new clothes today,\u201d she remarked to herself as she slowly trudged her way down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy saw her mom pull out two dozen chocolate chip cookies from the oven setting it down next to her multiple cartons of ice cream.  As she sat down at the table licking her lips her mom finished pouring her a large, tall glass of heavy cream when she arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Wendy the bus will be here in 30 minutes so eat up quick.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy wasted no time digging into her food ravenously letting small moans, grunts, and burps as devoured her breakfast. The warm cookies melting the ice cream allowing her to eat them like her life depends on it. 20 minutes later, she slams down her 3rd glass of heavy cream, and lets out a loud belch signifying she was full. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay Wendy, I have packed your bag with some soda and fried cheese balls for the bus ride for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, mom,\u201d Wendy replied as she struggled to get up, \u201ccan you get me some new clothes-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question gets cut off as her mom reached down to get Wendy\u2019s backpack her fattened backside and thick thighs finally were too much for her worn down jeans. A large rip could be heard as her mom\u2019s jeans ripped down the middle showing her underwear beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it looks like two of us need some clothes,\u201d her mother laughed handing the bag to Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy looked at her mom\u2019s backside thinking how much larger can it get as her mom plops another chocolate covered Twinkie into her mouth.

All of her classes incorporated food in some way to make sure everyone was eating throughout the day. Chemistry had them making rock candy, History was eating cake while learning about the sugar in trade, even Gym had them drinking milkshakes as the talked about the importance of calcium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest binge of food was during lunch. Lunch was greasy XL pizzas and 2L bottles of soda. Everyone took a couple\u2014except Wendy who took three\u2014of the pizza pies and began to gorge. With all of that cheese and soda on top of what they ate already, it was a lot for most people. The lunch room started to smell from that combination with burps and farts being heard through the lunchroom as everyone\u2019s body struggled to process the pure junk that was being consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy looked over to her two friends to see their eyes looked glazed over and sweating as they ate more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud beep is heard over the intercom and the principal, between small burps, told the student body that everyone\u2019s next period class was canceled and it would be replaced with an extended lunch/break. An exhausted cheer is heard throughout the student body as nobody had the energy to get up and move let alone go to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the newfound break and everyone rested off some of the massive amounts of food eaten so far, they got up to head to their next food filled classes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after eating massive cookies to learn about circumference in math, the final bell rung for the day. Wendy rocked her body up and slowly walked to the bus taking the large bag of chips offered to her on her way out. She felt huge after that day with her own shirt barely hanging on and her get bloated and pack full of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy got on the bus and saw her classmates in a similar situation to her; ripped clothing, broken buttons, and stained clothing. She smiled at that sight and sat down opening her bag of chips to replenish her energy after that walk. </span></div></div>",

Following her, Wendy ditched her pizza box on the side of the road and walked into the bus. And then she stopped.<br>\r\nThe bus she saw was not the bus she remembered. Every girl was morbidly obese. Carts of food traveled up and down the aisle, and everyone ate from them as they pleased.

Why would it be weird,\u201d Tracy responded, seeming concerned for her friend\u2019s mental health. Seeing the look on her face, Wendy decided not to push the issue further, but instead to gorge herself as all the other girls did. The really weird thing Wendy noticed was that the boys did not join in on the festivities. They ate and drank as they normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one of the many stops, they picked up yet more boys. One of the boys moved over to Wendy\u2019s spot on the bus. \u201cUm\u2026 Hello Wendy.

Nothing more.\u201d Jack and Wendy continued sitting next to each other on the bus in silence. Wendy noticed every girl on the bus gave her envious stares.

She was still the biggest of all three of them, and she'd always been way greedier so she grew faster too since she just ate more. So while the other girls could reach around their bellies and at least try to push up and off of the ground, Wendy's limbs were suspended just about a foot off of the ground. She could only dig her fingers and shoes into her own fat as she laid on top of her gut like a big bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry Wendy.\" Danicia said, before getting an idea. \"Hey- actually, that means you're more stable than us- Wendy, you can help me and Tracey stand up, and then when we're up we can help you stand up together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good idea Dani!

Danicia grunted as she pushed herself a little closer, taking Wendy's hand and standing up on shaky legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof- whoo...Thanks Wendy.\" Danicia said, still partially leaning up against her fat. Wendy couldn't help but notice, with Danicia so close to her, how her whole face and chest was covered in dropped food from their sloppy binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy giggled. \"No problem- but hey- you're not gonna let all this go to waste are ya?\" She teased, grabbing Danicia around the waist and pulling her closer. She fell forwards onto Wendy like a mattress, their bellies pushing into each other, as Wendy began to playfully lick all the fresh stains off of her cleavage and double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanicia squealed in surprise, and started laughing. \"Ahhahaha! Wendy- heheh- hey- quit it! You crazy fatass- hahaha!\" Though this spicy little move was meant to be all in good fun at first, Danicia found herself to be caught completely off guard by what happened next... </span></div></div>",

It's your fault you're such a messy eater you let yourself get covered in all this tasty stuff in the first place!\" She said, before going back to lapping away at Danicia's chest, but she grabbed onto her fat arms and pulled, Danicia so fat and unbalanced she fell forwards, leaning up onto Wendy's larger fat body. Wendy was now licking the stains off of her double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanicia giggled again, \"That's not fair to say! You're the one with a TRIPLE chin that's all covered in stains! You're just as-\" Danicia didn't get to finish her sentence, as Wendy opened her mouth wide and slobbered all over Danicia's face with her salivating tongue, she pulled her friend in closer one more time- Only for her to fall forwards, her head jamming into Wendy's open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy and Danicia were both surprised, it had been an accident after all. Danicia yelped, and tried to pull herself out- But just like she couldn't get up off the floor earlier, she was too fat to pull out of Wendy's maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy herself probably could've spit her out...but she felt a strange yet familiar urge overtake her. It was the same greedy response to just eat and eat and eat that she'd been indulging for only a little more than two weeks now, and already bloating up to over three times her size in so short a time. So...well...she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanicia panicked as she felt Wendy slurp her deeper in, up to her shoulders. She kicked her feet, and struggled, trying to wriggle her way out- as Wendy struggled to suppress her gag reflex and keep on swallowing- Something she'd gotten better at during her gorging anyway. Danicia's fat was so squishy and soft, Wendy found she didn't have to stretch her mouth too painfully open. Even Danicia's considerably large and shapely rump, which strained at the seams of her custom made quadruple-XL jeans, was tender enough to be squeezed down her gullet, even if the effort made Wendy's whole jaw and throat hurt, and her eyes watered from the strain. Finally, she finished, nothing but a pair of feet dangling out of her mouth, one with only a sock and the other with a sock and sneaker. Wendy quickly slurped them down, sighing in relief. She noticed that one of Danicia's shoes had fallen off- A bright red untied sneaker, sitting right on her triple chin, like a display shelf. She smirked, then giggled, and then all out laughed, happily picked up the shoe and swallowed it too. Danicia had been smaller than Wendy, but only by like a hundred pounds or so. Now all her weight was added to Wendy, specifically in her belly- making Wendy rise even higher off of the ground as she lay on her gut. There was such a thick layer of fat on Wendy's belly that even stuffed like it was it was still soft to the touch, just a bit more firm and rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of stunned silence, Wendy heard a startled \"Wh-Wha- What the hell?! Oh my gosh, Wendy! You just...you just- What the hell??\" Wendy blinked, snapping out of her own trance. She shifted her bulk to look down at Tracey, who was compeltely floored by what she just witnessed, still pinned to the floor by her fat belly, like Danicia had been. Wendy was about to apologize- About to explain it was an accident and she got carried away...but then she realized something....Tracey was even bigger than Danicia was. Wendy smirked, eyeing her other friend, and licked her lips in anticipation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Sasha walked in- quite a chubby woman herself, but still thin enough to walk back and forth from the kitchen without needing to rest for a snack break. She was wheeling along with her three large trolleys, filled with so much cake and pie and donuts and things that they looked like they might overflow. \"Hello again girls! I brought you each even more food than normal because of-\" she stopped short, gasping in shock from what she saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanicia and Tracey were gone, and Wendy was laying there, face down on top of a round, soft belly so big that it sprawled out wider than it was tall, and even still lifted her arms and legs almost four feet off of the ground. She also looked generally a whole lot thicker and flabbier, more filled out. Her triple chin had become a quintuple chin, her boobs had busted out of her special custom ordered XXXXXL shirt and and Double J-cup bra, now pouring out freely and resting on her belly. Her thighs and calves had also split the seams on her XXXXXXL Yoga Pants, which were supposed to be super stretchy on top of how big they were, pale fat bulging out in several places. Her pants were also stretched so thin over her fat legs and wide hips that they were almost translucent, and looked kinda like fishnets. Except for her butt, which was so insanely big and round and bouncy that it had ripped apart the seat of her pants completely, the two pale globes quivering freely. Even her shoes had been outgrown, the stitches which held the soles on being strained against so much by her own fat soles that they gave and popped right off, and as her feet grew wider too they pulled the laces apart so much the soleless shoe was barely holding together. Her socks were stretched so tight they were totally form fitting, aside from a few tears and rips which fat bulged through- particularly the seam on the end had burst open, allowing her fat soft oversized toes to hang out freely, wiggling idly and sometimes digging into her belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy giggled at Sasha's stunned reaction. Wendy had been about 800 pounds, gaining about 540 pounds by herself in about two weeks. She <i>was</i> a bit smaller than her 900 lb mother...but now with the approximately 700 lb Danicia and 760 lb Tracey gracefully donating themselves to her fat, she was easily more than double that- a staggering 2,260 pounds. That means she'd managed to pack on a whole ton of pure fat since her wish came true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved Sasha over playfully with the thick sausage fingers on one of her pudgy mitten like hands, almost like she was trying to act sultry and seductive, even as she let out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>bbrrRRRUUUOOOOORRRrrrp</b></i>- Just bring all three of those to me, Sasha. I'll make sure it gets to them. And try and get another course up here as soon as you can after this one. I'm absolutely famished~\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monday morning saw the herd of students returning to school, their footsteps plodding as they walked willingly or not-so-willingly back into their academic prison. The impromptu vacation, initially promised to last an entire year, had been a welcome respite from textbooks and pop quizzes, but now the fun was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few students happy to be back, one of them (surprisingly) being the fattest of them all. Weighing over 2,500 pounds, Wendy lumbered her way through the parking lot and to the main gate, happily munching on a sackful of breakfast burritos and chicken biscuit sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was far from the only transformed student. Over the break many of her classmates had taken to overeating and lazing about, and the pounds had come to them just as they had Wendy. Not to the same extent \u2013 though Wendy didn\u2019t think anyone had been following the same diet she had, she chuckled wickedly to herself \u2013 but almost half of the student population was straining their shirts and pants and dresses, so many overstuffed bellies, overripe butts and jiggling boobs or moobs barely contained by outfits that not too long ago had been form-fitting at least or baggy at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the recently awakened cannibal they all looked so delicious, even more appetizing than the food she had in hand at the moment. And Sasha, out of fear for her life, had become an exceptional cook in a very short time, so that was saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first period of the day was preempted by an assembly, so everyone was ushered to the gym to crowd into the bleachers that were no longer up to the task of seating them all. A number of skinnier students were left standing on the sides, and a few of the heavier ones \u2013 500 or 600-pounders \u2013 simply parked themselves on their ample rears on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy didn\u2019t pay much attention to the principal explaining that the out-of-the-blue school shut-down had been for the purposes of expanding the space in all the classrooms and the cafeteria. Walls between classrooms had been taken out to double the size of them, and temporary classes had been set up on the football and baseball fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said something about the national population growing fatter faster than ever before, which made Wendy\u2019s ears perk up, but then he went into some dry shit about reinforcing infrastructure or whatever and she tuned him out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they were released to go to second period and resume the school year for real. Wendy, not used to moving around too much at her current size, let everyone else file out of the auditorium first before she heaved herself back to her feet and began waddling to her physics class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the quarter-ton students moved much faster than Wendy, who was left alone making her way down the hallway after a while. Panting, sweating a bit, she began to second-guess her decision to come back to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things began to go her way. Rounding a corner, she came across a boy and a girl standing in the middle of the hall, looking over a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoom 115 is there,\u201d the boy said, pointing behind him, \u201cso we need to go that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his finger almost poked Wendy right in the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo (huff) problem.\u201d Catching her breath, she looked over the two lonely students. The boy was nicely plump, at least 200 pounds, but his friend had a good hundred pounds on him, with large basketball-sized breasts and a belly that hung down over her crotch. Mouth salivating, belly grumbling expectantly, she asked \u201cWhich class are you trying to get to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c120,\u201d the girl said, as the boy leaned against her belly and showed her his map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess they changed all the numbers,\u201d he said, but before he could finish his thought Wendy struck. Grabbing him by the arm, she jerked him across her belly and to her mouth, widening to cavern-size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed him in a pair of heartbeats, before his friend could even process what she was seeing. Wendy didn\u2019t give her a chance to react; even as she was slurping up his legs she was reaching out to grab the girl by her meaty shoulders, and then she was starting on her second course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Wendy was by herself, her belly sagging heavier on the floor. Letting out a proper belch, she smiled and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I got a decent breakfast today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the morning Wendy did the typical student thing, making space for herself to sit on the ground towards the back of the class (shoving classmates and their desks aside with her ample hips) and using her belly for a desk as she half-heartedly took notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen recess came she went into the women\u2019s restroom, hoping to find one or two ladies unaware. On this she was disappointed, but when lunch came she made a slight detour back to the restroom before heading to the cafeteria to try her luck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time fortune favored her. A trio of sophomores, two quite chubby and one proudly fat, were standing around gossiping when Wendy lurched her way through the door (even though all doors had been widened as part of the school remodeling it was still a tight-squeeze for the ton-plus teen). Three pairs of eyes bugged out, but the trio quickly recovered and resumed their gabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Wendy was right in front of them, eyeing them as if lustily and licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d the fattest girl asked, but Wendy was already grabbing her friend and gobbling her up. Then she grabbed the other not-as-fat girl and did likewise, before zeroing in on the 500-pounder left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill so much room inside,\u201d Wendy said to herself, \u201cI wonder if I can ever get full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarter-ton girl started to scream, but Wendy pounced like a cobra, throwing her mouth over the other\u2019s head and shoulders and then lifting her off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was just Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought. As she stood there, savoring the filling out of her belly, her happy moment was broken by a gasp from behind her.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, she hoisted a thick doughy leg and shuffled to the side, turning enough to get a look at who was behind her- the one who she heard gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a student- respectably fat, around 450 lbs. Of course, they were utterly dwarfed by Wendy- who now, after eating up five corpulent classmates, weighed in just over a staggering 4,400 lbs- nearly gaining an entire second ton after eating some of the students. Though, Wendy hadn't fully digested her meals yet- so her body still mostly looked like it did at 2,500- already monstrously fat, with wide hips and a doughy wobbling rear, rolls of fat hanging off of her that were thicker than some other girl's thighs. The students she ate still sat in her behemoth belly- which was pouring out in front of her, great and round like a globe- bulging out several feet in front of her, almost as big as the rest of her body. Just imagining all that belly digesting and turning into more and more beautiful fat- it made Wendy's mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a labored step, grunting and heaving her belly along, moving towards the student- but they quickly stepped back- putting up their hands defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait- no no no, don't eat me!\" They cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuh...\" Wendy said, dumbly, panting from the effort of dragging her immensity around. \"why...not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student calmed down, before getting excited. \"You- I saw you in assembly, you're Wendy, right?\" Wendy nodded, her quadruple chin limiting her head movements a bit. The student grinned- \"Wendy- oh my gosh, you're amazing! You're the fattest girl in the entire school, by a long shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy couldn't help but smirk, chuckling a little as she proudly rubbed her belly. \"Yeah... I am pretty impreshive, but I'm alsho shtill hungry, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student gulped nervously, \"I- I know, but- you don't have to eat me! I can help you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy raised an eyebrow. \"Help me? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student jumped for joy- their plump belly wobbling as they did. \"Ooh- this is great! I can't believe I get to help you keep growing! You're the most beautiful, perfect, fattest girl ever- I'm so glad I can help feed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy thought about it- she didn't even actually say yes yet. But...she was lazy- and waddling around getting her own prey was getting harder as she grew. And she did love being revered and praised. She sighed, smiling. \"Alright- shure, kid. You can...feed me...help me keep....growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student let out a squeal of delight. \"Thank you, Wendy! Here- follow me, I know the perfect place you can sit down and rest- And I can bring a whole buncha students for you to eat right to you, without you needing to move a muscle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smiled, waddling after the student- her footsteps heavy and slow as she heaved her bulk along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Wait- I didn't even tell you my name!\" The student said, turning back to face Wendy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy had always been a greedy gluttony girl, even before she made that wish which changed her life for the better. She'd been able to out-eat her whole extended family combined at every thanksgiving dinner, and if she ever found out about a new food she liked, she'd find a way to get her hands on it and gorge to her heart's content. And, as she'd discovered since eating Danicia and Tracey, she had a bit of a taste for people. In fact, since that day, Wendy had managed to eat seven more delicious, heart, obese individuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two had been Tracey's parents, who'd waddled on over to check on their daughter. Tracey's mom had been 850 pounds, and her dad was 750. Wendy's mom had told them that she could bring them both to where Tracey was...and she didn't technically lie. Danicia's parents on the other hand heard what happened, and came over, furious at first. Something odd happened though, when they had actually seen Wendy- her enormous blobby form jiggling like crazy as she continued to eat even then, they actually came around. They admitted that they loved how fat everybody was becoming, and saw the weight someone gained as a badge of honor. They'd hoped Danicia would outgrow her friends someday, but they agreed that for her to be <i>added</i> to the bountiful flabby rolls of such an amazing eater like Wendy was just as big an honor. In fact, they were proud she was the first one Wendy ate, viewing her as a trendsetter. That in mind, Danicia's 870 lb father and her 1,040 lb mother (even bigger than Wendy's mom), both willingly dove headfirst between Wendy's luscious, soft, fatty lips- Feeding themselves to her as well.The fifth person had been a pizza delivery girl, who seemed to clock in at a comparatively humble 600 lbs. Like many other delivery people, she'd been amazed by Wendy's sheer size, and had begged for the opportunity to feed the fleshy mountain of a teen all 2,000 triple extra large pizzas she'd ordered all by herself. And...well, around pizza 1,200 the poor girl got too close and her hand went into Wendy's mouth. Incapable of resisting another heftier treat, Wendy's greedy nature took over and she gulped the whole driver down. The owner of the pizza place was angry, and he was almost going to sue Wendy's family. But when the especially hefty man was driven over in the back of a van, and waddled his 1,330 pound body (likely a benefit of getting free pizza due to owning the joint) into their house to speak with them, he was so shocked and impressed by Wendy's size and weight that- just like Danicia's parents had- he agreed that she deserved all the fat more than he did, and settled out of court with both a promise of free pizza for life, and his own self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seventh person had been an odd but welcome case- A handsome young man of 2,260 pounds- the biggest one yet, just as big as Wendy after eating Danicia and Tracey- came knocking on Wendy's door, asking to see the amazing girl. He was almost entirely naked, wearing only a t-shirt covered in rips and tears, soaked almost entirely through with sweat, and barely able to cover his moobs. He waddled around with a wheeled platform on the ground, like the kind you'd transport cargo with, except he had to use it to hold up his massive quivering belly. His bare feet, too fat to squeeze into shoes or even socks, sweat so much that they left footprints, and his sloshy quivering butt was only a few inches from touching the ground even as he stood up. When he did get to squeeze through the door and see Wendy herself, he immediately professed his love for her- That he'd admired her for a long time, since he was actually a senior at her highschool. When he heard all those rumors about how she'd started eating people, he immediately began to binge as hard as he could, eating so much he couldn't breathe- Gaining as much weight as possible, so that he could be a satisfying snack. He apologized if he was too skinny for her, and begged her to eat him. Wendy had been taken aback at first, but giggled after a moment- wiggling one pudgy, useless finger- the closest thing she could do to a come hither gesture, considering how mind bendingly obese she'd become, and said to him in a singsong playful seductive voice, \"....<i>hurff</i>....C'mere....<i>hurff</i>...ya...<i>hurff</i>....big.. ..<b><i>BBUUOOOORRRRRRRPPP</i></b>......hunk~\" The boy's face lit up, as he gleefully wobbled forwards as fast as he could, his toes squishing into Wendy's belly fat as he, huffing and puffing, climbed up to her mouth. He embraced her squishy cheeks passionately, leaning forwards so much his moobs rested on her chins, and gave her a loving kiss on the lips. Those same thick, full, plump, luscious, stain-covered lips which her pudgy salivating tongue was licking clean of the young man's sweat a few minutes later, Wendy releasing a bout of flatulence so powerful it made her oceanic ass cheeks be blasted apart for a moment, before slamming back into eachother violently, clapping so loud it almost matched the fart itself, before the spoiled, greedy, titanic teenage slob called out between her mighty belches \"<b><i>BLLURURRRUUUAAAARRRRRURURP</i></b>....More....<b><i>GGGRRLLOOOORRRP{/ i}</i></b>....donuts! <b><i>UURRRRRRRPPP</i></b>\"   Wendy's mom, Sasha, and the two additional maids Jane and Phoebe who Wendy's mom hired, eagerly set about their task, stuffing the fifteen year old blob who filled up most of the room herself. Even with all four of them working together- Wendy's mom even helping since she'd <i>lost</i> 400 pounds, going down from her impressive 900 to a mere 500. She didn't mind though, since she knew every calorie she burned, every pound she shaved off, every crumb of food she refused to eat, ended up making her beautiful, <i>beautiful</i>, <b><i>beautiful</i></b>, <b><i><u>BEAUTIFUL</u></i></b> daughter that much fatter. She considered hiring a few more maids to help, as she knew that making sure her amazing girl grew as much as possible was the most important thing in the world, and she feared that the four women working together would be unable to satisfy her incredible, beautiful, perfect appetite, squeezing around the ghostly pale stark naked blobby teen that filled up the room, wading through the two inch deep puddle of sweat which filled up the whole floor, climbing her tender fatty rolls to get close enough to her face covered in stains (some dating all the way back to the day all this started, since she literally never washed herself at all since this started) to feed her yet more, relishing the intoxicating stench of her body odor which was strongest around her deep armpits, massive sweaty bare feet the size of pillows- cute round toes wiggling lightly, the four women euphoric whenever one of her frequent bouts of hot, humid, explosive blasts of a belch or fart would wash over them. Just being around her divine enormity, drinking in her glorious atmosphere, Wendy's mom knew she just had to feed this girl- More and more and more, keeping her gaining and growing fatter and fatter was the most important thing in the world, and she couldn't fail her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy herself sat, blissful and greedy as ever, in the epicenter of her own body, joyously savoring the feeling of being so grossly indulged and worshipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy weighed 14,660 pounds. That's more than 7 tons. That's heavier than an elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was in heaven.</span></div></div>",

A few of her red hairs were in her face, which was tied into a ponytail. The rest of her body was fat all over, with fat covering her arms, legs, chest, back, and front. At about 163 lbs. and only 5' 2'', she was quite fat. She enjoyed it now, though, and wanted to show it off. She changed into a yellow tank top that let her belly flow out and a white skirt that gave her a muffin top. She was pulling the skirt over her light blue panties, but had trouble pulling it over her large rear. After she succeeded, she then wondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Eating had become so automatic for her. Her mother kept bringing more and more food to her at the table and Wendy kept putting it away in to her gut. The past month had gone by in such a blur. Wendy currently sat at the table wearing a tank top 4 sizes too small. The extra 100 pounds didn't help out the wardrobe situation the plump girl had. Now at a bursting 260 lbs not much fit Wendy. Her pale white belly hung wildly out of her tank top and rested on her tree trunk thighs. Her thick meaty arms wobbled as she brought her hand to and from her mouth. Her swelled boobs hung freely in her tight tank, stretching the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the initial pleasure of eating beyond her bounds was past her, Wendy still loved to pack it away. During her breakfast, while she was consuming a tower of donuts, she remembered what she like so much about them.  It was not just the fact that they were sugary and filled her growing stomach, it was how each one was unique and had their own texture and flavor, and not to mention delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy decided to slow down on the pork fest and start enjoying the flavor of all the junk food she was now surrounded with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy stopped to take a breath.

In the introduction she already weighed 260 lbs, so after gaining 100 she'd be at 360)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Graham sighed in relief, wiping some sweat off of her forehead as she looked out proudly at her work. Mr. Graham smiled, placing his arm around her shoulder. \"You did amazing, honey.\" He said. She giggled, \"well I wouldn't have been able to do it without your help.\" He laughed, saying \"Well it's a good thing we make such a great team, since we're gonna have to do this everyday.\" Mrs. Graham nodded, as a bright smile spread over her face. \"Speaking of which...WENDY!\" She called out joyfully. \"Breakfast is ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer call was answered by a long silence, before a roaring explosion of flatulence which seemed to shake the whole house rung out from Wendy's bedroom, the huge fat teenage girl belching and farting at the same time as she woke up. They could smell it from the kitchen- hell, anyone who happened to be walking by could smell it from the sidewalk. A few moments later, they heard a resounding <b><i>BOOM</i></b>, which made a bit of plaster dust fall from the ceiling as they also felt it make the ground shake, like a tiny tremor. A few moments later, <i><b>BOOM</b></i>, again. <b><i>BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.</i></b> A few seconds between each mighty impact as they got closer, and closer. As the lumbering thundering behemoth slowly drew closer, they heard her breathing. Between every resounding stomp, a few long seconds of panting, huffing, and wheezing, more often than not accompanied by a couple good burps or a fart. As the <i><b>BOOM</b></i>s got louder, the smell got stronger and stronger until it was a thick miasma which filled the air. Slowly, a bit of pale, stained flesh, absolutely drenched in sweat which dripped off of it into a puddle, came into view, and Mr. and Mrs. Graham beamed as their pride and joy finally came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy grunted, pulling herself forwards, and sighing in relief as she finally squeezed out of that dang hallway, which she alone completely filled up. Her gargantuan body spilled out into the kitchen, free from the tight, restrictive walls. Wendy had been 5 feet tall just two months ago, back before her life mysteriously changed for the better. She was now five feet and four inches tall...at least, if you measured from the bottom of her foot to the top of her head. And all four of those inches came from the fat on her feet themselves, thick meaty soles and five round soft toes squishing like bags of doughy lard when she waddled. Of course, if you wanted to count the top of her breasts, belly, or butt- Or even her cheeks, like the ones on her face, then she'd get a few extra inches in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past month, Wendy had continued to relentlessly gorge herself, taking sheer bliss in the endless hedonism of her lifestyle and the thrill of her growth. Her parents had seemed to somehow take an even greater bliss from her gain than she did, they'd gotten downright overzealous how much they stuffed her. In fact, on the rare occasions she <i>did</i> see other people they all seemed overly dedicated to stuffing her silly too. Delivery guys who would drop off more than three hundred pizzas at a time, saying they were all for her- All completely free. People from the neighborhood who were coming back from grocery shopping suddenly make a pit stop at her house, eager to feed her all the items they'd just bought because she \"deserves it so much more\" than they did. Complete strangers who seemed to just be passing by felt an inexplicable urge to pull in to the nearest fast food place and order everything they could possibly afford, only to suddenly get a second inexplicable urge to drop by Wendy's house and donate everything to her. Everyone all of a sudden seemed to hold her up on some sort of pedestal, eager to the point of fanaticism to feed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these sources so eager to stuff her, Wendy couldn't help but give in to her gluttonous, hedonistic, greedy nature and eat it all up. She wasn't a very tall girl, so she simply grew <i>out</i> while staying the same height. Even as her weight more than doubled...and then more than tripled, the tubby teen growing wider and wider rapidly, surpassing the one ton mark within the first two weeks of the month. It was no wonder she stopped wearing clothes...and stopped showering. And stopped brushing her teeth, and trying to hold back all her gas, and doing anything resembling exercise aside from stomping wherever the nearest food was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Wendy was a staggering 2,700 pounds of pure greedy spoiled slob. She was more than three times wider than she was tall. Her naked body was usually spread eagle, her arms and legs so encased in thick fat that she had to keep them straight out, like she was in the middle of a jumping jack. Even her head was being totally squished between her chubby cheeks, each one as big as her belly back on the night all this started. Her belly and butt were so big they touched the ground, and piled up to be higher than her head when she was standing up. Sweat trickled down her several dozen square feet of fat rolls and deep folds, so much that it looked like she was being rained on by some invisible hurricane, droplets almost always flying off as her pale nude body almost constantly wobbled and jiggled. She was covered in a mosaic of food stains from her relentless messy gorging, Her body odor could make a person faint, her breath could knock someone out, and that wasn't even taking into account her near constant burping and flatulence. There was no denying it, in such an insanely short time Wendy had become the epitome of a slovenly spoiled hedonistic glutton. She stopped struggling to lift her enormous bare feet to stomp around, which sweat harder and stank worse than any other part of her body considering they were usually smotherd under all the flab of her legs. Relieved to be finished walking for now, she stood in place, panting, wheezing, gasping, belching, and farting up a storm, before she slammed her gargantuan fat rotund sweaty ass against the floor, making it jiggle like jello on steroids and cracking the tiles as she sat down on the floor, her legs sticking out so her oversized dirty sweaty bare feet were poking out in midair. Her ass seemed to rise even higher up when she sat, a good foot and a half taller than her head now. She belched again, incredibly loudly, making her cheeks jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning- <i>cough</i>- sweetheart!\" Mrs. Graham said, lovingly admiring her the blob sitting in front of her. Wendy mumbled a lethargic \"mrrph...gmornin...mstarvin..feed...feed..me..\" before burping yet again. Mr. Graham laughed. \"That's our growing girl!\" He said proudly. \"I think you'll really like what we planned today, Wendy! But you can't really appreciate it on an empty stomach now can ya, poor thing? You're just wasting away-\" Wendy cut her off with a loud simultaneous belch and fart, kicking her fat feet and demanding \"Then feed me!\"</span></div></div>",

They didn\u2019t want Crysta to follow a bad example, but Crysta didn't mind her weight gain. She was rather proud to be 80 lbs. and rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom and Dad want me to stop eating so much.\u201d Wendy started reaching into the fridge and took out a piece of leftover pizza. \u201cWho cares?

They were growing fatter in their dream, bulging out of their swimsuits as they were turning into whales, at least in their minds. What happened outside their dreams was even stranger: cheeks swelled to greater volume, stomachs stretched out, more buttons flew off their gowns. Wendy and Crysta didn\u2019t realize it, but they would wake up to an enormous surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, just before 7 AM, the Graham sisters finally awoke, but how?</span></div></div>",

Wendy was too preoccupied with her own increased girth to notice that her two classmates were also a little chunkier than normal. But she could be excused for missing her friends small change when her own belly was so noticeably larger and her school clothes were being strained to such uncomfortable tightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Danica, eyeing up Wendy's tummy. \"Looks like you enjoyed your weekend. Midnight feast or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy burped as she thought of all the food she had consumed over the last two days. \"Yeah, you could say that. It was the weirdest thing, my parents were just being total losers, telling me I shouldn't eat so much, and I said I wished they'd give me junk food for every meal. Then last night I woke up and the fridge was so full and I just ate soooo much oh my god it was SOOO good\" Wendy explained, her own gluttonous thoughts running away with her. \"And then for breakfast Ma made me cake! And lots of it. She's never done that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you normally had cake for breakfast?\" Tracy said a bit bemused. \"That's what all the other girls have. And why should you be eating less? Everybody loves a girl who can eat a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was about to dispute this weird comment when Danica suddenly opened her bag and pulled a dozen muffins out. \"Everybody knows you're the best eater in the school. And I couldn't finish my breakfast this morning so I brought leftovers for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah you can have mine too,\" said Tracy as she too opened her bag to reveal sweet treats. She dumped them onto Wendy, who immediately felt her large taut belly leap to attention with a mighty grumble. Putting sense and fullness aside, Wendy started to nibble on a muffin, watched on with something approaching awe by her two friends. What had happened here? Wendy seemed to have entered a world where gluttony was held up as a virtue, her perfect world! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Wendy was beginning to realise that she was enjoying food even more now that she seemed to have encouragement. Danica and Tracy were piling more and more cake into her hands and the nibbles were becoming larger bites, which were becoming whole muffins in one mouthful. Wendy's desire to consume every piece of food put near her was even more colossal then her rotund belly. In fact, Wendy pondered the possibility that if she had entered a world where attitudes food could change, maybe basic human biology could change too. Maybe things like stomach limits or sickness from over-eating were also a thing of the past. It certainly seemed that way as her stomach grew larger and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wendy chowed down on another muffin, the bus arrived...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bus ride to school was a little odd, but frankly everything that had happened recently was odd from Wendy's perspective. The boys on the bus seemed to fawn over her a little bit, like all of a sudden she as the hottest girl in school, whilst the girls talked to her like she was the leader of the pack, the numero uno. And like Tracy and Danica, the other girls on the bus gave her their breakfast leftovers, like peace offerings. Wendy knew she would normally feel at least a little full but today she was ravenous for anything she could lay her hands on. She would eat a giant sugared donut handed to her by one girl in the year below and before she could even swallow another girl would appear with a bacon roll, or a half-finished waffle, or some other fatty breakfast treat, and Wendy would greedily consume it with barely a second thought, and her stomach would grumble with desirous pangs regardless of her constant consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy quickly got used to keeping quiet about how odd her new world was and just eating, it seemed as if her biology was keeping track with her psychology, meaning that anything she wanted to eat, her body was suddenly able to handle it. The uniform she had squeezed herself into had ridden up into a belly shirt, a muffin top was plainly visible above the standard-school skirt, and though the clothes were generally unflattering Wendy's boobs were an impressive sight, somehow she had manage to grow enough to produce a line of cleavage that the school had presumably thought impossible when their designed the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at school she found, to her surprise, not that she allowed that shock to be noticeable, that first period was not a lesson but was in fact breakfast. Forty-five minutes out of the day which was dedicated to every student sitting in the canteen and filling themselves with as much food as possible. When Wendy first went to the counter she asked for ten rashers of bacon, ten sausages, four burger patties, five portions of fries and an entire pizza, but she found that she had finished all this within twenty minutes, and needed to go for seconds. This time she decided to go with all dessert, which she had bizarrely missed first time out, and found herself walking back with a tray laden with a mountain of cake and ice cream topped with whipped cream. She gorged herself, unaware of her friends sitting with her remarking on what an immense meal she had brought back, even for a well-known glutton such as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was simply incapable of feeling full, no matter how much food was forced into her mouth, (and she was forcing as much as seemed physically possible). Her belly stretched, her clothes grew tighter, her weight climbed, and yet, inside her body, there was no fullness. She just ate and ate and ate and ate and enjoyed and savoured and felt an almost orgasmic satisfaction and ate and consumed and ATE. But full? Never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so finally, after some astonishing number of plates, period one ended and period two was due to begin...</span></div></div>",

She was a bit surprised, because she knew there were other people on her bench before, but now they had all been pushed to the  neighboring benches. Had she really fattened sk much she took up more than a whole bench? Yes, yes she had. She smiled, and waddled to the double doors out to the hallway. She felt each of her sides graze the double width doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   By the time she reached the second period room, she had gained at the absolute least fifteen or twenty more pounds, due to dozens upon dozens of students gave her their leftovers. Though, she sort of got the impression that they got extra just for her, as evidenced by the seven three-decker cakes, nine full platters of cheeseburgers, and 14 entire pizzas (not counting the tons of spare slices, which must have equalled like 20 more). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She squeezed into the door to period 2, and squeezed... and squeezed.

But after looking out the window for a while, she saw it. A HUGE food festival. Signs saying \"DEEP FRIED CANDY\" and \"Bacon Cakes\" where everywhere. When the bus stopped, everyone wanted to get off, but none more than Wendy. Wendy was the first one off the bus and half-runned and half-waddled there. After seven hours of complete pigging out, you could spot immediate changes in Wendy's appearance. Her school clothes were unbelievably tight. They looked as if she took one more step they would burst apart. There was a huge tear along the side of her pants. Fat was spilling out of that tear. Fat was also spilling out of her shirt tear. \"No food limit and no food sickness is an advantage! Awesome!\" Wendy thought. Danica and Tracy were also noticeably larger than before. Their clothes weren't ripped but were very close to. After all the food from the festival the students were driven home. At the bus stop, Wendy said goodbye to Danica and Tracy and waddled home. Her mother was making a huge, greasy dinner for the three of them. Wendy went up to her and asked,\"Hey mom, what's for dinner? I'm hungry.\" \" Your favorite dear, chocalete lava fudge cake, deep-fried bacon, twinkies,brownies,three different kinds of cookies, and a huge side of potato chips\" said Wendy's mom. \"ok.\" Wendy went to nap on the couch while her mom finished dinner after getting a bunch of snacks from the pantry. She finished the snacks almost in an instant,napped and then woke up to the smell of a finished dinner.the table was creaking from the weight of all the food on it. The chairs ominously creaked as well as if to signal that they could break any minute. During the small period of time which Wendy was shoveling food down her throat, Wendy felt uncomfortably tight in her pants, so she tried to unbutton them. During the attempt, she thought,\"No, I'm gonna burst it.\" She swallowed her portion of the dinner and half way broke the button. She cheered. Both of her parents praised her.</span></div></div>",

Wendy pouted a little when she discovered she wasn't stuffed to the brim like she thought, but then she noticed something by her bed: a mini-fridge with a note on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Ms. Graham: your refrigerator should now be in fine working order. We thank you for your patronage. Sincerely, Silver Repairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had never had a min-fridge in her room before, (her parents wouldn't have it in order to control her eating), but she didn't question it and opened it to find a small collection of cakes and pies that she drooled over, then quickly gobbled. She felt her tummy stretch her nightgown as she finished and giggled as she patted it and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy! But I still don't feel full....\" Wendy usually filled up after a few desserts like that, but she was still feeling hungry. She walked over to her closet to change into her school uniform, a white buttoned t-shirt and pink plaid skirt, though they were both quite short on Wendy, exposing her belly and either just barely or not quite covering her white panties. \"Well, I guess that's still normal.\" Wendy liked how tight her clothes became as she got fatter, especially with the aforementioned exposure taking place. Just then, Wendy caught a whiff of something delicious. She bounded downstairs to find her mother cooking a huge stack of chocolate chip pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you got down here, sleepyhead,\" her mother told her. \"Did you get the note about the fridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy fidgeted with her red ponytail a bit. \"Yeah, mom, I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you must have also had your cakes and pies. Hope you still have room for breakfast.\" Now Wendy was truly confused. Just last night, her parents wanted to put a stop to her eating junk food, and this morning, her mother is making her pancakes. Wendy's belly gave a small rumble, letting her know to stop thinking and start eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings only got stranger after breakfast, though. After Wendy had her fill of pancakes, popping a button on her shirt in the process, she waddled out of the house to her bus stop, patting her overstuffed tummy all the way there. She then noticed two other girls doing the same thing at the stop. Wendy discovered they were both about as fat as she was, exposed bellies and panties included. She then noticed their hair: one girl had a long black low ponytail, like one of her best friends, Danica Yun. The other had medium-length blond pigtails, the same style as her other best friend, Tracey Smith. Wendy was shocked to find that they were indeed her two best friends, at double the size she remembered them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Wendy!\" The girls shouted in unison and waddled over to give their best friend a hug. Wendy embraced her two friends in the squishy hug, but wasn't sure what to do next.</span></div></div>",

She looked over her friends as they adjusted their skirts, which, like Wendy's, exposed their panties a little, though they didn't seem to care that much. Wendy noticed flashes of white around their rears each time they took a step, and their shirts rode up their bellies when they stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Wendy, you feel like going shopping after school?\" Danica asked. Wendy snapped out of her state of observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Wendy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Wendy? You seem a little off,\" Tracey replied. \"You sure you had enough to eat this morning?\" Of course she did, but Wendy didn't really know what \"enough\" was here. She was also a bit skeptical about her friends' new support of her eating habits, since they were a little concerned before. Ultimately, Wendy just ignored it and continued the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, Tracey. Hey, Danica, where's your sisters? They should be here soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, those little balls of energy can't get enough of my mom's cooking,\" Danica replied. \"They'll be here after they finish their seconds.\" Danica wasn't kidding when she said her sisters were balls of energy, though they were also balls of fat now. They came by the bus stop once Danica mentioned them, half bouncing and half rolling to their big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY DANI!\" Danica smiled at the nickname her little sisters gave her, and hugged them both. Lily and Carrie Yun were 6 year old identical twins who gained a penchant for their appetites and were rather chubby, at least that's how Wendy knew them. Here, they were little girls who were fat and round enough that they rolled like balls wherever they went. Both wore their hair in pigtails like Tracey, only they were much longer, reaching to their fat rears, both clad in white panties with pink flowers. The twins wore the same uniforms as the older girls, except smaller, completing their identical appearance. The only way to tell them apart was their bellies: Lily had freckles around her navel shaped like a star, and Carrie's were shaped like a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you two had a filling breakfast,\" Danica teased, tickling and patting their stuffed tummies. The twins giggled and did the same to each other. As the girls started laughing, their bus arrived and the five of them walked on, or in the twins' case, bounced on. Wendy noticed that the rest of the girls on the bus, as well as at the school, had all apparently doubled in weight or greater, showing off their bellies and panties as if it were an everyday occurrence. Younger girls like Lily and Carrie had also become little balls of fat, rolling around and having a good time. (The Norton Girls' School worked with girls of all ages from kindergarten to high school age, as there weren't many people in the city.) What's more, the bus served the girls donuts, vending machines filled with junk food were everywhere, and the cafeteria served full breakfasts filled with fattening food that all the girls, even those like Wendy and her friends that stuffed themselves to the brim earlier, were eager to chow down on. Wendy couldn't believe it, but she was too excited to stuff herself more to care. After the meal, the girls heaved themselves to their classrooms, with the twins heading to the area for younger girls. In both cases, snacks would be provided to satisfy, though they'd be too stuffed to accept right now.</span></div></div>",

This is intro to desserts and pastries. You know that silly.\u201d Danica said with chuckle. Wendy just went along with it. The class consisted of trying different desserts and studying various kinds of desserts. It was the best class Wendy had ever had. In fact the whole school day had been the best school day she ever had. All her classes were about cooking, eating, and food. Her classes covered how to use butter more in meals, what things could be deep fried, as well as a breakdown of the standardized mcdonalds menu. Plus there was a 2 hour lunch period which Wendy happily took advantage of. She spent the bus ride home massaging her bloated belly, eating various snacks they had on the bus, and recapping her day with her friends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her classmates were all stuffed and happy as they rode home on the bus, eating snacks or comparing bellies that bounced as the school bus did. Occasionally, a button that managed to stay on during the school day would pop off a girl's shirt or a skirt's zipper would break as well, only adding praise for that girl. Wendy couldn't help but giggle at these developments, as did her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see if my mom can give us a ride to the mall,\" Wendy told Tracey and Danica after getting off the bus. Since Norton was so small, the nearest big attractions were a city over in Seattle. As the girls waddled, or in Lily and Carrie's case, rolled home, Wendy thought about what else might have changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Wendy got home, she went to see her little sister Crysta, who'd been sick for the last couple of days. She was the same age as Lily and Carrie and their best friend, whom they'd missed the past week. Like the twins, Crysta was initially a big eater and merely chubby, and had become a big ball of fat in this new world. She was laying on her bed watching TV and eating cookies with a sense of complete abandon. Wendy laughed a bit as her sister's tummy grew out of her pink nightgown and stretching her matching panties. She patted Crysta on her hair bun to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Crysta.\" \"Hi, Wendy.\" \"What're you watching?\" \"Sam and Cat. I mean, the girls who play them.\" Wendy then saw something rather shocking: both Jennette McCurdy and Ariana Grande appeared to have tripled in weight, looking somewhat fatter than Wendy herself, much like the girls in her town. Both actresses also looked rather content with their fat, standing rather proudly. They'd also pat their bellies absentmindedly every now and then. The girls' mother Mary then came in with another bowl of cookies and a gallon of strawberry milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I brought more snacks. Oh, Wendy, just give me about an hour and I can drive you girls to the mall.\" As she set down the new bowl, Wendy began asking more questions in her head about the new world, such as if every actress had suddenly gotten huge. After eating and drinking her fill, she checked the Internet and saw that the younger actresses out there had gotten fatter, and it extended to fictional characters, too, such as Kim Possible and Sailor Moon, despite the shows having been finished for years. Although Wendy still enjoyed this new fat-positive world, she had more questions than ever now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she changed into a yellow tank top and blue knee-length skirt, she wondered what to do first. The new Super Sumo Sisters game was coming out at the mall (Super Smash Bros. still existed, but this was a side series beginning with this installment.), but she was still very curious about what had happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy started to move her searches back further in time, looking up actresses and singers famous at the turn of the century, then in the 90's, finding the same thing: famous women, and apparently all women, were much fatter than they had been the day before. How long had this been going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer search was cut short when her mother called her to drive her to the mall. Putting her questions on hold, Wendy bounced out to the car. Stopping to pick up Tracey and Danica first, her mom drove the three to the mall. Handing a wad of bills to Wendy, she said she'd be back in a couple hours to pick them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere we should go first?\u201d Tracey asked as the three went in through the side entrance near the parking garage. But Wendy didn't hear her, because she was too busy being surprised by the sudden appearance of a food court at one end of the V-shaped mall. Wasn't the food court always in the middle of the building?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then they passed a kiosk with a floorplan of the mall, and Wendy saw there were actually three food courts here: the old one in the middle (which seemed a lot larger now), and one at each end of the V's legs. Was eating really that constant in this world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could question it, Wendy felt her own stomach growl again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, before we do any shopping can we grab a snack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a surprise!\u201d Danica said good-naturedly. \u201cYeah, let's load up on fuel first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was in the mood for some fried chicken, pleasantly surprised to see an option on the menu for a basket of nothing but chicken skin. Grabbing one of those, a basket of chicken strips, and a bowl of gravy for dipping, she found a table and waited for her friends to get their own food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was digging in Wendy looked around. At the table next to her was a middle-aged mother with a pair of daughters who looked to be 7 or 8. The smaller of the two girls, an almost literal ball of doughy flesh, was moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMooOOOooom! I want to go to the toy store.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're not going anywhere until you finish your ice cream and cheesecake, young lady. Keep eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the girl was a giant sundae, something Wendy would hesitate to tackle. Sitting next to her, her sister (who had to be at least twice as round as her, though was apparently the same age) was scooping up the last remnants of her own ice cream and cheesecake concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm finished, mom!\u201d She said triumphantly. \u201cCan I have some French fries now? With mustard and ketchup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, baby.\u201d The mother's mood warmed up instantly, and as she got up to buy more food the fatter girl turned to her sister and stuck her tongue out. Clearly the mother's favoritism was well-established, as was the reason for it. When the mother returned it was with a salad bowl of French fries painted red and yellow and a 128-oz shake. The fatter girl dug in greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's my little piglet,\u201d the mother said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Wendy's friends came back and started eating Tracey repeated her earlier question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you want to go first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just got some new things last month, and you've got a great thing going with your belly hanging out,\u201d Tracey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm jealous,\u201d Danica added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Wendy stalled, caught off guard by the sudden realization of what should have been obvious: that revealing clothing was the norm for women in this world. But she had already said she wanted new clothes, so she need another reason. \u201cMy shirts are getting tight around the arms and boobs. I don't want something uncomfortable, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls nodded in understanding, and as Wendy went back to eating her attention was brought back to the neighboring table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, Michelle. It shouldn't take you this long to eat a simple sundae.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just not hungry, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don't have energy to eat, you don't have energy to play with new toys, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can finish her food, mom!\u201d The fatter sister chirped happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you can, piggy,\u201d Again, the abrupt change in tone, this time paired with an affectionate pat on the head. \u201cBut your sister needs to learn fat doesn't just magically appear. Beauty and size are things you need to work at and earn, if you're going to have them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, the smaller sister scooped up another massive bite of ice cream. As Wendy and her friends ate their own food, the girl slowly whittled down her snack until all that was left was a melted sludge of ice cream, chocolate syrup and whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK.\u201d The mother conceded, sounding annoyed it took so long. \u201cWe can go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was time for Wendy and her friends to get going too. Heaving themselves up and letting their swollen bellies lead the way, the trio made their way to Express.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, welcome to Express,\u201d a cashier said, looking up from hanging a set of skirts. Wendy gaped briefly when she saw the woman: close to 500 pounds, Wendy estimated (actually it was 650; the girl had no frame of reference for sizes this large), she was wearing a mini-skirt that not only didn't cover her bright pink panties, but which seemed designed to draw attention to the fact that they provided no modesty, and a blue top that snuggled around her breasts and did nothing else. The woman's belly, cascading before her to cover her crotch and knees, was bare to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the skin she was showing it seemed odd she would work in a clothing store, but as Wendy looked around, still orienting herself to how things worked in the world, she noticed the mannequins and blown-up pictures of models lining the walls. Exhibitionism seemed to be the height of fashion; rather than cover up and emphasize the entire body, shirts, pants, and skirts were designed to frame and accentuate whatever part of a woman's body was the biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Wendy that was the belly, and as she modeled several tops for her friends she picked up on what they expected her to already know: her belly was her best feature, and she was supposed to let it hang out for all the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got on the same wavelength as the new world she inhabited, Wendy started to have fun trying out new styles based around the idea that she not only could bare her midriff, but that she should. She got into it, and the realization that not only was she given a world to indulge her penchant for junk food but that her stock among her peers might even go up as she became more gluttonous and bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould her life get any better? What if...</span></div></div>",

For the moment, Wendy was fine with her outfit being tight, even if her panties were peeking out. As for her friends, who were splitting a pizza looking about 2 feet around, Danica's pink t-shirt and jean skirt were riding up a bit with every bite, and Tracey's belly had long since burst the zippers off her red hoodie and miniskirt. Neither of them were overly concerned, however. Even the little girls next to them had very liberal clothes: both wore little blue dresses that barely reached their belly buttons. Wendy noticed the smaller one finally catch up to her sister by finishing her dessert and actually started eating out of her sister's bowl of fries, returning the stuck out tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooom! Michelle's stealing my fries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, if you wanted your own, just tell me, don't steal Allison's, okay?\" Michelle rolled her eyes, but nodded. Allison eventually relented and gave the rest to her sister, looking a bit tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, Mom, she can have them, I'm full.\" Michelle finished them off, finally satisfied and looking as round as her sister. The mother sighed and took care of the trash, her daughters bouncing off their seats and slowly rolling off after their mother, heading in the toy store's direction. The trio of older girls looked amused and couldn't help but giggle at the sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the trio finished, they slowly walked to the game store to pick up Super Sumo Sisters: many of the female video game characters from Nintendo that Wendy recognized were present, and all were quite fat, rolling or bouncing to get around if they wanted just as girls did in this new world. This extended to their respective main series and to others by companies such as Sony or Microsoft, with some females getting their own spinoffs if they didn't already have them. Their wardrobe was similarly altered to those in the real world: one way or another, the girls' bellies were apparently always exposed, and their panties seemed to be as well, which Wendy had to take note of looking at the rest of the female shoppers. Wendy noticed something else that was strange: anything focusing on a male character wasn't altered: they were virtually the same as they were before. Men in the real world didn't change, either, nor did they eat the same food as women. They ate and dressed as they regularly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy felt this was a lot to process, but was too excited to have her game to care. After making her purchase, she and her friends left for another store.</span></div></div>",

One thing that the different styles had in common is that they all specialized in keeping a generous amount of flesh exposed, primarily the belly. Skirts and dresses had become more commonplace, possibly because they were easier to move in, and because panties could be exposed more easily. Underwear was displayed more prominently and clerks would actually recommend different styles depending on the accompanying clothing. Definitely an unusual fashion statement even for Wendy, but little girls seemed to enjoy it greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird,\" she muttered to herself. Far more had changed than Wendy realized, but ultimately, she wasn't particularly concerned. Overall, this new world seemed to be an improvement, with all the extra food and fattening (health wasn't an issue). It also looked more inviting to females in general: the media was at least more equal. \"Well, I guess this is my life now.\" Wendy decided not to question what had happened to change things so drastically and try to enjoy life. She looked around, seeing Tracey find a new short sleeved hoodie and Danica looking at young girls' panties as gifts for her sisters' birthday. Wendy made her way to a section of tube tops and eventually found a blue one matching her skirt, giggling with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter meeting up with her friends, Wendy decided to just take a look at some of the girls shopping around. A group of apparently goth girls popped open their shirts to try on new ones (only girls allowed and could undress at any time in the store). Michelle and Allison, the sisters from the food court, had rolled in and started looking at panties with their mother close behind holding a couple of toys. To Wendy's surprise, her mother had walked in with Crysta bouncing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy!\" Crysta came over to hug her big sister, looking quite confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I thought Crysta still needed until Sunday to go anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, her fever was gone and she started to roll around more today,\" Mary told her older daughter. \"I figured she's earned a bit of time outside the house.\" Crysta rolled to the section for younger girls, with Mary following after her. Eventually, Crysta picked out a petticoat skirt and wanted to hang out with Wendy for a bit. Mary accepted, deciding to find some cosmetics. \"Just keep your phone handy, sweetie,\" she told Wendy. \"I'll let you know when we should meet up or leave.\" The younger girls parted ways with Mary and headed off to explore the mall some more.</span></div></div>",

Wendy's face flushed and stayed that way until she caught the overwhelming scent of chocolate. She and her friends and sister soon found themselves in front of Choco-halla, a confectionery specializing as a chocolatier. Machines were set up all around to create the perfect assortments for the customers. A bar was also set up with sweet drinks on sale. Wendy noticed Crysta had quickly rolled into the shop and started guzzling a glass of strawberry milk, as well as the girl working behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls, what'll you have?\" The girl was one of Wendy's classmates, Ai Oshiro. Ai was once probably the smallest girl Wendy knew but she too had become fat in this new world, going from about 85 lbs. to likely around 300, outweighing even Wendy. She now resembled a sumo wrestler, with a prodigious belly bursting from her pink shirt. Her black skirt did little to cover her cream colored panties, and her hair was tied in a tight topknot. Ironically, she had no interest in Sumo, but she did like American football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever's good, Ai,\" Danica piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats on the job, Ai!\" Tracey shouted after sitting. Ai flushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, it was a tough process. I'm glad I made it. Oh, and Wendy, your sister's first drink is on me. I heard she was sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, Ai,\" Wendy said. She was once again taken aback by the new, fatter Ai, but that was mainly because she was so thin before. Regardless, Wendy joined the girls in taking a break from shopping to take in some coffee and milk. The beverages left them too full for candy, however, but Ai was invited to a sleepover at Wendy's for the next night as they left.</span></div></div>",

As Wendy looked around, she once again saw fatter versions of young actresses and songstresses she knew strewn throughout the store. Not much besides that changed about them: the quality of their work remained the same, something Wendy definitely could appreciate. She spent a few minutes sampling some music and doing some light dancing. Her shaking left her panties exposed for the duration. Tracy poked her during the dancing, laughing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who're you trying to fool, Wendy?\" she asked with a grin. \"You know you're no good at dancing. Remember my 13th birthday party?\" Wendy thought back and recalled when she bumped into her friends while trying to dance to a song. The strange thing about it, however, was that when she remembered, she noticed Tracy and Danica were both fat like her at that party. She knew, or thought she knew, that they had only been fat for this one day. Wendy started to question other things: she thought a bit more, and the memory of more parties came back, but like the first, her friends were fat in each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....\" Wendy then flashed back to last night and what her parents told her, realizing that was the only such memory of her life. Nowhere else did anything like that come up, and Wendy's memory was better than most, meaning last night was indeed a dream. Wendy couldn't believe it, but the world she lived in now was the real deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Wendy, you feeling alright?\" Tracy waved a hand in front of Wendy's face, bringing Wendy back to her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am now, Tracy.\" Wendy went back to her dancing, earning questionable looks from Tracy and Danica, who'd joined while holding plushes of Pok\u00e9mon alongside Crysta. Unlike the older girls, Crysta didn't mind Wendy's dancing and joined her sister, bumping in time to the music. With the song stuck in their heads, the sisters kept bumping after Mary met up with them and all the way to the car. Wendy bumped more to the fact that she was living in a fat female-friendly world now, and she could indulge without worry. What made this day even better: tomorrow was Saturday and she was without homework. Thus, Wendy was free to do whatever.</span></div></div>",

So, unnerving I fact that Wendy could no longer handle in. She bolted off her stool bacon still in her mouth, sprinted through the hall way crashing out of the house. Her eyes adjusted to realize something had changed drastically. <br>\r\n     The roads and every thing man made was the same but the plants, trees and dirt were distinctly different in a strange way. Wendy walked up to a tree and touched its bark. The bark was chocolate, Wendy grabbed a chunk of bark pulling it off the tree trunk. Wendy careful took a bite out of the chuck of bark and then moaned in pleasure it was unbelievable. Wendy went to grab more realizing that the wood underneath the bark was just normal wood but it was seeping out tons  of maple syrup even if though was not a maple Tree. Wendy licked the stick syrup off her had.<br>\r\n     \u201cAh, I see you just wanted some fresh food I get it.\u201d Her mother trotted up to some grass taking it off the ground and eating it. \u201cBoy I sure do love sugar candy. Oh, and before you forget I did pack launch for you so once your done eating your all natural meal come in and get it.\u201d Her mother walked back into the house grabbing a flower made of Doritos. Wendy was still confused looking around she saw some of the neighbors out eat the plants and gathering flowers too eat. Most of these people were the same weight but it still freaked out Wendy. She walked back inside grabbing her back pack and her lunch box which was a suitcase on wheels, why not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     Wendy waddled straight to her bus stop past all the candied and junk food-ivied plants. She saw her two best friends eating like animals on a near by bush that was made of overly buttered and salted popcorn. \u201cOh hey Wendy!\u201d Mumbled Danica Yuen Through all the popcorn in her mouth. Danica Yuen was a Japanese American. The bubbly girl had been friends with Wendy since kindergarten. Unlike Wendy though she was not it to gaining staying fit. She wore a small flower hair clip in her raven black hair which reached her shoulders and had large breast already but now unusually there was a food baby under those large double D breast. Right beside Danica was Tracy Smith a blond girl who had just moved to town and hit it of with the two other girls. She had not been so luck as Danica in the breast department but made up for it in the ass department. She also had a food baby to show the world.<br>\r\n      \u201cHowdy girl,\u201d said Tracy mouth full of popcorn. <br>\r\n      \u201cHi guys how\u2019s your day? Eating much?\u201d Wendy asked.<br>\r\n      \u201cJust getting started,\u201d Danica uncharacteristically. <br>\r\n      \u201cHey guys you wanna skip school and hit the town,\u201d Wendy asked because she wanted to get used to her new world but secretly.<br>\r\n      \u201cMmmm... we\u2019ll miss lunch, but it would be more fun... sure I\u2019m in.\u201d Said Tracy <br>\r\n      \u201cWhy not,\u201d said Danica.</span></div></div>",

Therefore we give you this key to have access to our house so that you can eat our food whenever you get hungry -  even at night.  We have already prepared a feast for you but do not hesitate too get more and you can even wake one of us up to go get more food,  if you need anymore\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile reading through this note Wendy grew more ravenous and as soon as she finished it she opened the door and ran straight for the kitchen.  In the kitchen she saw the most beautiful sight ever every ounce of space in the kitchen was filled out with junk food. It mainly consisted of fattening sweets like doughnuts but there was some thought out dishes like a cheese cake wider in diameter than Wendy's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starred salivating at the thoughts of being able to stuff herself silly and her stomach reminded her she needed to eat NOW! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wendy thought to herself and her question was quickly answered as the door swung open to reveal Elaine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine was always the skinniest of the two ever since they were kids. While Wendy loved watching movies and reading comics, Elaine loved dancing and playing Basketball. This helped Elaine always be one of the skinniest girls in their school, even getting jealous looks from some of the cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not the Elaine that greeted Wendy. This Elaine looked like she hadn't exercised a day in her life and was around 430lbs by Wendy's guess. Her face once slim and angular was now soft and round. Her arms looked like logs and her thighs were the same. Her clothes clung tightly to her giant body with a large part of her belly poking out of the space between her vest and her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Wendy.\" Elaine said yawning and rubbing one of her eyes. \"Here for another nighttime feasts. Come on in.\" She stepped aside to allow Wendy to walk in.\"</span></div></div>",

None of Elaine's dance mats or basketballs were anywhere to be found and in family photos Elaine always looked incredibly fat. \"Umm.. Elaine, where did you put your dance mats?\" Wendy asked as Elaine licked chocolate from around her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what?\" She replied puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dance mats. You're the best dancer in the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine laughed at that. \"Haha, that's funny. I've never owned any dancing stuff. Who'd want to waste time moving when I could be eating and watching movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess you're right.\" Wendy said a bit weirded out by these events. \"Am I dreaming?\" She asked herself aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not.
