Where am I? The last thing I remember was helping Mario,Luigi and Toad fight off King Koopa's cronies next thing I knew I was talking through a strange hole that popped out of nowhere can you please tell me where I am?\" She demanded a little annoyed you are forced to answer this time as there's nothing more fearful than a hot angry video game Princess looking at you that way! \"You're in my living room Princess Peach.\" She arches a eyebrow \"Princess Peach? You must have me confused with someone else I'm Princess Toadstool of the Mushroom....\" You interrupt her gently \"I know who you are Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom right?\" She nods apparently shocked \"Yes but how did you know that? I never seen you before are you one of King Koopa's....\" You shake your head \"No I'm not a henchmen or underling of Bowser aka King Koopa to you there's nothing to fear from me Princess Toadstool.\" You stand up and offer your hand after a while she smiles and extends her own hand \"Okay then I feel you're telling the truth so I trust you..wait you said I'm in your living room? Then this means I'm no longer in the Mushroom Kingdom my friends the Marios and Toad they were captured by King Koopa or what was you called him...Bowser you.... Ohh I should have introduced myself I'm sorry about that what is your name?\" You tell her and looking around in awe at her 3D surreal surroundings(being from a hand drawn 2d cartoon world must be normal and dull to her you weren't sure how anyone could stand it and the Mario cartoons did have the lamest and cheesiest animation around)  Princess Toadstool asks you </span></div></div>",

You were kinda a stickler for 100%ing games so it took longer than you wanted to, especially with needing to teach the princess everything about the game.

Are you serious!? You only won because you picked up like every coin in the level and took all the Green Stars out from under my nose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, a princess doesn't lie. I've won here, and that means...\" Toadstool scooted closer to you on the couch, her face now mere inches away from yours \"...We're going to play a <i>punishment game</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to feel about this but you decided to go along.

Was she really into this and you just never caught on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she took off her sparkling red heels you caught a whiff of her feet. Clearly the smell has been contained in them for quite a while. They didn't exactly smell bad but there was definitely a hint of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a couple seconds did you realize you were staring at her smooth perfectly pale looking feet and immediately looked back up to see Toadstool looking back at you with a huge smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What is it? Is there something...that caught your attention?\" she said, putting her right foot close to your face and wiggling her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her red painted toenails for a few moments and realized that the sweaty smell from before was much stronger now, yet...you didn't dislike it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes didn't seem to have that much toe jam in-between them but there were tiny bits here and there that were hardly noticeable. For some reason this didn't bother you, her feet were certainly beautiful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly raise your hands to grab onto her right foot to hold it into place. It was so soft...you almost wanted to press your face into it but kept your cool as best you could. Maybe if Toadstool would be into it...should you ask...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping yourself out of your trance you gave one last look at the princess' face, who was staring back at you with the same curious expression you had. Clearly she was just as invested in this little game as you were. Her face and body were quite beautiful, you could even tell under her huge dress. You could see quite a bit of her leg which was a rare sight to see, and God were they amazing. Sadly you couldn't see far enough to her thighs...but maybe soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, back to her feet. Deciding not to stall any further, you stuck your tongue out towards the sole of her foot and...wait...is that little specks of dirt on her sole? Oh lord, why were you getting turned on by this sweaty, smelly, and slightly dirtied princess' foot? You wanted to taste it so bad, press it to your face, kiss it, everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tongue made contact with the hot sole of the beautiful princess and you couldn't stop licking, you liked it way too much! You wanted more! You looked up while still licking to see the princess with her eyes closed and a smile on her face, she seemed to be quietly humming to herself, it was quite cute. The taste of sweat was absolutely delicious, you couldn't get enough. You wanted to clean her whole foot, both of her feet! You couldn't believe you ended up enjoying this \"punishment\" game so much...</span></div></div>",

You could feel your pants tighten up, and you wanted so bad for the princess about to sit on your face to touch it as well, but you knew your duty. Your place. Under her bottom. That was where you belonged for however long she sees fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, w-wait Prin-phhmmmmphhh!\" before you could even pretend you didn't want to do this you were cut off by the princess' curvy and juicy bottom coming in contact with your face. The many layered dress made her colossal ass seem even larger and comfier. It felt like a hundred pillows were surrounding your face at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess snuggled and grinded her butt up against your face until you were perfectly centered between her balloon-like butt cheeks. \"Ah...now that's a comfy seat...I wonder what these cushions are made of? Heehee, I could just sit here all day~\" the petite yet thick princess sighed to herself. Yep, no one else was in the room with her. She was sitting alone playing video games with nothing but a comfy cushion to satisfy her sore bottom. And your face was that cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool paid you no mind, she didn't even talk to you for the next three hours you were under her. Truth be told, you loved it. You face and nostrils filled with her perfume-y scent. Yet there was also a strange but intoxicating smell coming from within the princess as well. It made you want to be underneath her forever... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only noises you could hear were the occasional button clicking from the controller Toadstool was using and what seemed to be Toadstool's stomach growling. You felt so close to her for these past few hours, so intimate. You could feel your face almost becoming one with the contours of the princess' thighs and butt. Occasionally Peach would lean over and put her elbow on your crotch which made things seem torturous. You had so much buildup and you didn't know what to do. The only thing you wanted was to make Princess Toadstool happy.</span></div></div>",

Are you alright? I'm really sorry about that but you know I was just playing with you when I said...\" But you nodded as you accepted her hand as she pulled you to your feet <br>\r\n\"Yeah I know Princess although I must admit your undercarriage Er behind is rather big and you're rather heavy it's no wonder you wear a dress that big and wide.\" Toadstool giggled <br>\r\n\"Well I'm rather what's the word quite busty underneath this dress but don't tell Mario or Luigi it will be our little secret okay?\" She whispered as she went to the bathroom coming back with a wet washcloth and began wiping off your sweated face \"There is that better?\" She asked once she finished up you nodded yes and once more she apologized then took a look at the game system she had been playing \"That game is rather unique Mario,Luigi and me looks very different and why do our voices sound so....\" <br>\r\n\"It's the game develops and voice actors Princess or rather Nintendo they have total control over what to put in the games and how characters and levels are designed stuff like that want me to explain how Mario and your Mushroom Kingdom was created?\" You asked Toadstool eagerly nodded sitting down on the couch<br>\r\n\"Yes! I'd love to hear it!\" Clearing your throat you began<br>\r\n \"Okay well as far as I know Mario was first thought of here in America but he originated in Japan,a country far to the east he was thought of by video game developer Shigeru Miyamoto and made his first official appearance in a 1981 arcade game called Donkey Kong where he was known as Jumpman and had to rescue his girlfriend Pauline from the giant ape Donkey Kong following this he next appeared in the 1983 game Mario Bros. which happened to be Luigi's first appearance as well,a few more appearances mostly cameos and then you know what happened next.\" <br>\r\n\"No what?\" The princess asked eagerly <br>\r\n\"The game Super Mario Bros in 1985 debuted(you showed her a copy of the original cartiage and she looked at it interestedly)where you,the Mushroom Kingdom and King Koopa or Bowser appeared and the rest they say is history....\" Toadstool seemed very interested and amazed as she began examining the other Nintendo cartiages <br>\r\n\"That's very fascinating_. But who are all these other characters?\" <br>\r\n\"They're a few other video game characters from Nintendo most were also created by Shigeru Miyamoto the elf character is Link(you gesture to the Legend of Zelda game),a fantasy series,the space bounty hunter is Samus called Metriod,the little pink fluff ball is called Kirby,the fox and the other animals are Starfox and there are a couple others but I can't think of them right now.\" Toadstool nodded as she examined the last batch of games by Nintendo <br>\r\n\"And who is the blue guy with the sneakers? Is he a Nintendo character too?\" You shake your head <br>\r\n\"No not really he's Sonic the Hedgehog and he was created by Sega Genesis one of Nintendo's direct rivals to compete with Mario who at the time was one of the most popular video game characters at the time in fact he still is the best known.\" Toadstool's blue Pac-Man eyes lit up <br>\r\n\"Really?\" You nodded <br>\r\n\"Yeah Mario's well known the world over! And so are you anyway since you had your fun am I off the hook Princess?\" <br>\r\n\"Toadstool pondered this and replied.....</span></div></div>",

The Marios,Toad and I do happen to wander throughout the Mushroom World so television and movies aren't exactly a foreign thing to me! Hmmmmm these are some odd titles Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Mighty Morphin Power Rangers? SpongeBob SquarePants?

Ohh this looks promising! They made a movie about the Marios?\" She called over her shoulder you nodded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah back in the year 1993 some movie studio signed a contract with Nintendo to make the film I forgot I had it and barely ever watch it anyway!\" You confess Toadstool gets a confused look on her face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It's a film about the Marios after all and I'd really like to watch it may I please?\" She asked bringing it over when she walked back over <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay but the plot's a bit confusing and it's not exactly a fan favorite but don't say I didn't warn you......\" You said but she didn't pay any mind instead she plopped her royal rump on the couch <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh who cares about what your human movie critics think? I'm the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom! Anyway can you please fix us some popcorn and get a couple of sodas? If I'm going to watch this then I want it to be like in a real movie theatre!\" Toadstool said you rolled your eyes secretly typical of her to act like a good ole girly girl but luckily your folks had a huge built in theater in the basement you invited the princess to watch the film there while serving her the popcorn and soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later the Mario Bros Movie ends as you both get up from the two seats as you switch the really large widescreen TV off and take the DVD out of the DVD Player <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" You asked the princess fumed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a very odd film! It made no sense whatsoever it was nothing like my Mushroom Kingdom and the Marios certainly weren't like themselves,Toad is a mushroom retainer not a human rock and roll guy,the Goombas aren't supposed to be giant reptile creatures they're mushrooms and where were the Koopa Troopas at? And why did they make Luigi really young? Why does King Koopa appear to look human? What's with the parallel dinosaur world and why did they change my name to Princess Daisy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed \"I told you it wasn't a very good film princess the directors and writers who made the film are mostly to blame they kept changing things around originally it was going to be exactly like the game until the two husband and wife directors kept insisting to make a endless amount of changes eventually the film was way over budget and the cast and crew eventually just went along with it needless to say the ending results was what you just saw.\" You explained still Toadstool looked highly disappointed but quickly got over it <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well although it wasn't what I expected it was only a movie thank you for showing it to me.\" She said as she prepared to head out back upstairs what did she want to do now?</span></div></div>",

I just want to have enough say in that that I don't become your slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how about I make up for my... discretion... by letting you become my prince?\" Toadstool asked as she stood up, turned around, and lifted up her long skirt. Her large lovely rump was barely covered by a some rather plain white panties. As she shook her hips, Toadstool slowly pulled down her panties, until they were down by her knees.<i> 'Luckily for me, the mushroom kingdom is and will always remain a matriarchy.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped before you asked, \"Are you controlling how aroused I am now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that would be insulting to me. But when we begin to have sex, I'll just make sure you are able to cum more than once, if you allow me to,\" Toadstool answered as she slowly turned around, letting you see her glistening pussy. \"So if you put your member in me, I'll make a royal decree that you will be a prince of the Mushroom Kingdom. My Mushroom Kingdom, not the one in that video game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, not wanting to let her get disappointed if you cummed earlier than you expected..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulled down her panties and stepped out of them. Toadstool then reached behind herself and undid her red sash. Her next step was to pull her dress forward, thus leaving her in nothing, save her crown and her bra, which covered a fairly large bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took off her bra, picked up her panties, and tossed both onto you head. After you took both off of yourself, you couldn't help, but sniff both. Toadstool's scent aroused you even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem?\" Toadstool asked. You looked and saw that she was lying on the couch, posing in an erotic manner.</span></div></div>",

Hurry up and get over here please I can't wait to try this!\" Toadstool said a bit too excitably you nearly gasped this was her first time? She didn't even make a secret attempt with either of the Mario Bros of all people? The princess seemed to read your thoughts as she said \"Yes it so happens that I never experienced anything like....sex...before....\" She said with a serious blush on her face you still just stood there until she looked at you sternly \"Well aren't you going to take your clothes off? If we're going to do this I want to do it properly.\" Toadstool said getting more anxious so slowly wondering if you were also doing the right thing as this also was your first time with a girl much less a cartoon princess took off your clothes until you were in your underwear to which the Mushroom Princess pointed out giggling \"Go on take them off too come on!\" Finally you did and to your surprise the princess jumped right on top of you and shoved you onto the couch hard fortunately she wasn't that heavy  then she gave the cutest giggle you ever heard \"Oh this is going to be really exciting for me! Okay go ahead and put your member into my.....vagina.... go on.....\" She ordered grinning widely you could tell she was both enjoying her domination over you and getting really turned on your pole was in fact getting really hard as a rock at the mere sight of her lustful,glorious body which to you was a thousands times sexier compared to her video game counterpart Princess Peach! You immediately got to work and as expected Princess Toadstool gasped out-loud as she felt both the slight pain but gasped even more as the pleasure overcame her \"Ohhhhhhhhh that feels really weird....but I-I like it.....ohhhhhhhhh do it again,AGAIN!\" The Mushroom Princess was really getting turned on and she was soon on top of you moaning \"MORE,MORE GIVE ME MORE! I WANT TO EXPERIENCE IT ALL!\" You did as she requested and her gasps got louder as did her screams of pleasure \"Ohhhhhhhhhh this is amazing! I never felt this way before!\" Finally once you finished Toadstool got off of you as you begin putting back on your clothes but realized you were so engrossed with the beautiful naked princess you forgot to cum but it didn't matter anyway as she seemed satisfied enough she also seemed to rather not want to put on her dress back on \"Well that was very fun! I have to do that again with one of the Marios once my kingdom is safe,just kidding you're a lot cuter than Mario or Luigi could ever be.\" Toadstool said as her bright blue Pac-Man like eyes glared sweetly at you <br>\r\n\"So...so you weren't lying when you said I was going to be a Prince of the Mushroom Kingdom?\" You asked curiously she nodded eagerly <br>\r\n\"Not just a prince but also my husband!\" You nearly fell over in shock at what she just said <br>\r\n\"WHAT??? ME....YO....you're kidding right?\" To which Princess Toadstool said truthfully.....</span></div></div>",

You're even royalty that has power and can do more than anyone else, but I have to refuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool paused. After a few moments, she asked in a flat tone, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I don't think I have any desire to. You're a princess from a kingdom in another world. i'm a normal guy in the real world. I don't think it can work out,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to face you, Toadstool took a few deep breaths before she said, \"We can work it out. If you become a prince, we can put you through some training. Going by how you were in the video game and our... session, you are a quick learner..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you shook your head, Toadstool said, \"I guess I have no choice. If you continue to refuse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to trace her lips with a finger as she added, \"I'll give you a special kiss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked as you shook your head once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Toadstool shrugged before she rushed at you. She put  her arms under yours and grabbed the back of your head and began to kiss you on the lips. You let out a chuckle... until you began to feel a little bit tired and more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to push her away, but she seemed to take as an invitation to put more and more of her feelings into the kiss. She began to rub her body against yours. Due to the fact you only had your shirt on,she seemed to try her best to make it seem like her pussy lips were kissing your dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she kissed you, the more you felt drained by her and the harder your dick got. Eventually, your hands stopped trying to push her away and began to grope her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your hard member entered Toadstool's vagina, which seemed to also act as a energy drainer. Especially when you cummed inside of her. Then for a second time. Then a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you were only standing up because she held you up. Still kissing you, Toadstool chuckled as she gently put you on the floor.</span></div></div>",

See my mushroom people? I told you I'd find a suitor sooner than later and here he is!\" She said happily to her loyal and royal subjects but Toad,her main guardian and Mushroom Retainer spoke up from beside her <br>\r\n\"We're really happy for you Princess but what about the Mario Bros? I mean surely I thought you were going to.....\" Toadstool's smile faded a bit <br>\r\n\"Well maybe at one time I possibly did consider marrying one of the Mario Bros,Mario especially but since they left back into Brooklyn  but since I met my new young handsome friend in the Real World and he's about my age  I sort of fell deeply for him and he also fell deeply for me! Isn't that right my handsome friend?\" She giggled cutely giving you a playful wink you had no choice but to nod <br>\r\n\"And I suppose this was the same guy who also informed you that you and the Marios aren't nothing but made up pixels of imagination?\" Toad grumbled folding his arms several of the other people muttered and whispered to one another the princess frowned at him <br>\r\n\"Now Toad I already told you it's no big deal we should be happy that millions of people around the world enjoy watching our show and playing our games(She leaned forward towards you and whispered \"I actually did tell them the truth about that other 'Mushroom Kingdom' and blonde haired Princess Peach from those video games but I'm sure they understand perfectly!) but anyway let the preparations for the wedding begin!\" She announced but you jumped up crying out still not wanting to get hitched so quickly <br>\r\n\"Hey wait don't I get a say in any of this?\" All of them stared at you <br>\r\n\"Oh of course you do! You're the guest of honor go on ahead and tell us what's on your mind!\" Toadstool said merrily beaming at you as you began protesting while sweating up a storm <br>\r\n\"Well first of all I'm far too young to marry a princess of your status and I'm still in school,I have a terrible allergic to fungi,you know how bad certain types of fungi can be bad to the human body and....But you were cut off by several of Toadstool's subjects groaning and angry outbursts but the princess didn't look even remotely offended in the slightest <br>\r\n\"Oh! Yeah about that you really shouldn't have to be concerned with any of that! Remember that this is a magical realm so all those poisonous mushrooms,foot fungi and stuff that exist in your world will have no effect on you here so anymore complains?\" You nodded <br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe you really should marry one of the Mario Bros Princess Toadstool!\" You protested but again she shook her head <br>\r\n\"I already told you it's you I love and you I intend to marry and I'm sorry if this sounds a bit mean but as Princess of this kingdom I'm entitled to get what I want! Now Toad inform the kingdom that the wedding will be in three days,I want everything prepared by then oh and I'll have to fix you up a nice tuxedo and don't worry about your parents I already invited them to the wedding and even offered them residence to live in the Mushroom Kingdom as long as they'd like,they'll love it trust me.\" As she left the room.... </span></div></div>",

The lone window let you know that the room was at ground level, so there was no need to create a cloth ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were only wearing your t-shirt, so you had to raid one of Toadstool's dressers for a pair of shorts. Upon discovering her underwear drawer, your hormones did make you run your fingers through all her silky undergarments. After shaking your head clear, you found the shorts drawer and put one on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the drawers, you grabbed a number of stuffed plushes and put them under the blankets, doing your best to make it look like you were sleeping under the covers. The next step was to look out the window. To your relief, there was a warp pipe some distance outside. Knowing that Princess Toadstool would post guards in mere moments, you quickly got outside and hid in a bush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, Mushroom guards soon appeared. Knowing that the place kind of operated on a mix of cartoon logic and Video Game logic, you grabbed the bush's roots and took a few steps every time the mushroom guards weren't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a long time, close to an hour, but you reached the warp pipe and entered it, leaving the bush behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed up in a rather high tech area.

I guess I should find the library and see if I can find a way back home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your arrival didn't go unnoticed. In a nearby building, was Kootie Pie Koopa, who was planning on spreading rumors and lies about the mushroom kingdom in a few forums on a computer. However, she discovered the rumor that Princess Toadstool was going to get married in a few days and the topic had a picture of Princess Toadstool carrying your unconscious body. When you fell out of a pipe, Kootie had heard that and looked out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the loser marrying the dorky princess... I wonder if she'll still marry him if she finds him in the arms of another woman or two!\" Kootie Pie Koopa said before she cackled as she pulled out her wand and secretly cast a spell on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then made sure to avoid looking at you, as any woman that looked at you would quickly desire you in a sexual manner until the spell was removed from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you found the Library, or whatever had a library sign over it.

What do you mean he's not there?\" Toadstool asked sitting on her throne as she had been carefully making preparations for the wedding which was in about three days she wasn't angry but it was quite oblivious that she was displeased <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry Your Highness but he certainly wasn't there when we looked and he wasn't in any of the other rooms nor in any of the hallways either!\" Explained one of the guards the Princess's bright blue Pac-Man eyes widened as she gasped <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh I hope he hasn't gotten lost or gone exploring! The Mushroom Kingdom is very large and confusing especially to a Real Worlder! Quick summon all the guards to search the rest of the castle and the town square I'll meanwhile search elsewhere for his whereabouts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she got up and went off to a hidden chambers where she sat down at a computer terminal(it was still the late eighties after all or at least to the fair citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom and despite her royal upbringing Princess Toadstool was quite intelligence and knew fully well how to use a computer,even a modern one as well as other everyday modern accessories like driving a car etc. as she began typing in what you looked like,facial expression etc all the while her fear and concern over you was increasing by the minute <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh I wonder where he ran away? Doesn't he know how much I care for him not just as a husband to be but as someone I came to admire and grown to love.....\" She thought to herself finally she hit a mark <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm what's this 'Local Boy Is Found By......... *Gasp* Huh? That's Bunsen! What's she doing with my finacee?\" Toadstool said as she stared at the newspaper clipping of in Roboland how Dr. Nerdnick's robotic aide seemed to have found a young teenaged boy wandering around the scrapyards and came to his rescue,falling in love with him in the process finally Princess Toadstool stood up a bit peeved and headed out of the hidden chambers and out of the castle eventually <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Bunsen but no one kidnaps my finacee!\" As she stormed away to a nearby drain pipe leading straight to Roboland.......</span></div></div>",

Who would rescue you from the Mushroom Princess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother was that Bunsen would knockout Toadstool, use a robot to place her somewhere... a place where no one would be able to rescue her, nor you from Bunsen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third was that both would do something where they might kill each other, leaving you to die, secured to a chair in Bunsen's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fourth was that the two would team up and shower you with their love. You were scared that you might not survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bunsen, I'm glad you helped me and the Mario brothers save Roboland from Koopa, I insist that you give me back my fiance and tell the press that he is mine,\" Toadstool said, pointing at Bunsen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But princess! You have the pick of the land! I'm lucky to get a second look from a manbot, even if I have my manifolds loose!\" Bunsen replied. One of her hands had extended its fingers towards a control panel out of Toadstool's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then just ask to go to the real world! There's probably a million human guys who like robot women like you!\" Toadstool exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want this hunk of a man!\" Bunsen spat out, pressing a few buttons. Robot hands extended from the ceiling and floor, grabbing Toadstool, and putting her outside. The door closed, this time with bars appearing over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Toadstool began to smash her fists against the door, she yelled, \"Bunsen, open this door right now and give me back my man! Or else I'll turn you into a toaster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped when she heard evil cackling. One she knew all too well. Looking about, Toadstool called out, \"Kootie Pie Koopa? I thought you and your family were sealed forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were, but I wasn't! I was out shopping for clothes for our victory party!\" Kootie Pie said as she stepped into view. She angrily pointed at Toadstool as she roared,\"AND YOU RUINED IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I bet you decided to have your revenge by using your magic wand on my fiance to have Bunsen fall in love with him!\" Toadstool said with a slight growl as she curled her hands into fists. Physically fighting wasn't very princess-like, but Toadstool was a woman in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are <i>almost</i> right. I guess that brain of yours is not completely crushed by that red wig...\" Kootie Pie said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my real hair! I guess being a koopa would make you unfamiliar with something like hair...\" Toadstool said, knowing that Kootie Pie was extremely vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>back when Toadstool was hitting the door</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunsen smirked as she heard the knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll invite her to be a bridesmaid at our wedding,\" Bunsen said before she returned her attention to you. Feeling up her boobs, she said, \"I made these specially for you. They can produce a special milk laced with aphrodisiacs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped in fear... though also with a tiny bit of arousal. Damn the seemingly innate love of a woman's bosom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned around and wiggled her newly plump rump at you. \"And in case you're an ass man, This enhancement is ready to fulfill your desires! And if neither is big enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunsen then twirled around, her boobs and butt expanding to were either a single boob was bigger than your head and you could lose both hands in a single asscheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that you were moments away from being raped by a sexuallized fembot, you had to try something and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how friendly Princess Toadstool is. If it wasn't for her, I'd never by here, as I'm from the real world. If I don't see you apologize to her, then we're through,\" You said in the sternest tone you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunsen's figure shrank back down as she looked at you in shock. \"But mr hunk. She-I-but-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" you uttered, glaring at Bunsen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed as she walked behind the chair and pressed a button.

Kootie Pie was trying to avoiding looking at you at all costs but couldn't force herself to stare at anything else and the moment her big weird reptile blue eyes caught a single glance at you,cartoon like hearts appeared over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh no now I'm in love with him too! This wasn't how it was supposed to happen!\" She screamed as she made a desperate bull rush right at you and practically shoved the Mushroom Princess out of the way and began putting her slimy reptile lips upon you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey yuck get away!\" You shrieked as as if a robot kissing you wasn't bad enough Kootie Pie's big wet sloppy kisses felt like kissing a mop,a very dirty mop that smelled like it was dipped in bleach for three hours! You weren't the only one repelled by this new course of action Toadstool was nearly livid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey get your disgusting slimy claws off of my man! Kootie Pie this instant!\" She screamed her fat forearms were once more formed into angry fists but Bunsen held her back from leaping on the teenaged reptile(well technically Princess Toadstool was also a teenager herself 17 years old but you know what I mean)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your man? No way icky princess go marry one of those plumber boys or something! This hunk of a human is mine now,all mine Ahahahahahahaha!\" She cackled evilly completely smitten with you(the numerous hearts fluttering over her head)Kootie Pie gave you even more revolting kisses and you tried to push her off but damn it she was too heavy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh does everybody in this Mushroom Kingdom have superstrength? I need to work out more!\" You thought as your vision was blurry from nothing but Kootie Pie's big red lips upon your face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm warning you Kootie Pie let go of him now or I......\" Toadstool hissed trying to break free of the robot's grip <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha what can you do little fungi Princess? It's not your royal nature to get physical!\" King Koopa's only daughter jested as she went in for another big smooch but she thought wrong as to all three of your utter surprise the Mushroom Princess pulled herself out of Bunsen's grip which was the tighter than the strength of a small army tank and made a bull charge at the Koopaling practically quarter back tackling her to the ground and a severe wrestling match soon erupted between the two with you and Bunsen watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a few minutes you couldn't take anymore and just had to intervene <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Princess Toadstool,Kootie Pie break it up!!\" You screamed at the top of your lungs both instantly stopped and stared surprised at you <br>\r\n\"Look normally I would be thrilled that all of you have developed a serious crush on me but given the current circumstances this is far too much there's only one way for us to settle this matter and that's with a contest.\" All three Bunsen included exchanged confused glances at each other <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of contest?\" Bunsen asked you thought for a while about this what kind of contest indeed? Whatever it was you had to make it long and interesting enough to distract them for you to make your escape back to the Real World to tell the truth you didn't want to wed any of them Toadstool included you never imagined she could be so darn psychotic and obsessive! She seemed so much nicer and cuter compared to her video game counterpart <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well have you come up with a idea of the contest yet?\" The Princess asked tapping her foot rather impatiently you though hard staring at her signature pink dress,at Kootie Pie's ugly mug and Bunsen's weird robotic body you suddenly had a wild idea and announced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I made my decision we're going to have a beauty contest(once more all three looked at each other in utterly confusion) whoever wins this beauty contest gets to have me for keeps and I won't try and escape Scout's Honor!\" You gave a salute <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm already the absolute ruler of this entire world and besides I'm incredibly beautiful well far more than these two anyway!\" Toadstool couldn't help but blurt out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're joking right I'm the most beautiful of all in the Mushroom Kingdom my Daddy says so!\" Kootie Pie hissed back <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to disagree but with my advanced computerized functions I can instantly make myself into any curvy womanly shape that no ordinary human,mushroom princess or reptile can hope to achieve!\" Bunsen just had to get her two cents across as well .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three starting arguing with each other you saw your only chance to escape and took it but once more and predictably you found yourself lost again! But if you thought you gave the girls the slip you were dead wrong as it didn't take long for them to realize you were missing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait a moment where did he go?\" Kootie Pie asked looking around <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no he's gone again! This is horrible and this is all your fault Kootie Pie!\" Toadstool cried <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fault? How is this any of my fault?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did use a enhanted spell over all of us!\" Bunsen pointed out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well technically I was already in love with him the moment I fell into his parents' living room.\" Toadstool objected \"But listen none of us are going to see him again or even get a chance to marry him(she sighed deeply) if we don't find him and fast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal! And whoever does manage to find him gets to keep him forever!!\" Kootie Pie pointed out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!!\" Both the princess and Bunsen said as they shook hands with the young reptile and each one departed in a different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile were still wandering around aimlessly until you finally found the Holy Grail:the pipe that led to the way home was a foot away from you and without hesitation you took a desperate dive into it but little did you realize one of the three ladies was coming up the pathway and followed you down the pipe \"Oh no you don't you're not getting away that easily!\" The unknown person said as they secretly emerged with you back in the Real World question is who was it?</span></div></div>",

Sadly it was a towel, so you began to whip it against the Koopa princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinky! We'll have to shave that for- Owch! It's starting to hurt now!\" Kootie pie uttered, only covering her head when she cried out in pain. \"Let's kiss and make up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to the video game land, you ugly turtle-ox-oni thing!\" You yelled as you backed away because Kootie pit had gotten out of the tub. \"I'll never kiss you! Never!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugly! Never going to kiss me!\" Kootie pie growled as produced her magic wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, you remembered that you were a magic-less human and that Kootie Pie was stronger than you and had magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and waited for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that happened was a breeze of wind and the sound of Mario 3  magic sounds. As Kootie Pie began to chuckle, you slowly opened your eyes and asked, \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I altered your teenage hormones, so that any woman, either in person or just their image, will <i>really </i>turn you on!\" Kootie pie cooed before she puckered her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, you both sprouted the hardest erection you ever had and had a strong desire to kiss her. Your body reacted before you could thinkm making you kiss Kootie on the lips, even hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for a moment, did her lips feel wrong like fish lips. After a few moments, her lips felt like the soft pillow lips of a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeatedly kissed Kootie pie for a good ten minutes. Each kiss seemed to sap your will, making you want to do nothing but kiss the beauty in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fear entered your eyes round that point, Kootie shoved you away and chuckled. \"The more you kiss a woman, the more you want the pleasure a woman can bring you! And just to rub it in, you won't be able to tell any woman about it, so if you somehow escape my wonderful love, you'll get more enslaved to any woman you stay near! Even that pesky princess would abuse this spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that if you moved quickly enough, you'd be able to enter the warp pipe. There, you'd have to find the wand maker from the episode '\"A Toadally Magical Adventure\".

There's also the Mario Kart series, the Olympic games, the mario version of puzzle and dragons, and there's a Wendy skin in the Wii-U version of Minecraft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose Wendy?\" Kootie Pie asked in a quiet and angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of her as an alternate version of you.

She sat down on the couch and patting the seat next to her as she happily cooed, \"Sit down, boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to, but you did. she handed you a controller and the two of you began to play...</span></div></div>",

A large part of my royal magic powers actually revolves around flowers, much like how Toadstool's royal magic powers revolve around mushrooms. She doesn't like to use them, though. She said it might ruin her plan to spread peace throughout the lands,\" Daisy said as she sat next to you on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That gives me an idea. Since Toadstool, Bunsen, and Kootie Pie Koopa are all competing to win this man, perhaps you could offer a plan where they and you can marry him? We might even be able to offer Mama Fireplant a part of this deal!\" The fireplant that had been looking at you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound like a good idea, Sue,\" Daisy said as she crossed her arms, closed her eyes, and thought about the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered as you feared that such a plan would leave you dead before the honeymoon barely started. You already heated sue the fireplant for ruining whatever plan to escape videoland and the crazy women it held.</span></div></div>",

When Daisy and Sue looked at you for some reason, you said, \"So let's say you tell the others your idea. Here's a few problems. One is that Bunsen is not the princess of Robo Land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that can be solved by having everyone in Robo Land vote her into princesshood!\" Daisy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere it not for that one episode of <i>The adventures of Super Mario Bros 3</i> cartoon that had some voting <i>(Princess Toadstool for President)</i>, you'd pass her answer off as ridiculous. So you asked your next question, \"What makes you think Koopa would go for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows he does whatever Kootie Pie wants him to do!\" Daisy cheerfuly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except when he gets fed up with her screams,\" Sue muttered, getting a glare from Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third Question. How will you get all of them to agree to your plan?\" You asked, wondering if you would get clothes soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a secret! And don't bother asking, because it's a girl's secret!\" Daisy said with a giggle as she covered her mouth. she then snapped her fingers. A few odd looking plants spat out something that looked like pollen. As you began to have a harder time staying awake, Daisy said, \"I apologize for using Pollen Nap on you, but I need you to stay safe and sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell backwards, but did your best to only look like you were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy then picked up Sue and said, \"Sue, let's go talk to the others about our wonderful plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two left, you tried to move and escape. Your movements were sluggish from Mama Fireplant having her way with you, and the pollen nap was making your movements even slower. Daisy's RV began to move. You looked out the window and watched as the background changed from the wild skies of Dinosaur land, to the weird area of the warppipes, and finally the blue skies of the Mushroom Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Toadstool, Bunsen, and even you Kootie Pie!\" Daisy's voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd slap you head if you could.

You guessed the green dresses were bridesmaid outfit or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, that lady Mouser would haunt your dreams, specially when she blew you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Kootie Pie Koopa will be glad to know you're awake,\" A female Goomba said in a lusty whisper before she waddled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess? ...Well, I guess she is, since Koopa is a king...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when she marries you, she'll be Queen of the Koopa Queendom!\" A koopa replied as she adjusted the groom's coat you were wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked, not quite sure what you were hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I was told that the difference between a kingdom and a queendom is merely that in a Queendom, it means they are ruled by the queen and that power is passed down from mother to the first female firstborn. Though some people consider Kingdom to be something of a genderneutral term as it can mean 'A country, state, or territory ruled by a king or queen', The Koopa quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant to ask that why is Kootie Pie trying to dethrone her father,\" you returned. \"And who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, King Koopa and his cons are still stuck in the Banishment Zone. The princess wants power and the legalese of Video Game land allows her to take full power of the Koopa Kingdom if she marries while he is not in command. I guess you're the lucky man! As for my name, call me Coco Koopa!\" the Koopa said with a wink before she kissed you on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could say anything more, Kootie Pie yelled, \"BRING ME MY GROOM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Shucks! I guess we can't sneak off for a quick makeout session,\" Coco Koopa muttered as she walked around you and began to wheel the chair you were stuck to into the main hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the minister's stand, right on the wall was Toadstool, Daisy, and Bunson. all dressed in that green dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I guess that is the bridesmaid outfit for this wedding...'</i> You thought as you took a better look at the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three were tightly bound, half-wake, and angry at something behind you. When you heard the 'here comes the bride' music, you shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more so when you heard Kootie Pie began to hum to the song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kootie Pie appeared to your left, she gave you a wink. She held a bouquet of piranha plants, and what appeared to be a really expensive white bride dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said, \"I have a handsome groom, a big wedding, and three rivals as a trophy to prove that not only am I the most beautiful, but the strongest and the smartest! One of them is even that princess Daddy always tried to capture! I truly have surpassed my father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old Goomba wearing a suit and tie then leapt onto the Minster'd podium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, you saw that there were many pleased minions on Kootie Pie's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your side was Toadstool's and Daisy's people, as well as a few robots. They looked depressed, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As we gather here today-\" The Goomba minister began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry it up!\" Kootie Pie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Uh...\" The Goomba Minister muttered as they tried to find their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get... to... the.... I do part,\" Kootie Pie hissed. Almost immediately, Toadstool, Daisy, and Bunson all fully woke up and began trying to break out of their bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you.... Uh, Will, take Princess Kootie Pie in Wealth or... uh greater wealth, to be your lawfully wedded wife and Queen?\" The Goomba minister asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does,\" Kootie Pie quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goomba Minster then asked, \"and you, Princess Kootie Pie, do you...\"</span></div></div>",

It's just about some boring royal wedding.\" DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT WHAT I DO OR DON\"T WANT TO READ. Just give me the paper, ON THE DOUBLE!\" The Koopa meekly complies, and so the King of the Koopa snatches it up and starts hastily scans the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of Koopa Keep:<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\"<br>\r\nTwo Koopa guards cover their eardrums as a thunderous shout shakes the foundations of the castle.</span></div></div>",

But still you said nothing \"So what do you think? Do you want to give it a try?\" Toadstool asked her smile getting wider by the minute finally you spoke<br>\r\n\"Uh you sure this thing isn't going to cause me to be you know permanently shrunk or something of that nature?\" You nervously ask Toadstool shrugged<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth I have no idea what the effects would do or how long it will last. But let's find out right now shall we?\" As she approached you with the mushroom you backed up but Toadstool had the strength of a bear as she effortlessly pulled you back onto the couch \"There's nothing to be afraid of my new friend no harm will come to you just do this for me pretty please?\" She batted her pretty Pac-Man blue eyelashes at you and you sighed and nodded <br>\r\n\"Fine okay.\" The princess cheered and granted you a quick hug then gave you a piece of the mushroom <br>\r\n\"Thank you! Okay now take a bite won't you?\" You swallowed hard and did as she asked it tasted nasty like what you expected raw mushrooms would taste like you wondered how Mario could stand to eat these things all the time but immediately you felt the strange effects of you starting to decrease in size as you shockingly looked Princess Toadstool was getting larger and larger by the second as was everything else in the house soon you shrunk to two inches high <br>\r\n\"It worked hooray! It worked!\" She cried happily and excited you groaned as she picked you up she seemed far more terrifying yet prettier when she was near Godzilla size <br>\r\n\"Yeah it worked okay princess you tried out your little experiment and it was a success alright now can you please return me to normal now?\" To which the princess.......</span></div></div>",

I'm begging you!

And to show how much I'm in control, I'll just do <i>this</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new goddess and ruler Princess Toadstool gave you a cute but sadistic looking smirk and opened up the collar to her dress, exposing a large canyon of cleavage. Her breasts looked slightly bigger than you thought. They looked like high C or low D cups maybe. The large dress definitely covered her up well, but not right now. As the colossal cutie lowered you down into the vast fleshy canyon that was her boobs, you squirmed and shouted up at her face above you as best as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? You want down? I can do that, but are you <i>sure</i> that's what you want?\" Toadstool said with a fake caring look on her face. You shouted back up that that was not what you wanted at all, but clearly she couldn't or at least was pretending she couldn't hear you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess princess suddenly released you from her fingers and you plummeted to her soft fleshy orbs. You landed with a \"plop!\" and stopped about in the center of her two massive globes. Princess Toadstool let out a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you tickle in there! I'm sooo glad I was finally able to do this since I missed my chance with Mario and Luigi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were happy the princess finally achieved her dream, you were in absolute heaven. You couldn't even be mad right now, being in between a giant pair of breasts felt amazing. </span></div></div>",

You tried to stay above the cleavage, but the rocky motions eventually tripped you into the cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to sink into her bosom bit by bit. Just as your head was about to vanish into the princess's bosom, you cried out, \"Please stop, Princess Toadstool! I might die between your breasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment before she remembered something. \"Ah! I know how to fix that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reached inside her red sash around her waist and began to rummage around for a few moments. When she pulled out a magic wand, Toadstool said, \"This will fix that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved it around and you glowed for a few moments. You thought you were going back to your normal height, but that hope was dashed when she said, \"Now you you can hold your breath forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, I-\" You said before the giggling princess poked you into her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt you wriggle in her bosom, Toadstool  began to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is a home in the real world... More advanced than it was during 1989... but this home needs a princess's touch! After all, I'll probably be her for quite some time, after all!\" Toadstool  said as she waved around the wand. \"And I have just the wand to do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cast spell after spell. Each object hit turned into either a more expensive version of itself or a pink girly version of itself. Once she had changed all that she felt needed improvements, she then swung the wand around more and more, until she built up enough magic to change the house itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour home then changed into a mix of a mansion and a castle. The effects of the spell had the neighbors not be aware of any changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only had no idea what she was doing because your world currently consisted of Toadstool's boobs. They were big, soft, and smelled quite lovely. In fact, you had quite the erection from it and suspected that Toadstool knew about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the princess wandered about her new home, she muttered, \"I wonder if I should bring Zelda here? I do know she wants some time away from Link, who keeps wanting a kiss from her...\"</span></div></div>",

As she readied her magic wand, Toadstool noticed the Captain N comics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking some issues up, Toadstool flipped through them. She muttered, \"I like this Samus. She's chatty, is somewhat bribe-able, and actually is a seeker for romance, though only for strong fighters... But I might be able to fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she spun her wand around, the spell would bring all three to this world, however, their minds would be a bit altered. They'd be a bit more deferring to Toadstool, and have a far easier time falling in love and lust with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Toadstool watched as Zelda, Spryte, and Samus suddenly appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toadstool? Where are we?\" Zelda asked. She looked at Samus and asked, \"And who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain everything,\" Toadstool began. \"It starts with this world begin the real world and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent a long time between Toadstool's terrific tits, enough that you began to wonder if remaining here was going to be your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to your surprise, Toadstool reached in, plucked you out, and put you onto a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround you was Zelda and Samus, but not the video games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Zelda from the cartoon, dressed in her riding gear. A purple long-sleeve shirt, pink riding pants, and a blue vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was blonde, but was wearing a green one-piece suit with sleeves. You knew it was the comic version as you recalled that Toadstool didn't think much of her video game counterpart and probably didn't think much of the other characters. That and the comic version of Samus had fuller lips that you did fantasize about kissing once or twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte suddenly landed besides you. To your displeasure, she was still taller than you, as she seemed to be about five inches tall. She cooed in a lusty way, \"Ooohhh my! He's as cute as you say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that the three newcomers all were curvier than you recalled, making you wonder if your fate was to spend the rest of your life in their assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what we agreed, Spryte,\" Zelda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, princess Zelda...\" Spryte said before she flew around you in a circle. After a few rounds, she said, \"There! Done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you get to remain our tiny little boytoy. Only able to grow if you aren't too aroused. And unless you grow to your full size, whenever you cum, you'll shrink back to this size,\" Samus said as she knocked you down with a finger, then began to use that same finger to rub your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do, Toadstool!?\" You cried out, trying futilely to stop Samus's finger from making you cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to bring them to the real world, so we can work together and have our appearances be used in the newer video games!\" Toadstool answered. \"As.... <i>lovely </i>as Peach is, I think it'd be better if my appearance was used again in video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it'd be nice to have a static Zelda appearance in the games based in Hyrule,\" Zelda said, her breath a bit shallow and blushing the more she stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention getting to be with a cute guy without Link popping up and demanding a kiss, right?\" Spryte asked. Zelda looked away and huffed, though still looking at you with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte not lusting over Link was a big sigh that Toadstool did something to her and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, we are going to contact Nintendo and fix the problem,\" Toadstool interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where does that leave me?\" you asked, getting ready to cum from Samus's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was changing the house to better fit me, I realized one thing and discovered another. I realized that I really care about you, as you were really nice to me, not concerned with food all the time, and not a scaredy-cat,\" Toadstool answered with a blush. She then added, \"And I discovered that you are somehow a anchor that somehow allowed me to come here and I could also use to bring others in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you get to be our secret loverboy, while we get rich enough that you don't have to worry about money ever again,\" Samus said, just before you cummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool picked you up and placed you back in her bosom, saying, \"And now it's time to contact Nintendo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte was disappointed, as she was looking forward to having her way with you, while the others were away.</span></div></div>",

Anyway once the foursome came to the gates of the really tall building one of the security guards on duty came out looking confused at the four animated ladies <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just who are you four girls pretending to be?\" He asked curiously Toadstool who seemed to be acting as leader spoke up first <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Princess Peac-umm I mean Princess Toadstool and these are my friends,I'm sure you have no problems recognizing Princess Zelda,Samus from the Metroid games and Spryte(she pointed to each one in turn.)

Please may we go in?\" Toadstool begged carefully pushing you back into her breasts where she had you imprisoned for the last couple of days<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er right do you have a scheduled appointment?\" The guard asked looking down at his clipboard \"Hmmm none of you seem to be on the list now take off the lame and outdated princess costumes and get out of here before I call real security!\" He said a bit rough apparently not buying any of it that is when Zelda came up next to Toadstool and pulled out the magic wand from her belt the guard rolled his eyes as he stared at her getup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and let me guess you're supposed to be Princess Warrior from.....\" But he never got the chance to finish as with a single wave of the wand his memory was temporarily altered sort of like the Jedi Mind Trick from Star Wars as Zelda said calmly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll forget you ever saw any of us and will let us go in without any further questions.\" The guard simply nodded and gave the order to open the gate as the four entered into the main building all were beyond awestruck at the massive size not to mention all the numerous pictures,forums and trophies of every Nintendo character from past to present set upon every inch of the walls <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird I actually look like that?\" Samus said staring at her videogame counterpart from Metroid Prime <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing look how odd I'm supposed to be!\" Zelda pouted as she stared at a poster of Zelda Twilight Princess but Princess Toadstool more concerned with getting their actual faces on the merchandise calmly advised them to try and focus what they came for finally the big moment arrived when they saw the main doors that led into the offices of the big wigs of Nintendo of America Inc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay this is it girls.....\" Spryte said fluttering behind Zelda <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she talking about?

They instead claimed they came via a combination of magic and advanced technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to make small sacrifices, like Samus having to wear her armor more or wear the Zero suit. Zelda had to wear the dress the more modern one wore. Toadstool had to business suits to meetings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the time, you were stuck in Toadstool's bosom, between her buttcheeks, or bound to her crotch. To prevent you from escaping, magic was used to bind you to her bra or panties. To prevent you from calling for help, you were gagged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times you were in Zelda's bosom, when Toadstool had to model clothing that would have revealed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your home, you were given to one of the other ladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte liked to make out with you, when she wasn't having fun mocking your height or taking advantage of it. Yes, there was a few times where she somewhat treated you like a doll, one that she felt up like a lover, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus liked to get physical with you, usually with her hands. She had you fight her fingers, or else you'd get molested by them. Sometimes, she pinned you to a wall with her behind. It didn't matter what outfit she wore. If she wore her green outfit, then you'd get to feel her flesh. If she wore the Zero suit, then you'd get to feel her butt in spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nzelda was... nice for the most part. She played video games when she wasn't busy in a meeting. During those times, she sat on you and sometimes stomped on you with her behind when she got too into a game. When she watched movies, she kept you on top of her bosom. and yes, during romantic movies and  scary movies, she hugged you into her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool somehow shrinked a controller for you to use and played video games. However, she still did the penalty games, but refused to unshrink you. So you had to settle for food, a doll house for you to live in, and etc. Toadstool merely had you give your thoughts on new outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the moment where you had to be left behind because both Spryte and Toadstool had to do a modeling gig for a day. Both Zelda and Samus were dressed in t-shirts, panties, and bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that both Zelda and Samus were far too innocent when Toadstool left worried you. When the door closed, both ladies smiled at you as they headed your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, ladies, I think I should-Ack!\" You uttered as both Zelda and Samus picked you up. Holding a magic wand, Zelda temporarily increased your size to about Spryte's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While Link is too pig-headed to get a kiss from me, no matter how many times he asks,\" Zelda said as she and Samus held you between their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna get plenty of kisses from two of the hottest blondes in video game land!\" Samus finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/kiss.png\" alt=\"*Kiss*\" title=\"Kiss\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/kiss.png\" alt=\"*Kiss*\" title=\"Kiss\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/kiss.png\" alt=\"*Kiss*\" title=\"Kiss\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/kiss.png\" alt=\"*Kiss*\" title=\"Kiss\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/kiss.png\" alt=\"*Kiss*\" title=\"Kiss\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/kiss.png\" alt=\"*Kiss*\" title=\"Kiss\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled, trying to free yourself.

Samus held you for a few moments before she and Zelda pressed their boobs together. The only thing preventing you from falling was their breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rubbed, pressed, squeezed, and whatever else they could with their breasts, only occasionally pulling you up to the top of their boobs.</span></div></div>",

Oh no no no! You can 't be thinking about-\" You said before you were muffled by derrieres larger than a small house.

Only moving up, down, and side-to-side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled, as expected. All you could do was weakly slap butt flesh. Zelda and Samus's scent, though you were familiar enough to recognize it instantly, still aroused you. You still feared falling to the ground and smashing into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir next act was Zelda laying facedown on the ground, with Samus standing at her side. you were lying on Zelda's butt cleavage. Before you could move or escape, Samus quickly trapped you by squatting down and trapping you once more between their behinds. All that happened was Samus moving her butt up and down. Sometimes she rubbed her butt against Zelda's rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever either felt you not struggle, they stopped and gave you a 'chance' to escape. You tried, but Samus always caught you and put you back between their behinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour stuck in buttflesh, Samus was about to put you back between hers and Zelda's butt, you cried out, \"Wait! what about one-on-one time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus and Zelda looked at each other for a few moments before Zelda said, \"I don't mind if we go with his suggestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded.</span></div></div>",

Your parents would never have allowed it. You patiently waited for her to return. When Princess Toadstool came back, she was no longer wearing her dress again, only her bra and panties. You asked her why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're going to be feeding me, I wanted to see my stomach grow rounder and I think you'll now have an easier time climbing up to my mouth. Plus, it's more comfortable without my dress.\" She set down all of the food she brought. There was quite a bit of it. She brought grapes, jelly beans, popcorn, and other items. She got comfortable on the couch. She took off her shoes and put her bare feet on the table. You had easy access to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started with a grape. On the ground, it was about as tall as you. You picked it up, traveled across her leg and up her body. You got up to her mouth and threw it in. The princess immediately smashed it between her teeth. It took about 1 minute to complete that cycle, and another 30 seconds to get back to the food. You kept up this process for what felt like hours. When you ran out of food, you thought you were done, however, she pointed to a small box that had been siting there for a while. You opened it to find a lego man. You were confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you want to eat? A hard toy? I doubt it will taste good.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to be a replacement?\" She teased. You knew she was probably kidding, but to make sure you grabbed it and headed up again. When you got up there, you carefully placed it on her tongue. Her mouth closed and started to swirl it around. She swallowed and opened her mouth to reveal that it was gone. \"Thank you for that meal. I wanted to protect you, but also eat you, so I pretended that lego was you. I bet you would taste better though.\" She said and giggled. She was only joking, but you shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she started to hiccup. It caught both of you off guard. She hiccuped more, causing you to slide down her belly. She hiccuped even more, causing you to fall into her belly button. The princess drank water that was on the table from before. Within a few minutes, her hiccups stopped. You tried to climb out of her belly button but climbing the walls made her laugh. You kept trying to get out, only causing her to laugh. She put her hand on the opening, trapping you. You struggled even more, causing her to lose control of herself. All of the shaking was making it impossible to climb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please . . . . Stop! . . . . I can't . . . . . . . Take much more.\" She said, still laughing. However, the shaking was causing you to bump around. Bumping around caused her to laugh. You didn't know what to. You didn't think you could stop moving. Princess Toadstool eventually climbed off the couch and got onto her hands and knees. Though she kept laughing, the angle you were at caused you to fall down to the floor. Both of you took a minute to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you're lucky. You got to laugh that hard and have a personal pet feed you.\" You tell her. She smiles, still on her hands and knees. Once she got her breath, she started to tell you something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to thank you for that. It was so much fun. So in return I'll . . .\"</span></div></div>",

At your puny size, it almost sounded like growls from a monster dwelling within a cave. Clearly the sound was coming from Princess Toadstool, but you weren't entirely sure whether it was anything to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly all around you came an ear-piercing hissing noise, followed by a blast of hot gas right against your face. Your hair immediately stood on its end, you closed your eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent any of the noxious gas from getting in your system, but it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess' fart had already washed over you, like a tornado in a trailer park. Your eyes welled up with tears, you wanted to throw up, and you couldn't hold your breath any longer. You released your hands from your mouth and nose and began coughing furiously, being forced to take in as much of the soiled air as possible. This of course led to even more coughing as your entire body felt tainted by the beautiful goddess-sized girl's simple fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumbling around you got louder once more as you could tell another one was coming, this time even louder than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononono! <i>Nooooo!!!</i> Princess! Stop, please! <i>I'm begging you!!!</i>\" At this point your face was covered in your tears and the Princess' butt sweat. You could help but curl up into a ball and cry. This was cruel and unusual punishment for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hissing from before became akin to a hundred tubas at full blast around your ears. The air went from hot to volcano levels and you were completely overtaken by another blast of Princess Toadstool's gas. The fleshy walls around you vibrated at breakneck speed. You were in literal Hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gas bomb went on for at least five seconds, but for a bug like you, it seemed like a whole minute of being blasted with fart fumes. The blast of hot stench was so powerful, it dislodged you from your position between Princess Toadstool's cheeks and you flew out, dropping into the Princess' panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed....at least another hour that the Princess napped on your bed. Even though her farts only lasted a brief time, the stench of a garbage dump mixed with sewer waste stuck to your body. You laid in her panties, completely broken on the inside and out, and cried in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke what felt like hours later, it was night out now, and you were laying in the palm of Princess Toadstool's hand. You were absolutely livid right now, you didn't even want to speak to her, but you kept your composure and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey my tiny little man, how did you sleep?\" she inquired. You couldn't tell if she was intentionally making fun of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It.... it was fine...I guess.\" you replied sternly. You'd rather just forget the whole ordeal happened honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh....sounds like you didn't sleep that well... I'm sorry about that! If it makes you feel any better, I slept fantastic! Your bed is so comfy, you know?\" the Princess giggled and ruffled your hair with her pinky finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For being such a good little guy, you deserve a reward!\" she said, lifting her palm up to her large lips and proceeding to give you the biggest, wettest, and sloppiest kiss you'll ever receive. You were completely drenched from sweat, tears, and now, Toadstool's saliva and ruby red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwah! There you go cutie! I hope that made up for things. Honestly, I can kinda smell you from here, sorry about that! Though you have to admit, the fact that you couldn't even hold your own against a few farts from a princess is pretty pathetic!\" Princess Toadstool began to have a laughing fit, not even trying to hide that she thought of you as nothing more than a toy to mess with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Her left hand had fallen asleep so to wake it up, she hit it against her hip, sending shockwaves through her skin. Her butt cheeks began to have a ripple effect around you, sealing you within her even further and smearing your face against her smooth bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an absolutely lovely nap! It was so short, but I still feel completely refreshed! It's amazing how comfy the beds are in this world...\" Princess Toadstool mused. Was she talking to you, or just speaking aloud?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm and bang on the moons surrounding you, trying desperately for Toadstool to remember where she put you and let you out for some fresh air. You were worried that somewhere deep down, you were starting to enjoy being her little butt toy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got up off your bed, the Princess clenched her cheeks and patted her behind, as if to pretend that she was wiping any dust off her dress. You gussed that she was simply messing with you, because the way she patted her cheeks was the final push that sent you straight towards Princess Toadstool's asshole! It was still clenched tightly, so you didn't go through it, but your body was right up against it. The walls around you went from smooth to wrinkly, and the odor went from sweaty but bearable, to completely musky and torturous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below you could hear the footfalls of the Princess walking somewhere else in your house. You could do nothing but sway with her body movements. What would become of your fate? </span></div></div>",

Clearly all the activity was speeding up a few processes or something and she blushes a little knowing what was coming. Looking around, she made sure she was in a secluded area so that no one would see or hear the rather unladylike action she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your PoV, the pressure around your lower body started to build. You thankfully didn't feel anything solid down there, but the increased pressure raised another alarm in your mind. \"She wouldn't... not without taking me. Oh GOD! PRINCESS! WAIT!!! IM STUCK DOWN HERE!\"<br>\r\nOutside your prison, the princess heard your muffled squeaks for help and giggled softly, imagining just how helpless you are that she could completely overpower you with her next action. \"Hope your ready for this.\" She teased as she leaned over slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next you likely wouldn't forget no matter how hard you tried. As the hole opened up slightly, the pressure fired your body out and against the wall of fabric which trapped you there initially. What followed was a deafening thunder as the putrid gas erupted from her rear, keeping you pinned to her panties and assaulting all of your senses at once. The fart lasted about 5 seconds, but it sure felt longer from your perspective. Outside, Toadstool laughed as she felt you weakly wiggling against her cheeks as the gas ended. With a simple bodily function, she has just completely subdued you. The rush of power felt amazing to her.</span></div></div>",

I want to feel those hands of yours on that behind.\" Toadstool said while enjoying the feeling of your hands on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gets up to give you some air before sitting back down on your face. You then go to take your tongue out and began licking her butthole. Toadstool felt your tongue and gasped in pleasure by your course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, actually, felt really good. I want you to do more of that for me.\" Toadstool said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to lick around Toadstool's butthole and she keeps on moaning as the pleasure rises in her. Afterwards, you gave her a sign to get up and she did to let you breathe. She then turns around to face you with a nice smile on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an amazing experience. I didn't know you had it in you, you naughty man.\" Toadstool commented playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I didn't either. Guessed I never knew about it to begin with.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be. Now, I think you had enough of my behind for one night. How about we try another part of me?\" Toadstool suggested seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool didn't say anything as she goes to place her _______ on your face.</span></div></div>",

Like what?\" \"Weird things happening to my body it changed when I got close to it to touch it I mysteriously sprouted wings( no kidding you really did swear you grew wings from your back though they vanished after a  while, or could stretch your whole body like elastic for a full two days) the point is whatever energy this portal is made of it does bizarre and weird things to people who are exposed to it changes their body structure or DNA no telling what it may have done to you Princess.\" She still looked confused \"Changed my body structure?

Then does Mario,Luigi,Yoshi,Wario,Princess Daisy and Rosalina exist in your Mushroom Kingdom too?\" Asked the boy Toadstool frowned \"Well Mario and Luigi do of course but Bowser where I come from he's called King Koopa as for these people called Yoshi,Princess Daisy,Wario and Rosalina I have never heard of any of them before who are they?\" She asked curiously \"Characters who are part of the Super Mario video game universe we know!\" The boy said with a cold smirk you then spoke up from Toadstool's palm \"Well she speaks the truth son she really is Princess Peach but she comes from a cartoon version of Mario based on the first two original NES games you know Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Bros 2 that's why she looks different.\" You carefully explained but the boy didn't buy a word of your story \"Whatever I still don't believe she's the actual Princess Peach....\" \"YES I AM!\" Toadstool cried out completely frustrated \"Oh yeah prove it!\" The boy smirked folding his arms what should the princess do now? </span></div></div>",

Its horrible!\" To her and your relief rather than pressuring her or pursuing her further the man simply nodded \"A simple mistake Miss.....Miss....\" \"You can just call me Toadstool if you wish I don't mind General.\" The princess replies relieved she wasn't about to be attacked again \"Okay Miss Toadstool sorry about the mix-up with all these monsters roaming around nowadays I thought you were possibly in with them.....\" At this both you and the princess exchange confused looks at each other then you address the general \"Monsters? What type of monsters sir?\" He paused for a minute before replying \"Well let's see they're all about her size I would put them around 60 feet or more.\" \"Can you tell us what they look like General?\" A curious Toadstool asked slowly bending forward on the ground \"Really weird creatures MIss Toadstool strangest critters I have ever seen in my life they're popping up everywhere across the country I heard it on the radio and just saw it on the news too there's this mushroom thing roaming across Boston just north of here,a giant turtle creature thrashing parts of LA or so I heard,a giant egg spitting dinosaur monster in the Big Apple and some enormous mouse wandering around....\" But the princess didn't hear the rest of his sentence as she let out a loud gasp \"Oh No that....that sounds like King Koopa's minions! But how could they have possibly gotten here and more importantly how could they have gotten so BIG as I am?\" \"The portal.\" You replied as both people stare at you still in the princess' hand \"What portal?\" The general asked as you and Toadstool carefully explain the situation to him \"Oh No this is even more horrible than I could have possibly imagined!\" The princess exclaimed her free hand over her mouth \"King Koopa must have somehow figured out where I am and sent his cronies after me only....only now they're the same size as I am and destroying your world......we have to do something.\" As she stands to her full terrifying height lest to the tiny people at her feet \"No worry General and fair people of this city(\"Town.\" You reply to her)I'll try to put a stop to these cretins attacking your world but first....\" As she again lowered herself to the general \"General can you tell me if you saw two people one dressed in red overalls and wearing a red cap, really short while the other is much taller  wearing green overalls and a green cap they're both brothers  plus a little person with a mushroom like hat on his head somewhere around here or on the news anywhere?\" The man shook his head \"Nope can't say that I have Miss Toadstool I would definitely remembered seeing a guy with a mushroom on his head no those weird giant monsters were the only things I have seen.\" \"And you're sure about this? You haven't seen a giant turtle with green skin and a crown on his head either anywhere around here?\" Toadstool asked the man again shook his head \"Not that I'm aware of Miss as I said I would have freaked out if I did.\" She knew he was telling the truth and turned to you \"King Koopa and the Marios and Toad must still be back in the Mushroom Kingdom while several of his cronies are here in the Real World we have to stop them well I have to stop them,I just hope I don't shrink back to normal anytime soon as now I really need to be giant-sized in order to stop them from destroying your world.\" \"Are you sure you're up to the task?\" You slyly ask remembering both from the games and from the show how she was a complete damsel in distress getting captured by Bowser(King Koopa) was almost second nature to her Toadstool fumed angry at your remark \"Yes I am as a matter of fact! Don't try and think of me as this helpless little princess who can't take care of herself when the situation calls for it! I just taken out a entire military force a few hours ago didn't I? But right now I have to get going there's no telling what that Goomba,Koopa Troopa,the Birdo and Mouser are doing to those poor people in those cities right now....I'm going to leave you here_. I don't want anything happening to you most of all.\"  As she gently set you to the ground beside the general  then without a backwards glance and paying little attention to what she stepped on the giant princess began to run towards the outskirts of the town but where does she head to first? </span></div></div>",

Why are you looking at me like that?\" You move closer to the princess as you say \"I know the truth Princess.\" \" What truth?\" She asked curiously \"I know you aren't just highly concerned for my injured leg you actually enjoy taking care of me like I'm a infant and don't want to stop anytime soon I also know you really,really like me and haven't taken your eyes off me since you arrived here is that true?\" She gets disgusted as a frown appears over her face \"What? What are you talking about well the first part is true I have quite enjoyed taking advantage over you during your injured state but the other part I like you well I must admit you are sort of handsome but...\" You move closer to her and put your hands around the sides of her dress she starts to get really nervous \"W-what are you d-doing?\" \"I'm going to tickle you princess until you admit the truth that you really like me like me!\" Toadstool freaks out and cries frantic \"What? No please don't_. I....I'm very ticklish...honestly I just think of you as a friend that's all please don't tickl.....Ahhahahahahaha stooooppppp!\" She gets laughing like crazy as you begin to gently stroke her sides the princess shrieks and squirms from side to side \"Ahahahahaha stop it- it tickles! Hahahahaha!\" But you refuse and continue \"Not until you admit it princess admit that you like me,like me otherwise I can keep this up all day!\" As you start stroking her sides a bit faster Toadstool shrieks and squirms a bit faster and louder as she starts calling for her friends for help \"Ahahahahaha Mario,Luigi,Toad-Hahahahahaha heeeelllllpppp hahahahaha please stop_. Hahahahaha please!\" Finally you need her words and stop watching her pant and breathe like crazy after a few minutes of rest Toadstool finally </span></div></div>",

The princess rushs over to your side. \"Oh my!

I won't let him hurt you!\" Koopa watches this and realizes that the princes has feelings for you, then he gets an idea. Instead of just tormenting her physically, but just kidnapping her. He could torment he psychologically! Koopa bats the princess out of his way, sending her flying across the room, he then stands over you, pointing his magic wand at you. \"I need A princess. I didn't say I needed the original!\" You try to run but your leg is too hurt. The princess shoots \"NOOOO!!!\" As koopa shoots some magic from his want, hitting you. You body is enveloped in a strange glow, while the princess looks in horror. When the magic fades, you see that koopa has changed you into the princess!!! \"What?!\" Says you and the princess simotaniously. \"Like I said, I need A princess.\" You try to run, but even as the princess your leg is still broken. Koopa grabs you and jumps into the portal. \"NOOOO!!!\"says the princess, who immediately jumps in after him. But what the princess didn't expect was that koopa had  expected her to do this, so he set the portal to go two different ways. Koopa and you went to his castle, while the princess was dropped off somewhere far way form his castle.<br>\r\nWho do we stay with?</span></div></div>",

Mario and Luigi asked me the exact same thing when they first appeared in the Mushroom Kingdom.\"  \"And what did you tell them?\" You ask curiously getting started on your own sandwich \"The same thing I told you just now that I'm part mushroom but also mostly human like they and you are why are you asking me about this?\" She gives you a weird look you shrug \"Just curious I guess so it's just you ruling the whole kingdom what happened to your parents?\" She sniffed a bit in sadness \"Th...they died long ago when I was a little girl and I have been brought up in the ways of ruling over my kingdom ever since.\" She replied \"So how old are you then?\" \"17\" She took a sip of her drink looking at you with a sweet smile \"May I ask how old you are if you don't mind?\" \"Close to your age.\" You gave a satisfied answer as her smile grew \"Wow then we're not so far apart in age you're far younger then Mario and Luigi both of stated early on they're in their early twenties....\" She gives you a even greater smile as she puts away her sandwich and wipes her hands on her napkin \"Is this some kind of interview_.? You want to know all about me? I thought you would have already known enough about the Mushroom World from those video games but I can tell you more about my life if you're interested....\" As she leant in close face to face with you and you found yourself blushing furiously \"And I'm certain you can tell me more about yourself as well I'm very fascinated by this 3-D Real World but more to the point more fascinated by you_.*giggle*\" You could tell she was enjoying flirting with you as her blue Pac-Man eyes were almost at a dream like state and she was puckering up her cherry lips  but rather than kiss you she turned away and began putting up the food \"Oh I'm sorry I shouldn't have started putting up the food if you weren't...\" You laugh \"It's okay I'm already finished princess here....\" As you hand her your paper plate and remainder of food she packs it all in the wooden picnic basket then stands to her feet you do the same for a while you both stare around at the activity around your  whereabouts noticing several little kids in particular girls staring curiously at her she smiled sunnily at them then back at you \"Thank you for taking me on this picnic_.

Princess Toadstool was tiny, but holding up a planet sized weight. She was lifting it up in no time. You tried to run towards her, but she didn't get any closer. When she was done, she threw the weight away and suddenly grew to a giant. She looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you tried to make me fat huh? Well how do you like me now?\" She asked and brought her foot over your head. She must have though you were one of the bullies from before. \"You're pathetic, like a stupid spider. Let's see you die like a spider.\" Princess Toadstool brought her foot down right on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly woke up and fell over. You looked around, but didn't see the princess. You called out to her and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure she'll be back.\" A voice said, one you were afraid of. Before you could turn around, a hand covered your mouth. The other two showed their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello freak, remember us? We captured your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She may be gone now, but she'll be back for you, and this time, we'll make sure she eats like a good girl.\" The main one, which was still behind you, making sure you didn't run away, whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like to be her meal? It's the least you could do for helping her get away from us. Don't worry, we'll make sure your death is . . .very . . .painful.\" He said. You struggled until you heard a loud noise. The others started covering their ears as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, what's happening!?\" One of the minions cried out. Suddenly, you heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I decided to drop in, I wanted to make sure you three were rewarded for before.\" You look back to see Princess Toadstool drop in from the hole in the ceiling. She floated down using an umbrella. You were amazed, she looked as if she hadn't been fat before. She looked amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well. If it isn't the so called princess. We missed you, I suggest you surrender, . . . That is, if you don't want your friend to get hurt.\" The main one said. The princess shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surrendering, but you're out numbered. It's a good thing you didn't look behind you.\" She giggled. Even though you kept staring at her, the bully turned around to see what she meant. He only saw his two minions and was very confused. He started to look towards the princess when she suddenly grabbed him around the neck. He screamed, the others weren't sure what to do. The princess held him and grabbed a large rock. She hit him on the side of the head, causing him to pass out. She looked at the others, angrily. \"Do you want to be next?\" The others quickly ran away, causing the princess to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright princess?\" You asked, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I alright? Are you kidding? I feel like I can run around the whole planet! I feel great! As for this guy, I don't think he's feeling too good.\" Princess Toadstool pointed to the knocked out enemy. The two of you tied him up and brought him inside. When you got him settled, the princess hugged you.

Do you have any references?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the princess of the mushroom kingdom, will that work?\" Princess Toadstool asked. The mother thought for a minute, then nodded. You gave her the address and told her to bring him tomorrow at noon. The next night, as the princess was getting settled in bed, she asked you how you were going to teach him. You brought a laptop over to her and showed her \"Mario Teaches Typing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should work. . . I hope. He'll listen to you, so hopefully you'll be able to help him.\" You say.

She excitedly taught Thomas using the game you showed her. Although it was new for her, she quickly got the hang of it and helped the kid learn fast as well. Thomas soaked up the information like a sponge, making sure he didn't miss a single detail. After they completed both the first and second game multiple times, the kid could read pretty well. She then taught him how to write. Though it was a bit more difficult without a game, he got the hang of it. He learned to write his name, and after two weeks, he could write a lot of words. During the whole time, you mainly just provided snacks. You loved to see the princess excited, it made you giggle a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, the kid learned how to write sentences. Although they were pretty short sentences, the mother was very proud of Thomas. She thanked you for all of the hard work and asked if they could come visit sometime. You nodded, making her satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how well I did!\" The princess said. You agreed and decided to reward her for teaching Thomas.

She ended up getting a large bowl of strawberry ice cream. Some toppings that were added were gummy bears, chocolate syrup, sprinkles, and caramel. You simply got a regular ice cream cone. When the two of you sat down, you couldn't see her over all of the ice cream. People stared at the two of you. You were a little embarrassed, but happy that the princess was happy. Princess Toadstool didn't even notice that others were staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you eat all of that?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, don't worry. It'll all end up in my stomach.\" She said. The two of you started to eat your ice cream. You finished much faster than she did. The princess took her time so she didn't get a brain freeze. As she ate, her belly started to get round. You went to the bathroom, leaving her with her meal. When you got back, Princess Toadstool had an empty bowl in front of her. She had a little bit of ice cream on her face. Her dress was pushed out a little because of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be full.\" You said and laughed. You helped her get back to your place. When you reached your house, it was pretty dark outside. She climbed into bed and fell asleep immediately. As she slept, you quietly wrote a fan made story about her. It was about how she became a famous teacher and how she inspired the whole world. When you got done, you put your hand on her stomach. You were still amazed at how much she could eat. If she honestly wanted to, she could probably eat you. You smiled, knowing that she had a good day. You kissed her on the forehead and let her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Princess Toadstool woke up first. Her belly was back to normal, and she went to the bathroom to get rid of the waste. Once she was done, she came into the living room to see you sleeping on the couch. A couple of hours later, she woke you up. She said she read the story you wrote and loved it.

You nodded, making her smile. You weren't sure what she was planning to do with you. She was kind of unpredictable at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you went downstairs to look for the princess. You called for her, and waited for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the kitchen, looking for something to eat. Hey, can you come in here for a second? I have a question for you. You walk into the kitchen, ready to work for her. However, when you saw her, you immediately blushed. The princess wasn't in her usual outfit. Instead, she wore slippers with long transparent socks. Her pink panties left her legs smooth and bare, besides her socks. She wasn't wearing a shirt, leaving her belly button exposed. She was wearing, however, a pink bra that only covered some of her breasts. Her outfit left you speechless. \"Too much, or not enough?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . Uh. . . \" was all you could get out. She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what I'm wearing today. I thought it would be good to wear something different.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where . . . Did you get those clothes?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From your mother's bedroom. I'm pretty sure she won't mind me using them for today. Especially since I'll basically be in charge of you today. You won't tell her, will you?\" You shook your head. \"Thanks. I'm hungry though.\" Princess Toadstool spreads some peanut butter on a piece of wheat bread. You couldn't keep your eyes away from her body, and she knew this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got yourself a bowl of cereal and sat down. The princess walked by you and pretended to trip. Her piece of bread fell on your bare arm. She grabbed it and put it back on her plate. Meanwhile, your arm was now covered in peanut butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, let me clean it up for you.\" She put her plate on the table and knelt down. She grabbed your arm and brought it to her mouth. Although you told her it wasn't necessary, she simply put her finger to your lips, telling you to be quiet. You could feel her tongue licking and sucking up the peanut butter. \"Mm.\" She moaned. She made sure to not miss a spot. Once she was done, Princess Toadstool grabbed her plate and sat down. As you ate, you quietly watched her. She ate her piece of bread like nothing happened. In a way, she was also tasting your DNA since it landed on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of you were done, you went into the living room. The princess sat down on the couch and took her footwear off, wiggling her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, is there anything you would like me to do?\" You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there is something on my foot. Could you check?\" She asked. You nodded and looked. You told her you didn't see anything. \"Look closer, I'm pretty sure something is on pulls your face closer and squinted. Then, without warning, the princess pulled her foot up, hitting you and making you fall over. Before you could get up, she put her legs on both sides of you. You couldn't help but look up at her panties.\"My foot does feel something. You. In about three seconds.\" Princess Toadstool lifts her right foot up and sets it on your chest.

He turned around and smiled when he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, what a pretty lady we have here, you're as cute as a princess. Can I do anything for you cutie pie?\" He asked, not realizing she actually was a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I DEMAND that you apologize to my friend!\" She said, looking as angry as ever. You face palmed, wishing she hadn't said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw but dear, he's just a nerd.

You big bully! Apologize now, or else!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, can't I take you to dinner or something? I know a good place that sells pizza with mushrooms.\" He said, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mushrooms? Are you kidding me? Do you know who I am?!?\" You didn't think this could get worse. That was, until Ricky made a move on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who you are, buttercup, but I would like to know your name. If you got to know me better, I'm sure you'll like me. After all, I already like you beautiful.\" He suddenly put his arms around her and started to kiss her on the lips. Princess Toadstool hesitated, shocked at first, then basically lost control completely. She pushed him back and took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You big pervert! I am princess Toadstool, ruler of the mushroom kingdom, and I will not tolerate this one bit! You want to date me? Fine, but you shall be tested first, let's see how you handle fighting a girl!\" Ricky took a step back, a little shocked at first. Before he could move, she clobbered him down to the ground. He struggled, but she wouldn't give in. She twisted his arms, and bit his chest. She got up and picked him up. \"Don't ever mess with me or my friend again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to spin, then released him, sending flying to the wall. He hit it and landed. Ricky was a little hurt, but was mostly just scared. He had never fought a girl, or lost to a girl at anything. He quickly got up and ran away, afraid of what would happen if he fought back. Princess Toadstool turned around to you and walked up to you. You were afraid she was about to hurt you as well for trying to stop her, but she just hugged you. You hugged her back.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" You tell her. She smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you won't have to worry about him ever again.\" She gives you a kiss and starts to walk to another exhibit. As you followed her, you looked around to see people staring. They had seen everything.

You introduce them to the princess and the princess to them. Now your father doesn't play games much, so he was a little uneasy about this. However, your mother was a big Nintendo fan. As soon as you told her who she was, she recognized her immediately. The princess got up and shook hands with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you.

Your parents said they would pay for it so Princess Toadstool could get anything she wanted. The princess took advantage of this, getting almost everything on the menu. It was a good thing your parents were rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, how did you two meet?\" Your father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fell through a portal and woke up in your house.\" Princess Toadstool happily replied. This made you a little uneasy, it looked like she wasn't holding much back. You only hoped she listened to your advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Hm, I wonder if . . Nah, never mind.\" You were about to ask what he was thinking, when all of the food arrived. As soon as it was placed in front of the princess, she started eating. Though Princess Toadstool used her manners, she was like a black hole, absorbing anything she could get her hands on. Everything Toadstool ordered went into her mouth: chicken, lettuce, soup, you name it. People, including your parents, stared at her. She didn't mind, though your face started to turn red. After a few minutes, the princess was done. She gave a satisfied sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like someone was hungry.\" Your mom said, giggling. Princess Toadstool blushed and apologized. Suddenly, she hiccuped. After a second, she hiccuped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is . . <i>Hiccup</i> that?\" She asked. You explained to her. Though it seemed weird, she probably didn't get them very much back in the mushroom kingdom. Your parents smiled and told her what to do. She nodded and listened to every instruction. You smiled, they seemed to be getting along. That was good, you didn't know how long Princess Toadstool would be staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all went home that night, satisfied. On the way, you explained the problem. Though your dad was uneasy (again), your mother excitedly nodded. After all, Peach, or in this case Toadstool, was her favorite video game character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One condition, you can't go into the basement. That's where I do my work. Don't go into our bedroom either.\" Your dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and don't think of sneaking into his room.\" You mother said, pointing to you. \"We wouldn't want you two to have 'fun'. She winked at both of you. You understood that she was implying that the princess should, but you didn't know if the princess got that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you were in bed. You were only in your underwear. You hoped Princess Toadstool would come up to see you. You wanted to talk to her. If she didn't come, you may have to go see her yourself.

Are you wearing?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your mother handed me this downstairs before the lights went off. She said I would look cute in it, and that she would give us time together, whatever we want to do.\" She replied. Of course your mother would try to hook you up with the princess. \"Besides, I don't care what the rules are in this house. I am a princess, they don't affect me.

I'm hungry, can't we get something to eat or do something fun tonight?\" She asks, giving a small kiss on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, just give me a minute.\" You say, not wanting to upset her. You got dressed and quietly opened your window. You climbed down and told her to do the same. Unfortunately, the princess saw no need to be quiet. She jumped down and landed on you. She was absolutely fine, however you needed a minute to recover. Once you were ready, you grabbed her hand and started to walk. Since it was night time, there was hardly anyone out. Luckily, you knew where to go for food at this time of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Princess Toadstool walked down a few blocks until you reached an ice cream store. You walked in and told her to get what she wanted. You brought a lot of money, especially since you saw how much she liked to eat. A cute female worker gave suggestions. The princess started to order ice cream cones. They all had every single topping. She chewed them down like they were nothing. On her sixth ice cream cone, she suddenly started to make a weird face. She gave you her cone and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Sorry, I should have warned you. If you eat ice cream too fast, you'll get a brain freeze. It's basically a headache caused by eating too many things that are cold.\" After a minute she recovered. You tried to hand her cone back, but she wanted to eat it a slightly different way, she made you hold it close to you and stay still, which was a little difficult since it was cold. Princess Toadstool then leaned in and started to eat it. She kept getting closer to your chest, until she was practically touching it. The royal girl then licked ant that was on your chest. It started to tickle, making you giggle. You looked at her. She looked beautiful in her jumpsuit, though it looked a little tight around her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next place you took her was the movie theater. You took her to see one of your favorite movies. At the end of it though, you looked over and saw she fell asleep. She had crumbs on her, and looked so peaceful. You carefully picked her up and took her back to your house. When you got there, the lights were still off. You sneaked in the front door and set the princess on the couch. You put her blanket over her and went to bed. That night, you dreamed of her being happy. She said she wanted to be close, and to never let you go. You woke up the next morning, feeling really good.

Be glad I'm doing this, not even Mario has gotten this close.\" Princess Toadstool wasn't planning to get up anytime soon. Suddenly, your mother came in and asked where you were. Princess Toadstool stayed quiet, but pointed down to her dress. Mom said nothing, gave a thumbs up and left. Meanwhile, you were having trouble breathing. You tried to call to her, but her dress prevented your voice from getting out. You only had one option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached up and started to tickle her stomach. She started giggling, you could tell because you could feel her shaking. You kept tickling, turning her small giggle into a laugh. You needed to hurry though, your oxygen was running out. You kept going, thinking you were about to faint, when she got up and moved. Light came into view and you could see your bedroom again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still giggling a bit. You told her what almost happened. She kept smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, if you fainted, I would have simply kissed you until you came back. Anyway, let's go to the kitchen, I'm starving.\" You told her you wanted to sleep in a bit more. She nodded and left. You went back to sleep. This time, you dreamed you were tiny and the princess was big. She covered you in her dress like before, however, this time a strange hand inside grabbed you. It brought you higher until you were at her underwear. Just then, her legs started to close in. Though you struggled, Toadstool was too strong. Just when the walls were on you, you woke up. You went downstairs to find . . .</span></div></div>",

You looked to see if anyone was watching and entered. When you got down there, you saw the Princess was looking at some weird bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! What are you doing here? What if dad comes in?\" You asked a little scared. She shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, your parents went out to a movie five minutes ago. We have this place to ourselves. I can see that your dad likes to create things.\" She said. You were worried that there might be a camera somewhere. Though you didn't like it, you also looked around. The two of you saw different inventions, one of them was a chair that could groom your hair. However, when the princess was looking at something else, you noticed a notebook on the table. You flipped through the pages until something caught your eye. Your eyes got bigger when you read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess . . . You may want to come here . . . Like now.\" You said. Princess Toadstool came over and read what you had seen. The letters at the top bolder and read \"<b>The Portal</b>\". Below it was a note from your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there is a problem with it. This portal can open up to different dimensions and bring people here or take people somewhere else. I've tried it once, but it didn't open, unless . . . It opened somewhere else, or it's delayed. If only I can make it so I control where it goes, then I could send my wife and son to the Mushroom Kingdom, since they like it so much. The portal still needs work, but I think it's almost done, I just need some help finishing it. I'll get a friend here when I can, though I won't tell my family. They shouldn't know yet, they don't even know how many things I have invented. I don't know how I'll tell them. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note stopped there. Both you and the princess were surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So . . I'm here because your dad made the portal?\" She asked. You shrugged, honestly at this point, you didn't know what to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we shouldn't tell him that we know, I don't know how he'll react.\" You said. The princess nodded and turned around. \"I'm sorry, I had no idea, if I did, maybe . . .\" You started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, it clearly says you didn't know, plus, there's no reason for me to be mad. From what I have learned, humans will do weird things. But enough about that, I found this weird gun looking thing, should we try it out?\" She asked, holding a green gun that looked like a water pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh go ahead, not like he builds weapons. Unless he has a basement under the basement that I don't know of.\" You say. The princess smiles and fires it at you.</span></div></div>",

You were a little surprised you could still speak English. However, Princess Toadstool ignored you and went up to your bedroom, making sure to close the basement door so your father didn't find out. She hid the gun under the bed and plopped herself on the bed. She held and kissed you. \"Can I go back to normal?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can't. I still need to brush and love you! Unless you want me to turn you into a fish and have me eat you, is that what you want?\" She asked. You shook your head. \"I didn't think so, now stay here.\" Princess Toadstool left the room, giggling. You were worried that your dad would find out, and worse, put you in a pound!

It felt good, so you got comfortable in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if dad finds out?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if he yells at us, I'll turn him into a guinea pig. He shouldn't yell at us for being curious. Especially since I'm a princess and he opened up the portal which kidnapped me. I think that's enough reason for me to be allowed downstairs.\" You smiled and licked her hand. She pulled out something from behind her. \"I also got you this, enjoy it.\" She pulls out a chocolate bar. Even though you're a dog now, you shouldn't be allergic to it. You ate it and burped. \"Good boy, now let's play.\" She said. The princess wanted to play . . .</span></div></div>",

She didn't think anything was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that the two of you sneaked out last night.\" Your father said. You knew that was a rule, to never go out at night. \"I think something else is up too. You two seem to be together a lot. So I want you to tell me right now, is there anything you're not telling me?\" You didn't know how to answer, you couldn't challenge him. However, the princess was more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so maybe we went out last night. However, we're old enough, so why are you worried? We just went out for ice cream, it's not like we went to a strip club or anything. Also, of course we're together a lot. First off, he's my best friend. The other reason is he's the only person I know here besides you and your lovely wife.\" The princess said, and hugged you again. Your father was still a bit mad, but he honestly couldn't argue with those reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, fine. I'll let you off the hook for now, but you better not sneak out again. If you do, I will punish you.\" He said and went into the kitchen for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. It feels like he's always trying to find a way to yell at me.\" You say. \"But is it true? Am I your best friend?\" The princess nods and hugs you a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you went to go get breakfast. Your mom had made waffles. Princess Toadstool loved them. She asked you to feed a bit to her. You nodded and used her fork to pick up a piece and put it in her mouth. The two of you giggled, however, you couldn't help but notice your dad was watching closely. Throughout breakfast, Princess Toadstool ate six waffles. When you had one piece left, she decided to feed it to you. Though you ate it, she accidentally spilled syrup on your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, let me clean it up.\" Princess Toadstool said. Instead of getting a towel, she leaned in and started to lick it up. Though you were worried about what dad was going to say, your mom just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it good?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, very tasty.\" Princess Toadstool replied. Your dad grumbled, but mom told him to be quiet and said the two of you were only having fun. You were a bit more relaxed when you saw your mom took your side.

And the Marios are helpful as they are well.....as you probably seen in the show we have been searching for someone to help free my people from King Koopa or as he's known to you Bowser and I'm sorry to say though the Marios have helped me and Toad out of plenty of jams they're really not what I'm looking for in a possible hero Mario's not exactly like the one in your games is he? He's more obsessed with pasta than helping me free my people and Luigi well he's a bit too much of a what's the word a wimp to be taken seriously at times! No I need to find someone else....someone brave and loyal to a fault.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone like me?\" You asked the princess tried not to blush and turned away instead as the two of you were headed through the neighborhood on your way to the nearest store for a bathing suit for the princess to wear <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes exactly but I wouldn't force you to come back with me if you don't want to_.  But it would be interesting to see what you could do you certainly look athletic and full of courage to me!

You only wore it for last Halloween, and it made you feel naked when you had it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can we switch to something else?\" You ask, a little embarrassed.

I just wanted Princess Toadstool to get to know you better. Come sit down with us.\" Mom said, patting the couch.

You sat down next to the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">You look good without a shirt on.</font>\" Princess Toadstool whispered, putting a hand to your chest. She kissed you and continued to watch. Over time, you got less embarrassed. Though the princess giggled at some points, you knew it wasn't to insult you. When the two of you got done, it was about 11:00 at night. You told them it was probably time to get to sleep,  up your mother and Princess Toadstool had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we play a few rounds of truth or dare, but let's make it more interesting. Just dares, and you have to do them.\" Mom said, the princess agreed. You knew there wasn't anyway out of this so you also agreed. The three of you sat in a circle. Your mom went first. She started small and dared the princess to kiss you on the lips. The princess crawled on top of you and kissed you. She moaned, loving this. Once she was done, she crawled off of you, but still sat close to you. It was her turn, and she wasn't going to hold back. You knew mom wouldn't mind either.

Looking outside, you saw no  package. After you grabbed them, you headed back to Toadstool. As you did, you shifted through the envelopes. You muttered, \"Junk, Junk, Junk.

The Bahamas. Says it also is a expense paid summer vacation as well. I doubt it's a winner,\" You said as you began to open the envelope in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you read it, Toadstool looked at the recipe magazine as she said, \"The last time I took a vacation, it was at Hawaii... although during that time, Koopa tried to take over the mushroom kingdom with a robot doppelganger of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...

Toadstool was nervous, but began to fight the crowd as best she could. After all, you were fighting as hard as you could to get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Kootie Pie wanted to go back to her normal self, she decided to wait and see. If you and Toadstool won, then she'd do her best to wedge herself between you and Toadstool, using her human form. If Koopa won, then she'd take you in as her pet.

Her face looked the same and she even still had her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to me!?\" Toadstool cried out, trying to cover up her body, even though it somehow had the ability to hide and protect her nipples and pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoopa drooled at the sight of her for a few moments before he said, \"I was trying to make you into a Koopa Troopa, but I guess I messed up somewhere and make you into a koopa queen!

She stared at her hands for a moment before she remembered she left a wand with you.

Ones like 'what it would be like if she kidnapped you?', 'how much you like sexy lizard girls that are bigger than you?', and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did her best to shake such thoughts off, but they kept coming, making her wonder if by the time she got to you, would she still be the kind Mushroom Princess Toadstool who loves you? ...Or Koopa Queen Toadstool who wants to kidnap you and have her nasty way with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater. when you heard a knock at the door, you opened it.

You shook yourself out of your pondering and picked up a thick broken umbrella pole. You then followed after Toadstool. \"She likes me enough that she is willing to beat up the koopa kids, but is that her or her new form making her do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh-Get her!\" King Koopa cried out, clearly afraid of Toadstool's anger, now that she was a koopa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHip and Hop began to fling spells at Toadstool. Kooky began to quickly modify the mind-controlling helmet to fit Toadstool. Bully and Kootie Pie decided that grabbing you would be the best option.

Though I kind of liked it.....it was completely disgusting!\" That was all you needed for a distraction as you slipped free and grabbed the wand from the ground and fired a beam at her immediately Kootie Pie's own polkadot hair bow grew to gigantic size and wound up crushing her as she began screaming to get it off of her the other Koopalings rushed towards you and you fired more beams each one had a different effect on the said Koopa Kid,Cheasty Koopa was turned into a worm,Big Mouth was made mute unable to talk at all,quite a relief to everyone around him,Hip and Hop were turned into stuffed doll versions of themselves,Bully was turned into a piece of brick and Kooky Von Koopa was transformed into a hourglass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Koopa was livid as he gibbered and dropped the mind controlling helmet which broke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you do that to my precious children!! You're going to pay for that human boy!!\" As he himself made a bull rush towards you but you instead of firing a beam at him you threw the wand at the princess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess heads up!\" She nodded and leaped into the air tackling Koopa in the style of a quarterback and managed to catch the wand and fired it at herself transforming back to her human/mushroom self <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! It feels so good to be back to my regular self! And as for you Koopa take this!!\" And she fired a beam at him sending him and the still transformed Koopa Kids back to the Mushroom Kingdom before snapping the wand in half <br>\r\n\"There that takes care of them for a while! Without this they won't be able to bother us again.\" She explained to you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's good and all Princess Toadstool but we got a new problem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong now?\" She asked curiously you told her to look down at herself and she gasped outloud <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? OH NO I-I'M COMPLETELY NAKED!! And there's still people here!!\" She cried as she tried to cover her private parts with both hands while she blushed bright tomato red \"Ohhh why did I just destroy that wand and not use it to create some decent clothes? This is highly embarrassing especially for someone of royal status!!\" You tried not to stare at her but it was completely impossible as she was completely stunning <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and this isn't even a private beach!\" You joked but she wasn't in the mood <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for jokes_. We got to get out of here before someone spots me like this! Quick pick me up and carry me back to the beach house!\" She commanded as you did as she ordered........</span></div></div>",

He took it down for you and you go to pay for it. You then took the tv into your trunk and you drove off. You've then noticed that she's upset while you were driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Toadstool?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that I feel kinda disappointed that I'm not a real person. But rather, a creation of someone's imagination. It's like I have no existence from the start. Like I have no purpose anymore.\" Toadstool said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel bad for her and can't blame her for feeling this way. Finding out that you're just a fictional character must be a gigantic pill that's hard to swallow. You then try your best to cheer her up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. It's okay. I know it must be hard for you right now after realizing the truth. But, you're here now. That makes you real to me. So, don't give a rat's behind that you're a fictional woman. You know what you got to say? You have to say \" I am who I am. I'm me and I'll always be me. No matter what.\" You want to be more than what you are. You want to be who you are. And that's the most beautiful, greatest, happiest girl I have ever met. That's the truth,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool was surprised and moved by your words. She then let a tear fall down while smiling. Maybe there is something that's worth her living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really mean it?\" Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then drive off back home and Toadstool said that she needed to be alone. You nodded and she went into her room. For a while, she hasn't come back out. This really devestating for her and you. You then have images about her pretty face in your head and can't deny that you may have a crush on her. She does have a stunning look on her every time you see her. You then decided to</span></div></div>",

Once she was done, she gave a satisfied burp and patted her tummy. You smiled and took both of your plates to the sink. As you wash the dishes, you can't help but notice that Princess Toadstool is smiling at you. You're starting to feel glad that you're her friend and not her food. You walk back and sit down with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So princess, can I ask you some personal questions?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I know what you're going to ask. You want to see my private spot, right?\" She said, putting her hand down there. You suddenly feel really embarrassed, causing your face to turn red like a tomato. The princess laughs. \"I'm kidding. What do you want to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um . . Well .  . What's your height and weight?\" You struggle to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you calling me fat?\" The princess gets a serious look, making it hard for you to speak. She then smiles and starts to giggle. \"I'm kidding again, stop worrying so much.\" You didn't feel any more confident, but you tried to worry less like she said. The princess told you her exact height and weight. \"You know what, this is what we'll do. Once you ask a question, I'll ask one, sound fair?\" You nod. She then asks you the same question you asked. You tell her the truth, though it made you feel short. She was interested though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, my next question is this. What do you like to do for fun when you have free time, like when you're not captured or running the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I like to play sports, and I also like relaxing in the sun. What about you?\" You tell her you like to draw pictures or play video games. You tell her that you could draw a picture of her later if she wants, making her really happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So princess, what's your favorite color and food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love pink, you can tell by the dress. As for my favorite food, I love peaches. They're pink and are soft and juicy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, ironic considering your counterpart is also named peach.\" You say, giggling. She then asks you the same question again. You tell her your favorite color and food. \"Okay princess, I have a serious question. Why were you so hungry before? I never see you apart anything in the TV show.\" She giggles as if it was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got really hungry because it looked really tasty. Besides some fruits, veggies, pizza, and pasta, you never really see anything unique. You're salad was veggies, but it was different veggies combined, which I almost never get to have.\" She says starting to look sad. You try to cheer her up by saying she can have whatever she wants here. She smiles again, ready to ask her question. \"So, do you have any friends, and where's your parents?\" You were caught off guard by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my parents are on vacation, and gave me the house to look after for about a week. As for friends .  .\" You stop talking there, it was a little awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, tell me.\" She persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, besides you and my buddy Stanley, I have almost no friends. In school, I was a nerd who liked school, and around that time, nobody else liked school.\" The princess gives you her sad eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you have two friends, right?\" She asks, trying to cheer you up now. You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that is good. Anyway, so what's it like being a princess . . When you aren't captured.\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a lot of things are done for me, so it's a carefree life, usually. I do have to go to meetings and visit towns sometimes, but they're typically fun. So, what's it like being a human in your world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, people typically work for money, and do most things themselves. When they have time, they spend money to go to fun places and act like a child. That, or they're on their devices the entire time.\" You look at the clock and ask her if she wants to walk around town. The princess does, but has one more question first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you said you have few friends, but do you have a girlfriend?\" She asks directly. You start to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't. I wish I did, and if I do get one, I hope she's as great as you.\" You saying this, made the princess blush. You decided to step away from this conversation and took her hand. The two of you took a walk, you showed her many places that you liked to go to. After an hour of walking she asks you . .  .</span></div></div>",

If that's not your thing, I have an apple slicer that you might like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess let out a sigh of relief before she said, \"Anything sounds good.

In fact, they both love anything deepfried or plain unhealthy. Luigi once turned into a chickensaurus because of one of Koopa's schemes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she found the apple slicer, she said, \"Oh! So all you have to do is push this down on the apple?

Perhaps none of the mushroom people were lazy enough to think of inventing it?\" you asked as you finished the sandwiches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool used the apple slicer on a couple of apples as she answered, \"Maybe. Thanks for the complement, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled a little as you helped prepare the plates of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then returned to the couch. You asked, \"Ready for more of the cartoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Toadstool answered. \"Perhaps we should watch the one where I came out of again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded as you set it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, nothing happened. Toadstool sighed. \"Maybe we need to wait a day and try it around the time where I appeared in this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly. I don't know much about magic,\" you answered. \"How was the sandwich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious! Where did you learn how to make it?\" Toadstool answered, cheering up quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents. My mom likes to follow cook books, but my dad likes to experiment and try out new kitchen gadgets,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool smiled before she asked, \"Can I take a look at some of the cookbooks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she spent a couple hours, just reading the cook books. You merely watched her, enjoying how she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she noticed you looking at her, she asked, \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Just enjoying how you peaceful and beautiful you look as you enjoy yourself,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool blushed and hid herself in the book. After a few moments, she quietly said, \"T-Thanks... It's been so long since I either had a long enough time to lose myself in a good book or been complemented on my beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to be of help,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...

Her visiting video Game Land could lead you and her to joining the real Princess Toadstool and the Mario Bros on their adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you didn't want even the slightest risk of Robot Toadstool to either cry or get destroyed. There also was the threat of Kooky taking back control of Robot Toadstool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... What if the Mario bros or the original princess don't like you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobot Toadstool paused as she pondered your words. After a few moments, she seemed to get less cheerful, but said, \"Even if they don't like me, all that matters is your opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... do you know a way to get to Video Game land?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a spare bathtub?\" Robot Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the basement,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Robot Toadstool turned the spare tub into a warp pipe, the two of you wound up near a sign that read, 'Welcome to the Mushroom Kingdom!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope the Mario Bros and Princess Toadstool are here and not on one their adventures,\" You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobot Toadstool nodded before she held up a picnic basket and said, \"And if they aren't, we'll at least have a nice picnic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two of you headed to a large.... well, it looked like a combination of a large house and a castle, right near a small house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Data tells me that small house is Princess Toadstool's,\" Robot Toadstool answered. When you looked at her in a confused manner, she explained, \"She doesn't like to show off her wealth, but she does like looking over the history of the mushroom kingdom royalty. There's also the symbolism behind the royal heads residing in the kingdom's castle in times of crisis that inspires hope in the mushroom people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. It sorta made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of you knocked on Princess Toadstool's front door.</span></div></div>",

Hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting story. You see, I was originally created by Kooky von Koopa to impersonate you, but I was rebuilt by Mr. Will here to be his bodyguard. Luckily, he was good enough to also give me a lot of free will! So...\" Robot Toadstool explained, as she gestured to you. \"I decided to become his lover and asked if we could travel around Video Game Land to announce it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... nice,\" Toadstool muttered, feeling a tad jealous of her robotic doppelganger.<i> 'This Will certainly must be a genius if he managed to get something good out of a Koopa creation. Though by how he altered her body, he is a bit of a pervert, but he is kind of cute...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Well, I love him!\" Robot Toadstool said as she hugged you, pressing her bosom against you and making you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love her!\" You said, returning the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to royal training, Toadstool was able to hide her feeling of jealousy as she smiled and thought, <i>He loves you because you look like me! Just because you were made to look sexier than me, doesn't mean you can keep him!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I guess us lovers should go on a picnic before we go on our roadtrip!\" Robot Toadstool said before she gave you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An-and before we forget, is it possible for us to help you and the Mario bros on your adventures?\" You asked, feeling a little nervous speaking with royalty. Both Toadstools found it a bit cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to ask Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Yoshi, but I think we'd like the extra help. You never know what evil schemes those Koopas might come up with next!\" Toadstool answered.</span></div></div>",

There, Willy saved me, but now I need your help in freeing him from Kootie Pie's grasp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool blinked before she asked, \"You're that robot? Well... I guess I can see why Mario and Luigi couldn't tell you were a robot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I originally was made of metal and had visible bolts, but looked just like you. Willy gave me the upgrades,\" Robot Toadstool answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... so is that why Kootie Pie kidnapped him?\" Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worse! She... hypnotized him into loving her!\" Robot Toadstool said with an angry growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That brat! She deserves a great punishment!\" Toadstool exclaimed. \"Let's come up with a plan to free him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a few systems that can disrupt any kind of energy. I just need to study a magic wand and I bet I can undo its effects!\" Robot Toadstool said as she briefly changed her right hand to some kind of laser gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go show Kootie Pie what happens when you double Princess P Power!\" Toadstool said, enjoying the rare chance she got to use her special catchphrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to, but she has a remote that can force me to obey her. When I entered the castle, I went out of the remote's range,\" Robot Toadstool replied with a sad tone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool thought about her options for a few minutes. When she came up with a plan, she said...</span></div></div>",

This is proof of it. I chose to collect the memories from your old machine and put them on to a new storage medium. This beauty here is running a 64-bit Linux distro and her old system can't match the specs of the new hardware, even if you overclocked it. In other words, your old hardware and software are gone,\" you tell him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do with it?\" Kooky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in the trash cans outside. If you want it, you better hurry. The trash truck should be arriving soon,\" you answered seeing if they'd believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Koopalings rushed outside and started going through your trash like they were a bunch of raccoons. You found this very entertaining as you laughed watching them. Truth was you took the old parts to a recycling center days ago. In addition, you made sure to do some formatting so data from there couldn't be recovered from it. On the one hand, this could be seen as a good thing for the Koopalings as it would reduce any sensitive data from the device from falling into the hands of criminals. On the other hand, it meant even if they did get the parts back, they'd be starting from square one again with getting her back together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are my old parts out there?\" Robot Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I just told them that to see if the trash would take itself out and look what's outside,\" you said as the trash truck arrived emptied the cans into the back of the truck, Koopalings and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my old parts aren't out there, where are they?\" Robot Toadstool asked next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't bring myself to throw them out or destroy them, but at the same time, I didn't want to use them when tech has improved so much since then. As such, I took them to a recycling center. Hopefully they'll end up being put to better use than the Koopalings would ever try to,\" you explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Linux and why did you pick choose to use it on me?\" Robot Toadstool asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linux is a kernel for operating systems to run on. It's also free to use and free to modify, which is why there's so many different Linux distros such as LinuxMint, Debian, ZorinOS, Puppy Linux, Arch Linux, and Fedora to name a few. Different Linux distros have their own features, purpose, and software included. Many distros and programs for Linux are cheap or even free to download and install,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else I should know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In addition to having a number of ports for connecting to devices, you also have the ability to connect to some devices wirelessly. I've also taken some care to set up security measures and filters to keep you from accessing dangerous stuff and to make it harder for bad programs to try to take control. However, if you want to know about your hardware, you can use the Wifi connection. I set it up when installing the security and updates. On that note, you might want to make sure you install updates when are any as they fix security flaws and improve performance. If you want to know more about what your hardware specs are, there should be some diagnostic programs you can access,\" you explained.</span></div></div>",

You even had the two TVS side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a particularly close thunder came along with a very bright bolt of lightning, you decided to stop before anything bad would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were about to set your console to turn off, you stopped when there was a ripple on the screen, like the TV screen was made of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" You uttered as you got up and poked at the TV. Indeed, it was like the screen was made of water. A thought occurred to you about the other TV, the one that was showing the Mario Cartoon. That screen was also like water.  \"This... is weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the screens began to ripple once more on their own, getting faster and faster. You bent down to study it, when you heard the sound of someone crying out like they were in the middle of falling. Then came two pink comets, one light pink and the other regular pink. They knocked you onto your back. The Two TVs, video game console, and DVD player all shut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you took stock of your situation. You were on your back with two women on your back. One was dressed like Princess Peach from the later Mario games, and the other was dressed like Princess Toadstool from the Mario Cartoon. You didn't speak, as you kind of liked having their rather attractive bodies pressed against yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow... What happened? Last thing I remembered was looking in a new warp pipe,\" Toadstool asked as she slowly stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?\" Peach asked as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth princesses looked at and studying each other. Eventually, Toadstool said, \"I am Princess Toadstool of the Mushroom kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach looked shocked and said, \"but how? I am Princess Peach of the mushroom kingdom! I've never heard of a Princess Toadstool, other than an odd nickname I like having for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I once had the nickname of Peach, but I'm sure I'm the only princess of the mushroom kingdom at the moment,\" Toadstool answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth princesses were looking a little concerned and annoyed at each other. Before an argument could break, you said, \"I think I can answer that with a theory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Princesses looked down and were both concerned for your health. They both helped you up. You continued, \"Ever hear of the Multiverse theory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I once heard Professer Nerdnick mention something of it, when trying to figure out a way to help the Mario Brothers home,\" Toadstool answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I once listened to Professer E. Gad's speech about it. It's also how I compete with a lot of other beings in races, sports, and...\" Peach said. She looked sheepish as she added, \"Fights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah, Let's do a quick rundown to doublecheck. Coinflips; Heads in one universe, tails in another. Shirt in one universe, sweaters in another. Redheads in one universe, blondes in another. That ring any bells?\" You asked. Toadstool and Peach looked at each other before they nodded. \"So with that out of the way, I think you are analogues from different universes. And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Peach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two of you wound up in a universe where there is fictional media that probably seems a lot like your adventures,\" You added nervously. You tapped the TV screen and found them solid. \"You came out of the TV screens, but they're solid now and I don't know if there is any warp pipes to get you back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Toadstool picked up the game box that had Princess Peach on it, while Peach picked up the DVD box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Toadstool said, \"Huh... I do hope they're fun to play...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And safe to watch. some things are quite dangerous and scary in my mushroom kingdom,\" Peach said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too,\" Toadstool replied. Both princesses smiled at each other, sensing a kinship. \"You have easily scared mushroom people and a koopa king that likes to kidnap you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach let out a happy gasp as she said, \"You too? I do love my people, but I sometimes wish they could stand up for themselves during some of the nastier threats. As for the Koopa king, mine is named Bowser. That's their name in your universe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bowser as well, but we all call him King Koopa, since calling him by his name is being too personal for our liking,\" Toadstool answered as she and Peach traded the Game box and DVD case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Whose hungry? I can whip up some hamburgers and side dishes,\" You said, wanting to join in on the conversation. Both princesses looked at you and stepped up close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are kind of cute up close,\" Toadstool said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Peach added. \"but It would be rude for uninvited guests to simply sit back and let their host cook all by themselves. So let us help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo You and the princesses began to cook dinner. As they helped you cook, the princesses occasionally made a flirting attempt with you. However, one princess' flirting attempt did not go unnoticed by the other. In fact, one princess' attempt at flirting seemed to invite the other to flirt in mere moments.</span></div></div>",

Once they realized that not only was someone else there, they looked up and was shocked to see themselves, but different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" The Koopa princesses shouted as they pointed at each other. \"I am-No, stop speaking when I speak-quit it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of silently glaring at each other, Kootie Pie spoke up. \"I... am Kootie Pie Koopa, princess of the Koopa Kingdom and daughter of King Koopa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right!

It didn't take much for her to connect the dots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put it this way, this world influences both our worlds,\" Kootie Pie said as she picked up the DVD and the game cartridge. \"You might say that we are reflections of each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter handing the two to Wendy, Kootie Pie continued, \"We could team up and take on the stupid Mario Bros...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you mean like when Dad teamed up with a paper version of himself,\" Wendy replied. \"But unlike him, we actually have brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKootie Pie then said, \"So let's see if we can set up a base here and- Crap! The princesses are here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What makes you think that?!\" Wendy angrily asked. Kootie Pie pointed out the Window. It took a few moments for Wendy to see that the princess and you, since the three of you were far off and still walking around. She looked back at Kootie and growled, \"Curses! Now there's two of that pesky princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's set a trap!\" Kootie Pie said as she produced her wand.

You're both technically the ruler(rulers)of the Mushroom Kingdom!\" You said but neither paid any mind to what you just said instead they stared at you plainly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he's nice to me! Unlike you,you blonde haired harpy!\" Toadstool hissed \"And I'm certain if he had to choose between the two of us he'd choose me as I'm far more prettier and nicer!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? And what makes you think that? I have been in video games far longer than you have! And am far more popular besides most guys like him and Mario in general go for the blonde nowadays!\" Peach shot back <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares how long you have been in video games Peach!

She then held down your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you saw that both Toadstool and Peach's eyes looked weird. They looked flat, glassy, and had a slight swirl to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toadstool? Peach?\" You asked before Toadstool began to kiss you on the lips.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">The being who exited the purple swirling vortex that had spontaneously manifested in your living room appeared to be a young woman. Her skin was fair and yellow-toned. Her face was round with a rounded nose. She had large, round sapphire-blue eyes framed by two, thick lashes and lengthy eyebrows. She had short titian hair that went to her back She stood at a height of \u00b1 172 centimeters (5 feet 8 inches). The stanger\u2019s attire was composed of a floor-length yellow evening gown with two frilly, orange trimmings at the dress opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my goodness,\" You whisper to yourself. \"It's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Daisy!\" The woman greeted in a chipper tone, waving her right hand at you. However, she stopped upon seeing your shocked state. \"Um... Hey, buddy?\" She tried getting your attention by walking over to you and snapping her fingers, but you still remained petrified. \"Hmm, what else can I try?\" Daisy muttered, her left hand gripping her chin in thought, before she smirked mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were still attempting to process the situation here. How on Earth could a video game character just randomly pop up in your house? God knows how many laws of nature and science are being ripped apart by the mere possibility of her presence. Your mind flashes back to that bizzare crossover game, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, where those annoying precursors to the Minions arrived in their Time Washing Machine and attained access to a device known as the SupaMerge helmet, which can merge any two objects together into a single entity. Naturally, chaos ensued and they along with Mario and company were sucked into an interuniversal vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more obtuse scenarios ran through your mind, you felt the sensation of lips gently pressing against your left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! W-wut... What?!\" You shouted in a barely coherent manner, though you were soon drowned out by the uproarious giggling of the orange-clad princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA! You should've seen the look on your face!\" She exclaimed between bouts of laughter, rolling on the wooden living room floor. \"It was priceless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been snapped out of your daze, you blushed and stare daggers at her. \"What did you that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds, Daisy rose to her feet and her laughter softened to a light chuckle. \"Hehe, sorry, but it was the only way for me to get you to notice me.\" She apologized before extending her right hand out toward you. \"Let's try this again. Hi, I'm Daisy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated for a second before shaking her hand. \"My name's Ty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ty, do you think that you can tell me where I am?\" The princess inquired. \"The last thing I remember doing was taking a walk through my kingdom. Then, this vortex appeared above the ground and sucked me up into it. Next thing I knew, I was walking through a strange hole that lead me here. I don't think I've ever been to this part of Sarasaland before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't immediately answer, not sure <i>how</i> to answer the young woman. \"Uh..well...this isn't Sarasaland. You're in my living room, Daisy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you said I'm not in Sarasaland?\" She asked, you nodding in agreement. \"Well, it was nice meeting you, Ty, but I have to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy quickly waved farewell to you before turning around to go back into the portal... however, just as she was about to enter, the portal closed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no.\" Daisy moaned. \"Now I'm stuck here!\" She then turned back toward you. \"No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.\" You stated. \"But if the portal appeared out of nowhere once, then it might appear again. All we have to do is wait and hope that the portal shows up again, then you go back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy nodded understanding. \"I certainly hopes it does appear, but what do we do in the meantime?\" She asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned widely enough to match Daisy's previous ones. \"Are you hungry?\" You asked as you gestured towards the Kitchen. \"I can whip something up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" The tomboy princess agreed as the two of you headed towards the kitchen. \"So, what's on the menu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's some pizza in here.\" You replied. \"But, if that's not healthy enough for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?\" The princess chuckled. \"Pizza has four of the five food groups: the grain is the crust, the vegetable is the tomato sauce, the dairy is the cheese, and the meat is the toppings. It's, like, the healthiest food ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's hard to argue with that logic.\" You concede as you take out a extra large meat lovers pizza and put it in the oven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the pizza warmed up, you and Daisy conversed. She shared her tales of adventure and fun with Mario and crew and you teased her about her relationship with a certain green-capped plumber. She took it in stride though, much to your relief. You would NOT want to be on the wrong side of her wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the pizza finished baking and you take it out of the oven. As you sat it on the table and left to grab some plates, napkins, soda, cups, and a pizza cutter, Daisy gazed at the incredible Italian delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" She uttered, wafting the spicy aroma to her nostrils. \"I can only imagine how it will taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't have to imagine for very long.\" You said as you grabbed what you needed as laid them on the circular metal table. \"What type of soda do you like? I have Pepsi, Coca-cola, Root Beer, and Sprite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not familiar with those brands.\" Daisy admitted, getting her own plate and napkins. \"I prefer Koopa Kola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want, you could sample these and see how they stack up to yours.\" You suggested while cutting the pizza into twelve slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good with that.\" Daisy agreed, taking four cups and pouring two-liter bottles of each soft drink into them. \"Thanks for the grub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou filled your own glass of Pepsi and grabbed a couple slices of pizza.\"You're welcome. I hope you enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me,\" Daisy said, coating her slices in Parmesan cheese. \"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next thirty minutes, you two ate dinner. Daisy took a bite out of her first slice and her eyes sparkled in awe. The gooey cheddar cheese was melted to just the right viscosity, not too runny to be a liquid soup but not rigid to be a solid brick. The bread bed beneath was fluffy and soft, absorbing some of the moisture from the tomato sauce like a sponge. The pepperoni slices were sprinkled with spices, as was the sausage and ham. And the thin blanket of Parmesan cheese complimented the other flavors without overwhelming them. All in all, it had made for an experience that nearly caused Daisy's taste buds to explode in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my... \" The regal figure muttered quietly. \"This... is... AWESOME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer energetic exclamation got your attention and you looked up from your meal to see Daisy scarf down the rest of her pizza in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you like the pizza.\" You teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy merely nodded before stuffing her second slice into her gaping maw. You could've sworn that she unhinged her jaw to get that down in a single gulp. The woman must have felt pretty parched after that, because she immediately proceeded to down her Coke, draining her entire cup in five seconds flat. What surprised you most was how little her stomach stuck out from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe repeated the process with her remaining slices, alternating between two pizzas and the Root Beer, then the Sprite, and lastly the Pepsi, until she had finally finished her meal. You had only consumed four slices and one cup of pop, yet Daisy managed to finish faster despite eating eight slices and four cups<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That pizza hit the spot.\" Daisy stated, rubbing her belly, which had finally distended against her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was the soda?\" You asked as you take both of your garbage and put it in the trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, it was ok,\" Daisy responded mild-mannerly. \"None of them hold a candle to Koopa Kola. But if I had to gave an arbitrary numerical rating, I'd say that Koopa Kola is a solid ten, Pepsi is a six and a half, Coca-cola is a six, Root Beer is a five and a half, and Sprite is a five.\" Daisy stated before thumping her right fist on her DD cup breasts. <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><i><b>*BBBBHHHHHOOOOOUUUURRRRRAAAAAPPPP!*</b></i></span>\" </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burp of uniform tone blared forth from the depths of Daisy's digestive tracts. It sounded akin to the roar of the mighty Koopa King himself, although it possessed the unique characteristic of smelling like partially two-thirds of a pizza, a pint of carbonated beverage, and stomach acid. Said stench assumed the form of an opaque emerald fog that threatened to pollute you entire house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the burp was enough to literally blow you away, as you found yourself being propelled straight toward your living room couch, you hair now a disheveled messy mop. Such a disaster-piece of a belch exploded for a grand total of ten seconds, after which the epicenter of the eruption only had two words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me.\" She giggled sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you recovered from your flight and tried to fan away the toxic fumes encircling you. \"Daisy, you are something else.\" You said amidst the constant coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you're not bad either.\" Daisy said as she approached you, completely unnerved by the noxious cloud surrounding her. \"Sorry about stinking up your house. I got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize. It's cool.\" You said. \"I can just open all of the windows and air this place out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, after that chow down, I feeling pretty sluggish. Can I sleep with you on the couch while I digest?\" Daisy requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy laid down on the couch, her head resting on your lap. You blushed as you rarely have intimate interaction with females in your world, let alone a completely different one. She closed her eyes as she began to digest her big meal. You found her to look rather cute while she is asleep and soon join her in slumber.</span></span></div></div>",

M.. ar..io..\" her grip suddenly tightened as she pulled back, you looking up at her as her glazed teary blue eyes in some awe and sadness. \"How'd I get here, who are you?\" She asked timidly, I tried to move my arms to have her let go, but moving my body I felt my bulge grind against her thighs and stopped trying <i>that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo..u came through a p-portal, I'm Jack..\" stammered out, she rested her head on my own head's side and sobbed quietly. \"My universe is gone.. Bowser failed.. bu-\" her grip tightened more, it hurt slightly and it was hard not to grunt from it. \"I can't feel <i>anything</i>.\" She said somewhat dull, before loosening the hold and looking at my own eyes with a seemingly weak forced smile, I could tell her eyes were full of depression.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jack, just.. I have nobody.\" Hesitantly said, I had to opt to help her. Whatever she went through seems traumatic on its own, and kicking her as fragile as she is around would be horrible. \"No problem, uh- Rosalina, you can stay with me for now? \" I was nervous with her gaze, and her ass against my bulge made my member rub her thighs and.. <i>crack</i> some.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love ever to.. thank you.\" Gracefully ignored by her, I'm glad my bulge died down as my arousal did when I saw her curvy frame against her dress as she stood off.

Honestly I'd crushed on her when I was younger, makes me feel somewhat bad for still thinking of <i>crushing</i> on her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of silence and her stepping back a few inches, \"Ca.. may you show me around here?\" I obliged and nodded, hastily turning towards the hallway to the kitchen as she'd look at the other hall. I stopped hearing her footsteps to turn and see her slowing and seemingly in awe over outside, she frowned with emotion. Her entire observatory, Mario and them are just gone? <br>\r\nRosalina sped up and entered behind me, slipping behind with speed before getting around the center counter and looking at many of the utensils and kitchen sink and sorts, she smiled weakly but.. grief, what a world to live in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened a cabinet to get a short glass of water, pouring it as she'd reach for one of her own, bringing down a big glass mug. I watched silently as she filled it up to the top, almost a full gallon! <br>\r\nShe chugged it down and her body pressed against her dress, I just averted contact to the sink's window as she was just chugging it all to avoid my own weird thoughts. Looked back just as she set the mug down on the counter with a satisfied small sigh, her heartfelt smile toward me was somewhat flattering and somewhat confusing. \"Parched.. your world's very different.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how she is I'd think other people wouldn't be as hospitable, this world <i>is</i> completely different. \"Not even I know to much.\" Walking back to the last hall leading to the sliding door, downstairs, and the bathroom, she surely stopped at the fridge. Only a few seconds was spent there before she caught up, hard to tell if she is hungry..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our bathroom, and 'our' is my parents, they're out on vacation..\" she frowned slightly, looking back at the back porch with the pool and lawn chairs, then to the closed downstairs door. \"Where do I go th-\" <br>\r\n\"You can to.\" I cut her off and she was slightly surprised,  though her eyes remained a little glazed. <br>\r\nI'd show her to the back and she knew what the pool was along with the chairs, but she refused to go out until I was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I went downstairs and showed her our <i>other</i> living room with a PS4 and mini-kitchen, even the laundry room.

This made me slightly relaxed for some reason, but she silently nudged her head on my shoulders as she'd arch her legs some to press me against her more.. I'd assume?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..rry, just..\" her low crying was like a small sobbing, her grip around my chest tightened a little, and honestly I'm just confused on how to feel or act now- \"My Luma's would be.. here, now..\" Then she loosened the grip, and me pressing against her body, eu- my erotic sense is <i>to</i> wild. \"It's fine, reall-y!\" She moved her hand slightly lower around my waist and I stuttered barely, she'd notice that easy.<br>\r\nThen my butt suddenly fell between her legs as she spread them slightly, my head hitting her breast, ah- I am able to feel her heat going lower and I move up to try and avoid getting stimulated. Rosalina pulled me down again and pressed on my back, honestly just making me a start a real small immoral turn-on from the feeling. \"Just comfort me, please..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust.. I relax and lean back, closing my eyes and trying ignore my thoughts while focusing on her situation.  Rosalina had looked down at him often in her flurry of tears, and she'd seen Jack's changing bulge. She'd vaguely know why he was like that but was oblivious as to why he would be like that now. Her thoughts were occupied with her fallen Luma's, Mario and them all being <i>gone.</i> <br>\r\nI'd sit here in her hold rather comfortable, my mood had calmed as I'd wanted it to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina had silently observed him sitting with her, and she was honestly wanting to try and make them both more comfortable seeing her circumstances weren't going to change anytime.

I went to sit on my bed while she looked at my desktop and dresser, along with my TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina looked in my dresser drawers for a few seconds before turning to me and walking over, then turned her back at me. Scooting to my bed's wall she jumped onto my bed and right next to me, uncomfortably-ish I pressed against her sides and crossed my arms. \"Question, why so tense?\" Oi, that flustered me, might as well.. \"I find you- appealing.\" Her smile stood on there, she pressed her body on my side some. \"What about me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything?\" Silence for a dozen or so seconds, then she scooted off of my bed and faced me with a still-red face. I think I knew what she was <i>trying</i> to do, then she slowly brought her dress up while smiling wide. \"Well-\" I- this was getting me hot seeing her frame, then with a yank she pulled her dress off. <br>\r\nI averted my eyes some but glanced still, seeing her with nothing but white panties!

Throwing the sheets over me I faced her while she lifted them, she eyes my body as she faced me going under the sheets.

Nothing came out. Kinda anticlimactic, there. You were expected some unearthly figure from another dimension to emerge from the portal and blow your mind with knowledge or warnings from beyond your world that would no doubt fall upon your planet as you know it.<br>\r\nInstead the portal just disappears, leaving no trace of it whatsoever behind, and your living room returns to being the way it was. It was if the sudden crash boom bang never happened to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly bizarre. But sadly, nothing spectacular. It just was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief out of this world experience left you scratching your head.<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d you say to yourself, \u201c...that was\u2026 something?\u201d You'd chalk it up to just a minor acid trip, but youre sure you skipped out on taking acid today\u2026<br>\r\nNevermind. You just shake your head and turn back to the direction of the back door to resume your precious star watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhehehehe...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until you heard the sound of giggling behind you. You turn around and in no time at all, the giggling stops. Nothing's there. Just hearing things? Anyways, back to the star watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehehehe...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as you turn to the backdoor, you hear the giggling again. This time it's closer. You squint your eyes and quickly turn to the direction of the giggling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gasp!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a surprised gasp but nothing's in front of you! If you didnt know any better, you coulda sworn you caught a glimpse of woman in white at least for just a nanosecond! Regardless, whatever you think you saw, you aint seeing it now.<br>\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d was all you let out before turning back to the backdoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehehehehe...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you hear the giggling. This time it was much closer. Not only that, you could feel ice cold breath blow against the back of your neck with each giggle. You stayed perfectly still, keeping cautious and trying to assess the situation. But all the while the giggles didnt stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehehehehehaaaaa\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you caught a glimpse of the reflection in the glass of the back door. You could make out a pale ghoulish figure behind you giggling in sync with what you were hearing! A white haired woman in a fancy white dress with a pink polka-dotted crown grinning your way with purple blood-shot eyes, letting her tongue almost the size of your arm slip right out her mouth with each giggle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c!!!\u201d you immediately whip back around faster than the speed of sound!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeep!\u201d you caught a brief glimpse of this ghoulish woman yelp in surprise just before putting her hands over her face! Then just like that, you saw nothing at all! A GHOST!! YOU GOT GHOSTS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHO'S THERE?!!\u201d you whip out the gun from your pocket like you would against any home intruder and start demanding, \u201cSHOW YOURSELF!!\u201d You wait patiently pointing your gun at nothing in particular as gaze all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little time passes, but nothing appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon! I just saw you!\u201d you state, looking up and down left and right for the ghost, \u201ccome on out now! You cant hide from me!\u201d You wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you wait some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pant hard, shivering a bit, expecting something to pounce on you the second you lower the gun. If you'd build the courage to look in the reflection again, you'd have looked like you seen a ghost (ba dum PISH!).<br>\r\nQuite an awful lot of time passes before you begin to soften your nerves. You turn your attention away from what isnt even there and look at the gun you were brandishing. Then you start to feel silly. Seriously, you were actually gonna try to SHOOT a ghost? Even if a ghost was really after you, what good's that gonna do? It's not like the bullets are enchanted or drenched with holy water or some crap! And how are you explain this to the cops when the neighbors call 911 from all the racket you made?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d you finally lower the gun and smack your forehead, \u201cwhat the heck is wrong with me?\u201d On the plus side, this bit of embarrassment cooled your nerves. Maybe you were just hallucinating things. Maybe you actually did slip in a little acid shot today! You really need to cut down on the stuff before you start hallucinating vampires, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh to yourself and put the gun away. \u201cWell\u2026 THAT was something!\u201d you repeat yourself. And with that, you decide to resume your star searching without any more interruptions. For the remainder of the night, it was peaceful and relaxing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, the uh, oddity wasnt over. Far from it. In fact, that wasnt the last time you saw your 'imaginary' ghoulish intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, when did you start hearing the giggling again?</span></div></div>",

So your second course of action would be to brush off the ghostly girl youre seeing as a long-lasting figment of your drug-induced imagination and resume your bathing in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a mistake. For when the late Princess finally stopped gawking at the naked commoner and his physique which was awfully fine and kept in optimal shape despite his lower class status, she had decided to do what came natural. Natural for a Boo, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Flush!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!!\" you jumped up into the air at the ice-cold sensation that hit you out of nowhere! For a brief moment, the shower water raining down on you went from luke warm to freezing your balls off! It didnt last long, but the goosebumps and blood rush you got from the rapid change of temperature hitting your body took a while to go away. You groaned and peeked out of the shower to see the toilet finishing it's awfully long convenient flush. A stupid prank. Now who couldve done that if youre the only person in the house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Squeak squeak squeak*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GEEZ!!!\" the ice-cold water comes back with a vengeance and this time it STAYS there! You rush back over to notice someone flipped the nobs to Cold at it's max! Shivering from the blistering cold, you quickly readjust the knobs to set it back to warm as soon as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Squeak squeak squeak SQUEAK!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GYAADD!!!\" And now it's too hot! You had only a second or two to notice the knobs moving by itself before being burned with scalding hot water! It was so hot, you couldnt bare to stand in the stall any longer! You rush out, almost tripping on the wet floor, and just think 'SCREW IT' and just get your things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad your things werent there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, your clothes were gone. You remember where you left them, right on the counter next to the seat. They werent there anymore! No sign of them!<br>\r\nYou begin to panic as you checked the floor for a towel to dry off with.<br>\r\nNo towels either! All of the towels were gone! ALL of them! But you just had them all washed and put away like yesterday! How could they all be gone already?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd uh... who turned off the shower? You sure as heck didnt. Youre pretty sure you paid your water bill. It couldnt have been that ghostly figment of your drug-induced imagination, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to take any chances, you burst out of the bathroom buck naked, ready to dart out of the house\u2026 after you find a change of clothes first! Provided your clothes arent missing too, of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as soon as you step out of the bathroom, you find yourself in the middle of a long, dimly lit hallway. A hallway more suitable for a fancy mansion than a small little bachelor house. This hallway consists of 18th century candelabras, neatly painted vases with exotic ferns (some of them alive and snapping), painted Victorian portraits of female nobles (one of them with odd green curly hair, red bows, and wielding a purple fan all snobbishly), and glass windows which outside reveal a harsh thunderstorm in the middle of a barren wasteland!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026 these drugged up fantasies are getting WAY outta hand,\u201d you mutter to yourself, desperately denying the sheer horror developing within you. You walked down the nearly endless hallway, hoping to somehow wake up from this bizarre nightmare, but you never do. You pretend the distant high-pitched giggles echoing across the walls dont creep you out either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if hallucinating about walking down the creepy hallway of a haunted mansion wasnt horrifying enough for you, all the candles suddenly went out at the exact same time. And everything got so dark, you couldnt see the hand in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things could not get any worse, you just had to do the dumbest possible thing at the moment and ask how could this get any worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud high-pitched howl could be heard from the other side of the endless hallway you were stranded in! You couldnt see the howling figure in the darkness, but you could make out the glowing red eyes gazing into your soul. Your instincts tell you to stay perfectly still and not to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But then you saw it's incredibly bright wide grin appear out of nowhere and all bets were off!<br>\r\nYou dashed away like a bat out of Hell, trying to get as much distance from the beast in the shadows as possible while conveniently placed adrenaline pumping speed metal played in the background!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridors that were the endless straight hallway twisted and turned, but you had no time to question it what with a ferocious smirking unseeable monster chasing after you!<br>\r\nYou at least managed to see a door and without a second thought dashed through it and slammed it shut behind you. The room looked to be a small plain guest bedroom with a bed, closet, and a wardrobe cupboard. With no window to jump out of, you jump into the cupboard and hide in the little pile of dresses inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conveniently placed speed metal quickly changed to slow pounding, not unlike a heartbeat, as if switching from 'YOUVE BEEN SPOTTED' to 'YOURE ALMOST IN THE CLEAR, BUT ONLY ALMOST'!<br>\r\nAnd to prove it, you hear the door open and the heavy panting and pacing from your stalker, no doubt prowling around the room in search of you!<br>\r\nYou take very little breaths, despite being exhausted from the chase. Sure enough, this spontaneous experience took a lot out of you. One minute youre seeing a stage fright ghostly girl laughing behind your back and the next youre stranded in a haunted house buck naked and hiding from a monster! What kind of drugs have you been taking to have THAT kind of disturbing imagination?!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, cuz too much of you actually believes what youre experience is real, you take no chances and remain hiding in that cramped cupboard in absolute silence, hoping for the monster to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long waiting, the pounding in the background finally stops and...</span></div></div>",

If you had to sum up her description in just one word, the one coming to mind would be FERAL. Other words like 'grizzly', 'beastly', 'animal-like' and 'not housebroken' would be a close second (if 'not housebroken' was only one word!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her feral sass, you also detected royalty judging by the pink and white polkadot crown on her head. Maybe she's a princess or something from wherever it was beyond that portal. So many more thoughts, theories, and questions came to mind, but nothing was getting resolved just staring at this grizzly girl like a drooling idiot (nevermind SHE'S the one drooling!).<br>\r\nIf you wanted answers, you'd best get them from the source and start asking her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou introduce yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hi, I'm-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRUFF RUFF RUFFF!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYAAAGGGGHHH!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind, she lunged at you and you ran off screaming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being fancy dressed, she charged at you on all fours, snapping her teeth at you and barking like a starving dog! Fortunately, by the time she cornered you against a wall, she almost choked herself with her own collar in a failed attempt to pounce on ya! She kept attempting to reach for you, but something was restraining, preventing her from getting any closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, the iron necklace of hers was actually a chain collar. Looking past the growling princess, you see a big wooden stake sticking deep into your carpet that her collar is chained to. Really sucks that it's tearing up your brand new carpet, but that stake is the only thing keeping Princess Sharptooth from sinking her jaws into your throat and tearing your body to pieces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrr!! Grrr!!\u201d infuriated with the chain, she kept tugging at it and biting into it to no avail. The iron mustve been hellastrong. This gave you a bit of time to catch your breath, but just a single breath alone was enough to bring her attention back to you and go \u201cRUFF!! RUFF RUFF RUFF!!!\u201d At the moment she was less a princess than a wild dog on a tight leash! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever brought this oddity into your house, you'd find it amusing if you werent pinned against a wall with little to no space to shimmy around the feral girl on a chain leash!<br>\r\nAnd despite the chain, she kept constantly reaching for you and barking, \u201cRUFF RUFF!! RUFF!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-N-Nice girl... good girl...\" you calmly spoke while you looked for a safe way around her or at least something to draw her attention away. You werent going anywhere and she wasnt about to let you. Though the chain was damn near indestructible, youre certain that wooden stake wasnt. If that thing breaks or pops out of the carpet... teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to quickly think of a way out of this sticky situation while you still had the time. Since she's barking like a dog, does she know how to fetch? Maybe you could toss something her way and she'll chase after it, giving you the opportunity to flee the house!<br>\r\nBut then another thought comes to mind. Maybe you can try to communicate with her? Surely, if she's so elegantly dressed, she cant possibly be THAT primitive! Surely she's completely lacking manners and royal civility! Would it really be that farfetched to attempt to talk with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you wanna do, best do it quick! She's clearly not the patient type!</span></div></div>",

I never seen a horse quite like this!\" She exclaimed taking a step back as the actual roar of the engine no doubted terrified her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a animal at all princess...it's a sort of mechanical device called a car.\" You said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A c-car? My goodness! It looks fercious! A-are you certain it's not some sort of monster?\" She asked timidly actually pulling out her sword at her side(unlike other versions this Princess Zelda was more trained in physical combat).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I reassure you it's perfectly safe. Come on it won't hurt you at all. It's not even alive princess.\" You said but still she held back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but then how does it make that strange noises then if it's not alive?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm actually controlling it from in here. Come on it's completely safe.\" You pressed her as finally she nodded and slowly climbed in on the passenger side looking at you curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright...anyway thank you for rescuing me..ohhhh!\" She let out a loud outcry as you started up the car and started to drive off down the road. \"My word! I thought you said this 'car' thing wasn't alive!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not princess.\" You replied your hands on the steering wheel. \"I'm controlling it with this circular thing in front of me.\" You carefully explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright then..but y-you said there are no castles around here? None at all?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm sorry but we don't have any castles or fortresses in this era Princess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what kind of era or place  may I ask is this?\" She asked curiously looking out the glass covered window at the scenery before her,at all the mailboxes,road signs and people's houses and lawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called America or the USA...Ohhh you must mean what planet you're on I mean Earth,you're on Earth.\" You replied as you turned down the road to your own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"America? USA? Earth? What odd names... And you said your name is Max?\" She asked studying you carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How incredibly strange but nonetheless I do thank you for your kindness towards me..my word this is certainly a strange kingdom I'm in. Do you have a king or queen in this America-Earth?\" Zelda asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it's just America and its not really a kingdom at all it's more of a country with dozens of smaller places or pieces of lands what we call states. Right now you're in a small town of Richmond,VA and....\" You start explaining but she interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a town? Oh you mean like Kakariko?\" As her face brightened but you shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the town you're in right now is a bit more advance compared to your kingdom's own. You'll see in just a bit...er what are you doing?\" You ask a bit annoyed as she began touching your shirt and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes are incredibly odd,I have never seen such designs and symbols like that one(pointing at the Nike symbol on your T-shirt)before. Are you a sorcerer by any chance?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? No I'm not you see magic doesn't really exist here in America even though we are familiar with it.\" You said as you slowed down to let a car pass by you on your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you have no magic? But how do you create all this...this stuff then?\" She asked arching a eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain a big later Princess Zelda.\" As you finally stopped the car right in front of your parents' driveway and got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your home?\" She asked as you helped her out of the passenger side and she began looking around in awe at your lawn and porch area to the front of your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah since you apparently have nowhere else to go,I was thinking maybe you can stay here for the time being princess. We have plenty of room and I have no problems with providing you with anything you may need.\" You explained as you told her to follow you into the house to which she nodded giving you a sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes thank you,I'll love to stay here at least until I can get back to my own time in Hyrule.\" A bit later the princess asks you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please tell me the truth where am I and why have you kidnapped me?\" She asked raising her voice as she stood up at first you though she was going to attack you but she stood her ground folding her arms \"Give me a answer as princess I demand immediate respect!\" She said in a serious tone <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you the truth Princess Zelda I haven't kidnapped you and you're in my house don't worry no harm will come to you Princess.\" After a while Zelda gave you a small smile <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-I guess you're telling the truth so I believe you-but you say this-this is the year 2017?

When you told her where she was, Midna shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't really matter. As long as you don't work for Zant, I'm fine with you. How about you show me around, I need to see what I have to work with.\" She said. You nodded, and motioned for her to follow. However, she didn't feel like following at the moment. Instead, she hopped into the air. Before you knew it, she landed on your back. When you started to object to this, she covered your mouth with her hand. \"Now now, be a good boy and show me  around.\" She said, petting you like a dog. You sighed, realizing you weren't going to convince her to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you showed her your house, you didn't mind her being on you. She smelled nice and was mainly kind to you, aside from a few jokes. When you showed her your bedroom upstairs, she got off and jumped right on your bed. She got comfortable and motioned for you to come closer. You knelt next to the bed, looking at her beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided to stay here for a while. As an added bonus, you get the best job ever. You get to be my servant, and like a servant, you'd have to do exactly as I say. Don't worry, I won't make you do anything too harsh like eat trash. Right now, I'm hungry so get me some food.\" She said, giving you a smile. You nodded and did as she said. Although you weren't sure how you felt to be her servant, she was really cute, so you wanted to make her happy. You went down to the kitchen and made her the best meal ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You happily brought it up to the bedroom. She was currently checking out her nails. When you set it down, she told you to kneel and feed her. You rolled your eyes and did so. You were careful not to bring your hand too close to her mouth. You filled up her belly, making her satisfied. When she thanked you, she grabbed your hand and brought it closer. She slowly licked it, sending shivers throughout your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, you also taste good. You better be glad that you're a human, because I would have you in my stomach already.\" Midna let go and asked you to . . . </span></div></div>",

I might have to look for a smaller controller for you if you want to play PC games with me, though. \" Midna's attention turns towards the window as she notices it is still daylight outside and says, \"There might be a bit of a problem. I'm not exactly good with sunlight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a second and realized she is right. You'd be taking a risk if you took her outside during the daylight hours. Granted, you may be in the car most of the time, you didn't want to take a chance on it. You realized there might be something you could do. \"I might have an idea. I do have something was created to prevent people from getting sunburned. Maybe it would be what you need,\" Midna looked a bit shocked to hear what you just told her. Was there really a way the Twili could walk in the sunlight without any harm? \"Now you have my attention. How do you keep a Twili safe in daylight hours? You'd have to block the sun,\" Midna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out a bottle of sunblock from the dresser and answer, \"This will do that for you when it is applied to your skin.\" She put her hair out like a hand for you to squirt the sunblock on. Once it is in her palm, she rubs it all over her body. You squirt a little on your hand and get some spots she wasn't able to get. You decide to bring the bottle with you as you get your phone and car keys. Even though you had plenty left in the bottle, you figured that having an extra bottle or two wouldn't be a bad idea. \"So where do you want to go to first? Which ever we go to first won't be as crowded if we went to it later, so it is your call,\" you tell her as you head outside and lead her to the car. You then help her with the seat belt. Thinking about it, maybe you should consider getting a booster seat for her. Yes, she might not like being treated like a child, but it might be a good idea given her size, you weren't sure a regular seat belt would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got into the driver's seat, Midna finally answers your question.</span></div></div>",

I tried to move towards it to see what it was, and that is all I remember. But enough about that. You didn't tell me where I am.\" You told her she was on Earth and that she was in your house.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're suddenly engulfed by a kiss. She holds you tightly, making it impossible to escape. You're surprised at how happy she was. Suddenly, Midna moves closer, making you fall onto your back. Midna is still on top of you, kissing. Even though your parents wouldn't be home for a while, you had a feeling they wouldn't approve. Midna finishes up the kiss and sits up on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was really fun. I'm glad I have such a . . Loyal . . Friend.\" She says, softly brushing some of your hair to the side. She gets up and grabs your arm, helping you up. You smile and hold her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad I have such a beautiful and fun princess for a friend.\" You say. She leans in and kisses you again. Midna walked downstairs, leaving you in her bedroom. \"She's such a great person.\" You say to yourself. You followed her downstairs to the kitchen. You can see she had gotten into the Oreos. However, the way she was eating them caught you off guard. Instead of chewing them, she put the Oreo on her tongue, pulled it in, and swallowed whole. You watched the bulge go down her throat. \"Whoa.\" Was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you notice how I eat? It's only for small things like these, but it's still fun. Would you like to feed me?\" She asked. You simply nodded, making her smile. The two of you went to the couch and got comfortable. You pulled out an Oreo and held it in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright pathetic creature, you're about to be lunch for my beautiful princess. You better feel lucky, after all, you're going into her belly whole.\" Midna giggled, she wasn't expecting you to act like it was alive. You set it on her tongue and watched her swallow it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, this is a good use for them. Maybe this will teach their species not to mess with Giants.\" Midna liked playing along. You kept doing this for every Oreo until you got to the last one. You started to set it on her tongue when she stopped you. \"Hold on, I know this one. It has hurt a lot of people and tried to take over an entire kingdom. For this reason, I want to lick up its insides and crush its outsides with my teeth.\" Midna giggled. You shuddered but did as she said. You pulled the Oreo apart and held the piece with the cream in front of her. Midna slowly licked it up. \"Tastes good, not the body, one half at a time.\" She said, grinning. You slid the first piece onto her wet tongue, then the next. You watched her teeth grind them up, you also could see her snake like tongue rolling around, tasting it. Midna swallowed and got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy it, my princess?\" You asked. You shuddered at what you just experienced, even if it was an Oreo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did. Be glad I'm not going to turn you into an Oreo, because you have seen their fate.\" Midna laughed at her joke and laid on you. The princess soon fell asleep on you, you didn't mind. It was nice knowing she trusted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really are something special Midna.\" You said quietly and fell asleep as well. During your nap, you dreamed Midna was eating real people. She swallowed them as if they were candy. You were her size, so she couldn't eat you. She did, however, lean in with a tiny female that looked like Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon-appetite, my handsome prince.\" She said and dropped her in your mouth. You couldn't control yourself and chewed Zelda up. \"Perfect, only one meal now.\" She said and leaned it. You soon saw yourself going into her mouth and down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly woke up. You looked at the clock next to you, you were only asleep for an hour. You looked down at Midna, who was still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mm, you taste good.\" She mumbled. Clearly, she was having a similar dream. You decided to test something by putting your finger next to her lips. Midna leaned in and grabbed it with her mouth. She started sucking on it and moaned. When you tried to pull it out, she grabbed your hand, preventing movement. \"Don't run away, I'm not done with you yet.\" Midna mumbled in her sleep. You decided to go along with it and let her taste your finger. She didn't bite or hurt you so you didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna eventually woke up and saw your finger in her mouth. She pulled it out and started to question, making you tell her everything, from your dream to the fact you were doing an experiment and and then wouldn't let go. Midna nodded, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's why I dreamt of tasting you. In my dream, I grabbed your arm and started to suck on it, you were good. Be careful next time, because I might actually try to eat you.\" Midna said. You nodded, making her smile. \"Alright, enough of that, how about we . . .</span></div></div>",

You let out a long sigh as you catch  sight of your soon to be ex-girlfriend, \"What do you want Jackie?\" You ask as you lean against the door to prevent Jackie from catching a sight of Midna. \"You know why I'm here! You and I had a date scheduled for yesterday but you never showed up!\" Jackie nearly shouts at you as your eye begins to twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's 3 reasons why I didn't show up bitch 1. You have a looney love shrine dedicated to me in your closet 2. You're obsessed with me to a point it's creepy! &amp; 3 You are just plumb crazy!!!\" Jackie gasps out in shock, as she runs off not able to think of a retort or comeback. You then scream at the sky as you go back to the door and open it, startling midna as she was leaning against the door trying to listen to you &amp; your ex. You don't have the energy to say or do anything so you just let Midna put her hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry that happened to you.\" She says concerned, you just sigh as you say \"Thanks Midna but I'm happy that I don't have to worry about her anymore. She was crazy and if I didn't nip that in the bud it would have just gotten worse over time.\" Midna just smiles and says \"Well if you need to talk about it or anything just let me know.\" You smile and nod in thanks  as a curious look crosses your face. \"Ya'know Midna there is something I've been wondering about..\" You say trailing off as Midna asks \"What would that be?\" You then ask her...    </span></div></div>",

You couldn't tell what she was thinking, but her face looked annoyed. She reached for her weapon, only to realize she didn't have one with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello there. My name is-\" You started to say, however the Gerudo thief cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, who are you? Are you helping Gannon?\" She demanded and stepped closer. Even without her weapon, you knew she was probably still dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like Gannon. He hurt many people in Hyrule! He turned the future into a world of monsters, and not the good kind of monsters.\" Nabooru stopped moving. She seemed to calm down a little, but you were still nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you aren't working for Gannon, prove it by answering all of my questions.\" You nodded and watched her sit down. She mainly asked about the area she was in, like where she was and who you were. After you answered her, you turned on your GameCube and showed her \"Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time\" to prove that she was no longer in Hyrule. When she saw it, she nodded. You explained exactly what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please believe me when I say I don't work for Gannon.\" You plead. Nabooru simply smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright then. I believe you.

You then head to your room and get your keys and wallet. You then noticed your stun gun. You had gotten it after a nasty break up and worried something might have happened, but hoped you'd never need to use it. You decided to bring it with you in the event that something then return to Nabooru. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk outside she takes a look around, then asks, \"Where's your horse?\" Everything seems so strange to her as she looks around. The roads weren't made of dirt or sand. Instead it looked like rocks and some kind of strange black substance to here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me please,\" you say. You then guide her to the passenger seat of your car, then open the door for her and tell her, \"Please have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets in and asks,\"What exactly is this thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my car. It can travel much faster than a horse, and will likely be a new experience for you. By the way, look to your right shoulder. There should be a safety harness device there. It's called a seat belt and it needs to be fastened in to a socket that's to the left of your hips before we can get started,\" you tell her. She does as you tell her, then you shut the door and head back to the driver's side, open the door, sit down,close the door, buckle your seatbelt, then put the key in the ignition and start the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drive, Nabooru asks you about things that seem new to her. She asks about radio in the car, what the roads are made up, what those \"strange leafless trees with wires on them\" are, and some other questions. You couldn't blame here for asking these questions. If you were in an unfamiliar place, you'd probably have some questions too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you pull into the parking lot of a restaurant. However, before you got out, Nabooru remembers something. \"I think forgot to ask you your name.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Alex,\" you answer. The two of you unbuckle your seatbelts and exit the vehicle to enter the building.</span></div></div>",

How did you get them?\" Nabooru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not going to pretend to be a mind reader, but it seems they were after you. I used this on the 'Kathy' and 'Kelly', thus stunning them, which resulted in them dropping their wands. Once they hit the floor, I switched them with a couple of twigs before turning them against them,\" you tell her while showing her the stun gun and the wands. Nabooru looked proud at what you managed to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not proud of stealing from and conning the elderly, but at the same time I had a bit of a bad feeling about what they'd do if I didn't take that chance to get these away from them. It would be irresponsible on my part. I'm actually wanting to destroy them the first chance I get. By the way, I want you to keep this. It's called a stun gun,\" you tell Nabooru as you hand her the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems like you might be a hero worthy of a rank among the Gerudo. We might be a mostly female tribe, but a trophy like those wands would be something that could earn one a lot of respect even if they're an outsider. Plus you\u2019ve pretty much saved everyone here. Anyway, how do you use this?\" Nabooru says while examining the stun gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you've ever had a crossbow, it's something like that. You aim and pull the trigger. The range of the device is limited, but it will briefly paralyze the target. Of course, you can only use it so many times before it stops functioning. That's when it will need a recharge. I'll show you how to do that later,\" you explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be holding you to that. After all, there is no point in having something to defend myself with if I don\u2019t know how to use it,\u201d Nabooru says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she finishes telling you this, your order arrives and you both enjoy the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving home, the first thing you do is explain to her a bit more in depth how to charge it. \u201cThis here is a USB port. They come in many shapes, but this type is a USB type C. The good thing about it is it\u2019s reversible, so you don\u2019t have to worry too much about struggling to get the cable in correctly,\u201d you explain as you plug the cable into the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this end of the wire for?\u201d Nabooru asks as she stares at the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best way to describe it is that\u2019s it\u2019s a legacy port. It\u2019s on many devices and still continues to be the standard port for many devices to this day. While charging the batteries inside of devices like this up to allow them to be used is one purpose of them, it\u2019s not the only use for them.\u201d you answer as you plug in the adapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that box for?\u201d she asks next with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe device is charged when it\u2019s plugged into the wall. The good thing about this is it can be swapped out with other ones if needed,\u201d you explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if you lost the wire or box, you\u2019d only need to replace one of them,\u201d Nabooru says as she gets the idea of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d you tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru gives you a kiss and says, \u201cIt\u2019s nice you\u2019re looking out for me. I think you can guess what happened to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, fire and ice messed up big time and you were sent here,\u201d you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Nabooru confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should probably show you around. I don\u2019t think I gave you a proper tour earlier,\u201d you say thinking a bit about earlier. You then proceed to show her around the house. Afterwards, Nabooru goes into the guest room you show her and changes her clothes. When she returns, she\u2019s wearing her game clothes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next?</span></div></div>",

She had gone to the top of Death Mountain with the other sages when a bright light appeared. Now, there was some strange Hylian touching her without permission.

I want to know where is Cia?\" She asked. You put a hand on her shoulder. You told her that she was on another world, you knew who she was and how you knew and that the portal closed. You also theorized that Cia didn't get sucked in like she did. Surprisingly, none of this shocked her. Her reason was anything was possible, and being a video game character wasn't as bad as you might think. You gave her a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you can stay here until the portal reopens. I'll give you access to the whole place, sort of like if you were living here.\" You said. She hugged you and thanked you. She held onto you for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell good by the way.\" She said and stepped back. You blushed, then showed her around. You gave her the guest bedroom, which looked a lot nicer than your bedroom. There was a bathroom connected inside the bedroom, there was also a window and a closet. She asked you to leave her so she could take a shower. You did as she asked and went downstairs. As you waited, you looked online to see if you could find a reason this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found some stuff about the portal, but there wasn't much about going in it. You started to get frustrated when Lana called you up. You went upstairs, but stayed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lana? Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you bring me a towel? There doesn't seem to be any in here.\" She said. You told her alright and went to get one. You brought it back and told would leave it outside the door. Once you left the room, you started to think. The only explanation you could think of was that the portal brought creatures from different worlds the whole time, and the one she encountered was out of control or something. You also thought that she might have been big enough for it to close on her making it so that Cia wasn't pulled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps behind you. You turn around to see Lana. However, she wasn't dressed, she was still holding a towel to cover herself. You blushed, trying to keep your eyes up at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but is there anything else I can wear? I want to wash my regular clothes.\" She said. You got up, avoiding eye contact and told her to follow. You took her to your parents bedroom. You didn't know if this was a good idea, but you were willing to try it anyways. You searched their dresser and pulled out some of your mother's clothes. Without looking, you handed them to her. She giggled. Though this was a normal reaction, she couldn't help but find it funny how you were embarrassed to look at her in her birthday suit. She decided that after she got to know you better, maybe you could see more of her skin. You might even be able to replace Link for her. The thought excited her, that she didn't have to worry about Link being with Zelda anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on the clothes you gave her. You were told to turn around and see her. When you look, she was barefoot, wearing a pink shirtsleeve shirt and tight jeans. She asked how she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look . . Beautiful.\" You said. She hugged you, making you blush. When she let go, she knew what she wanted you to do.</span></div></div>",

As you got ready for bed, you thought about how cute she was. You were determined to help her have fun tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up the next morning, feeling something heavy on you. You wanted to open your eyes, but you needed to get used to the light. When you tried to stand up, you heard some giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you're awake. Good, because I can't wait to see this world.\" The voice said. After a minute, you remembered what happened last night and opened your eyes. Lana was smiling at you, while sitting on you. She was back in her jeans and full of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Lana. Please get off me and give me a minute.\" You said. Lana smiled more and leaped off you landing on her feet. Though it hurt a little, you more surprised how high she could jump. You got up and got dressed. You decided to take her somewhere for breakfast. When you were ready, the two of you walked to the closest restaurant. On the way, Lana looked at the different people. She was fascinated to see what they wore. When you got inside the building, Lana hugged you. She loved the smell and the way the place looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" She said. It was funny how easily amused she was. You helped her order some eggs and bacon. You ordered the same thing. When the two of you sat down to eat. . .</span></div></div>",

It was still a little awkward having her wear your mother' she clothing, but you were glad she liked them. You sat her down at the table and started to get food for her. She excitedly watched you work. After about ten minutes, you had gotten box stuffing, broccoli, some milk, and a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich for her. For dessert, you had ice cream. You set the plate down in front of her. Without hesitation, she started to eat it. \"This is amazing!\" She said, making you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana ate pretty quickly, you were surprised at how hungry she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can I ask a question?\" You asked, she nodded, but kept eating. \"Before you and Cia were separated, and I mean at the start before Gannon was defeated or before Cia got Wizzro and Volga, what was your original name?\" Lana swallowed and used a napkin to wipe her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can guess from the names of Cia and Lana, but my original name was Ciana. It's something I don't really think about often. Anyway, what is for dessert?\" She asked excitedly. You looked down to confirm her plate was clean, literally. She had licked her plate so there wasn't any crumbs or spots left. You took her plate and put it in the sink. As you got the ice cream out, you suddenly felt a tongue on the back of your neck, making you shudder. \"You taste good, can't i have you for dessert?\" Lana giggled at her joke. As you filled up a bowl for her, you could feel her arms around you. You felt really comfortable around her. The two of you went into the living room and sat down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, could I . . Uh . .\" You started to say. She looked at you, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Do you want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that. It's just . . Could I . . .feed you?\" You asked and then shut your eyes with embarrassment, you didn't want your new friend to think you were weird.

Really?\" Lana nodded and opened her mouth. You grabbed her spoon and put some ice cream in her mouth. She swallowed it and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh . . Please keep going.\" She said. You could tell she was relaxed. You kept feeding her until you ran out. You started to take the bowl back to the kitchen, but she stopped you. \"Bring it here and lay down. I want to do something fun.\" You were confused, but you listened. She then told you to trust her and take off your shirt. You nodded and did so, you were really curious as to what she had in mind. Lana moved her spoon to the table and held the bowl. Before you knew it, she was pouring the ice cream that had melted onto your belly. It was cold and tickled. Once that step was done, she put the bowl on the table. \"Mm, I'm going to enjoy my dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana leaned in and started to lick up the ice cream. You private spot got hard from her licking your tummy, and she knew it. Once all of the ice cream was gone, she put her hand on your crotch. It was really sensitive right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like you had fun, I bet you want me to touch you, huh?\" She asked, making you embarrassed. Lana . . .</span></div></div>",

However, Mipha doesn't seem as flabbergasted. She looked at you up and down. She looked around the room, carefully looking at small details. When Mipha saw the couch, she sat down, she figured it would take a while for this Hylian to start talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply waited for a response. Meanwhile, a lot of things were going through your head. First of all, you couldn't believe a real live zora was in your home. Second, you couldn't believe it was a zora princess. Another thing you couldn't believe was she was here, alive and breathing (since she died in Breath of the Wild). With all of this thinking, your head started to get dizzy. You tried to get stable, but eventually passed out. You dreamed of Mipha, being close. You remembered Link's memories of her, and how helpful her ability was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you could see Mipha's face. She had your head in her lap while she was healing some scars that you had from previous years. You struggled to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mipha . .\" You started to say. She looked at you, a little surprised that you knew her name, but then smiled and pushed you back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't speak, please relax. I'm still healing you. I can tell from just looking at your scars that you have had trouble in the past, these aren't normal scars. I'm guessing someone hurt you.\" She said. You wanted to cry, her theory was correct. It had been your step-mom, whenever she got angry, she would take it out on you. Mipha moved her hand to catch a tear going down your cheek. \"It is alright, I too have been hurt in the past. I want to help you. Also, don't worry about explaining anything to me. When you passed out, I helped you onto your couch and looked around. In your world, I wasn't truly real until now. I'm also guessing you aren't a Hylian, are you?\" She asked. You shook your head. Mipha brushed your hair. \"Maybe later you can teach me about this world, would that be alright?\" You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipha finished healing your scars and helped you up. You didn't really understand how she was taking this so well. When you asked her, she smiled and said there were a lot of unusual things in her world, like Calamity Gannon, or the Divine Beasts. She asked if she could get some fresh air. You nodded and led her to the backyard. You noticed that it was daytime. She stepped in the grass. You felt a little awkward talking to her, when you knew her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mipha listen, there is something I need to tell you. In your game, you . . \" you start to say. Mipha turns around and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It's not necessary. I already know, I saw it on your device, the one that looks similar to the sheikah slate.\" She said, referring to your IPad. \"So I may have passed away in Hyrule, but I know Link will save it. To be honest though, I don't remember much before I got here. I remember being trapped in Vah Ruta, then a bright light appeared. I took some steps and appeared in your home.\" Mipha laid down on her back and stared up at the sky. \"Please, come lay next to me.\" You hesitated, but then listened. When you got comfortable next to her, she held your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're beautiful, you know. The girls at my school would be jealous of your looks, and all of the guys would want to be with you.\" You said, you didn't know if that was a little creepy to say, but she turned her head and smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the compliment.

You thought she would never eat fish since she was technically one. You brought this up, making her smile. \"I guess it is weird to think, but if you have been to Zora's Domain, we do sell fish there. Besides, I'm sure in your world, bigger fish eat smaller fish, right?\" You nod. \"Now ask me some questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start off with a simple question like what was one of her favorite memories (which involved her friends).

You decide to test it out with the Game Boy Color version of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX. As you were about to place the black cartridge into the device, you hear a strange noise and go to check it out. To your surprise it was Marin from the game. You check on her and notice's only sleeping. You then get an idea. You decide to turn the roles around. In the game, she brings Link from the beach and takes him to her bed to watch over him. You figured you might as well do the same for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring her to your room and place her in your bed, but decided to stay near while she slept. While you were considering watching her sleep, you figured that might seem too creepy for a first encounter. Just to make it harder for you to walk away from her than your console clone, you instead boot up your PC, sign into the Steam client, and play some Dead By Daylight, which is pretty much a survival horror twist on the game of tag. You decided to go with survivor since finding a game seems easier that way. You pick your character, equip your item and choose your offering before joining a match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later, you're playing as Bill from Left 4 Dead and you're at the Hawkins Lab map. You wondered who you were facing. You were thinking it might be the pig at first, but you eventually saw that it was the iconic 1980s horror character that the game refers to as the nightmare. About a few minutes of repairing generators with the other survivors and some close calls, you were able to escape the lab in the game. As the results screen showed up you started to hear yawning from behind you and knew Marin was waking up. You close the game and decide to turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a relief! I thought you'd never wake up! My name's Alex,\" you tell her. You thought it would be interesting to quote a bit of her early dialog from the game to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, why haven't I seen you before? Where am I?\" Marin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found you in my living room. You arrived asleep. I believe it was a portal of some kind that brought you here, but I'm not sure. As you can guess, you're not where you came from, you're in the United States of America,\" you tell her. Her response was to hug you in a mixture of emotions. You couldn't tell what she was feeling. She was curious about life beyond her island, so being here and meeting someone new might be exciting for her, but at the same time, there was something bothering you. It was the truth about her island and that she might not be able to go back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're here, I'd like to tell you that I'll let you stay with me from now on. I'm not sure if you'll be able to get back to your island, but maybe it's better this way,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I wanted to explore lands away from that island. I'll accept your offer,\" Marin replies. You could tell she wasn't aware of the truth of her island. You didn't want to burden her with that knowledge if you didn't have to do so.

You look closely and you were shocked as this woman has blue eyes, dark navy blue hair with yellow hair clips, a white hat with a pokeball symbol on it, a red scarf, a black dress with a tint of white on the top and pink on the skirt part and pink boots with long black socks on. You recognized her as Dawn from the Pokemon series. You were amazed that you're seeing one of your favorite characters right in front of your eyes. You also blushed as you can see her white panties underneath her skirt as you covered your eyes while Dawn gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh. My head hurts.\" Dawn groaned as she rubs her head before seeing you. \"Oh! Hi there!\" Dawn greated nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" You greated back as you still covering your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you covering your eyes like that?\" Dawn wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed down below her and Dawn looks down to see what your pointed at. Dawn yelped as she covers herself by crossing her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's why.\" You said still not looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn gets up and you peeked to see that it's good to look. You sighed in relief as put your hand down to see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I didn't want to give myself a bad name, you know?\" You said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn was surprised to see that you're no where near a pervert after seeing her panties. She can also see the respect, caring and love in your eyes that she smiled nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed to be a nice guy to a girl like me. I like you. Oh! I'm Dawn, by the way.\" Dawn introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. I'm William.\" You introduced yourself to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, William? Where, exactly, am I?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in my home in Miami, Florida.\" You answered her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of that place.\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains where you came from at the other sids of that portal.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Portal? PORTAL?!?!\" Dawn yelled as she remebers the portal she came out of, which is no longer in the living room. \"It's gone! How am I gonna get home, now?!\" Dawn asked in sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but calm down. You can with me if you want to.\" You suggested as you try to relax the blue haired pokemon trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Dawn asked in a relaxing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You answered nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll stay.\" Dawn said with a soft smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, let me see if I have something you can where.\" You said before going to getting some kind of clothing for Dawn to where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, William. Nice place, by the way.\" Dawn complimented as she observes the house you live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come back and you give her a long shirt for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can wear that as a nightgown. It's big. So, it should cover you up. Now, you can sleep in my room, which is on your left, and I'll sleep on the couch here. Is that okay?\" You wondered.</span></div></div>",

I'm now preparing to go back into the portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, before Tails could even react, the portal roared out a loud vacuum sound before completing vanishing and exploding behind him, leaving most of the furniture and items in the living room destroyed in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Tails voice turned into pure panic, \"I've lost the portal! Sonic, can you hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really an expert in whatever technological babble Tails got into to but judging from the sounds of the surrounding situation. you can barely hear the dead static coming out of the receiver.

As he took a few more seconds looking at the damage, he turned around and the two of you locked eye contact.

Tails tried to ignore the idea to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of curiosity got the better of him and he tried to sneak a peek at you in the shower. Unfortunately for him, the bathroom door was locked. Being the genius that Tails was, he wasn't ready to give up; instead, his curiosity only grew stronger. It was going to take some quick thinking for the fox to deal with this problem. He considered his choices to overcome the issue but as he went through each choice, he eventually only found two options he could try, but he would know that they still had their elements of risk and disadvantages, but Tails knew that it was the only way to overcome his sudden interest in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first option he could try was to lockpick the door. Tails, who was a genius in comparison to his friends back in his homeworld, figured that he could easily lockpick the door. However, while the task itself was easy, it was finding a lockpick in the house or building one. Either way, it could take a while to even find or create a decent-enough lockpicking device. The fox wasn't even familiar with the whole house, let alone where everything was. By the time he could build/find a lockpicking device, it might be too late to fulfil his mission. Though, out of the two options, it was the far less risky and might be rewarding in the long-run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other option that was worth trying was climbing through the window, high up on the wall. For Tails, it would be much quicker than the former and because of his ability to fly, he can easily reach the opening of the window. Even though it was easy enough to get there, the actual problem was that the size of the window. Tails turned his neck upwards slightly and glanced at the transparent glass pane separating the bathroom from the rest of the house. Mentally taking down notes, he judged the diameter of the window to be an average of 53cm, which is barely enough to sneak through it. There was also the added noise which could set an alert that could easily get him caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was ticking for Tails. He had to pick one option, fast!</span></div></div>",

You told him it was going to be a while, so he should find something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to offend you, but how about you go watch TV?\" You suggested. Tails nodded and left the room. As you were working in the kitchen, you started to think. It was going to be weird walking around with him in town, even if he did look human to others. You didn't mind, it was just that the thought of it was weird. Within a couple of hours, you made a couple of cheeseburgers and salads. You called Tails and told him it was time to eat. When he came, he was holding something. You put a plate in front of him and looked to see what he was holding. It was a picture book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I kind of got bored and started looking for something to do upstairs when I found this.\" Tails said, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\" You said smiling. \"I don't recognize it, so let's open it up after lunch.\" Tails nodded and excitedly ate his food. He ate it pretty fast, while you took your time. He was very patient though, waiting until you finished as well. Once both of you were done, you went into the living room and opened it up. Inside were pictures of your mother and father. They looked happy together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" Tails asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I wasn't born yet, or they're on a trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Something doesn't feel right to me. My tails are twitching, and that's never a good sign.\" Tails looked worried. You simply sighed and took some of the photos out, flipping them over to the other side. Usually, the date of when it was taken was written on the back, so you knew you could stop your friend from worrying. However, when you saw the dates, something was wrong. According to the dates, these were taken a month before you were born. The problem with this was your mom clearly wasn't pregnant. You looked through the others, only to find the same result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand. They're not my real parents?\" You asked yourself, your head was starting to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Tails said, noticing a page. When you opened it, it looked like it once belonged to a diary. Tails started to read. \"We've finally done it. We have a kid of our own. We'll move far away so no one will know. He should never find out about what we did, it could tear his life apart. He'll now be safe with us hopefully.\" The page said. Tails started reading to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you able to find anything that says where I came from?\" You asked. Tails hesitated, but then found something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it says here that you were . .  .</span></div></div>",

You chuckle at his eagerness, \"Okay then, before you learn the story of how I got this you must know the story of the seven deadly sins...\" You say as you begin your story. \"A long time ago in the time of knights and dragons there existed 7 knights that possessed very unique powers..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one knight that was strongest out of all of them though was Meliodus: The dragon's sin of wreath...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Time skip)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..and that's the story of the 7 deadly sins.\" You say as you finish the story, \"I'm guessing that this Meliodus guy is your ancestor right?\" Tails asks as you nod. \"Yep and because of that I got this tattoo when I was born.

Well, that and Sonic's joke about how the portal might lead me to a boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Sonic?\u201d You asked, hoping to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s nice, a great hero, someone I can always rely on, and my first crush, but you can only be rejected so many times before you start looking  around,\u201d Amy answered, looking a bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you from going back?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing really, I still have the controller for the portal machine, so I can always go back, \u201d Amy answered.  Then in a lusty voice and bedroom eyes, \u201cBut I think we have enough questions for now\u2026 Let\u2019s get straight to the makeout session!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmy, wait, I-\u201d You uttered before Amy leapt at you, wrapping her arms around your upper arms and her legs around your body. Your hands caught her by her thighs by instinct, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s mouth landed on yours and her tongue managed to slip past your lip. As your tongue\u2019s began to wrestle, your hands accidentally slid, now unwittingly grabbing her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled, but Amy\u2019s grasp was too strong. You made panicked noises and tried to shake her off, but she was too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping the kiss, Amy said, \"You're a good kisser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, we just met!\" you exclaimed, still trying to escape her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pondered your words for a moment.

Mumbling to nobody in particular, you frown while your brain struggles to comprehend the setting that laid front of you. The mess that the raccoon and the portal had left behind wasn't as bad as you thought it would be but you could tell that it was going to take some of your free time to clean the room and make it look normal again. What's even more strange about it is that she looked just like a Sonic character, but oddly enough, you didn't seem to remember her name or the games she was in. You shrugged. It will probably come to you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you stutter awkwardly, as you move in closer towards the creature, \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon scratched her head and frowned a little.

I promise I'll clean it up for ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"Fine, but at least tell me what your name is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Marine!\" she proudly boasted, pointing at herself with a smirk, \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond?</span></div></div>",

You felt up her back, so she did the same to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Coco stopped the kiss and asked, \"How was I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were great, Coco,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. It was my first kiss, by the way,\" Coco said, the desire to continue the kiss was in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine as well. I guess you're quite talented, then, going by how hot you made me. Let's make us skilled as well,\" You replied before continuing the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco made a joyous squeal, somehow putting more effort in the kiss than before.</span></div></div>",

Why don't i remember anything!?\u201d She said, her voice having panic in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point your guard was down, you dropped the knife on the table next you her and slowly approached. \u201chey take it easy, panicking won't help anything\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn't good, why can i remember anything! What has happened to- WOAHH!\u201d She said tripping over as you react quickly jumping forward and catching her. Your eyes locking with hers as she smiled. \u201cThanks\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, lets just keep calm and think about this rationally okay. Do you want some tea or some coffee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Timeskip-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I'm on E...

One that she has complete Amnesia, not remembering her name, where she came from and even her interests. Something you think would be absolutely find terrifying. Secondly is that your gonna help her. As much as you can that is, your not really familiar with warp holes or anthro animal people so your gonna give her a home for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh can i make it myself\u201d She said as she you welcomed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know how to- The Amnesia hasn't gotten you there\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it has not\u201d She said with a huge smile as she moved closer to you. It was then you started to notice the height difference. She's a small petite girl compared to a normal human. Barely over 5 foot. Her biggest feature was her blonde hair which you found funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your mixture of coffee as you watch the Bandicoot start hers, dropping more Coco and more Coco then you believe. She seems satisfied when she filled half of the mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell since you don't know your name, i feel like Coco would be a good nickname\u201d You say pointing to the mug as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I'm sorry, i just like it very strong. More then your small cowards amount\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoward! Ill have you know that this is the average human amount. We don't need to feel it with a cupful\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah\u201d She says as you and her finished making your Coffee\u2019s.

Right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that doesn't sound too good\u201d  She said sitting down. You sit next to her as you take a sip of your mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus your not a stranger anymore since I've given you a nickname.

While Samus did accept that one time, Samus did it on her own terms, keeping Captain N with her and secretly rescuing Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also has a strong desire for romance, going by her actions towards Captain N. but her longing for friends prevents her from playing dirty with Princess Lana for Captain N's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Samus still has a number of traits with the video game version, like a predilection for drinking and celebrating after a mission. Going by the cheers of the other bounty hunters in that comic, she is quite popular because of her skills and number of victories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a bounty hunter, she likes to keep trophies of her victories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that did lead Lana to think that Samus had kidnapped the King because Samus had a trophy that was to be rewarded to whoever kidnapped the king. A fight broke out between them, as Samus couldn't recall if she did or not. That was due to Kraid and Ridley capturing Samus and trying to hypnotize her to kidnap the king. They eventually sorted it out, but Samus worries she kidnapped the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't, but the only one that knows is the sentient trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause this Samus is friends with Captain N and Princess Lana, she knows about other worlds and even the real world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChances are she'd be both impressed and unimpressed by 2017's tech. unimpressed with the graphic power of Computers, TV, and smartphones, but impressed with how small they can get and the multiple functions of them.

But I do not want any intruders...\" Nega-Shantae said as she put the Lamp on her belt, where it stayed in place. She then quickly did a dance, creating a bright flash that blinded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your sight returned, you saw that you were back in your living room, along with Shantae, Risky Boots, and Nega-Shantae. However, only the latter was free to move. You, Shantae, and Risky Boots were tied up with rope. Your legs were tied up ankle-to-thigh and your arms were tied up behind your back. The other two were tied up similarly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now we can... \" Nega-Shantae said before adopting a scary-looking face. \"Play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRisky Boots glared at Shantae and said, \"I blame you for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? You separated me from my genie half!\" Shantae replied, glaring right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one with bondage fantasies,\" Risky Boots said before Nega-Shantae snapped her fingers. The rope tying you vanished. Risky Boots glared at Nega-Shantae and growled, \"How come the greenhorn Landlubber gets freed!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I like him,\" Nega-Shantae answered before snapping her fingers. Now the rope tying Shantae and Risky boots altered itself, so now both ladies were spread-eagled, but a tear was ripped in both their pants and underwear, revealing their vaginas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shantae! You really are nothing more than a big pervert!\" Risky Boots cried out. \"You could've at least gotten me dinner and the strongest Grog first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush, you two,\" Nega-Shantae ordered. She then looked at you and asked, \"Entertain me. perform cunnilingus on the more attractive one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about her smile seemed to be very threatening. Looking down, you noted a small bump on the edge of the lid of the lamp, leaving a small hole for Nega-Shantae to escape from.</span></div></div>",

The child seemed to be wearing a blue sweater with a pink stripe in the middle, a pair of shorts and shoes and socks respectively. \"She seems to be knocked out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said to yourself as you carefully pick the kid up off the floor, within seconds the kid responds mumbling to herself as she noticed where she was. \"Wha? Who are yo-!\" She tried to ask before cutting herself off flinching as she began to clasp her side in pain! \"Hey! hey kid, are you hurt?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked before getting your answer as you notice what seemed to be blood coming from where the child was clenching, \"Oh God! Don't worry kid, I know what to do. I'll get you patched up!!\" You said before running to your bedroom and placing the kid on your bed as carefully as you can without hurting her, making sure to grab the first-aid kit out of the hall closet beforehand as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's see how bad this is..\" You trailed off as you pulled the sweater over the child's head noticing that she was wearing a t-shirt underneath it which was blotched with blood like her sweater but to a much higher degree. You blushed a bit as you processed this muttering \"*groan* I wish I didn't have to do this but..\" a little embarrassed, before you pull the shirt over her head much like her sweater moments before leaving her naked from the waist up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly taking action you quickly warn her \"This may sting a bit.\" before attempting to stop the bleeding, in an instant  the girl began to cry a bit from the pain. Seeing this you attempt to comfort her, your eyes not ounce leaving your current task.\"Don't worry kid. You're going to be just fine, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly being encouraged by your kind words she manages to give you a shaky nod of thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes you finish your work, \"*Sigh* Well I've stopped the bleeding and sealed your wound, right now you need to rest and be careful so you can recover.\" You said mostly speaking to yourself not realizing your little guest had been listening, You were just about out the door when she suddenly spoke startling you. \"Hey mister? I wanted to thank you for taking care of me like this.\" You just shrugged saying \" 's no big deal kid I was just doing what was right..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n At that moment she realized \"Oh I never told you my name did I? I'm Frisk. What's your name sir?\" You chuckled at her politeness before responding \"I'm Jack, it's nice to meet you Frisk. Now then, go ahead and rest, I'll be sleeping in the guest bedroom tonight across the hall if you need me sleep well.\" Frisk smiled as you began to head for the door, the last thing you heard her say was \"Good night.\" before she fell asleep instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at that on the other side of the door (Maybe having her around will be a good thing. Maybe she'll think of me as a dad someday..)  With that final thought you went to bed.                 </span></div></div>",

Are you okay?\"  You begin calling out before even leaving your room, but as you enter hers, you see her sitting up in bed in tears.  You realize she probably had a nightmare.  You relax a little, grateful that it's nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the edge of her bed and put a protective arm around her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frisk, it's okay.  It's just a nightmare.

I know a story about a beautiful and brave princess.  Her name is very similar to yours.  Her name is Brisk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed to create an elaborate story about a princess who, in many ways, resembles Frisk.  She is wounded, she has nightmares, but she's very brave and in the end she triumphs over her troubles.  You hope Frisk is able to take comfort in this story you weave.  She seems calmer when you are done.  Her breathing is slower and softer and she's shut her eyes again.  You get up quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be in the next room if you need me, Frisk.  Good night.\"  You pause at the door, a smile on your face.  You feel so warm toward this helpless little child you just met a few hours before.  You know you'd make a good father one day.

You smiled to yourself as you left the room leaving the door open on purpose as you head into the kitchen, if you couldn't get her up by talking to her you'll just use the next best thing, food. As you got started the smell of cooking food filled the air, quickly traveling throughout the house. Within moments you could hear Frisk mumbling again as she came out of her room rallying on her nose to lead her too the food instead of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but chuckle at her, \"Morning sleepyhead.\" you said receiving a sleepy \"Good morning.\" from her in return as she rubbed her eyes. You just finished up the cooking and were going about fixing a plate of food for Frisk &amp; yourself before going over and grabbing two glasses out of a cabinet. \"What do you want to drink?\" Frisk thought it over before asking \"Do you have any milk?\" \"Chocolate or regular?\" You asked as you went to grab the milk and chocolate syrup out of the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turned to face her, before having to clamp a hand over your mouth at what you just saw. Frisk noticed this and asked \"What's so funny Jack?\" You stifled a laugh muttering \"Uh, you might want to look in a mirror.\" She did so, and suddenly burst out laughing at the state her hair was in. She had such a bad case of bedhead that her hair looked like Marge Simpson or the bride of Frankenstein! \"*giggle* I think I better go fix this..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said as you nodded wiping a tear out of your eye, after a second you quickly said \"Wait! what kind of milk do you want!?\" She quickly said \"Chocolate please!\" not looking back as she headed into the bathroom to fix her hair.

He was closing his bay window curtains as dusk was coming near, continuing to lock his two doors for tonight. Continuing he'd cook just an omelet &amp; tear into it, adding some salt to finish. Walking into his living room he decided to watch a movie, not really having anything else to do but not knowing what movie to choose. <br>\r\nSo opening up the entertainment centers bottom cabinets he was offput seeing a blank brown CD-Case fall out, plopping on the birch hardwood. 'Do not open! Danger disc!' A crudely drawn old sticky note was on it, case wrapped by scotch tape. For a few seconds he contemplated wether or not to open it.. a bit freaked about how it just appeared. Like a creepypasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decides to just do it to get over curiosity, walking to the kitchen to get scissors. Snipping it open he found there to be a Wii-Fit game disc, nothing more in it but white scratches on the casing. He hasn't touched a Wii since he was a kid, a bit nostalgic with seeing it. As he grabbed the disc's side to pull it out he got cut- he bled a little, the sharpness of the disc astounding &amp; worrying him. So he closed the case &amp; would set it on his couchstand once back in the living room, going to bring it up to Bestbuy or something tomorrow to check legitimacy. Sucking the blood off his wound he'd head to his room now, the whole disc-finding thing discouraging staying up later, for some reason..<br>\r\nClosing his door &amp; going on to drop into his underwear Jake was a tad bit annoyed with the pain in his index finger, laying down &amp; just ignoring it. So he gradually went to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...\"Are you awake yet?\" Groggy, Jake heard a womens voice. \"Should we stretch?\" He got a rush of fear as he woke up to see her- the Wii Fit trainer, eyes a cold grey, skin white, grey hair groomed perfectly &amp; slick, just infront of his door. She wore her gaming attire- a low, tight croptop &amp; tight grey pants.. Jake didn't know how to react, sitting up slowly. \"You.. Lost? I don't know you, why are you here?\"<br>\r\nShe had a constant grin on her face, arms behind her back, he a bit scared. \"Im your personal trainer. You opened my case.\" He felt his stomach flutter like it was trying to tell him something, or he was just hungry. Seeing how she seems subservient- but heavily suspicious &amp; out of place, he sat his legs off the bed, how a case pertaining to her release puzzling. \"I don't.. Why were you.. In a case?\" The Wii womans flat-nippled breasts seemed to poke through her top but he ignored it, more concerned with her. \"Faulty programming. Im a defunct model.\" He questioned what 'defunct' was if 'she' was able to manifest physically, at this point he was rolling with it, he had.. Now has weird.. fascinations with game characters again, what what the chances this happens, he thought? Despite her being very vauge he judged..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Spider-man is about a boy who was is about to be an adult getting powers because of an accident. He then uses them to fight crime. Captain America is about a young man who volunteers for an experiment during a time of crisis for the sake of his country. Iron Man is about a rich guy getting a wake up call when he sees something he created used for evil and almost gets killed. He ends up making a powerful suit of armor that keeps him alive and uses it to try to fix his mistake. Guardians of the Galaxy is about a group of intergalactic outlaws who become heroes,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... these do sound like interesting stories. I wouldn't mind watching them all,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might not have time to today, but we could watch them later,\" you suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we could start with Iron Man,\" Tigress says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the movie out of the case, turn on the both Blue-Ray player and TV, open the Blue-ray player, insert the disc into the drive, and then close it.</span></div></div>",

I swear!\" You reasoned with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra takes a good look at you and she can tell that you're not someone who can cause harm to anyone just by looking in your eyes. They're full of kindness and fun. Korra then let's you go and you fixed your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Jason. One more question. How do you know my name?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's complicated to explain. So, how about I show you?\" You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Korra answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back.\" You said as you left to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came back and you give Korra a copy of the DVD. Korra was surprised to see herself on the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this- Is this really me?\" Korra asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and you explained everything to her. Her adventures, bending training, Pro-Bending and the enemies that she had ever faced. Korra is bewildered by all of this. But, at the same time, she's very happy that there's a lot of people that likes her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Now I know how Bolin feels in his movie career.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're okay with it?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes actually.\" Korra answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in relief as there won't be any weird scenarios from here on out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about earlier by the way, Jason.\" Korra apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I don't blame you for doing that actually. I would've done the same.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you felt that way. Say, since you know about me and my home world, how about we go out and see what your world's like. Maybe we can even know each other more.\" Korra suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. That sounds fun.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Korra went out and left to go to the</span></div></div>",

You clean this?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every now and then.

You two then walked to the bridge and look at the clean lake. You look at Korra and can't argue that she's like the most sexy girl you have ever seen. She looks incredibly cute with that outfit on. You two then went to the food cart and you buy yourself and Korra a bottle of water. You two were having the time of your lives with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I never had that much fun in a long time.

What should we do today?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could go shopping for some new clothes.\" You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with what I'm wearing?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! It's just that you need to wear something more 21st century if you're going to be here for a while.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. Okay. I'll try something new.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took Korra to a clothes shop for new clothing for her. You two look around and Korra found some shirts and pants of interest. You showed her to the women's fitting rooms to try them on. Korra came back out to see what you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked and widened your eyes and blushed madly as you see Korra wearing a light blue t-shirt, jean pants and she even lose the ponytail to make her hair longer. Your heart start pounding fast as you can't believe on the beauty of the female avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, Korra.\" You said almost nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Jason. You're sweet.\" Korra said nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then took her to get her some socks and shoes. You found some sneakers that Korra seems to like. You put one of them on her foot to see that they fit. Once that's done, you paid for the clothes and drove back home to put them away for her. You two then went for a walk and you stopped to see Korra looking at a poster on a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fireworks special?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They do this like every weekend. It's fun actually. You listen to music, eat food, go on the beach.

Korra was always told back home that the moon was the first waterbender and seeing it glow over the water is a magnificent sight. You thought about the same thing as you see the moon looking over the horizon. You two then go to the snack bar and ordered two drinks for you and Korra. The fireworks came up and Korra was amazed by the colors exploding in the sky. You can see on her face that she's having a good time and you smiled at that. You then felt tapping on your shoulder and you turned to see a man about your age (18) with brown eyes and dark hair. It turns out to be a friend of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheldon!\" You said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's up, man?\" Your friend, Sheldon, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! Just enjoying the show.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, Man! Great!\" Sheldon said before seeing Korra. \"Oh boy, Jason! Who's this fine lady you've got here?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Korra. Nice to meet you.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise. Is she your girlfriend, man?\" Sheldon wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. We just met yesterday, actually.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. You've just found yourself a nice girl here, Jason. It's about you step back into the game.\" Sheldon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he mean by that?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I used to like this other girl name Stacy. But, she wasn't who I thought she'd be when she was playing with my heart like a toy.\" You said sadly and angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra was shocked to hear that as it was one of the most saddest and disgusting things she ever heard. To have someone use your emotions for whatever reason is beyond evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Don't worry, though. She got what she had coming to her.\" Sheldon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, that's terrible.\" Korra said as she puts her hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. That's in the past now.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right. I'm gonna head back home now. See you two later.\" Shelton said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Korra waved at Sheldon before enjoying the fireworks. Afterwards, you two went back home and you decide to take a shower. You then come out and it was Korra's turn. Korra finished showering and you two sit on the couch to watch a late night movie which is the first Avengers movie. During the movie, Korra looked at you and she can feel her heart pumping up faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jason?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like me by any chance?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked to hear her ask that question. You took a moment to think of something before telling her the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes I do.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can you close your eyes real quick?\" Korra suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and you felt something on your lips. You opened your eyes and you were surprised as Hell to see Korra kissing you on the lips. She let go of the kiss and looks at you in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Korra! I-I don't know what to say.\" You said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about an \"I love you\"?\" Korra suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

Have some.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Korra her plate and put you own plate on the table and you two sit to enjoy them. You noticed that Korra is confused about her utensils. You figured why concerning that her home is mostly like China. So, she uses chopsticks for her meal. You decided to help her by cutting her meal for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Jason.\" Korra said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Enjoy.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra took the first bite of the pancake and likes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This taste amazing.

Sit here and give me your foot.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra sits down on the bench and she give you her foot. You pulled off her boot and you put on the sneaker for her.

Say, where's the bathroom?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that way to the back. First door on the left.\" The female worker directed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worker then left. But, not before she gives Korra a wink. Korra can tell what that means and blushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Korra. Done. How does it feel?\" You asked as you finished putting on the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fits so well.\" Korra said as she wiggles her toes a little in the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now, let's get you back into your old clothes so you can use the restroom.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra went back into the fitting rooms to put on her regular clothes again. She gives you the new clothes in a bag while she goes to the bathroom. You went to the front desk and paid for her clothing. You and Korra meet up and went to your car to leave. You then looked at your gas meter and sees that it's almost empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great.\" You groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My gas tank is almost empty.

Nice car you got there.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You said in a serious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad a prissy boy like you have to drive something like this.\" The other thug teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got under your skin a bit and you looked at him dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prissy boy? Well, at least I don't look like a guy who just got broken up by his boyfriend.\" You teased back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna try saying that again?\" The first thug dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra then got out of the car as she sees what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine. Just get back in the car.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That's a fine piece of beauty you got here. Hey, Sexy. How would like to leave this sissy and go with some real men like us?\" The second thug asked sickly seducetive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra does not like how that man is talking to her and gets mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Now, get lost.\" Korra demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we got to do this the hard way.\" The first thug said as he walks towards Korra. But, you got into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over my dead body.\" You said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you can do anything about it, Bitch?\" The thug asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that you've mentioned it.\" You said before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POW!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou punched him right in his jaw and he went down. He got up and went to tackle you. You give him a high kick in the face and a few chops and a spinning heel kick to the back of his head to knock him out. Korra was surprised that you know moves like that. The other thug went to intervene. But, Korra grabbed him and gives him a straight uppercut to his chin. She then tossed to the garbage and kicked him straight in the gut. She finishes him off by giving him a punch in the eye. Korra went to see if you're alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Jason?\" Korra asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm alright. No scratches or bruises at all.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing. Where do you learn moves like that?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go to this Mixed Martial Arts gym to go for some training. I've been doing it for years now.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see the owner of the station come out to see the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, Man.\" You apologized to the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It's fine, actually.

Then what is?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see-.\" You were about to explain until you heard roaring and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked and widened you're eyes as you see people running from what appears to be a lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! It's a lion! And I think it's hungry.\" You said scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUN!!\" You screamed as you and Korra are being chased by the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Korra kept on running until you've hit a dead end. You two turned and see the lion growling at you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're cornered!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion went up to you and Korra and you both feel like you're both screwed. That is until the lion went to you and rubbed it's head on both of your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You and Korra said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion appears to be friendly and it wants you two to pet it. Korra took her hand out first and rubbed it's fur first. It then licked her face and she laughed at it. It then looks at you and it ponced on you to lick your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it knows that we were here and wants to say hi.\" Korra said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see a lot of people taking their phones out and taking videos and photos of you two and the lion. You and Korts both took you hands on it's head and actually see it's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just see that?\" You asked surprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure did.\" Korra answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zookeeper then shows up to see if you're both alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two okay?\" The zookeeper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We're fine.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness. Now, allow me to-.\" The zookeeper was gonna say something. But, Korra stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I think that this guy wants to go home. It's real home.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zookeeper and everyone else, except you, was shocked to what Korra just said. You know it as well and decided to go with Korra's saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right, Sir. We believed that this lion deserves to return home to Africa where he can roam free again.\" You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Africa?\" Korra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the land where these things live. Anyway, if you agree to let him go, this disaster will not happen again. Please, he wants this.\" You pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zookeeper thinks about this and comes to conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see if I can it arranged.\" The zookeeper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Korra are happy about that and the people clapped in appreciation for you selflessness. After that was over, you and Korra drove home and walked inside after that crazy day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason? I'm sorry.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was overreacting back there to see those animals having little freedom and I took it out on you.\" Korra explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Don't worry about it. I should say sorry to you. I was kind of a jerk back there.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we both did something stupid today, huh?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. No hard feelings?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No hard feelings.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and pulled Korra towards you by her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Korra.\" You said lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Jason.\" Korra said back also lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Korra leaned into each other and kissed each other on the lips. You two then stick your tongues into each other's mouths and have a tongue wrestling match.</span></div></div>",

Korra also noticed that you've been looking at her sometimes. She smiles as she thinks that you have a crush on her. Korra then thought of an idea to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jason? I feel kinda sore back here. Could you massage my back, please?\" Korra asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure, Korra. No problem.\" You said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra lays down on the arm of the couch, with her back facing up. You blushed more as you see Korra's butt in your face. You shook that thought off though and took your hand to rub Korra's upper back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this okay?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep on rubbing her upper back and Korra's feeling relaxed by your soft hands. Korra now decides to take it up a notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you go a little lower?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and went down to her middle spine. Korra wants to keep this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit lower.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved your hands to her tailbone and you massaged there too. Now, time for the main part of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit more.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Korra? That's your butt I'll hit next.

When you got your fish, you two were talking about the great and funny things about your lives while eating. Korra looks like she's having a tremendous time with you and the other times since she came here. She knows that she'll have to go home soon, but part of her wished she could stay here with you. This world looks so peaceful with no spirtal problems or anyone trying to take over the world. It's just seems so right here.

But the question is, how brutal. She sits in the stands with a lot of people. Now she knows what's it like to be in the stands at the Pro-Bending arena. After a while of waiting, the lights went out and the spotlights came on. Then she heard music from the background and sees you coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rise up by Drowning Pool)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou high-five everyone coming in and you give a hug to Korra for good luck. You reached the cage and took your shirt off. Korra blushed as she sees you with a very well-toned body. Whatever training you have, it's working well. You went in and you jog around to get energy from the crowd. Korra was also listening to the music and thinks that it seems fitting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, Jason! Show them who's boss!\" Korra yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another music came up and she sees your opponent. He's a big man with tattoos on both of his arms.

I doubt they've taught you that, no offense.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra never thought of that. She seen how your opponent tossed you to the ground and hold your arm as if he was gonna break it.

I flushed red from excitement, my heart beat wildly against Korra's chest echoing with a drumbeat in my ears. I felt Korra's hands exploring my back and bottom, sending goosebumps down my spine. I hugged her and run my shaky hands down her back and up the sides. I couldn't believe my luck. I had a real live Korra in my arms, the taste of her in my mouth, the smell in my nostrils, everything here for the taking, just for me. I leaned closer into her embrace sucking on her tongue, breathing in the aroma of her body, pressing her tight to my chest.

This is a very important matter!\" Korra furrowed her brows and pushed me away. I proceeded to flop onto the couch in geat despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You barge into my home, get me all hot and bothered and now you want to talk business? My brain is set on only one thing right now, you have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to help you cool off.\" Said Korra in a calm voice and waterbended a bucked of icy water over my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that helps.\" I said gloomily blowing wet hair out of my face. I was outwardly composed but on the inside a burning anger was stirring inside me. What does this bitch think she is, playing me like that? She kissed me first! Playing hard to get in hopes that I would be desperate enough to help her in this mission to protect the Republic City is... well it is likely to work.. but she won't find it out from me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'm all ears darlin'. How may I be of service?\" I fixed her with the coldest stare I could muster and folded my arms over the wet t-shirt trying to suppress the cold shivers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I had to resort to this... but I badly need your help.\" Korra hung her head in shame and stroked the bridge of her nose trying to gather her thoughts together.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI snorted in disappointment and turned my head away to hide my evil grin. My favorite cartoon character was asking <i>me</i> for help!

She had fallen asleep, still wearing her hat. It looked pretty wet, but you didn't think about it. You left her alone and went downstairs to turn the TV on.

Power to Henrinus and I recover one damage! Now, Gerrie's additional skill! After the battle in which he attacks or he boosts another unit for an attack, I sent him to the soul and I Counter Charge. Now, Jeffrey will boost my second Henrinus on your vanguard!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not gonna guard!\" Misaki said as she took the 2 damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeffrey's Unite!

She need to figure something out and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stand and draw. Generation Stride! Soaring Auspicious Beast, Kirin! Susanoo's Stride Sill! I look at the top two cards of my deck and picked one to add to my hand while the other goes to the bottom of the deck. I activate Hahiki's Oracle. Send her to the soul and look at the top two cards of my deck and choose one to add to my hand while the other goes to the bottom of my deck. I call Lozenge Magus and Rigid Crane. Crane's Skill! Add 2000 power and a new skill! Then I call Psychic Bird! It's Skill! I send him to the soul and I draw. Then I call Imperial Shrine Guard, Akagi. With Akagi's Skill, I look at the top two cards of my deck and choose on to add to my hand while the other goes to the bottom of my deck and give her an additional 2000 power. Then I call Weather Girl, Milk and Divine Sword, Kusanagi. With a boost from Kusanagi, Akagi attacks the Henrinus on the left.\" Misaki declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guard!\" You said to stop the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a boost from Milk, Kirin Attacks! Using Kusanagi's Skill! I send her to the soul and I draw one card then give my vanguard an additional 5000 power. Milk's Skill! Since she's boosting my vanguard while I have four or more cards in my hand, give it 4000 extra power!\" Misaki declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No guard.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triple Drive!\" Misaki said as she goes throw her checks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double Critical Trigger! Giving power to Crane and I give Kirin the 2 critical!\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the damage and you got a trigger on it and give the power to your vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Using Kirin's Skill, I look at the top two cards of my deck and put one in my hand and the other in the bottom of the deck. Time to finish this! With support from Magus, Rigid Crane will attack your vanguard! With Magus skill, I give the boosted unit 3000 power!\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Generation Guard! Sacred Heavenly Prayer Master, Reid! With her skill, since I have 2 or more rear guards, I give her an additional 5000 power to her shield!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn! Using Lozenge Magus's Skill to shuffle her back to the deck.\" Misaki said as she shuffles her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed of how you're doing, Misaki. Really, I am. Still, Final Turn!\" You declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaki is getting nervous if what you just said is true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Generation Stride! Sunrise Ray Radiant Sword, Gurguit! Using Stride Skill, look at the top four cards of my deck and Superior Call one unit. I Superior Call Knight of Morning Knight, Horsa! Add 2000 power! Then I call Sunshine Knight, Jeffrey and Flame of Victory. Using Horsa's Unite! Whenever I call a unit to rear guard, I can give 2000 power to him and the unit that's in the same column as him. Since I call two units, that's 4000 power to him and Henrinus. Using Flame of Victory's Skill, I send him to the soul and give 3000 power to the unit of my choice. I give it to the Henrinus that has Jeffrey as his boosted unit. Then, I call Gerrie. Using Horsa's Unite again to give 2000 power to him and Henrinus. Gerrie's Unite! Add 3000 power and a new skill. Here's the best part. Sunrise Ray Radiant Sword, Gurguit's Unite! Counter Blast one and Soul Blast two! For every rear guard that I have, he gains 5000 power. So that's 25000 power to Gurguit! That's not all! He gives his allies 5000 power for themselves. Guess what? I can use his Generation Break as many times as I want. So, I'll do it again.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaki was both surprised and impressed of how your playing. This is the kind of skills that's something of a legend. She looks at you and she might think that this is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go! Boosted by Jeffrey, my first Henrinus attacks the vanguard!\" You declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Generation Guard! Sunrise-on-high Godhawk, Ichibyoshi! With its skill, since I have three or more cards in my hand, I add 5000 power to the shield and I guard with a Grade 0!\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I'll use Jeffrey's Unite! I send him to the soul and I draw. Now, with a boost from Gerrie, Gurguit attacks the vanguard!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I nullify your attack!\" Misaki said as your attack is stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triple Drive!\" You said as you look for the trigger check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first is nothing, but, you got one on the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heal Trigger! Power to Henrinus and I recover one!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the third check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Critical Trigger! All effects to Henrinus!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaki looks at you and she was astonished by your course of the game. She forms a smile that you were having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go, Henrinus! Attack!\" You declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack went through and the damage is now 6, giving you the victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun. Don't you think, Misaki?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear her clapping at you as she was impressed by your skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing! You really gave everything you had.\" Misaki said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. You did better, though.\" You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaki smiled at you when you said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do now?\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we go to the</span></div></div>",

Pleased to meet you.\" As she holds out her hand and you nervously shake it as you're unable to take your eyes off just how cute and pretty she is even in anime form from her huge solid blue eyes to her long blonde hair in pig tails to her short blue skirt with those long slender legs and stylish high heel red boots on top of that she was close to your own age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah like I said I don't plan on hurting you or anything and you must a bit confused about how all this happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How what happened?\" She asked turning back around to stare at you after getting a eyeful of your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you suddenly falling into my house unexpectedly.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that,it was the oddest thing one minute I'm fighting the latest Negaverse creep with my friends in Tokyo,next thing I know I'm suddenly falling through some weird portal thing that opened up beneath my feet!

You had an HDMI compatible NES console clone, an SNES, a Sega Genesis, a Nintendo 64, a PlayStation 2, a PlayStation 3, a Nintendo Wii, and a Wii U. You also had a Game Boy Advance SP, a DSlite, and a 3DS. You had switched to PC gaming recently for newer games, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\" Molly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was younger, I played games on these devices. Some of these games were for one player only, some for two or more, some adventure games, some were competitions,\" you explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look through the hardware, you realized didn't have the controllers that came with many of these, but in a number of cases it's because you upgraded to newer ones. Example, the NES and SNES, you had bluetooth SNES controllers with wireless receivers for the consoles. For the Genesis you had done the same, but the controllers were the 6 button variant. For the N64, you had aftermarket controllers with a better analog stick and were designed to be more two handed than the original ones. For the Wii, you the upgraded Wii remote plus versions. You also had HDMI cords for the system. Molly was going to experience a bit of your childhood and something that would be considered futuristic from where she came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we decide which one of these devices to set up, we need to figure out which games might be the best options. Not all games are appropriate for someone your age,\" you tell her as you show her the different games you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that one?\" Molly asks as she points to Mario Party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one is a 4 player board game. Players take turns rolling dice for a number value between 1 and 10 while trying to get coins to buy stars. After each player has a turn, little games are played where coins can be earned. The color of the spaces that each player lands determine's what kind of game is played. This one should be fine for you to play. I'll set it up,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know which ones are okay for me to play?\" Molly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of these games have a box with some letters and numbers on them. For your age, we're looking for anything labeled GA, K-A, or E,\" you tell her as you hook up the Nintendo 64.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about the ones that don't have a box like that?\" Molly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make a judgement call based for the games that I do own, but for things I don't I'll try to research it to see what I can find out about it,\" you answer as you plug in the controllers. You then leave an extra controller out in the event that Rebecca wakes up so you can offer her a chance to join in the game with you and Molly, but you do make sure to put what you don't need.</span></div></div>",

After you finished with that you came  back into the living room and found Rebecca looking thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on your mind?\" You asked as you took a seat in the armchair near the couch.<br>\r\nRebecca thought to herself a moment before she said..               </span></div></div>",

Did you happen to find one that is a bear wearing a<br>\r\n blue dress?\u201d Rebecca asked. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cNo, but I have an idea. There\u2019s a place that allows shoppers to create their own<br>\r\n stuffed animal toys. I\u2019ll be happy to take her there tomorrow. For now, you should go<br>\r\n comfort her. I might have something that I could offer her for now,\u201d you suggested. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Rebecca leaves to comfort Molly. You go back to your room and reach up to your shelves.<br>\r\n While you had some Funko Pop figures, you figured you might show them to Molly some time<br>\r\n in the future. Of the ones you were thinking about giving her, you picked Coco Bandicoot<br>\r\n and made a note to pick up another while shopping online. As for the stuff toys you had,<br>\r\n noticed Sonic the Hedgehog and Toriel from Undertale. You decided to offer her both. You<br>\r\n figured it might help Molly sleep better if she had some music that was calming, so you<br>\r\n put some on an MP3 player you have lying around and bring it with you to the guest room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cSorry I\u2019m late, I had to get a few things,\u201d you say as you enter the room. Molly<br>\r\n seemed a bit calmer now. \u201cFirst is Sonic the Hedgehog. He is a hero who uses his speed<br>\r\n to save trapped animals and the world around him,\u201d you tell her as you give her the<br>\r\n first stuffed animal. \u201cNext is Toriel. She is a motherly character that acts as guardian<br>\r\n and a protector,\u201d you tell her as you give her the stuffed white goat toy. \u201cThird is a<br>\r\n collectible toy. This one is Coco Bandicoot. She\u2019s helped her brother Crash save the world<br>\r\n from an evil scientist several times,\u201d you tell her as you give her the toy in the box.<br>\r\n She takes a look at it and notices that what Coco\u2019s wearing looks a little bit like what<br>\r\n she is, but it\u2019s a white shirt instead of pink.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Are you giving me this one because it looks like me?\u201d Molly asks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n You\u2019ve noticed that too, but it\u2019s not just her. Toriel is supposed to represent<br>\r\n your mother and how she cares for you. Sonic is supposed to represent me. I might not be<br>\r\n family, but I am willing to do what I can to protect you,\u201d you tell her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cThank you,\u201d Molly says as she puts Coco on the nightstand.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \u201cThere is one more thing I have to offer you. I figured some calming music might help<br>\r\n you relax, so I brought this for you,\u201d you say as you start up a playlist of calming<br>\r\n music on the MP3 player and then place it on the nightstand next to the toy. Molly yawns<br>\r\n and goes back to sleep.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cYou seem to get along real well with Molly,\u201d Rebecca comments on your parenting<br>\r\n skills, then asks, \u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cNo,\u201d you answer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cI was thinking, maybe after you take Molly to get a new toy, maybe the three of us<br>\r\n could go out to eat. Something similar to a date,\u201d Rebecca suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You shrug, \"I guess we can do that. There is one thing though..\" You said trailing off as you went over to the couch and began to search under it before pulling out a small dust covered box, \"What's in there?\" Rebecca asked as she had to fan away some of the dust that came up from the box when it had been moved. \"Something that will allow you &amp; your daughter too walk around in town without raising suspicion..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Rebecca asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Most people aren't as welcoming or trusting as I am to you and Molly Rebecca..\" Rebecca looked too the side sadly muttering \"I figured as much..\" You nodded continuing, \"If someone other then me catches sight of you two they'll call the authorities and have the two of you put in a cage at the zoo or something worse.\" You finished giving Rebecca a Grimm look. Knowing what that look meant made your friend shudder, \"Goodness..\" You nodded again, \"Your daughter especially doesn't need to go through something like that at her age so it would be best if we tried to avoid that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded asking \"How do we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and opened the box, \"With these..\" You said as you pulled out the contents of the box which turned out to be 2 blank white masks, \"What can those do?\" \"These two masks have a power to alter a person's appearance that way the person who wears them can fit into the world without problems.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll happen to me?\" You chuckled, \"Put it on and find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca glanced down at the mask you held out in front of her before she slowly took hold of it and put it on, the moment it made contact her entire body glowed white before it faded just a fast as it had shown up revealing Rebecca rubbing her head in confusion, \"What happened?\" \"Look at your hand.\" She did so but instead of finding her fur covered paw she found a human hand, she glanced at her other hand and found the same result. She glanced at the rest of her body and found that she now had the appearance of a human woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing..\" She said in shock before a thought came too her \"How do I change back?\" \"Easy, just take the mask off and you'll return to normal.\" \"Okay.\" Rebecca did as you instructed and her body glowed white again before returning to it's normal state. \"At least now Molly and I'll be safe if we go out of the house with you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and said \"Yeah, but we''ll worry about it in the morning right now we should get some sleep.\" Rebecca nodded saying \"I can take the couch if you want.\"   However you quickly stopped her saying \"No, it'd be better for you to take my bed for the night sense my room's next too the room Molly's sleeping in. Better for you to be close just in case she has another bad dream right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca blinked in surprise muttering \"I suppose your right.\" You nodded as you went about grabbing blankets before climbing in them and laying down on the couch. \"Goodnight then and thank you again.\" Rebecca said before heading off to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*The Next Morning*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up fairly early to start cooking breakfast knowing that you had guests to feed after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding on making pancakes, bacon and eggs you go about grabbing everything needed. As you were working on the pancakes a voice spoke up, \"Do you need a hand?\" You looked over your shoulder and found Rebecca standing a few feet away. \"Your up early.\" Rebecca laughed as she came up next to you \"I could say the same for you.\" You chuckled at that as you went over to the eye on the stove the bacon was cooking on and turned it off sliding the bacon off the pan and onto a plate, then putting that on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just finished cooking the bacon, You wanna help with the pancakes while I work on the eggs?\" Rebecca nodded and went right too work, after a few minutes the food was all cooked and ready. Rebecca went to go and wake up Molly while you went about setting out plates of food for your friends and yourself, as Rebecca and her daughter came in you greeted the bear cub with a smile. Morning Molly, Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly nodded, \"Good, you want some breakfast?\" Without answering she ran over to her seat and glanced down at her food before she began to giggle, \"What's so funny pumpkin?\" Rebecca asked her daughter in amusement \"*giggle* (Your Name) made my food in the shape of a smiley face!\" You chuckled \"I figured you'd like it.\" Other then the occasional joke from Molly, breakfast was uneventful. After that you helped Rebecca explain about the mask you had given her the night prior that turned her into a human woman as well as one for Molly that turn her into a normal little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that The 3 of you went to the store to have Molly make her own stuffed bear, she had just finished putting a blue dress on it as she said \"I missed you Lucy, Make sure I don't lose you again okay?\" After that you paid for the toy and headed off to the cafe to decide where to go next, After helping the girls pick out some new clothes you went to the park to let Molly play for a while As that was going on you were sitting on a bench looking at the sky as the sun was beginning to set, you noticed Rebecca coming over to you so you scooted over to give her a spot to sit. \"You ready to head out to get some dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded, \"Sure, Do you know of any good places we can eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked and said \"You'll have to wait and see.\" You then called out \"Molly! it's time to go!\" A moment later she came and jumped onto your back wanting a piggyback ride, Rebecca giggled at the sight as the 3 of you went back to your car.             </span></div></div>",

Secondly your parents are out of town for the next week, which means uncensored fun. Thirdly it's blazing hot outside, which means you better stay in the house the entire day. Or go outside and get fried like an egg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short terms, you've got a whole to do nothing but sit on your butt, watch TV and play games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of your room still in your underwear, knowing there's no reason to get dressed. Your underwear consisted of a pair of heart boxers and a white plain shirt, with a couple of stains on it. You start to prepare for your extended stay on the couch. Cooking some popcorn in the microwave and grabbing some fresh soda cans from the fridge. You also disconnected the phone line, making sure you wouldn't get interrupted on your perfect day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were all prepared, you turn on the TV and . . . Nothing happened. You keep pressing the remote hoping something would change. You checked the cords to the Tv, the remote's battery. You couldn't understand what happened to the Tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however understood less when a blue circular portal opened. You jump back a bit in surprise, you then watch as a girl fell out of the portal. Needless to say she was beautiful, with a beautiful face and a beautiful body. She had old timey clothes and looked around your age, if not slightly older. To be honest she kind of looked like Kim Possible, more then an uncanny resemblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portal disappeared and then ______________</span></div></div>",

It was so weird, and if she came out of that Portal, how will she go back now that it's gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing what most people do when they are confused, you go to Google! You open your laptop at the kitchen table and started typing into Google 'Mysterious Blue Portal'. Which Unfortunately but understandable didn't show anything helpful. You then typed in 'Kim Possible Look Alike' which once again failed you as it only got results of Cosplayers. Taking a final look at the girl you knew what to type in 'Kim Possible Old Timey'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it did show results as you saw pictures and pages about a girl called Mim Possible. A girl from a episode called 'Rewriting History' and was Kim's ancestor. And once you saw a picture of Mim, you knew it was her. Typing in next you searched for an online video of the episode, you spent the next twenty minutes watching the episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you walked back to the couch, seeing that she was asleep still, but this time upright. She must of moved around in her sleep, making you realize how awkward of a position to sleep in was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something odd once again happened. You watch as Mim starts shining blue? You watch as she starts to not only glow, but grow. Her whole being being elevated as she starts growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big does she grow?.

Something that doesn't surprise you considering that she was related to Kim Possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept growing bigger and bigger as in the next two minutes, she grew an extra two feet. Looking like she was around eight foot now. And her clothes were getting even tighter as it looked like her clothes were about to burst.  The dress she had hugging her body as you try not to focus on it. You didn't know how much she was growing. Would she continually grow, or will she stop soon. Hopefully before she crashes threw your ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two minutes she once again grew two more feet, equaling the height of ten. You watch as her dress starts ripping slightly, making you feel a bit bad at the beautiful dress now ripped. You also note that her neckline pretty much exploded from her growing. Which makes you wonder what's happening to the corset underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more minutes and the growing seemed to have stopped as well as the blue glowing, when her head hit the top of the ceiling. It seemed this bump finally woke her up as she gave out a little \"Ouch!\" her eyes flutter open and you watch as she looks around, being obviously shocked at the sudden new environment and the sudden new height.

I don't know how to help you, but I'll try to help where I can\" you monologued to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you sweet\" Mim said, still giving you fluttering eyes as she reached down. You panic for second at what she's doing but it's far to late to do something when her large hands grab your shoulders and pull yourself onto the couch. More specifically onto her lap. She forced you to lay back on her, your head hitting her breasts as you start blushing like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. . . What are you doing?\" you say completely flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice that you cared for me, made sure I was right and all. And in return I think you need a little thank you gift. Is that all right handsome?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure?\" you asked confused at what she meant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She grabs your chin and rises it up so your staring at her face, and how it was coming right for you. You found yourself getting kissed in a passionate embrace as her lips dwarf yours. She entered her tongue in your mouth which dominated your own tongue. Normally you would be angry a girl was violating you, but now you weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mim pulled away and looked down at the shock faced you had, which made her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Opening the closet I grabbed a towel- Raven opened the door and walked into the bathroom already.  <br>\r\nI sighed some feeling like Im just a caretaker of her, looking in the bathroom she was slightly bent over the tub and examining the shampoos. Setting the towel on its rack I was walking out, then her warm-cold hand grabbed mine.. I freaked out on the inside seeing her with a low smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to bathe with me? I won't mind.\" Uh..<br>\r\nMy face was likely red like a schoolgirls feeling the rush of blood to it, Raven just staring with the same smile.<br>\r\nI'd not really know <i>why</i> but.. \"Sure.\" I blurted out likely with nervousness, being near forty made me full of anxiety about my body with alot of people, and she looked quite young, to. <br>\r\n\"Then you get it going.\" Raven stepped back so I approached the shower and flipped it onto hot water, the showerhead immediately pouring it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI- she was- <br>\r\nI oogled her while she removed her leotard and weird accessories belt, her petite frame coupled with her sizeable breast and bosom.. I would lie if I said she wasn't appealing. <br>\r\nAlmost all of the cuts had sealed completely, how? <br>\r\nShe laughed silently, the smile more mischievous I think. \"I'll be in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust <i>strolling</i> by me naked and getting in, she closed the curtains and the water changed sound to hitting skin. Damn, I <i>need</i> to accept that offer, atleast I'm not the one making the moves.. <br>\r\nI unbuttoned my polo &amp; pants, sliding the shirt off following the lowers. My body quivered with some uncertainty &amp; some anticipation, I just hoped to keep my attraction unnoticeable.<br>\r\nFinally going with my underwear I just looked myself up in the mirror, slightly greying hair, a rather regular- slight belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing once.. I approached the curtain and pulled it open, seeing Ravens curvaceous body as I stepped in behind her, she was under the water. Couldn't help but stare for a second,  she turned her head to me and her body slightly, making her assets stick out noticabley and I jerked my eyes to hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to..\" <br>\r\nHer tone was rather pleased but I saw her look me down and up, her smile widened.. \"Do whatever.\" She simply said, taking the shampoo &amp; pasting it on her hands. <br>\r\nI slid around her which made her eyes widen some, feeling the nice rush of hot water was relaxing. <br>\r\n\"Water hog.\" She muttered while wetting her hair in the showers side-stream, rubbing the shampoo while I'd take the bottle from her and put shampoo on my own hands, then hair-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's breast pressed up against my back.. I got moved out of the direct stream while she got the soap out from her hair, turning and seeing her smiring at me, of course I felt myself get a rush of arousal! \"Sheeg- could've asked.\" I stepped forward to turn around but she took the entire shower, pressing me nearly against the wall.<br>\r\n\"Whatever..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around, ignoring the fact my dick had gotten somewhat hard and that I was barely half a foot from her. She store straight up at me with a stotic smile, then I.. <br>\r\nI freaked out when she arched one knee up some and leaned on the shower wall, crossing her hands under her breast, I did best to just keep eye contact. <br>\r\n\"Your real nervous, never get this close with anyone?\" I was certainly blushing now. \"No.. seems like you.. have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laugh was quiet and had a small crack to it, I'd just notice a weird.. gem thing on her head. \"I haven't, that's why your here with me..\" -she widened her smile while pointing down-! <br>\r\n\"I can tell you <i>like</i> how close we are.\" <br>\r\nFeeling more aroused seeing her body, pubic hair.. I saw my boner had grown high, at six inches I couldn't hide it anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since.. 'whatever' is fair, get as close as you'd like.\" She said seemingly jokeful, was that a.. invitation to be physical? I didn't know but <i>really</i> felt like it was..</span></div></div>",

More-so accidentally I pressed my dick against her butt while moving my arms around her and rubbing her navel, she was smiling a bit. \"M-mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking anxiously, she didn't say a word and just store at me. I took it as a yes, moving the sponge on her breast and groping them just a bit- <br>\r\nHell- moving my groin up some, a pleasurable sensation filled me as I started to repeat that motion <i>very</i> slowly. Just dropping the sponge and then groping one of her breast, she moved into the stream slowly and I followed, halfway out as all the soap was being washed away from the wide showerhead. <br>\r\n\"Thanks- o-\" moving in, she turned to me with her arms crossed, making her breast jut out. \"-Nic-e, seems like you know it.\" What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't get it, but- \"You to?\" Moving one hand just above her butt, she looked up at me stoticly. \"Heh, nice.\" With a small laugh from her, it looked like she was blushing a bit-</span></div></div>",

It was really cold, to, almost zero as the news says. Luckily having to not be out &amp; having earned over half-a-million dollars from a lottery, it was nice to know that you didn't have to labor for weeks on end just for some vacation days. <br>\r\nSo as the snowfall slowly intensified the Avatar movie came on, a good movie to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a bright flash &amp; small boom came from the window behind you, making you jump out of your seat in shock. Quickly speeding to the back window &amp; seeing snow zooming past the barren trees... There is a figure of a person laying in the snow near the woodline! Shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily running to the closet &amp; taking out a thermal jacket you'd put it on as you ran downstairs, running to the den &amp; quickly putting on your boots. <br>\r\nOpening the sliding door &amp; running out the cold was bitter &amp; the wind fierce, but you toughed it out to get to this figure! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAble to get there fast, it turned out to be a woman! Wearing some white beach attire &amp; face down in the snow, you quickly slipped both your hands under her &amp; lifted her in your hands. She was cold &amp; unconscious, you didn't waste any time heaving her somewhat heavy body back to the den. <br>\r\nRunning through the door &amp; plopping her onto the couch, her brown hair smacked you before you shut it. <br>\r\nA somewhat busty &amp; somewhat tall girl you checked her pulse to find her breathing &amp; her heart pounding rapidly, your immediate reaction to put your coats thermal-side over her freezing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Walking to the kitchen to grab your phone you thought of calling the police, then realized that this woman was unconscious &amp; they wouldn't be able to do much unless she's awake. Making you wish you had family here in your house to help, you sped back to the den &amp; found her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was kind-of weird seeing her curvaceous cleavage, though..<br>\r\nAfter a wheeze she'd look at you with teary eyes &amp; a red face, looking quite troubled. \"Ah.. Ha.. What? No! Where am I!?\" About to reply, her suddenly grabbing &amp; pushing your hand away before standing up angrily made you stop. She held her fist out &amp; looked angry, you'd put your palms up in surrender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being about four inches taller &amp; undoubtedly older, you stood still as she inched closer very slowly. <br>\r\n\"Your in my house, In the United States in Massachusetts. Im Kyle Hoen, you were passed out in the snow in my backyard..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing being rugged as she breathed out her mouth you felt nervous, seeing here eye you &amp; stop a foot away. \"Ok? I.. Came from the Fire Nation on Gaia. Was enjoying vacation.. Got ambushed..\" <br>\r\nShe crackles her fist &amp; exhales deeply, Kyle stepping back once. \"Hey.. What? Fire Nat-\" stopping yourself &amp; realizing that she's not from this world, you looked at her in utter confusion. \"Yeah! N-now, Kyle..\" Lowering her fist slowly you'd lower your hands, honestly feeling bewildered. <br>\r\n\"..Sorry for being hostile, for one..\" She inched closer. \"For two, I know getting here wasn't your fault &amp; im likely stuck..\" Breaking the six-inch line &amp; within grabbing distance you store down in slight fear &amp; arousal, she was hot, but seemed strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke a smile as her breathing slowed, looking behind her at the den &amp; then outside. \"Well, for three, may you please show me hospitality?\" Smiling at you fully, you felt saying 'no' would make her attack. You felt calling the cops now wouldn't help her confusion, &amp; now that she's awake, you could likely get into antics before tommorow. <br>\r\nDeciding to look up the 'Fire Nation' later, \"Sure, come with me?\" Answering in confusion as you walked down the hall &amp; her steps followed, you'd start walking upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suudenly-<br>\r\nBAM!-CRACK--<br>\r\nRunning upstairs as many bangs came from downstairs &amp; he heard men yelling 'Seize!' Among things, he ran to his room with the woman running right behind him. \"What!?\" Yelling &amp; slamming the door, the girl was looking furious. The stomps of people coming down the hall terrified them. \"We know your here! Yield &amp; you won't be harmed!\" <br>\r\nQuickly Kyle moved away from the door as she got into a fighting position with her index-&amp;-middle fingers out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFIRE burst through the door &amp; Kyle yelled in shock, his immediate reaction to grab &amp; pocket his wallet sitting on his bed before running to his closet. The girl jumped back as four men ran in through the fried door in clunky dark-red armor with samurai-like helmets, Kyle yelling in shock as one aimed at him with his fingers!<br>\r\nHastily dodging as fire shot right at him, the girl pounded the necks of the two guards in a small neck-cloth spot, KO'ing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire seared Kyle's arm some before the guard turned around &amp; barely dodged a kick from her, Kyle reacting with a straight elbow to the guards back before getting roundhoused by her. \"We need to go! NOW!\" <br>\r\nYelling to Kyle he ran to his dresser as fire burned &amp; found his keys on the ground instead, snatching them &amp; starting to feel confused as to what's happening. <br>\r\n\"Wha-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Yelling again, he decided to just do it &amp; followed her running down the hall. \"Whats happening?\" He whispers as she slows down, scouting the house from the top stair. <br>\r\n\"M.. Ozi's after me for a good cause is all.\" Saying back, &amp; confusing the hell out of him, he was quick to bolt to the front door hearing nobody else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore fire! Jumping back barely, the girl would athletically dive under the flames &amp; KO two guards, Kyle already hurting from his previous burns. First degree luckily..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! I hate this!\" Opening the door &amp; glancing around quickly he'd make sure she was coming, he watched in some fear as she ran back with a dagger from one of the KO'd guards. \"Things are changing, we have to flee!\" <br>\r\nQuickly they ran to Kyle's silver Ford off-road &amp; he got into the drivers, both of them ignoring the cold.<br>\r\nMore flashes from behind the house Kyle started the truck &amp; booked it in reverse, the girl just closing the door as this happened &amp; almost fell out. <br>\r\n\"Careful!\" She yelled, Kyle- \"Well im not used to this!\" He yelled back as armored people ran from the side of the house, firing fire at the truck as it drove quickly down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked back for a few seconds &amp; then exhaled deeply, Kyle starting to drive out of the neighborhood. \"No.. No, they mastered it! If the dang Avatar didn't die!\" She yelled, Kyle starting to see the picture a bit. <br>\r\n\"Are you telling me they're coming to our universe!?\" He asked quite worryingly, the girl nodding with a bare hum. \"Shit.. Ok, we'll go somewhere for tonight. Our police force should be on it soon.\" He said rather panicked, just wanting the invasion over-with until doing anything.. The neighborhood was small, so he got out to rural road hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't leave until I return. \" He told her &amp; exited the car with the keys, lookin' back at Ty Lee store at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the front office to see a older-looking woman sitting behind a desk asleep in a cushion chair, he'd snicker some &amp; lean on the counter. \"Hey?\" He inquiries, then backs up some as she jolts awake!  \"Ph-oha! Oh, welcome to Motel Six..\" she yawned deeply. \"Staying a night? Forty dollars.\" Telling him he'd take his wallet out &amp; give her the card to scan. He'd watch her give him the '06' keys &amp; beep his card in the register, handing it back &amp; smiling- \"Have a nice night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the office &amp; seeing Ty Lee staring at him with her hand on her cheek boringly he'd signal her to come with him, she'd happily open the door &amp; slam it shut before running <u>quickly</u> to him. <br>\r\n\"Brr- comeon!\" She'd hurry him, Kyle speed-walking to their room &amp; opening it hastily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was nice with a small flat-screen, two-seated short roundtable, mini-fridge &amp; a queen-sized bed. Kyle felt slightly nervous as there was only one bed, he didn't feel laying with a assassin-like hot girl would be very pleasing.. or very safe. But still feeling some arousal from her appearence &amp; not really caring to much seeing how Earth was likely under attack, he'd wait for her to enter before closing the door, locking it &amp; sighing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh.. finally safe &amp; warm..\" Ty-Lee would sigh in happiness, jumping back on the bed. \"..Right, well, looks like we're sharing this bed.\" Kyle said as he set his keys on the table with his wallet &amp; walked to the fridge, slightly shocked seeing the girl.. her legs are over her head &amp; she relaxes with her hands on her chin, a damn good gymnast. <br>\r\n\"Could be worse. Sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying to him happily as he checked the fridge to find it freshly stocked with cheese, ice-cream bars.. &amp; small bottled water, he sighed in slight tiredness. He was a bit surprised to hear her agree, laughing to himself.<br>\r\n\"Well then I'm bathing, don't wander off.\" He'd joke while walking into the bathroom, shutting the door &amp; seeing that it to was just stocked. <br>\r\nFinally being atleast two miles from his home he'd start undressing &amp; sigh in relaxation, happy to be back at a shower.

He started thinking about how crazy those people were &amp; how powerful Ty-Lee was, taking out likely a dozen of them. It was only slightly unnerving knowing that she could demolish him, but seeing she's on his side, he didn't worry so much. <br>\r\nWhile Kyle is preparing to enter the shower Ty-Lee rolled off the bed &amp; would hastily grab his wallet, opening it &amp; slipping many of the cards out. The credit, debit &amp; bank cards were all confusing so she'd put those back, then eyeing his driver's license carefully.. 'So he's over twenty..' She'd think among other things, slightly entranced by his picture from a year ago, then put it back in the wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd set it down &amp; peek out of the closed curtains, the snowfall gradually slowing down. Then looking around the room, the sound of the shower was all that she heard, part from the fridges low 'hum.' <br>\r\nGetting bored by having to wait for Kyle to be done she'd get an idea, feeling entertained as she slid under the bedsheets. Ty-Lee would raise her bikini-top off, laying under the thick blankets &amp; start to wonder what his reactions are gonna be..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..In the meantime..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral dozen Fire-Nation soldiers had come out from this portal in the back of Kyle's old home, most setting up a HQ around &amp; in the house as others scouted out his neighbors. With this neighborhood having as few as ten homes &amp; nature separating them all, they'd have perfect camouflage coupled with the misty snow.<br>\r\nOne of the general's, General Vex, stood in the fire-nation tent with three others. Seeing that they were technologically beaten by scouting the house he'd send many soliders to seize other homes &amp; the inhabitants, then get back to planning.<br>\r\n\"So this nations armies haven't got wind of us. Our forces should be nearing platoon levels by morning, if the time is right here.\" Vex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true with many men piling out of the flash, most carrying machinery parts, foodstuffs &amp; other tent parts. They'd just now begin setting up fire-podiums. <br>\r\n\"It is definite, by time reinforcements arrive we should be expanding our borders. Take more prisoners.\"  A armored man said &amp; Vex nodded, then another- armored woman, spoke. \"Don't forget, the threat of the escaped prisoner &amp; this worlds obvious advantage over range in warfare. It may hinder us if we're caught early. Making sure we're in numbers with our prisoners as leverage should work.\" <br>\r\nEveryone went silent, the woman sighing. \"Right. We'll go with Hilda's plan, tell some squads to seize the surrounding area &amp; bring everyone back to this home.\" <br>\r\nVex walked out of the tent quickly &amp; toward the house, soliders working on setting up perimeter posts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n..Back at the Hotel..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle finally finished his shower when the last sud went down the drain, hasty to shut it off &amp; sigh as he stepped out. Only slightly worried about the army coming through as he dried himself off, Kyle was disappointed with no earswabs, then stepped out of the bathroom dressed in his boxers-&amp;-pants &amp; shirt in hand. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, talk about one helluva night. Never expected to lose my house..\" Seeing that Ty-Lee was nudged comfortably under the blanket &amp; had her hands holding it tightly near her, Kyle was unsuspecting of her half-nakedness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd turn the flatscreen on &amp; flip the channels, stopping on the Avatar movie again. It was more than halfway over &amp; at the part where the Avatar's were getting ready to counterattack the people, Kyle lowering the volume slightly before walking to the other bedside.. <br>\r\n\"Definently could be worse, we're not dead.\" Ty-Lee said jokingly as Kyle rolled under the blanket, looking the other way he'd not see her body &amp; let the blanket settle over them. <br>\r\nWith the size of the bed they stood about two inches apart, under the sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had close calls. Anyway, watching <i>this</i> tonight? Im going to sleep, wanting tommorow to come.\" Kyle layed his back on the bed &amp; on one of the pillows, sighing as Ty-Lee stared at him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ty-Lee, however, she'd smile mischievously seeing Kyle fall asleep. Kyle was a heavy sleeper &amp; once he got going it'd take some movement to wake him, Ty-Lee now loozening her grip on the blanket &amp; sliding under the sheets some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe film was interesting though, she stopped her little 'prank' to awe over the animation &amp; battle. Reminding her of the vainity some people in battle would go through as the one woman in the painted helicopter was shot down, she'd stop watching it &amp; look back at Kyle, who was sleeping sound. <br>\r\nShe'd look under the sheets to see the two barely an inch apart, then she'd scoot back under the sheets some to lay facing him. <br>\r\nHaving her chest race along with her mind in the fact she was pranking a guy shirtless &amp; likely was going to wake him, she'd decide to continue anyways, after today she'd decide on many risks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying then for a minute thinking what to do Ty-Lee then decided to stealthily move under the blanket, able to continue &amp; unbutton his pants with ease. Knowing how men got from her beach encounters she'd want to get that out of the way, then laying back down. Then she felt a rush of nervousness &amp; some blushing, realizing that she's going to-be basically 'teasing' him, but was going along with it. <br>\r\nTired of stalling she'd finally do something, &amp; as in 'do something' that meant once again moving under the sheets &amp; making sure to keep the blanket over the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this felt impulsive she continued anyways, even figuring if he woke that this should be a 'make-up' for coming out of nowhere. Plus things seemed to be getting serious, she thinks it'll be sometime before they relax again if the Fire Nation is doing what she knows they are.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..While the events at the hotel happened, Vex, Milda, &amp; the othed armored man had been receiving reinforcements. The numbers coming to about one-hundred-&amp;-thirty, they'd easily seize the others in they're homes &amp; bring them to the camp. Fire nation soliders already had over two dozen tents, &amp; as the snowfall slowed Vex would come into the house &amp; to the living room where sixteen neighbours all sat in the middle, surrounded by the same amount of guards. <br>\r\n\"Men, woman, &amp; children, I know your all scared.

If we ask you all to follow us, <i>do it.\"</i> Everyone went quiet, more scared. <br>\r\n\"Got it?\" He said, many nodded &amp; some 'uh-huh'ed'. \"Good, ask a guard if you need something.\" Vex said quite annoyingly, exiting &amp; making way past the four tanks being built from many parts &amp; going toward the General's tent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nAnd as these two events concurred, they both continued into separate situations. Ty-Lee stealthily &amp; joyfully edging Kyle's pants down as Vex went to consult his commanders about courses of action, two contrasting situations got further apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kyle's pants were about halfway down his thighs Ty-Lee stopped moving them, seeing him justle around in his sleep. Wanting to keep things covert for the time she stopped moving for a minute, sighing in relief seeing he remained out. <br>\r\nSomewhat entranced by the musk under the sheets, her feet lay off the bedside.

As you looked back at the living room, you saw Jessica meddle with the stereo, turning on some lounge music. As she began to sing along with the song, you recalled that an old cartoon gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny cartoon character had a weakness to being hypnotized by a spinning hypnosis wheel. You could use it to make Jessica Rabbit your girlfriend and lover.

You shrugged before you did your best to lick and tongue her vagina.

I just need some time to recover. Human men have a refractory period,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica studied you for a few moments before she pushed herself away from you and said, \"I can fix that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leapt out of the hot tub and spun around.

You did expect the Dark Queen from Battletoads to be Jessica because of how similar they looked; Mirage confirmed it. That wasn't the the surprising part to you though. What Mirage said got you to wonder how different the Battletoads games would have been if Mirage had that role instead. Since the Dark Queen would show up between rounds mock and taunt Rash, Pimple, and Zitz, you had to wonder what those scenes would have been like as well as what her boss battles would have been like along with how she would have looked on an NES, Sega Genesis, Game Boy, and SNES for the various games released on those systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course while you were in lost in thought...</span></div></div>",

You had thought Mirage had hurt someone, but realize Mirage was playing Dead By Daylight as the Huntress and was hooked her first survivor. In a way, you were right about that. \"What? How did I get back home?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage pauses the game, then turns to you and says,\"I confess, I picked your pockets to get some info from you since you were spaced out, but I put it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm curious, why did you offer to help me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what your connection to Jessica is, but any enemy of my enemy is considered a friend,\" Mirage answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then took a bit to explain what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Jessica doesn't have an issue with you dating other toons like me and would prefer it to a human, but I wonder what would happen if Roger found out. I sense blackmail, revenge, betrayal, jealousy, and envy,\" Mirage says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I want to run the risk ending up on Roger's bad side,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will spin it as her fault and protect you if things go bad,\" Mirage says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's change the subject, would you like to get something to eat?\" you ask Mirage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to get a date with me? Fine, I'll accept,\" Mirage answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to get a few things and we'll have to make a stop before we go out,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you were dressed to go out and had your wallet, car keys, and phone. You noticed Mirage had finished the round with all survivors on a hook and won. She then turns the computer off. You escort Mirage to the passenger seat, then get in the driver's seat. Your first stop was the bank, but Mirage grabbed your arm. \"I think I should go in first,\" she says as she points out what looks like an armed robbery going on inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think you can handle it without any of the innocent bystanders getting hurt, go for it,\" you tell Mirage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of eight minutes you heard screams of fear and pain before Mirage came back and things looked calm inside the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked in, you saw what happened. The bank looked like it was a mess. \"I locked the doors and told the robbers that if they were able to activate five mechanisms in different parts of the bank while avoiding me, the doors will open for them. If I catch them and hook them all though, they're staying on those hooks until someone helps them off. If all four of them are hooked, the doors will work normally, but they won't have anyone to help them off the hooks,\" Mirage explained. Basically, Mirage turned things into a game of Dead By Daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage takes you to a guy on a hook with second degree burns to his face. \"This guy tried to point a weapon at me, so I decided to set his disguise on fire. He struggled a bit when I caught him, but I managed to hook him easily,\" Mirage explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then brings you to another guy on a hook. This one was wearing a ski mask, but one of his gloves was missing. Similar to the first robber, this guy had second degree burns on his hands. \"This idiot tried to use a hostage as a bargaining chip by holding her at knife point. I made the knife too hot to handle causing him to drop it, then moved fast while he still focusing on his and picked him up and brought him here,\" she informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage then brings you to a third hook. The guy on this one looked relatively unharmed if you ignore the hook going through him. \"This one was at one of the mechanisms to open the door, but started cowering in fear in when he saw me standing behind him. He provided the least fun of the four,\" Mirage continues her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage then takes you to a fourth hook. The guy on it had scratch marks on his back, \"This was the fun one. I had quite the chase with him. He knocked over a lot of stuff, but he was ultimately unable to escape my claws and ended up like the rest,\" Mirage reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, the hooks will leave them feeling weak for the next 24 hours. Do what you have to do and let's get going,\" Mirage says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed,\" you complement her on her actions as you walk up to the ATM to withdraw some some cash before leaving the bank.</span></div></div>",

They would really like to spend some time with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then spun around and shook her lovely rear at you as she asked, \"Or my behind? I do have some panties on to prevent you from leaving, but if you explore, I won't complain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica then turned around and leaned her face in close. \"Or should I keep you in my mouth? If I happen to swallow you, I do promise you won't get hurt. In fact, you might wind up in a place called 'Jessica Rabbit's stomach Land'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her, not saying anything.

She popened it and pulled out... well, they looked like Jessica, but their hair was black, their skin was tan, and they wore some Egyptian jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, Cleopatra?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jessica-lookalike nodded before she said, \"Call me when you need a history lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleopatra then jumped into the book and closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it's only a toon version of her, not the human version,\" Jessica explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then leapt onto floor, put her thumb in her mouth and began to blow. Jessica grew and grew... until she was back to her normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, after the success of Daffy's <i>Book Revue</i> cartoon, no one saw the point of trying to outdo him, so no one ever made another' everything comes to life in a store afterhours'.\" Jessica explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... you might've overgrown your... assets,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked down and gasped. Her bosom was really big! A single one of her boobs was three feet in diameter. Her behind was also pretty big, but not as extreme. She said, \"Whoops! Been since I've done this gag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then opened her mouth and squeezed her bosom until her boobs were back to normal. She then turned around and did the same with her behind, making sure to shake her booty as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for one I know I won't mess up,\" Jessica said as she walked over to a tall lamp. She then took a step behind it and just... vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoo hoo!\" Jessica said, appearing from the TV screen. She then climbed out of it, like it was a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" You exclaimed as you clapped your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you!\" Jessica answered with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you do it more often?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not seen as comic material. The best I can do is a lounge singer and a side character in my hunny-bunny cartoons,\" Jessica said. \"Any gags you would like me to do?\"</span></div></div>",

But I didn't see anything out of place part from a glass mug on the counter, so I put that back in the cabinet, turned off the light, &amp; then went back outside to get the fish..<br>\r\nGone, the water &amp; my fish! I looked forward to cooking them, but now I'd have to cook just hamburger and some mashed potatoes, ugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nobody was around and the bucket stood there, weird how it emptied. Part from a nagging suspicion that someone was around I turned back with the bucket in-hand and closed my door, locking both it &amp; the screen before walking to the garage.. Set the bucket in another &amp; hastily went to the deep-freezer, I pulled out two pre-made burgers from the top, closed it &amp; walked back- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...My kitchen light was back on again &amp; my pantry door was open, living alone was feeling eerie, making me wish I had more things to take my time. Fishing &amp; walking around my property &amp; doing temporary-jobs was all that I did.. So what bafoon would stalk a lone, middle-aged guy? <br>\r\nI closed the door after grabbing two mashed-tatoes and set them on the counter, then going on to get a big pan out for them and a flatter one for the burgers..

Turned out a woman stood in my kitchen, going right into my living room!...<br>\r\nWith blue hair &amp; red eyes, and some weird blue school-looking uniform on, we just stare. Shes stotic appearing and short, me being six feet, she looked young. \"Hey! What!?\" I yell in confusion, what's a girl doing here! And why is she blue haired!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened slightly, but continuing to make my food I opened the butter, put it in the flatpan &amp; started filling the bigger pan as she spoke. \"I am Rei Ayanami. Sorry if I intrude.\" <br>\r\nI feel flabbergasted, polite <i>and</i> mysterious? <br>\r\nPutting the pan on a burner &amp; butter in, I started glancing at her as I put the burgers on the flat. \"You do, why are you here? Be glad im hungry or I'd call the cops.\" <br>\r\nNot really, but prodding for answers with intimidation would help, she's got complexion so she's not albino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when she'd pull out a card with the label 'NERV' &amp; a picture of her on it &amp; hand me it, I taking it &amp; pocketing it as she stood about two feet back. \"I came here after I failed to defeat an Angel, how, I don't know.\" Now knowing to look this up, might as well be hospitable. Taking the milk out and pouring it into the boiling water, the potatoes followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. I'll look into that. Want to eat something?\"  I asked to see her expression of a bare smile, only a bit odd now. \"Yes, thank you.\" She'd walk behind me &amp; to the table, sitting herself.<br>\r\nI'd take a spoon &amp; mix the taetoes &amp; then flip the burgers, keeping this up for a minute. \"No prob.\" <br>\r\nAfter cooking the burgers through crisp &amp; the cheesy tatoes fully, I'd get two big plates and sort a few big tatoe piles on them and a bunned burger, to. \"Water?\" I asked as I set the plates down, seeing a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo giving her a spoon and a glass of water as I did myself, I sat across the table in more-so mystery as she stsrted eating. We met eyes for a few seconds before I'd start munching, the meal got silent &amp; stood like it throughout.. Gladly I didn't feel any bad intent, so I figure she can stay. <br>\r\nI finished first &amp; set my plate in the sink as she just she all the tatoes, drinking now. \"Well feel free to feel at home for tonight, in the morning I'll see what to do with you. <b>Don't</b> go being bad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to my front door and closing it, I'd lock it and go to the hall to see her follow. \"Thanks for the meal, &amp; courtesy.\" About to walk into my roo- \"Your name?\" She asked. \"Kyle Smith, now please leave me for a few minutes.\" Entering my room and closing the door nearly fully, I got on ny computer and booted it up. Heard a door in the hall open and figured Rei was looking around, not much of a bother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it was on I went to google and searched 'NERV', getting 'evangelion' as a result. Turned out.. Rei is a vessel of a spirit-alien thing and a fictional.. Well, not now, anime girl? This hit me hard with confusion, but then I heard the shower start running, meeting herself at home was took literally..<br>\r\nFiguring there isn't much to do tonight apart from question reality &amp; this girl, making her a place to sleep on the couch seems good enough. <br>\r\nHeading to the hall closet I saw the bathroom door remained open, ignoring it &amp; taking out a floofy blanket and a pillow to lay on the fluffy couch, oh how I do love my furniture.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo going back to my room &amp; turning my TV on, I'd see it was almost ten minutes in the shower as I shut off my computer.<br>\r\nFiguring either she zoned out or just taking forever, I waited probably another three watching TV. Ugh, I just want to sleep, mystery doesn't really kill tiredness.. <br>\r\nWalking down the hall and just stopping at the door, \"Rei, done? Taking a while.\" And after a few seconds it stopped. \"Yes.\" She ssid rather quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading <i>back</i> to the kitchen and getting water for myself- I was a bit shocked to see her walking out in undergarments! Being an adult felt weird like this, she'd have her dress over her hand and still drip some. \"You can sleep on the couch tonight, if you wake up early then just wait.\" <br>\r\nNot really wanting to stare &amp; simply sleep, I sped past her &amp; into my room. This was quite weird for me, so jumping in bed &amp; muting TV I began dozing off..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow crazy was it today to have a short pale girl appear? Dunno, but I feel this'll get weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though you felt there was no reason for overcaution when awake, she was definently weird, and would <i>definently</i> get even more-so. While you slept rather soundly a rainstorm would enroach on the horizon, Rei would sit on the blankets &amp; stare at them through the window. <br>\r\nThe thunderstorm approached within minutes &amp; rain began to pour down rather calmly, fluctuating between that &amp; strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd zone out staring at the rain, and as it started steadily pouring hard she'd snap out of it, not realizing almost fifteen minutes had passed. Seeing the darkness of the house and the quietness of it, it was very calming, but internally Rei felt uneasy. <br>\r\nKnowing that this isn't home &amp; that there wasn't much to know now about this one, Rei decided to get up with the big blanket and walk toward your room. <br>\r\nPeeking through the door to see your head poking out of the blanket &amp; hear quiet snores, Rei would enter the room quietly and glance at everything while slowly walking toward the bedside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were to much of a heavy sleeper to be woke by someone's presence, she seemed to know that. Throwing the blanket over the bed you shook a bit, but didn't do much more as she climbed under both of them on the other side. The queen-sized bed barely fit both of you comfortably and Rei would stare at your sleeping face, only a few inches away from you. The fact she was in her undergarments didn't bother her despite knowing it urked you, she even jokefully thought of your many reactions if you were to wake now or in the morning, it eased her some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd face up and stare at the TV for a few minutes before laying down, dozing off at the sound of the rain. Of many thoughts that she had, the one about what might happen tomorrow stuck the most.. <br>\r\nYou'd press against her back with your arm while sleeping, Rei ignoring this &amp; continuing to fall asleep..

Felt her smooth stomach &amp; slowly ran my hand across it, working down to her pant-<br>\r\nWhat a dream. But, im more shocked to see Rei! My crotch bulge under my pants is firmly against her butt, one of my hands over her &amp; laying on her stomach, god. I think she's dead asleep though, slightly looking over I see her eyes closed &amp; feel her stirring in her sleep barely. Another blanket lies over us &amp; shes under it with me, &amp; now that I think of it, I didn't tell her where she couldn't sleep.. Now I feel quite awkward, feeling sexually charged by a young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally though, im still shocked about her appearing. In general, what's the chance the two universal points meet &amp; allow for unharmed physcial travel &amp; to appear here? Universally low. But-<br>\r\nUgh, Im not risking my morals touching her, would be very wrong. <br>\r\nSlowly turning the other direction and stepping out of bed, I saw the sun barely peek out behind clouds in the horizon. I saw her turn on her back a few seconds after, least she ended up here &amp; not somewhere bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalked out &amp; made way to my kitchen &amp; saw her dress on the couch, but with not much in mind Im just gonna eat. Got in a cabinet &amp; took a big bowl out with a box of Raisin Bran, filled it a little over half &amp; poured milk in it until it floated some. Grabbed a spoon.. Ate it all within probably five minutes. <br>\r\nNow for a shower, I got up and was <i>about</i> to put it in the sink- Rei stood in the doorway again! And in her undergarments! What the.. stealthy &amp; weird. I likely looked confused, I know I am, why didn't she put her dress on? <br>\r\n\"Morning.. hungry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Got a simple reply, I rinsed my bowl out &amp; put about the same amount of Bran in it with milk &amp; a spoon. I ignored her slightly unflattering appearance as she sat down, I went to walk out. \"Im bathing, knock if you need me.\" No reply, I went down to my room to grab my bathrobe &amp; a pair of drawers. Threw my pants off &amp; into a dirty-clothes basket in the hall before closing the door to the bathroom, a bit surprised to see it very neat after Rei was in it yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off &amp; setting my bathrobe on the door hanger I followed with my undergarments, feeling the black towel hanging mostly dry as I turned the shower on. Stepping in it once the water was hot enough, I wet my hair before slathering shampoo onto it. Began washing it out while enjoying the texture of the water...<br>\r\nRelaxation.. Ah, nice to be by myself again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knock Knock</i>, figured that wouldn't last long. <br>\r\nWas alone for what, three minutes? I peeked past the curtian- \"What?\" I somewhat yelled, then saw her open the door a bit, almost making me angry, expected her to ask through it. \"....Can I come in?\" <br>\r\nUh- really? Talk about provoking' some weird thoughts. \"Why?\" I question back &amp; retreat behind the black curtain, thankfully its opaque. \"I want-to bathe.\" Feeling a bit annoyed, now, after this morning.. Then remembering her predicament &amp; thinking maybe she's mentally off for some reason, well, my.. Ugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then there's giving her a fake ID, or just no ID at all.. <br>\r\nSoaping my chest up, Rei would walk Into the showerstream &amp; close the curtain. Felt a little weird seeing her stare straight at me, &amp; ignoring the pings of arousal, continued soaping myself.. <br>\r\nShe'd grab the shampoo &amp; step out of the stream, I had to step back once to give her room.

I just want to feel at home..\" Oh- I just can't argue, Ayanami may be deceiving me but I guess I'll just deal with my sexual frustrations.. \"Fine, just wear panties everyday, at-least.\" Asking, she'd stay silent but still keep a smirk, I heard the coffee machine stop~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd be watching the whole time, &amp; I think it's paranoia, but if someone appears I don't want a nearly naked girl being the first thing they see. \"Can I sit there?\" Asking me as soon as I sat in my recliner &amp; flipped the TV onto Pike Man, she seemed uninterested in it, now standing &amp; walking toward me. \"Im sitting here, Ayanami, go sit down.\" Taking a drink of my hot coffee &amp; then setting it onto the table- <br>\r\nAs soon as I leaned back Ayanami pushed herself between my legs, pressing her ass &amp; back against my dick, making it quickly harden- \"Hey!\" Yelling, I didn't move her off, feeling her body.. She's warming me up, probably testing me. \"I sat down.\" She said stoticly before turning to the TV, her grin was sly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy frustration is real, I don't know how to think about feeling her shake her butt against my dick, &amp; it's gradually pressing up higher on her back. \"..Why on me?\" I asked her, honestly, resisting the urge to touch her is getting harder. \"Im not on you, just against you.\" Replying to me after a few seconds, she was fixated on the TV.. Well- I brought one hand to her stomach &amp; pushed her back, she'd stop sitting straight, laying back on me. <br>\r\nHer glare looked of mixed emotions, wow, I just went there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your.. on me now.\" She turned back to the television, wordless. I felt some weird tension &amp; alot of lust, I would keep my hand on her soft stomach, contradicting everything thought of earlier- slowly grinding against her, the cloth would hurt slightly even as I felt some precum lubing me. \"Urges?\" Simply asking stoticly &amp; not looking back at me, I definently feel like an assaulter, she has much time to get up though. <br>\r\n\"Not helping me control them, Ayanami.\" Stopping my grind &amp; slowly rubbing my hand up &amp; down her stomach I would gradually work my fingers downward, her breathing increasing just barely.<br>\r\n\"Don't do anything permanent.\" Was all I heard her say, &amp; I felt my mind losing reason, im enjoying this <i>to</i> much.. But, as long as it's not permanent- <br>\r\nBringing my other hand over her breast I took in the petite softness of it, taking liberties to squeeze her areolas &amp; grip both breasts hard~ she leaned her head back to, now making me feel like surprising her with a reverse cowgirl, but it's best to wait for <u>that.</u> Plunging two fingers into her panties I felt her jump some as I rubbed over her vaginal entrance, it seems tight.. &amp; warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, know what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps She-Ra does as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth siblings protect different planets. Both planets are sister planets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe-Man protects Eternia and She-Ra protects Etheria. Their real identities are Prince Adam and Princess Adora.</span></div></div>",

A killer thunderstorm had rolled in during the morning, luckily resources are plentiful. I sit now infront of my fireplace with some Ginseng, watching out the window as the rain pours down heavily.. Look back on how I got here like I do sometimes, im one of the best martial artists- just chop. That's it, a kick or a chop defeats almost anything instantly. Monsters near God level I've defeated, but never got with the Hero Association just because it is not my cup of tea. My cozy log cabin is nuzzled near MO-City in the mountains, easy access to supplies after im done gold panning in the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning is awfully strong, flashes are often happening outside now. It's entrancing to watch.. Then a very loud cracking sound with a green flash, there's a slam into the ground- I quickly jump up from my recliner &amp; swoop toward the door, disregarding boots or a coat. I open it &amp; look out, about half a mile away the forest sears with fire even as it rains. Rarely anything bad happens near my house- im not taking chances. Jumping far &amp; fast, my body is weightless &amp; I can glide like a eagle- then I see a crater with a girl in it, fire searing the forest &amp; ground around. <br>\r\nHer hair is green &amp; she is passed out- also almost nude, her black clothes are ripped &amp; barely together. She looks like a young teen.. Breathing in gaps, it is not my focus immediately. I land &amp; begin to clap at the fire, putting it out by shooting the rain at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasily done, I look at her- why today? Looks like life decided to throw a problem my way.. But she is injured! I see some scrapes around her chest &amp; a very bare bruise on her forehead, yeah, time to go. Not really focusing on her soft body, ass &amp; such as I pick her up I'd quickly jump back toward my home. The landing was smooth despite the mud, I quickly made way in as the lightning got worse again.. <br>\r\nWould walk to my recliner &amp; set her on it- though it now was wet, it was warm, the fire kept it like that. This lady grunted in pain, definitely not well, breathing steady now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\nFigure she'll be ok. Should wait for her to wake up, &amp; if not soon, bring her to MO-City. Would grab my tea from the coffee table infront of the recliner, taking a drink of it as I made way into my bedroom. <br>\r\nWould grab one of my shirts- im a 6'4\" man, lady barely reaches my nipples to, so this will do well to cover her. Made way back into the main room to see she's slouched over &amp; out still, atleast comfortably. Throwing the big shirt on her &amp; finishing my tea, I set that down &amp; would sit infront of the fire, closing my eyes &amp; holding my hands together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackness.. For long. <br>\r\n...................................<br>\r\nCalming it is, hearing the tapping of the rainfall &amp; booms in the sky. \"HEY!\" There's a high-pitched yell behind me- she is awake. See she is holding my shirt around her front, her feet tuck it in as she puts them on the recliner. Angry looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awake? Sorry- you ok?\" There's a few seconds silence. \"No im not ok! Where am I!? Who are you!\" Really confusing me here.. \"Samo Felork, nice to meet.. You? We're near MO-City, found you in a crater near my house.\"<br>\r\nHer face contorts like she is taking in something bad, she seems to shive a bit. \"So I lost..\" She lost?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tatsumaki. I take it A-City is okay?\" A-City? There's only AO-City.. \"AO-City is okay, has been for two months.\" Her expression seems a mix of anger, confusion &amp; submission.. The storm has also calmed. How long was I focusing on the blackness? \"IM NOT EVEN IN MY WORLD!?\" Her yelling was like a shriek, very annoying. \"...Dunno.. Uh, just found you, Tatsumaki. Want me to get out of here so you can properly dress? Your not hurt to bad?\" Feeling like a young schoolboy, I see her expression drop near expressionless for a few seconds. Also feel stupid not acknowledging her world shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.. YES! GO!\" Sheesh.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk back in my room &amp; sit on the bed, closing the door fully. See her eyeing me down as I leave, figure she didn't like me seeing her tiny nude body.. Goodness teen's &amp; mortal danger don't get me going..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While you didn\u2019t have a VR headset to make the most of the virtual arcade and theater environment, you did have an excellent PC, which was good enough for you. You configure the game\u2019s  files and added the file into the game as a VHS tape. You also got a chiptune version of the show\u2019s theme song, which you added as a tape for the game\u2019s radio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter configuring it, you boot the game up on Steam, access the Neon Arcade from the menu, then pick up the radio in the game and put it in the theater. You then went back for tape with the song and put it in the radio, then pick up video tape and insert it into the VCR connected to the projector in the game. A second later, you heard a loud crash coming from your living room. You decided to pause the video and check it out. and noticed a woman in a yellow jumpsuit. She looked like she was worn out. \u201cOh, sorry about showing up unannounced. My name is April O\u2019Neil. I\u2019m with a reporter for Channel 6 news,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m Alex Mason.

I'd like you to show me around this apartment if you don't mind.\" She said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be glad if you will just follow me....\" You started to escort her down the hallway but your phone rings and you answer it the young cartoon news reporter is startled beyond belief when she sees you pull out the tiny beeper like device shaped like a phone from your pocket you speak a few words into it and press the red icon signaling 'End Call' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that you're holding?\" April asked unable to help herself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called a cell phone Ms. Oneil and I use it to call people and.....\" You started but were interrupted by her looking curious and bewildered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a phone? Bu-but it's incredibly tiny! Don't you guys still use payphones anymore?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually a few payphones still exist in some cities in America and a few people do use them from time to time but mostly no they're been out of fashion and date for the last two decades now!\" You explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last two decades? Where exactly am I?\" She asked arching a eyebrow <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The year 2018 no this is not the future in case you're wondering just because everything looks all new and stuff we still use cars not fly around on jet packs! You seem pretty interested in my cell phone Ms. Oneil would you like to see it?\" You asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly!\" April cried out as she took it from you examining it closely <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This thing would make one heck of a news coverage! It even has a television like screen on it! So what else can this cell phone do? Besides use it to call people?\" She asked eagerly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All sorts of things....\" You said telling her to first press the icon shaped like a mailbox <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see in this age and day we use what's called email which uses rather than receiving and sending letters the old fashioned way(although we still do that too) all we have to do is type in someone's address or to be more specific another person's email address we can send them practically anything from simple messages to actual pictures through either this cell phone or a computer....now if you will press the icon shaped like a camera.\" You instructed she did and was anotished as a much more advanced camera that what she was used to came on <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although we still use camcorders most people prefer to use the built in cameras on their phones it can did everything normal cameras can do take all sorts of pictures among other stuff including selfies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril ignored the part about selfies as she of course didn't understand the word(she was from the 1980s after all) and examined the phone further <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's really incredible! But what's this picture of a globe here?\" She had accidentally pressed the home button and was pointing at the Internet icon <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and press the globe icon Ms. Oneil.\" You said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...whoa! What is this! The World Wide Web? What's that?\" She asked nearly dropping the phone in shock <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called the Internet basically all you have to do is type in any word of words and it will show you a endless amount of results,pictures etc about-well just type in something like news reporter or something using the built in keyboard at the bottom.\" But April found the buttons far too small for her to press and too confusing and gave the phone back to you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really incredible! Oh I got so carried away with your phone I never even bothered to ask you your name!\" She gasped <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willy.\" You replied as you shook her hand <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Willy very nice to meet you and see your amazing technology but I really must be getting back to New York,I do have a major news story to cover......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait I don't think you can go anywhere Ms. Oneil-I mean April.....\" You said suddenly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why not?\" She asked thinking you were about to hold her captive as she was often a damsel in distress throughout the original Turtles series in the 90s <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the portal remember? The strange portal that you fell into sending you here? You possibly have to wait for it to reappear again I don't know how long that may be though.\" You apologized <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah I forgot about that Willy. Looks like I'm stuck here for the time being.\" As she sat back down on the couch <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go and rest in the guest room if you want are you hungry by any chance? I got-I mean my folks have plenty of food.\" You said concernly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really at least not right now thank you for asking but I guess I will go and rest for a bit.\" April stood up and smiled sunnily at you \"Thank you for your kindness towards me.\" As she affectedly put a hand on your shoulder and was about to go back to the guest room when.....</span></div></div>",

He'd probably enjoy a chance to briefly live in a world where he doesn't have to fight Dr. Wily and his robots. Where at most, he'd have to deal with normal crimes, and that's if he'd choose to. He'd probably have faith that Dr. Light would bring him home. There's the possibility he'd worry about energy, but he can probably sleep to recharge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's Proto man, Mega man's brother. Sure, he works for Dr. Wily, but he tends to ignore orders that he doesn't like, and probably rebelled a few times, just for the fun of it. He'd probably treat the whole thing as a vacation, of not trying to talk you into committing crimes. Or perhaps you might be the one who talks him into going full hero?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd third, there's Roll. Unlike her video game counterpart, she looks to be in her late Teens-early 20's. She does her best to support Mega man and tries to prove herself as a hero. Her left forearm has a multi-use utility device for use in housekeeping. However, she mostly uses it to fight Wly's robots, suggesting she modifies it quite often. Perhaps she might use the situation to prove herself a hero in a world where Mega Man is only a video game character/video game character?</span></div></div>",

I must be miles away from Dr. Light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you asked, making the woman jump a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting something in one of her pockets, she turned to face you, holding out her left arm as if it were a weapon.

Who are you and why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman let out a sigh as her left hand returned. She answered, \"My name is Roll. My brother and I were visiting  a private technology show. I'd say more, but I doubt you're cleared for it. Got a phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I think you're not in your home dimension any more...\" You said, pointing at your home phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Roll asked as she picked up the phone and dialed. After a few moments, she looked puzzled and tried dialing again. A few more attempts got her mad enough to put the phone down roughly. She asked, \"I can't reach him. The operator said the number is not in service! Why do you think I'm not in my home dimension?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up a few Mega man games and the DVD of the TV show. \"This is why, Ms. Roll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the games and DVD, Roll muttered, \"Sizzling circuits! Dr. Gates said his teleporter might sent anyone to another dimension! I guess there's no harm in telling you how I got here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and so did you. She began, \"So the Technology show was about a prototype teleporter. Somehow, Dr. Wily found out about it and attacked. Mega gave me the teleporter and told me to run. However,  Wily's saucer fired some weird missiles that caused gaps to appear in the floor. I fell into a cave that was underneath the place. When the cave I was stuck in began to collapse, I decided to use the device, even though the coordinates were... weird... Now I know it sent me to another dimension.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyway to get you home?\" You asked as she brought out the teleporter from her pockets. It looked like a TV remote with a screen built in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I think. I need to recharge it and check to see if it needs repairs. Thankfully, it can recharge with solar power, it just needs a week or two,\" Roll answered as she looked the teleporter. \"I can do repairs in the morning. Do you have a spare room I can stay in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I gotta ask. Why are you so calm?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a robot and I'm on an adventure that Mega never went on! I'm too excited to be scared!\" Roll answered with a thumbs up and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, hoping she really felt as she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you showed Roll to her room, you went to your room and fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you...</span></div></div>",

When she entered the door, she stretched in a way that brought your attention to her bosom. As she sat down, she said, \"Haven't had a good workout in a long time! I've either had to help Mega deal with some problem with Dr Wily, an experiment of Dr. Light going haywire, or some goodwill job that Dr. Light sends us on. I know he means well, but a gal needs her practice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how goes the repairs on the teleporter?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Aside from the battery problem, I'll need to fix some minor problems. Some of the parts are close to shorting out. So if you are able, can you take me to a electronic shop or a junkyard? Otherwise, I can jury-rig what I need from the teleporter itself, some of your stuff, and parts from my own body,\" Roll answered. She then looked at her body and muttered with a cute pout, \"I'd really rather not, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a store or two in the town nearby. Might have to travel a bit to some of the towns. As for junkyards, I'm not certain there's one nearby, but I'll check the internet,\" You replied. \"I do have a question. What do you think of the Mega Man games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Those.I thought they were pretty neat. I just wish they were more accurate to the stuff that me and Mega do on a daily basis,\" Roll answered with small smile. \"And do the video game versions look like kids to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not my decision, but as time does on, the artwork for each does seem to suggest that Rock and Roll were slowly modified to look older as the games went on,\" You answered with a shrug. \"So... After I finish eating, shall we go look for the parts? Or should we go walk around or even see some movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of Movies?\" Roll asked with some suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martial art movies. There's a marathon in town,\" You answered, making Roll smile. \"Your choice, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of pondering, Roll answered...</span></div></div>",

Okay,\" You answered, remembering that episode where Dr. Light made a robot college where robots ate computer chips or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm ready and you're ready. I think it's time to go!\" A smiling Roll said, carrying the picnic basket in on hand. She walked over to you and hugged you with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she was soft! As soft as a human would be! You naturally asked in the most intelligent way you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh... Buh... Gah...\" You uttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hn?\" Roll uttered in a curious tone. After a few moments, she realized what the matter was. She let you got and stepped away. With a bit of a nervous laugh, she said \"Oh! whoops! Kinda forgot you are a teenage boy and I look and feel like a woman in her early twenties! My bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... It's alright... but how? How are you so... soft?\" You asked, blushing a bit at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. I guess it's something about my design, but let's go on a trip!\" Roll said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two of you headed out. Roll asked, \"So where are we going?\"</span></div></div>",

W-what are you doing?\" She shrieked trying to push you away with one hand and point her wand at you but she immediately began squirming around you could tell by the blank expression and the way she was biting her lower lips she was struggling not to laugh <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you wanted to play around with me didn't you?\" You said calmly stroking her sides a bit harder \"It's my turn now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh....Noooooooooo!

Go ahead and ask me anything!\" She said smirking a bit <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'll give her two out of three!\" You thought <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win,manage to answer most of the questions I ask I.....I'll let you do whatever you want to me,you're free to use your magic on me anyway you'd like I won't complain!\" You said truthfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I really don't think...that's a good idea.....\" Hermione frowned heavily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem you were going to erase my memory eventually right? Anyway let's get started......\" You began <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first test was a find-it-word which she had to find the hidden letter in a small box of blue polkadots ranging from LEFT to which she correctly guessed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T that's obliviously as its right there.\" Hermione said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second test was another find-it to which she had to find a series of smiley faces in a small box of red polkadots <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again obvious it's the frowning face!\" She said bored <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You're good at this!\" You muttered amazed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's honestly not that hard to figure out Willy!\" She said folding her arms \"Anyway next one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next ones involved more find-its in small boxes filled with yellow and pink polkadots to which Hermione effortlessly found the answers without much difficulty at all <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heart for the pink one and the correct number is 275 for the yellow box! Again this is considered a little too simple for me!\" She expressed truthfully \"Come on give me some hard ones you said you want to know how smart I am!\" She insisted a bit impatiently <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you asked for it!\" You said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A athlete is able to jump FOREVER. However,everytime that she jumps she gets a bit more tired,and every jump goes 1/2 as far as her prior jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for her first jump,she goes 1/2 of a foot. On her second jump,she goes 1/4 of a foot and so on and so forth. How many jumps does it take for her to travel one foot?\" You asked hoping to stump her on a really complicated math problem even the top genius nerds in your school couldn't answer <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmm well you're right this does require a bit of logical thinking.....\" Hermione said her hand on her chin finally she came to a conclusion <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the answer's simple she'll won't be able to get to the first mark if you continue to add the smaller amounts step by step.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How did you come to that?\" You asked antonished <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not hard if you think about it from a mathematic view of point Willy. I told you this type of stuff isn't that hard for me to figure out.\" Hermione said a broad smile on her face \"Here let me show you how to figure it out.....\" And she brought out her wand and muttered a inaudible word and a lifelike illusion of a stick figure jumping over a series of hurdles appeared in midair <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See how long it takes for them to make it? It's simple to figure out.\" She showed you as with another wave of her wand the illusion vanished and she stowed the stick back into her jeans pocket \"Now are there anymore you want to ask me?\" She smiled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're actually enjoying this?\" You asked stunned \"I thought it might be a bit boring or something.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no it's actually quite exciting Willy! Go on ask me some more!\" She pressed you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay and for the final test maybe she'll like a murder mystery puzzle after all she'll eventually help Harry and Ron defeat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named aka Lord Voldemort!\" You thought surely she won't be able to figure out this one <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay here's one,a good one.\" You said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay this takes place at a bar or what you would call it a pub(\"I'm sure they're the same thing Willy.\" She pointed out)the man lying on the floor was a gangster or criminal called Three-Fingers Jim when the police arrived on the scene Jim was lying unconsciously on the floor of the bar,the autopsy result showed that a bullet had went through Jim's left ear,the bullet was defined to be the same kind of the gun that Marco,a close partner of Jim owned both of them used to have a lot of arguments as they often went to the same bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at that very moment of the murder there were only Marco and two waiters and when the police asked he(Marco answered) \"There was no customer in the bar at the time. And I was the first person to enter and a moment later Jim walked in with a knife in his hand and yelled angrily \"Marco will be the last day of your life!\" Then he held the knife and came at me so I pulled out the gun in self-defense and opened fire.\" You continued as Hermione listened carefully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only eyewitnesses were the waiters there,they confirmed Marco's story to be true. When the police officer in charge heard this he placed him under arrest and took him to jail. So the question is how did the police officer know Marco was lying?\" You finished and turned to the 13th year old witch thinking this would stump her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh! A murder mystery hmmmmmm! Well this requires a bit of thinking more than usual if I was a ordinary average person but I believe the correct answer is when the other bandit Marco said Jim came upon him with the knife if that was true then they should have been facing one another then the bullet would have never went into Jim's left ear apparently the police officer figured that out as easily as I just did so that's that. Do you have anymore brain teasers for me?\" Hermione gave you a solid sweet smile obliviously she was enjoying this a little too much <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er no.....\" You gave up and tossed the book aside in defeat \"It's oblivious not only are you the world's smartest witch in your magical world,you could just as well be the most intelligent person on the planet! I mean these are puzzles,riddles only guys like Sherlock Holmes can answer.....you know who he is right?\" You asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do!  He's that fictional detective person who lived in the Victorian era and solved all sorts of mysteries!\" Hermione pointed out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You really are Smart!\" You gibbered breathlessly but she shook her head smiling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm just highly logical Willy! I happen to notice a lot of stuff most people would easily overlook but that was very fun! Thank you I rather enjoyed it!\" As she put her hand on your shoulder affectingly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess you won after all,anything you want to do to me you're perfectly free to! I won't complain!\" You said but she shook her head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh I couldn't.......\" Hermione looked horrified <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright I don't care what you do to me!\" You said truthfully but she still looked unsure and wary to do it she hesitated to pull her wand out of her back jeans pocket <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are you certain....because I must warn you I'm rather good at most spells,a little too good and if I wind up hurting you or worse.......\" She stuttered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have complete confidence in you Hermione! If you wanted to hurt me you already would have the moment you met me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh don'....don't say that just because you're a Muggle doesn't mean you don't have feelings!\" She protested feeling stung by your words \"But alright if you insist(as she pulled out her wand again)now the spell I'm going to cast on you is only temporary alright? It won't last long okay? Here goes stay perfectly still......\" She instructed you did as she asked and muttering the same inaudible words she.......</span></div></div>",

Take a look.\" She said, holding up a mirror. When you looked in it, you didn't see yourself. Instead, a green bunny was in your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned me into a bunny? Why?\" You asked. You were a little surprised that you could still speak English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted you to be happy. Doesn't this feel good?\" She asked as she petted you.

She left you on the couch and went to go get you something to eat. Though it felt weird being a furry creature, you had to admit, she was right. It felt nice having her take care of you like that. She came back with a nice juicy carrot.

You weren't sure about what to do. Before you could react though, the leader grabbed Hermione and kissed her. He held her close to him, Hermione accidentally dropped her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a cute mouse. I'm going to take you home. We'll have some real fun.\" Although she struggled, the bully wouldn't let go. After he kissed her again, you ran up to him and punched him as hard as you could. He let go of Hermione and put his hand to where you hit him. \"You brat! I'll show you what happens when you mess with me.\" He took a step forward and pushed you to the ground. You scraped your arm on the sidewalk. Luckily, Hermione had time to grab her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you, now it's time to punish you!\" The angry girl said. She waved her wand and spoke some words. Before they knew it, the three bullies turned into geese. Unlike when you were transformed however, the three bullies couldn't speak English. The leader honked at her, shocked. \"Leave, before I turn you into bugs and step on you!\" She said. The leader backed up. All scared and confused, the three flew away with their new wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" You told her. Hermione fell onto her knees, terrified of what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even . . . want to know . . . what he was going to do with me. What if he treated me like a slave! Or something worse.\" You went over to her and held her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to let that happen. I would have fought him with my bare fists until one of us collapsed if I had to. Don't worry about getting into trouble, look around. No one even noticed.\" It was true, it was as if nobody noticed, or cared. Hermione smiled, she liked having a friend by her. \"Please, let me do something to make you feel better. Tell me what to do, I'll do anything.\" You meant it as well. She thought for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hotdog might be nice.\" She said. You nodded and helped her get back on her feet. You took her to a hotdog stand. She got a nice hotdog with ketchup and mustard on it. The two of you sat down at a table to eat. Hermione was feeling more comfortable now. Once she was done, she looked over to you.

She loved the animals, and absolutely adored the petting zoo.  When it started to get late, you suggested that it was time for the two of you to go home. However, she had another idea. She suggested that the two of you hide until night time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we do that?\" You asked, afraid to know. She gave a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can become zoo animals for a day. I'll use my magic to keep us hidden, we wait until night, go for one of the animals, then with my magic, we turn into the same kind. Then we can hang out until tomorrow night.

You waited until everyone left and it was pure silent. She then took you to a cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You said looking at the cage she chose. She picked the sea turtles. They had an island in the middle and lots of water to swim in. \"How are we going to tell which one we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, with my magic, we'll communicate through thought. Then at the end of tomorrow, I'll call you and change us back.\" Hermione was confident. She then teleported both of you in the cage. You struggled to keep your head above the water. You didn't need to worry for long, as she then transformed both of you into turtles. Hermione's wand fell to the bottom. \"<i>Don't worry, I'll hold my wand with my mouth when I need it. I'll keep it in my shell so they don't think it's a normal stick.</i>\" She told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, people came to see you. You were surprised how many people liked turtles.

You luckily remembered that you had ice cream in your freezer. It hadn't been opened yet so it was completely fresh. You took the ice cream and a spoon out and set it in front of Hermione. \"Wait. Are you saying . . . Do I get all of this?\" She asked. You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as much as you like. Just try to not make yourself sick.\" You said. She nodded, then didn't hesitate. She started to eat it all away. You couldn't believe how fast she was eating. \"Whoa hold on! You'll get a brain freeze!\" You warned her. She stopped when she heard you, but still got a brain freeze. She put her hand to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow ow. Well at least you warned me before I ate everything.\" She said. Once it was gone, she continued, but slower. She soon had a few more bites left. Instead of eating them right away, she asked a strange request. \"Can I put this on your stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What do you mean?\" You heard what she said, but you weren't sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to tickle you, so I want to put this ice cream on your bare belly. Then I'll use my tongue to lick it away. Unless you're scared to have a girl get that close.\" She said and giggled. You told her you would do it, but not in the kitchen. Instead, you took her out to the backyard. You took off her shirt so she had easy access to your belly. Once you laid down on your back, she sat right next to you. Hermione started to put the remaining bits of ice cream on your stomach, licking her lips. You couldn't believe you agreed to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have one request before you do this. Can you act like you have kidnapped me? I know it's weird, but I like the feeling of you having complete control over me.\" Though it was a weird request, you wanted her to have as much fun as she could. She smiled and cover your mouth with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence boy. You're all mine to use. In fact . . .\" She started to say and pulled out her wand. With her magic, she made rope appear on your legs and arms. You could no longer get up without her help. She finished putting the ice cream on you. She leaned down to your ear and whispered. \"You look tasty, my sweet treat. Don't think about escaping, none of your friends are coming to rescue you in time.\" Hermione licked up the ice cream. Her tongue tickled you a lot. You started giggling, and begged her to stop. She simply giggled. \"You can't escape me. Once I'm done here, I have something else planned.\" She said. Hermione loved this game, she liked feeling powerful, plus her friend was technically willing. Hermione licked it up until it was gone. You couldn't stop laughing. You couldn't help it, your belly was sensitive. \"I'm done there. Now it's time to meet your fate.\" Hermione . . . .</span></div></div>",

The two of you walk down the street, it took about five minutes to get there. The store was pretty big, and you knew it had tons of candy inside. Hermione stepped in first, when she did, something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hermione entered, confetti came down from the ceiling, and there was a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CONGRATULATIONS! You are are out 1,000 visitor. As a reward, you get to eat as much candy as you want FOR FREE!\" The female owner said happily. Hermione was caught off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean . . Me?\" She asked. The owner nodded and told her it was alright. Hermione looked at all of it, she was very hungry. She licked her lips and didn't hesitate anymore. She ran over and started filling her mouth with candy. Luckily, there wasn't any other customers in the building right now. The jellybeans were the first to go. She went through them like they were going out of style. She was basically Godzilla to this city of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went for gummy bears next. She ate every last one of them. Both you and the owner giggled while watching her. You saw her belly was getting very round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, maybe you should stop before you get sick.\" You said, however, Hermione ignored you. She didn't stop until everything was gone. You didn't know it, but she put a spell on her so that she could eat a lot without getting sick, despite not knowing she was going to be the 1,000 visitor. Hermione's belly was really big now, her clothes couldn't hide her bellybutton. The owner smiled and walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're finally done. Your belly is amazing. Though you are the 1,000 visitor, that's not why I let you eat all of that. I did it so I could see a large belly, they're my fetish. Yours though, it's bigger than any I have ever seen.\" The woman said. She climbed on Hermione's belly and started to rub it. Hermione didn't mind, she was happy she got to eat all of it. \"With a belly like yours, you could eat a person.<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">In fact . . </font>\" She looked over at you. You were still watching, unsure if this was real. The woman grinned and told you to follow her. You nodded, unsure of what she was planning. You walked over to Hermione first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back, just rest for now.\" You told her, she nodded and smiled. You gave her one final kiss before following the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took you to a back room. Before you could ask why she brought you here, so wing suddenly hit you, making you pass out. When you wake up, you feel weird. You can see a mirror. You look in it to see you were covered in sweetness. From head to toe, there was sugar. As for your outfit, you were only in your underwear. Your mouth was covered and your arms and legs were tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you look tasty. You're perfect for her.\" The owner said, stepping into view. You struggled, causing her to laugh. \"Don't try to escape, it's useless. I want to see her belly get bigger, so you'll have to do. Even if she recognizes you, I made sure you were irresistible. A human jellybean.\" She said. She grabbed you and brought you out to the main room where your friend was. When you saw her, you were very surprised. Even though her belly had not gotten smaller, she managed to stand up. Hermione was surprised to see you. \"My faithful customer. I have brought you another piece of candy. Remember, it's free, so enjoy.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione slowly got over to you. She grabbed you and pulled you up over her belly to her face. You closed your eyes, worried of what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Don't worry, do you really think I would harm you?</font>\" She whispered. You opened your eyes to see her sweet smile. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I have magic, remember? If I eat you, I can just teleport you out. I don't want to scare you though, so I may only taste you.</font>\" She thinks for a minute. You trusted her no matter what decision she made.</span></div></div>",

You put in all of the ingredients, including one special ingredient: broken bits of Oreo. You put it in the oven and waited for it to be done. You couldn't wait for her to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited, you got out a piece of paper and folded it. With your artistic ability, you made the front really beautiful. On the inside, on the right side, you drew a Beagle dog. You made sure that it was detailed. By the time you got done with the drawing, the cake was ready to be pulled out. You turned the oven off and set it on the table. You then frosted it and put the toppings on. You wrote in frosting on the top \"Thanks for being my friend\". You hoped she would love it. You went back to the card while it cooled down. You wrote a special message inside:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Hermione,<br>\r\n           Thank you for being there when I needed you. You are such a great friend and I was lucky to meet you. You're really beautiful and I want to return your kindness. I'm not sure how long you will be here, but while you are here, I want to treat you like a princess. Just ask for anything and I will listen and serve you. I'll be happy to do anything for you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it may have sounded like you were exaggerating, you really weren't. You really did want to make her happy for helping you. You quietly went up to the bedroom she was in and set the cake down on the table. You set the card and utensils down next to it and left her quietly. You went downstairs and looked outside. You didn't know when your parents would be home from their vacation, but they probably wouldn't approve of you serving Hermione like how you have. For instance, your mother would probably be a little upset that you were her pet at one point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't care, as long as Hermione was happy. You also knew that Hermione might have to erase your memory because of what you have seen. That didn't matter to you though, if that was what she was most comfortable with, you would go along with it willing. You eventually got tired from watching outside, and fell asleep. When you woke up . . .</span></div></div>",

Thank you so very much!\" She gushed as she granted you a hug and being that you couldn't move all you felt was nothing but her brown bushy hair in your face and avoided choking when you almost swallowed a bunch of it Hermione looked ashamed and sheepish<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry about that! Anyway here let me undo the curse.....\" And she took out her wand and muttered another inaudible word and you felt yourself able to move freely again and stood up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so now what did you want to do?\" She thought for a second then grinned mischievously although she knew what she was about to ask wasn't right in the slightest she couldn't help but try and take advantage over this really cute American Muggle boy besides people like Harry or Ron merely thought of her as a bossy-know-it-all and had no idea just how feisty or daring Hermione Granger could really be <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm well there is something I always wanted to try out with my own friends at my school but never got the chance to actually do it!\" She blurted out beckoning you closer to her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay what is it?\" You curiously asked to which Hermione took out her wand......</span></div></div>",

In the mirror, you saw a pair of red shoes. You weren't sure what to say. Hermione then wore you. When you were out on, it didn't hurt. It didn't smell bad, and it felt comfortable. \"I hope you don't mind, but I want to go on a walk with you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I don't mind at all, in fact you could keep me like this forever. It's really comfortable!\" You say a little excited. She giggles and starts walking. It felt nicer than one would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't keep you like this forever, but I'm glad you're enjoying this. Just please keep quiet so people don't notice, oh and don't look up.\" She said. You already knew the reason why, and you decided to listen to her instructions. Your walk was really nice. Some people complimented Hermione's shoes, making you feel special. One woman even offered to buy you from her. Hermione declined. Though you didn't know it, it wasn't because you could talk or because you were human. She had another reason for keeping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione walked through a forest. Though you were getting a little dirty, you didn't mind. If anything, you were falling asleep, her feet were that comfortable to you. You knew no one else was around you you told her you were sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and take a nap, I'll wake you when we get back. Don't be surprised if you wake up as a necklace or something.\" She said, and giggled. You eventually couldn't stay awake anymore. Hermione thought about some topics as she walked. She knew that she would be required to erase your memories before she went home. However, with everything that had happened, she wasn't sure she could do it anymore. You had been so nice to her, and you made her feel at home. Heck, you rarely complained about her actions, for instance she knew you liked being her shoes. Theoretically speaking, she didn't have to tell anyone about this, there might have been a chance that you could keep your memories. She decided to worry about it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got back to the house and set you on the table. With a few magic words, she turned you into a human again, but the size of a toy. She picked you up and set you in her lap to sleep. Though you were older, she felt like your guardian. After an hour, you woke up to see . . . </span></div></div>",

You're causing more destruction......\" She gasped silently and covered her mouth \"oh sorry!\" She whispered in the smallest breath she could take \"What should I do?\" you asked she thought for a minute and for the first time in her life didn't have a answer \"Honestly I have no idea but please for now hold onto my wand guard it with your life until we can figure out a solution to this or else the spell wears off and I return to normal....oh and one more thing do not...I repeat do not attempt to use it terrible things happen to nonmagical  people who try to use a wizard or witch's wand or so I read in History Of Magic......\" She sounded really serious when she said this you nodded firmly and informed her that you would try and go for help but what exactly would you tell a policeman or somebody else that a fictional character with magical powers had just grown to massive size and was sitting out on your front lawn you had no idea \"I'll make up something...\"You thought as you rushed off down the street to where a few more of your neighbors lived as for Hermione she was beyond frantic \"OH NO THIS IS SO COMPLETELY CRAZY!

You had an idea for her, but it would cause a little bit more destruction. When you got to her, she was standing as tall as ever. You could see the helicopters around her. You needed to get up to her ear, luckily, there was a building next to her that wasn't destroyed. You rode the elevator up to the top. When you stepped outside, her ear was close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, I didn't mean to hurt anyone!\" Hermione said, getting frustrated. You yelled out her name. She turned and saw you. Her eyes widened, she couldn't believe that you were there next to her. She held out her hand, and you got on. When the helicopters questioned, you lied and said you were part of a secret military service, and that they needed to leave now so you could fix this mess. Without questioning, they flew away. They didn't leave completely, but they were far enough that you felt safe talking to Hermione. \"Thank you. I'm sorry for everything.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, but you asked me to give you your wand. However, I have a better idea.\" You pointed to a large light post and told her to pick it up. Hesitant at first, she picked it up with her other hand. You asked if that would work as a wand. She concentrated for a minute and confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will work for now. But where are we going to go?\" She asked.

It was pretty dark and you still hadn't returned. Hermione couldn't stand it anymore, she was really hungry. She decided that if you couldn't return, she might as well go off and find some food for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up, and carefully walked towards the city. It was a good thing she waited so long, there was hardly anyone in the streets. She kneeled down and looked in a couple of houses to see sleeping people. She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Since Everyone is asleep, I'm sure they won't mind if I 'borrow' some food.\" She whispered. She quietly lifted up some roofs and started taking food. She took so much food, including entire fridges. At a couple of houses, some dogs started to bark at her. Although a little embarrassed, she was too hungry to stop. She ate everything she collected. Since it didn't fill up her belly, she kept searching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you finally got back to where your house used to be. It took you forever to find someone willing to give you a phone to use. You had made a couple of calls to your friends who said they would try to help if they could. When you got to your house, you noticed Hermione wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" was all you could say. You started running towards the city, hoping to catch up. You assumed it wouldn't be hard to find her, after all, she was the size of the building, you should be able to see her easily. However, that also meant others should be able to see her easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs predicted, the mayor had been taking a midnight walk and saw Hermione. He called the military and asked for help with the giantess. He explained everyone was asleep and pleaded that they take care of her quickly and quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was laying on her side starting to chew on a tree. Though it wasn't human food, she had wondered if it would taste like a veggie to her, probably like a piece of broccoli. She didn't like the taste at all, she learned that her magic hadn't changed her taste buds much. She started to eat the human food she had collected, when soldiers arrived. Most of them were surprised that she was a young girl, just huge. The commander was out sick, so a regular soldier had been put in charge. Though he was a little frightened of her size, he was sure he could stop a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Miss! We demand that you leave this place or else!\" He commanded. Hermione dropped some bottles of soda into her mouth. She swallowed and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but am I doing something wrong? I'm not hurting anyone, am I?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, but-\" Suddenly, Hermione burped pretty loud. It shattered some windows, and caused a few people to wake up. Most people thought it was just a thunderstorm, despite the fact that there was broken glass now. Hermione burped again, making her embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry! I couldn't help it.\" Suddenly, Hermione burped louder. This one traveled and hit neighboring cities, scaring a lot of people. She started getting so embarrassed, she started losing control of her magic again. The tanks that the army brought started floating in the air. Hermione and the others could hear the drivers yelling. Hermione tried focusing and getting control. When she concentrated, a few of the tanks floating fell back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough! We demand that you leave monster!\" Hermione frowned. Not because she was causing trouble, but because she had just been called a monster. She roughly grabbed him and brought him to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I'm a monster for making some mistakes, huh? So when a baby or a student makes a mistake, do you call them a monster?\" She said. The soldier wasn't sure what to do. However, despite the fact that Hermione was annoyed, she put him down softly. Just when she thought the men would just leave her alone, they aimed their guns at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier was about to give the signal, when you came out of nowhere and jumped on him. All of the soldiers stepped back, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hurt her! Despite her size she's just a dumb child! She didn't mean harm!\" You started yelling. Hermione was about to complain, but then kept her mouth closed for the time being. You got off the soldier, who looked pissed off, and apologized for the rough entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's my . . . Daughter. I have been working on a machine to make food bigger to end world hunger, but then I accidentally hit her, she's my responsibility.\" You lied. You really hoped they would back off.</span></div></div>",

However, though you didn't know it, as soon as you showed up, Hermione had been concentrating. After a moment of looking at her, Hermione shrunk down to her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew you still had her wand and asked for it back. When you gave it to her, the leader soldier stepped closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for stopping her.

You weren't sure what to do, but Hermione was already prepared for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can show you, but it's not very big, can all of you come closer?\" Hermione asked. Without thinking, they all stepped up to the two of you. \"Obliviate!\" she said, waving her wand. From your perspective, it looked like they all suddenly became dizzy. However, once the leader got his balance back, he looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where are we? What were we doing?\" He asked. Hermione told him they had been sent to make sure everything was alright because someone reported an alien sighting. She also told them they did a fantastic job, and that they should go back now. They nodded and left. You couldn't believe that worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely done Hermione. I think everything will be alright now.\" You said, however, she wasn't very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking? Calling me a dumb girl!? I could beat you in every written test given! Also, how dare you call me your daughter! Do you think I would have a parent like you? It would have been best just to call me your friend!\" She stomped her foot. You were embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was just trying to help, and I didn't know what to say. I'm sorry.\" You started to back up, when she grabbed you and pulled you in. Without warning, she hugged you and kissed you on the lips. Now you were really confused. \"Wait, aren't you mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not happy that you called me your daughter or that you said I was dumb. However, I am happy that you did stop them. They were pretty scary.\" She kissed you again. You weren't sure what to say. She let go of you and smiled. \"So hero, where shall we go? After all, I sort of destroyed your home by accident.\" She asked. You thought for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know of a winter home. Since it's Spring, no one should be there. It'll be perfect for now.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So . . . We'll be alone . . . Together?\" She asked in a strange way. You nodded. You rode the bus to the building. When you got there, she saw that it was pretty big. You got the key from under the mat and allowed her inside. You showed her where everything was, including the bedroom she was going to use. You was happy and got comfortable in bed. You went to make dinner for the two of you. Though there wasn't much food now, there was enough to get you through the night. You would be able to buy more tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finished, you were called by Hermione. You went to check on her to see she seemed to be struggling with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get my shoe off, can you help me?\" You were a little confused, you thought she would be able to do it. Despite this, you helped her. Unfortunately it was a trap! When you went for her foot, she pulled you in again. She rubbed your head. \"Mm, you smell nice. Can you believe it though? We get to be alone for a while.\" She said. You had a feeling you knew where this was going. You told her that dinner was ready. You gave her a ride to the kitchen, she was having fun. The two of you sat down and started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but notice, Hermione kept looking at you. When she thought you couldn't see her, she looked at you and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This food is really good! It tastes pretty sweet, but you know, this isn't the only thing that's sweet.\" You weren't sure what she meant, until she winked at you.

She carefully grabs you and sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't mean to do this, but this works out great! Now you have to speak, if you don't, I can't guarantee that you'll be safe.\" She said, ready to twist your arm. \"Tell me, how do you know who I am?\" You knew she had complete control over the situation. You decided to tell her the truth. You pointed over to your desk. On it was a Harry Potter book. Still holding onto you, she walked over and opened the book. She skimmed through it. You tried to explain the real truth, afraid that she would think you're lying. You were surprised when she didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to hurt me? You must think I'm lying.\" You said. She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can see you're telling the truth. The evidence is here in this book, but that still doesn't explain how I got here.\" You tried to tell her about the portal. After a minute of thinking, Hermione had an idea. \"I think I know what this 'portal' was. What I learned in class was a mysterious portal opens in different places in the world. It's rare and said to be caused by a deity. Besides that, not much is known about it, and few have witnessed it, or returned from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did it grab you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe it was like a sacrifice. After all, in stories, some gods need offerings, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they chose a beautiful lady like you?\" You said, causing Hermione to blush. \"Well now that we have that figured out, how about you change me back.\" She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also need an offering. You can offer me your service.\" You started to struggle. \"Look, you can either be willing and be treated like a pet and be rewarded, or be unwilling and be treated like a slave and get punishments. What will it be?\" She made a valid argument. You stopped struggling, making her happy. \"Good, don't worry, we can learn to be friends. But for now, my butt needs to be rubbed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off her robe revealing her underwear layer. Hermione laid down on the couch and chucked you behind her. You landed on your butt. You were a little confused, you couldn't believe she was asking you to get this close this fast. You eagerly started to rub and lick her. She could feel you and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you you would have fun!\" You continue to work hard until . . .</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes, you managed to get onto her belly. She told you to hop inside her bellybutton. As soon as you followed instructions, Hermione used her magic to seal you inside. The opening of her bellybutton closed up, making the only doorway disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want out, you'll have to work for it. Tickle me as much as you can, if you don't, you are probably going to be in there for a very long time.\" Hermione told you. You decided to get to work. You start rubbing the ground, trying to make her laugh. After a minute, Hermione started to get impatient. \"Is that the best you got? Try harder? Or is it that you want to live in by bellybutton forever? I can keep you there for all eternity, is that what you want?\" You didn't see that as a bad idea. Still, you wanted to please her, so you went to the walls and tickled as hard as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried using both your hands and your feet. Hermione started to laugh. She couldn't contain it and laughed as loud as she could. Some people outside looked in, a little confused. To tickle her even more, you started to lick her. To her, you were now a tickling machine. However, Hermione was starting to lose control of more than just her laugh. Objects on shells started to fall off. In the kitchen, the cupboards flung open. Hermione didn't realize her magic was doing this. She just kept laughing as if nothing ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tickling her for a while, you started to get tired. You fell down, unable to really tickle her. Her laugh soon came to a stop, but she didn't care. She had lots of fun. As her bellybutton opened, she suddenly noticed the destruction that she caused. Her face turned red, and was worried about what you would say if you saw it. She grabbed you, rolled over and made it so you couldn't see your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how would you like to take a nap?\" She asked. You shook your head and struggled to get free. Without warning, you became loose and fell to the floor. You looked around to see the house was a mess. \"PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME,\" she pleaded. She started to cry, she didn't mean for this to happen. You climbed up and told her it was alright. The place always gets this messy somehow. She wipe the tears away and lifted you up. \"Really? You . . Forgive me?\" She asked. You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I think you can do something to make it up.\" You said. She was all ears. You told her . . .</span></div></div>",

Just asking....\" Ginny shrugged \"Basically anywhere will do but if you must know my top ticklish spots are my feet,thighs,my belly,belly button and the lower part of my neck which part do you want to start with first_.?\" You think her feet were too oblivious,her thighs you weren't interested in the lower part of her neck was also out of the question that left her belly and round belly button which you really desired to stick your finger into \"Okay I'll try your belly button Ginny umm you might need to remove your sweater though it will be kind of hard to tickle your stomach with it covering it.\" Ginny nods and quickly casts a spell(as she once more figures there's no shame in doing magic in front of a Muggle when you were a fiction character from a book,she could always erase his memories of the Wizarding World and herself later)with a pop her multicolored sweater is removed revealing her in a small black bra you see her smooth sexy stomach and a bit further her cute inner belly button you desired to get started right away as it was almost inviting you to stick your finger in it \"Okay here I go I promise not to tickle you too hard and automatically stop when you say it!\" You inform her \"Okay just get started already!\" She urged you as you stick a finger into her navel and wriggle it around at once Ginny let's out a small giggle \"Ha,ha,ha come on is that the best you can do? Tickle me harder I won't bite!\" You do and she finally begins giggling out loud but you notice something else the more Ginny squirms and laughs,the more magic is flowing around her and things in your house is starting to break or fly around the room strange she doesn't even have her wand out,the experience alone must be driving her magic powers berserk! Then you notice something else,something alarming.....</span></div></div>",

I do hope this doesn't ruin our newfound friendship.\" You nod and reply \"Not at all Ginny I don't blame you for this but we have to find a way to shrink you back to normal.

They would probably freak out as theses poor tiny Muggles are doing...\" As she stared down at the hundreds of frightened faces below her feet \"Ummm I'm very sorry Mu...I mean tiny American people I'm not what you think....\" But none of the people paid any attention instead they did what crowds comforted by a giant monster did:screamed and panicked \"Ahhhhh run a giant monster from space!\" Ginny fumed as she heard this \"Monster from space? How dare they think of me as...as....wait was that 'term' Muggles use when describling creatures from the stars and beyond? Oh yeah aliens or something I think....\" Finally she cried over the screams of panic and fear \"Okay,okay you're right tiny Mugg....I mean American people I'm a giant alien from the stars but I'm not evil I'm friendly and I'm not here to hurt any of you....\" But again they either seemily ignored her words or were far too terrified of her massive size to care or hear what they really meant as she did towered over everything in sight growing frustrated Ginny fumed \"American Muggles are even stranger than British ones! Well I'm not going to bother setting them straight on my true intentions what if they uncover my true identity...\" Then ignoring the screams she stepped over the rubble that used to be your house and bent down to your level where you the only one not afraid of her stood \"Listen_. I'm going to try and head back to London to see if my mum and dad can possibly return me back to normal.\" You were highly confused at this but she carefully explained it to you \"Look at this massive size I can't use my wand it didn't grow with me remember? And I can't control my magic without my wand so I'm going to head back to London all the way overseas don't worry I can cut across back alley ways and across countries to prevent anymore Mugg...I mean American people from spotting me...\" You interrupted her \"Yeah I get that but wait don't you need your wand to you know....\" But she shook her head smiling at you \"No remember I wouldn't have any use for it at this size remember silly? Anyway you can keep it though you won't be able to use it for anything due to you don't have any magic in you at all I'll just tell mum and dad I broke it or lost it and they'll get me a new one from Ollivander's in Diagon Alley hopefully when this is all over I....I can at least come visit you occasionally from time to time as to tell the truth I have grown quite fond of you  until then good bye....\" And with that she began walking slowly towards the outskirts of the neighborhood occasionally she would accidentally step on a car,mailbox or something look down and apologize at the screaming person or people below \"Oops sorry about that!\" Unfortunately in order to cross over to the rest of the country she had to get through the city(your city to be exact) and once there the crowds heard the loud BOOMING sounds of her footsteps and screamed and ran for it Ginny didn't bother apologizing when she stepped on a few cars and stuff \"I just want to be out of this nightmare and back into the magical world although I must say the Muggle World is pretty fascinating or at least the Amercian version is anyway....\" As she slowly continued onwards until a major rumbling of her stomach forced her to look down at her groaning stomach and she stopped \"Uh oh it's been a while since I ate anything I'm terribly hungry I wonder what Amercian Muggles eat for food....\" As she stared down at the numberous fast food joints,restaurants and grocery stores that narrowed along one part of the city and....</span></div></div>",

It lasted two seconds, but its loudness drowned out the show on TV. You flinch as the scent of Big Macs, French Fries, and Diet Coke ejected from her gob and into your nostrils, at which the 8-year old giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d Charlie apologized sarcastically. \u201cSorry Willy, I just couldn't resist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to fan away the smelly smog. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m surprised that you could do that, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls can burp too, you know,\u201d Charlie smirked and folded her arms. \u201cBut I doubt many of them can do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Charlene began to swallow air. She took exaggerated gasps to fill her belly with as much oxygen as possible. After several seconds, she stop inhaling and concaved her stomach, forcing out an expectedly epic eructation. However, Charlie added a twist to make it even more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201c<span class=\"cred\"><i><b>*BBBUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!*</b></i></span>\u201d{/ size} A plume of orange flame roared out of her mouth like a small dragon. Thankfully, though only a foot away, you are not met with a burning burp to the face, but you can still feel the heat of it. This belch possessed the same loudness, length, and smell, though now the aroma of incinerated oxygen filled the air around you two as well. Even Charlie pinched her nose along with you, but her satisfied grin implied that she was still enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw, that stunk.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that I did that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d You deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie put her hands on her hips. \u201cI think I can top it, though, but I\u2019ll need some help first.\u201d Seeking fuel for her fire, she walked over to a table and grabbed an untouched cup of Pepsi. The pyrokinetic slurped the cold bubbly liquid through the straw, laughing as it splashed on her tongue and tickled her taste buds. Eventually, Charlie drained the plastic cup of its content and rubbed her even fuller tummy, which pressed out against her dark blue leotard. She walked out to the back porch of your house and motioned for you to follow her. You complied readily, wishing to avoid setting the house\u2019s interior afire. Once you were both outside, her face contorted into an expression of concentration as she proceeded to repeat the process of swallowing precious oxygen to aid in stoking the literal/proverbial fire in her belly. A minute passed and Charlie smiled, indicating that it was time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl relaxed her throat, straightened her back, caved in her abdomen, cranked her head upward, and forced out her third blazing belch for the evening. <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201c<span class=\"cred\"><i><b>*HHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPP!*</b></i></span>\u201d</font> For seven suspenseful seconds, Charlie\u2019s charring burp exited her mouth as a crimson stream of plasma, similar to Godzilla\u2019s atomic breath. The inferno shot into the air, illuminating part of the ebony night sky. Her burp\u2019s loudness forced you to cover your ears and the odor was somehow even fouler than her previous eruptions. Despite this, you look on with widened eyes at the mesmerizing sight of her fiery blast. When the eructation ended, Charlie took a few seconds to catch her breath. \u201cPhew! Even I was sure that I could do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026\u201d You said with a slacked jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie took notice of this and giggled. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m glad that you liked it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Aw, look at her. She\u2019s acting so happy just because she can burp like a cow,\u2019</i> You thought. <i>\u2018I suppose some immature behavior is understandable, given everything that she went through.\u2019</i> You soon regained your composure and spoke to her appropriately. \u201cYou seem to have a lid on your powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you want to do, now?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie pondered her next choice and made her decision.</font></span></span></div></div>",

She got tired of waiting, and couldn't stand being hungry anymore. She looked around until she finally saw a store. She took a couple steps forward before accidentally stepping on a car. She lifted her foot up and looked at the remains. She bent over and looked carefully. She didn't see any signs of human life, which was good. When she got up, she suddenly heard someone yelling. She saw an angry woman yelling at her about the car. Charlie blushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I'm sorry. Please, I didn't mean to.\" She said, and quickly continued towards the store. When she got there, Charlie accidentally stepped on a few more cars. She then took the roof off, surprising a lot of people. Her hungry hands quickly shot towards the food. She grabbed everything she could and tossed it in her mouth. She completely ignored the manager, she was too hungry to care.

I'm sorry I left, I just really wanted something to devour.\" She said. You told her you had food in your truck. Charlie nodded and bended over to pick it up. When she did, her butt accidentally broke some windows of a tall building. A lot of people screamed at the sight of how close it was to them. Though she didn't notice, you face palmed. She rose back up and devoured the entire truck. You yelled at her to stop, but she didn't hear you.

Charlie kept stomping through until she saw a beautiful sight: a farmer's market. Everyone screamed and ran away. It didn't matter to her, it just meant she would get more food. She started grabbing everything and threw it in her mouth. You jumped off and ran in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie stop!\" You yelled. You didn't want her to eat everything in the city, that would make people mad. You stopped next to some carrots and waved at her. You got excited when she turned towards you. At first, you thought she heard you, but then noticed that her face said otherwise. Her giant hand grabbed you and the carrots. You got terrified, she was about to chew you up without realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You watched her other hand drop tomatoes in her mouth. She grinded them up and swallowed. You were next. She raised you above her mouth and opened wide. Though you yelled, she was oblivious of your presence. She let go, making you and the carrots fall towards her mouth. You got a great look at where you were headed. You closed your eyes, fearing the worst. Thankfully, luck was on your side this time. You hit her lip and fell down her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You quickly grabbed her shirt to stop the fall. After a moment of calming down, you looked around to see where you landed. You were right at her exposed belly button, hanging on to the edge of the shirt where you had cut previously. You could feel the vibrations of her chewing up her food. Charlie's stomach was also growling from all of the food it was getting. You shuddered to think about how close you were to being on the other side, whether in pieces or whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie kept searching for food after she cleared the farmers market. You shook with every step she took. You looked down to see her giant feet moving and leaving bus sized craters. You could try to climb down when she stopped, but you really didn't want to get that close to her mouth again without her knowing. You could try going up, but it may be harder. After a few minutes, you decide to risk going up. You took a deep breath and started to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were doing this, Charlie sat down to take a breather. Eating all of that food had made her tired. She went to rub her satisfied stomach, when she accidentally put her hand on you. Charlie jerked her hand back immediately, and looked down. When she saw you, she was both happy and a little upset. She grabbed you and brought you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask why you're trying to climb my body without telling me?\" She said. You explained how she almost ate you and that you were trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't trying to invade your personal space. Honestly!\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, but you better make it up to me\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see how you taste. You will also clean my rub my feet. As soon as those two things happen, then I'll forgive you for being so close to my breasts.\" You nodded. You knew she had no intention of harming you, so you trusted her. \"Hold still, or I may accidentally eat you like before.\" She then opened her mouth. Her tongue came out and massaged you. Though it felt weird, it felt a little nice. Her tongue covered you in saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she took her shoes off and dropped you down at them. \"Just try your best.\" Charlie didn't care if she could feel you or not, she just wanted you to show that you were sorry. You started to rub her feet. It wasn't as bad as you thought it would be. Yes her feet didn't smell good, but they were soft. After a couple of hours of rubbing her feet, she finally forgave you. However, you were covered in sweat from her foot. The two of you started giggling when . . .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Charlie gave a big yawn. Today had been a long day so you told her to get some sleep. Charlie nodded and stretched her arms. Charlie laid her back down on the soft grass. As soon as the sun disappeared, she fell fast asleep. You found a cozy spot yourself and also went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That night, you had a nightmare. Charlie held onto you like a banana and licked her lips. You begged her to let you go, however she simply rubbed her belly. You couldn't tell if it was because she couldn't hear you or didn't care. Charlie shoved you in her mouth. The light was quickly fading. Before you could yell, she chomped your legs off. Charlie swallowed, causing you to end up in her stomach, but one problem. It wasn't her stomach. You landed on some sort of conveyor belt in some sort of realm. You looked ahead to see a crusher. As the conveyor belt moved, metal was crushed into pancake sized, and soon you would be next. You also saw Charlie with an evil grin. You screamed, wishing you could move. The crusher was now over you. It came down, ready to claim it's victim when . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up. The sun was starting to come up. You looked over at Charlie to see she was still calmly asleep. You took a deep breath, there wasn't anything to worry about. She was your friend, she wouldn't harm you on purpose. You climbed on her belly. It was scary to think how close you were to being inside it. You crawled up to her innocent face. You sat there, just watching her. You thought everything was fine, until Charlie started to make a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah . . Ah . . \" she said. You were confused a little. \"ACHOO,\" Charlie sneezed, causing you to fly back. You fell into her shirt and rolled down her chest. You tried to stop yourself, but you were just moving too fast. As you rolled, you wondered where you were about to end up. When you finally stop, there isn't much room to move. Your body was on something soft. As you felt it, trying to identify it, you heard Charlie moan. After thinking for a second, your face suddenly gets bright red. With her moaning, there was only one place you could possibly be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it, you were next to her vagina. Considering how she felt after she found you on her belly, you didn't want to know how she would react if she found you. Despite this, you struggled and screamed, trying to get her attention. Being shamed was better than being crushed in a lady's private spot. The good news was that Charlie woke up. The bad news was that she had no idea you were there. The worst news was you were only tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie put her hands down between her legs. She started to laugh and squirm. Charlie knew it was coming from her most secret spot, but she didn't know what was going on. Some of the buildings collapsed from her laughing. She was so busy having fun, she didn't realize the military came. However, they couldn't hit her because they couldn't stay still long enough. Tanks were moving slowly. A lot of the guns were fen crushed under the wheels. However, the worst was yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were basically fueling her power. Charlie begged to stop, despite the fact she didn't know who she was talking to, making her lose more control over herself. Fire started to light up around the giantess. When the general saw this, he immediately ordered all troops to fall back. Just as the last one ran away, the fire caused the tanks to explode. There was fire everywhere, and Charlie didn't even know it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually gave up and waited. When you did this, Charlie was able to reach down and grab you. She pulled you out and looked at you. Suddenly, fear consumed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! What Why were you there!\" She said, turning red. Believe it or not, you were the one who burst into tears first. You told her about your nightmare and that you just wanted to get closer to her for safety when you flew back down there. You didn't mean to invade her personal space, but no matter what, things kept ending up that way. Charlie looked around to see all of the fire she started. Despite being afraid of her power, she decided to try and fix things instead of hating herself for what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She calmly set you down and told you she would be back. Charlie walked over to the lake and filled her mouth with water. She got up and sprayed it over all of the fire, putting it all out. Once that was done, all that remained was you. She walked back over to you and picked you up. You were terrified that she didn't want to be your friend anymore. However, Charlie brought you closer to her and hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I scared you. Please don't cry, I forgive you. It was an accident. Besides, you have helped me also.\" You looked up, a little confused. \"Look around. I was able to fix my mistakes, . . . In a way. I'm not as afraid of my powers as I used to be.\" She said, trying to calm you down. \"Tell you what . . .</span></div></div>",

What do I have to do though?\" As she acted like she never played this type of game before Charlie gleefully explained <br>\r\n\"Okay first you must remove all your clothes....\" As expected Frisk's eyes widened <br>\r\n\"What?\" She nearly jumped up in shock <br>\r\n\"It's perfectly okay Frisk we're just playing a game.\" Charlie explained \"Go head and take off your clothes otherwise Willy won't be able to climb you successfully you see he has to climb your actual body,having your clothes still on kind of ruins the game.\" Frisk still looked highly confused and upset but once again you reassured it this was merely a game so she does as she's asked and one by one removes all her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's finished looking completely embarrassed buck naked Frisk once more lied down on the floor while you took a deep breath and started at the young giantess' feet right at the soft part of her toes Frisk tries to put a hand over her mouth but Charlie warns her <br>\r\n\"Sorry Frisk but you can't move any part of your body,hands included you have to stay perfectly still!\" Frisk nodded <br>\r\n\"Okay but I wish he would hurry up and get over my feet already his tiny movements tickle!\" As she was struggling to hold herself together the tickling feeling as you crawling over her feet like a fly was nerve wracking finally Frisk couldn't hold it and squealed with suppressed giggles \"Ahahahahaha it tickles! Make him stop!\" <br>\r\n\"No you have yo stay still Frisk!\" Charlie protested despite the giantess wriggling her feet like mad you still managed to stay on tightly wrapped around her big toe then once you made it over her feet you started on her enormous thighs luckily for her this didn't tickle as much then he slowly started crawling up towards her lower bottom of her body and this really made Frisk sweat like mad \"What? Is he.....oh no....he's not going in there....\" <br>\r\n\"Don't be silly Frisk! Willy wouldn't dare do a thing like that would you?\" But you were too busy trying to avoid getting sucked up in that particular hole of the girl's to hear a word Charlie was saying finally with a deep sigh from both you and Frisk<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness he didn't fall or crawl in there.\" She muttered to herself you were on your way towards the upper part of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you came to the traditional fork in the road:Frisk's massive belly button,the size of a pot hole in the street you had two choices <br>\r\n\"Either I can go around it and spare her the agony of being tickled to death or I can just....oh what the heck I'm going with the second option!\" As Frisk's eyes grow wide she knows what you're about to do and cities out <br>\r\n\"What? No,no please don't crawl into my belly button! I'm far too ticklish there! Don't....\" But too late you crawl deep inside her innie navel and begin falling until you reach the bottom Frisk is already squirming around,beads of sweat pouring down her face while Charlie looks on interestedly and she's not even being tickled yet once you hit rock bottom you begin to run alongside the soft,squashy flesh that was the caverns of Frisk's navel but unfortunately this did nothing to make her even chuckle <br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness he's not doing it yet.....I'm so nervous if he starts tickling me I'm afraid I'll wet myself....\" Frisk whispered to herself as she can barely feel you walking around she only hopes you get bored and come out continuing on your way towards her face but no such luck as after thinking about it you finally come up with a way to give her the ultimate humiliation and began rubbing your stuffed pocket pens on the cavern walls of Frisk's navel as expected she starts giggling <br>\r\n\"Ahahahahaha nooooooooooo stooooooppppp! Charrrllliie Mahahahahakke himmmmmhahaha stoooopppppp!\" But the Firestarter does nothing as you slowly continue to tickle her navel running the pens up and down the smooth walls Frisk is literally rolling around on the floor while Charlie watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk is laughing so hard she's practically crying thin tears in agony \"Hahahahaha pleassssseeeee Willllyyy Stoooopppp iitttttttt!\" She begged inside her navel you have a unlimited amount of energy as you're not tired at all you keep at it tickling her stomach walls while trying to maintain your balance as it feels like you're on a wild roller coaster everything's moving around like crazy while her wild laughter is echoing all around you once more Frisk close to passing out begs Charlie for aid but she does nothing but watch after a while she gets a wild idea in her own head and slowly approaches Frisk from the back and begins pins her down the girl is equally confused <br>\r\n\"What are you doing.....\" She screams Charlie beams <br>\r\n\"Just helping out a friend....\" And to Frisk's ultimate horror she sticks a finger in the girl's already tortured navel and begins stroking it even more Frisk screams and buckles trying to throw her off <br>\r\n\"Nooooooo Charrrllllieeeee stoooppppp! Thaaatttt Tickles! Hellllppp!\" She begged at the top of her lungs although she understood it was just a harmless game that didn't stop the sheer panic in her voice finally after a while of nothing but intense tickling and Frisk laughing her head off.....</span></div></div>",

As soon as you got there, you had to lead them through a dark cave. Frisk was a little worried, but Charlie wasn't scared at all. Soon, you got to where you were referring to. It was a pool of water, with a sandy beach. Walls were on every side, making it impossible to see outside of this area. There wasn't a roof either, so beautiful sunlight shined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls took everything off and stepped into the water. You took everything off except your swim trunks and went in as well. The girls had fun splashing each other. You had brought three water guns for all of you to play with. The girls teamed up and sprayed you. All of you were happy and having fun. Suddenly, Charlie noticed something shiny in the water. She picked it up and felt it. It was smooth and made Charlie feel weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look at this object .\" She said. You got closer and took a look. You remembered seeing an object like this when you were a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that is called a mermaid scale. They're very rare, but powerful.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Frisk asked, getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I remember, Mermaid scales can grant two wishes if one is found. The wishes are rule free, and only the person who grabbed it can make the wishes. Once they do, someone else can make two wishes.\" The girls got excited at hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then how about this, I'll make my two wishes, then Frisk can make her wishes, then you can.\" Charlie said. You shook your head however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't. I already made two wishes years ago. In fact, it was so long ago, I completely forgot about the scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you wish for?\" Frisk asked. You told them what you wished for all of those years ago, then looked at Charlie. She was thinking deeply. After a minute, she held the scale close to her and mumbled her first wish.

She felt Charlie's squishy and wet tongue. Frisk laid down on her tongue, leaving her legs sticking out. Charlie shut her mouth and lifted up. She tasted and licked Frisk. She was tasty.

Charlie held the mermaid scale close and made her final wish. Instead of wishing for her and Frisk to switch sizes, she wished that the three of you had the ability to change your sizes whenever you wanted. That way, they didn't have to waste a wish to get everyone back to normal. Once Charlie made her wish, the scale stopped glowing. Now Frisk could make two wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she did though, Charlie used her new power to shrink herself to your height. She then asked Frisk to grow to her normal size. Frisk had a feeling she knew what the two of you were up to, so she listened. She then raised you high into the air as she laid down. You and Charlie had a pretty good view of her. Frisk let go, making the two of you fall onto her stomach. The height of the fall made the two of you bounce really high. You started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Frisk sat up a little and blew you and Charlie. The two of you were sent straight to her bellybutton. It was smaller and squishier than Charlie's. The place also gave you a feeling of wanting to stay. You weren't sure how to explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get to work.\" You say, Charlie nods. The two of you start to tickle. Frisk almost immediately starts to laugh. All of Frisk's laughing starts to make you giggle a little. Frisk laughs so much, Charlie falls down. Suddenly, Charlie tells you to keep tickling and that she'll be back. Charlie struggles to climb out, then disappears from your line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply kept tickling, struggling to stay standing. Since Charlie gave you the power to change your size, you could make this into a business, going to people's houses, shrinking and tickling their most sensitive spot. You were lost in thought until Frisk pulled you out with her massive fingers. When you were pulled up to her face, you looked around to see that Charlie was missing. You asked Frisk where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but all of that tickling made me hungry, and I need something tasty. Don't worry, you'll see Charlie soon.\" You started to question her but you were then shoved in her mouth. Her tongue tossed you around like a piece of candy. You struggled and begged to not be eaten. Just when you thought she was going to swallow you, she started to move. Your tiny body drooled out of her mouth and onto the sand. You wipe the saliva away, while hearing Charlie and Frisk laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, got you! You should have seen your face!\" You looked to see Charlie was still shrunk next to Frisk. You started to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, Charlie came up with the idea of pretending to eat you, since you came up with the idea to tickle us both. She hid in my hair and watched you enter my mouth. Are you mad?\" She asked, still smiling. You shook your head. It was a pretty good trick after all. You climbed onto Frisk's foot, Charlie was on the other one. \"Now, I think it's time for my first wish.\" She said, holding the mermaid scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to wish for?\" Charlie asked. Frisk thought about it, then wished for. . .</span></div></div>",

Frisk transformed back into her human form with a shocked look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously! Then we have no choice!\" Frisk said.

Still, you didn't want to disappoint them, so you listened to their lesson. Although you struggled, the girls made sure you didn't give up.

Frisk wasn't sure either. This insect had a pink body with blue spots, six legs, and a female human head. At the moment it was asleep. You and Frisk climbed out of Charlie's bellybutton.

I found it very strange to see all those things floating about with no human hands to support them! But what does this have to do with me being here?\" Alice asked as she sat down on the nearby couch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's possible when you fell through the rabbit hole you must have seen the swirling portal and due to your curious nature you followed it and ended up here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make much sense to me though.\" Alice said through fully \"I certainly didn't see any 'portal' when I fell through the rabbit hole.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably did but didn't realize what it was.\" You said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I believe you're a honest person and are telling me the truth so I'll believe you but please tell me if this 'portal' thing sent me here then how can I go back home?\" She asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll just have to wait for the portal to reappear first Alice! It may take a few seconds or even a few hours,I really have no idea whether or not it might appear again we'll have to see but in the meantime you must be a bit hungry and tired I have plenty of food and there's a small guest room down the hall where you can rest.\" You informed her as you stood up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh alright then. Thank you very much for your kindness. I am a bit hungry what do you have to eat?\" She asked also standing up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here let me lead you into the kitchen.\" As you escorted the cartoon Disney character into the direction of the kitchen explaining how all the odd electric appliances worked,the cheeky Disney girl's big blue eyes widened as you taught her how the fridge and ice maker worked,how the microwave worked and the stove itself worked although you warned her not to touch it as you were cooking something for her she obeyed and simply sat at the table watching you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh all this is very fascinating to me_. But I was wondering when that portal thing may show up again....ohhhh are these cookies?\" She asked as she saw the pack of Oreos on the table next to her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they are actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oreos? How incredibly odd(as she ripped open the resealable bag covering and pulled one out examining it closely)for a name for a cookie.

Her eyes sparkled like stars in the night. The first place you took her was the kitchen. When she entered, she immediately went to the toaster. She picked it up and looked at it closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is for heating bread up. The bread becomes warm and crunchy. People also like to put peanut butter on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I try that?\" She asked, you nodded and showed her how to make toast. She was startled when the bread popped out. You spread peanut butter on it and gave it to her. She took a few bites and moaned with delight. You then took her to the laundry room and showed her the washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this, you don't need to hand wash clothes. It will do the work for you. You then put the clothes in the dryer and it will make them dry for you. It's a lot faster than manually drying them.\" Alice looked at all of the buttons and looked inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could a person ride this dryer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically speaking they could, however since it heats up to dry the clothes it wouldn't be a good idea. The inside also turns in counterclockwise, so it could hurt your body by bumping it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh too bad.\" As you showed her more things, she kept inspecting items and asking questions. You finally got to your bedroom and showed her your system. You told her how it could play games that happened in a fantasy world and it could play movies which were like plays in a theater except they happened on a moving screen. You looked at her and noticed she was blushing a little and was giving you a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing. I was just wondering\u2026 well\u2026 could you\u2026 you know\u2026 give me a kiss?\" She asked, blushing even more. You started to blush yourself. You knew in the movies she wasn't in a relationship with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" You said, giving her an awkward smile. You walked over to her and let Alice wrap her arms around you, leaning in for a kiss. She kissed you passionately, you kissed her back. You have never felt this way before about someone. After a minute, she pushed you, making you fall onto your bed. The two of you smiled at each other. Then without warning, she took her dress off. You started to blush like crazy as she started to take her dress off. She then took off her black bow, stockings and shoes. All she was currently wearing now was her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like what you see?\" Alice said, making your face turn red. She leaned in and gave you another kiss.

Aren't you going to say I'm incredibly beautiful?

She giggled as she studied them. She also loved how she could bend them, despite the fact that they were made of metal. If she didn't know any better, she could have thought these were toys. As the giantess put her things down, she suddenly noticed a car driving towards her. She picked it up and looked inside to see a strange teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she tried to drive away, the teenager couldn't do anything with Alice holding her. Alice carefully inspected both outside and inside the car. She pressed her fingers a little to see how weak the car was compared to her. The car easily caved in, scarring the poor teenager. However, what Alice did next scared her the most. Alice pulled the door off and grabbed the girl. She then pulled her out and studied her. Though Alice had seen her friend this small, she didn't take the time to see one up close. She was amazed at how small she was. Alice felt her tiny clothes, they felt so soft.  Alice was so mesmerized, she didn't notice that the girl was screaming. The giantess was so distracted by everything, she forgot that she went to get materials for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was about to bring the tiny female closer to her, when she suddenly heard her stomach growl. When the teenager heard this, she screamed louder, not wanting to be food. Luckily to her surprise, Alice set her down gently and stepped away. The hungry giantess searched until she saw a feast in the park. It looked like the people left it, so she decided to help herself. Alice grabbed everything and put in her pocket. She wanted to get the food together first before eating it. She continued to collect food from the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you drove through the city, trying to find her. You didn't know how you lost her, she was a massive giant girl. You drove up to a passed out teenager. When you helped her, she explained that Alice grabbed her car. You thanked her for giving you a lead and continued. After another hour of searching, you finally located her on a hill laying down. She was devouring every bit of food she had. You rushed over to her and yelled her name. She sat up and saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, my friend! I'm so sorry, I completely forgot about you!\" As you started to talk, she finished off the food she collected. However . . .</span></div></div>",

She planned to get food and then to help you. She searched around until she found a large store. She pulled off the roof and started to collect. She immediately ate some, like oranges and bananas, and saved others, like doughnuts and muffins. However, she forgot that you were there and put the food in the same pocket you were in. Lots of food landed on you. You struggled to get out, if you didn't stop her she was about to eat all of the food in the city. You also didn't want her to eat you since you were in the pile of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to get out, Alice saw the most amazing thing. People were showing off the world's largest muffin. The muffin was just her size. She eagerly ran over and grabbed it. She didn't care that the people screamed, she was too hungry and didn't want to save this one. You poked your head out of her pocket just in time to see her eat it. She made quick work of it, biting it away. Unfortunately, before Alice picked it up, a random girl had ate her way into the middle. The girl fell into Alice's mouth and was swallowed with the muffin. Neither Alice nor you knew of her presence. Alice finished up and gave a loud burp. It caused a lot of people, and buildings, to fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice kept collecting food, you climbed up her dress. At this moment, you felt like an ant. Whenever she stopped, you struggled to hang on. You got all the way up to her chin when she sat down on a quiet beach. She started to pull out the treats she collected and devoured them. It was a good thing you had moved, she wasn't making sure that she grabbed you by mistake. You struggled to climb around and up to her ear. The only thing you wanted to do now was feed her with sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got just inside her ear and yelled, startling the poor girl. She started to choke a little from being surprised like that. She eventually got the food down, but it hurt a little bit. She grabbed you and brought you to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you again. How did you get up there?\" You explained everything and told her to please stop eating. She started to say something, but suddenly stopped. She got a weird feeling and set you down on her lap for the moment. Suddenly, she started burping. She couldn't contain herself and caused most of the buildings to collapse. When she thought she was done, she gave one more burp. It was the biggest one she ever had, and everyone could hear it. She put her hand to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" She said. She picked you up again. Although it smelled, you still talked to her. You were worried about how the people would react, but she didn't seem to care. Instead, she wanted to . . . </span></div></div>",

You smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, don't worry about it. If you want to play with me, just go ahead. I won't mind. Even if I beg and scream, just go ahead and have fun. Just as long as you don't hurt me.\" You said. She blushed, asking if you were serious. You nodded, after all, she was a friend and she should get to use her new size for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Um, if it's alright, can I kiss you, since you're being so nice to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask, just do. In a way, I'm kind of like your pet . . or slave, depending on how you want to look at it.\" She brought you in to kiss you.  As Alice sat in the grass, people were able to see the two of you kiss. Neither of you cared though. When she started pulling you back, her hand tilted. You started to slip and fell down into the collar of her dress. Alice giggled as you tumbled down her belly. You landed on her leg. You looked down to see her giant shoe, and when you looked up, you saw her bellybutton, tummy and breasts. \"Now I know how an ant feels.\" You say. \"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Alice! Can you hear me? If you can, please pull me out.</font>\" You yell. However, you can hear Alice chuckle, you knew something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, little friend. Do you remember what you said. You said, and I quote 'even if I beg and scream, just go ahead and have fun'. Do you thing you're there by accident? Of course not. I sent you there so I could have fun. However, I don't think you are close enough. Let me help you.\" She said. You were a little confused until you look down. Her hand was going into her dress getting closer to you. You stayed still as her fingers wrapped around you. However, instead of taking you out, she lifted you up higher. Alice opened her panties and dropped you in. You could feel the lips of her opening, they were pretty warm. \"Get cozy down there, you'll be there for a while. Don't try to climb out this time, if you do, I'll put you farther in. I'll go explore the city while you get to sleep next to the best bed there is.\" You started to feel her move. All you could do was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice traveled around, looking at different buildings. As she did this, she thought about you in her panties. She never had a man get this close, the thought aroused her a little. No matter how she moved, she could always feel you. She was so busy thinking, she almost tripped over a factory. When she snapped back into focus, there was a lot of smoke in front of her. She looked down to see a factory. They were making cars, and we're making a lot of black smoke. The smoke started going up her nose. Alice took a step back, trying to hold her sneeze. She tried very hard, but her body won the battle. She sneezed, causing some trees to go flying. She rubbed her nose and looked at the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sneezed again. She wasn't happy, and not because she couldn't stop sneezing. This stupid building was damaging Earth. Alice decided to do something. She raised her foot and slammed it down. She kept stomping, crushing it to pieces. She didn't care if anyone was inside, this torture device was going down.  She rubbed her foot on the remaining pieces, making sure she got it. That would teach humans. She walked away and didn't look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alice got to a quiet spot, she was disappointed. This whole time you didn't struggle much. Though she was a little aroused from you being in her panties, she wanted to feel you squirm. She sat down and grabbed you. You thought you were finally going to see the sunlight again, you didn't know just how incorrect you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was hoping I would get to feel you squirm against me, but you must have been so comfortable. Guess what, I have somewhere even more cozy. Enjoy!\" She said and took you around back. When you realized where she was putting you, you really struggled. You didn't want to accidentally be squashed, and you wanted to be somewhere that smelled nice. She opened her panties and put you next to her butt. Though it looked nice, you knew that she would do something nasty to you. You begged and told her you would get her aroused. You heard her laugh. \"Oh silly, you had me aroused a little, but now I'm even more aroused. You're actually struggling, . . . My tiny victim . . . You don't need to worry, I won't harm you . . Physically.\" She said and laid down on her stomach to take a nap. Though you kept struggling, it was no use. Suddenly . . .</span></div></div>",

However, when she tries to avoid a red car, she stumbles and falls into a building. Her shoulder breaks some bricks off. A lot of cars come to a screeching halt. As she repositions herself, you jump onto her shoe. You weren't sure how to stop her, but maybe if you got to her ear, you could convince her. You started to climb, hoping she wouldn't accidentally shake you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\" She said, after getting her balance back. She bended down and grabbed the bricks that fell off. \"Oh well, at least I now have some bricks for that nice boy.\" She continued walking, unaware of your presence. You had gotten pretty high on her leg, so it was impossible for her to see you. Suddenly as Alice was turning a corner, she realized she was about to step on someone. She went to avoid them, causing her to lose her balance again and fall down onto her back. Though she made a big crack in the middle of the road, it was lucky for both of you. For Alice, she avoided hurting anyone, and fell next to a construction site, so she could get more bricks. For you, it made things really easy to get higher. You quickly rushed before she got up. You managed to get to her belly button as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, how lucky am I!\" She said and grabbed wood and bricks from the site. A few of the workers complained. \"I'm sorry, but I need this to repay someone.\" She said and continued. Alice started to fell hungry, but she was sure she almost had all the supplies she needed. Meanwhile, you climbed up to her breasts. You were pretty tired, but you wouldn't give up. Unfortunately, when you stopped to take a breather, she suddenly put her hands where you were. She pressed them against you a little tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still hadn't felt you, instead, she saw lots of bricks and wood in a pile. She didn't know what they were supposed to be for, but she was excited that she found some. She skipped over, almost hitting a couple of cars, and grabbed them. She stuffed them in her pocket. By this time, you finally reached her chin. It was easy since she was distracted. You climbed up her cheek and to her ear. You were out of breath, and weren't sure how long you could cold onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALICE, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME!\" You yell in her ear. She jumps, startled. Alice loses her balance and falls onto an empty pink car, crushing to the the height of a pancake. After a moment, she got back up and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, who said that?\" She asked,bending over to look down at her feet. She was confused, the poor oblivious giantess couldn't see anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here, next to your ear.\" You say. She stands up at her full height and reaches for her left ear. She grabs you and brings you to her face to get a better look. After a moment, her face lights up and she recognizes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It's you. Guess what, I have all the supplies I need to rebuild your house.\" She says, smiling. You explain to her though that building a house isn't as easy as she thinks it is. Alice frowns, sad from what you tell her. \"Oh, but I want to try at least. I want to help you.\" She places you in her other pocket and walks back to where your house used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she gets there, she pulls you out and sets you down. You look to see she had made footprints in the street on her way back. She didn't seem to notice though.<br>\r\n\"Alright, here I go. Wish me luck.\" She gets to work. After an hour, she declares to be done. You inspect it to see that . . .</span></div></div>",

No way!\" You thought the young beautiful  fifteen year old Princess of the fiction desert kingdom of Agrabah was busy looking around amazed herself \"Where am I?\" She wonders out loud hen her stunning brown eyes turn right at you and she backs up further on the couch where she first fell gasping \"Oh my! Who are you and...\" You stepped forward and outstretched your hand despite you being extremely nervous it wasn't everyday you met a stunning,beautiful Disney Princess face to face like this \"Umm Princess Jasmine my name is....\" At hearing you speak her name Jasmine gasped out loud \"Ho..how do you know my name? Are..,are you a new palace guard or servant and why doesn't any of this look like the palace?\" You quickly answer that \"First of all no I'm neither a palace guard nor am I a hired servant nor are you in the palace of Agrabah Princess in fact you're miles away from Agrabah altogether or centuries away I really should say...\" \"Centuries?\" She quizzed arching a eyebrow as she slowly got up to study you \"Why are your clothes so strange looking? And what do you mean by centuries?\" \"How to explain this....you have been somehow mysteriously brought from your world into my living room in other words you're in the future Princess Jasmine...\" \"Future? You said I...wait out of the palace? I'm outside of the palace?\" As she rushed over to the nearest window and gasped looking outside at the sunny neighborhood and your parents' clean lawn \"Oh it's even more wonderful than I ever could have imagined! But why doesn't any of this look familiar? All the stories from the guards and servants about what Agrabah....\" You interrupted her gently \"I already told you Princess you're not in Agrabah anymore you're in the future,in my house...\" Jasmine once again glanced at you \"In your house? This is where you live?\" As she began curiously wondering around looking at all the modern things like your widescreen TV,stereo system and laptop on the table \"Yeah I'm sure all of this is very confusing to you so I'll do my best to explain everything carefully so you can understand okay?\" You hold out your hand to her and she shakes it and finally gives you a sweet trusting smile \"Thank you and may I please ask your name?\" \"Frank.\" You reply and she grandly introduces herself as you began explaining all the bizarre equipment and stuff in the living room and how they operated then you began showing her the kitchen(she was very fascinated by the modern apprentices including the stove,microwave,fridge,ice maker and everything else)then you showed her the bathroom,your parents' bedroom and finally your room and the lone guest room where she would be staying at fortunately  Princess Jasmine seemed to be quite a fast learner despite the numerous questions she kept asking you she appeared to memorize things you showed her at a quicken pace finally you showed her a display globe of the world pointing out various countries and places including where she was currently at the United States of America \"May I see the rest of this United States of America?\" She eagerly asked you shook your head \"You could but it would take over four whole years or more to show you every single bit of it Princess.\" She spinning the globe in her hands muttered \"Please Frank you can just call me Jasmine I don't mind *giggle* now I'd like to show you where I come from Agrabah you said every single place on earth can be found here now where....\" She gasped \"Wait where is it? It should be right here!\" She cried as she spun the globe around and around looking at various spots you quickly told her that Agrabah was in reality a really tiny place that historians hadn't really discovered yet that was why it wasn't anywhere on the globe she seemed to buy the little lie for now then came the tough job of explaining the history of how the world changed since her timeline luckily your parents were nuts about history and had a huge library of world encyclopedias you spent most of the day showing Jasmine everything from the French Revolution all the way to today's age she kept asking various questions many you couldn't answer until she seemed to absorb all this mind mashing information and stood up smiling at you \"Thank you so very much Frank for telling and showing me all this I really think I'm going to enjoy this wonderful new world.\" She beamed happily as she put her hand on your shoulder you blinked at her in shock \"Are..are you sure...you don't want to go back to Aladdin and...\" At this her eyes widened in confusion \"Who's that? I don't know anyone named Aladdin is he someone you know? A friend of yours?\" She asked curiously you thought about this for a few minutes \"Okay although she is indeed Princess Jasmine in the flesh this must be the very beginning of the movie right before she meets Aladdin or Abu...but just to make sure...\" And you ask her if she recognizes the names of Aladdin,Genie,Abu,or Carpet she repeatedly shakes her head at each one but she does recognize the names Jafar and Iago and this makes you even more happy \"Okay this is definitely before the film she must have just attempted to escape the palace....\" \"Are you alright Frank?\" Jasmine asked her tone highly concerned you stared at her pretty stunning face and smile widely \"Yeah I am say are you tired or anything you can head into the guest room and rest....\" \"I'm not one bit tired Frank I find this new world very fascinating and want to explore all of it...but you...why are you staring at me that way?\" She finally noticed the way you were staring at her and this rather than make her angry and flee the room in rage and disappointment she got a small smile on her face \"Oh I see...\" \"What?\" You tried to play dumb but she saw through your ruse \"You can't fool me dozens of handsome suitors were also enchanted by my beauty rather than my personality...are you one of those handsome men,young men who see me for just my stunning beauty or my personality and beyond...\" She gives you a questioning look that demands you answer her what is your answer? </span></div></div>",

Now that's that done I want to explore more of this amazing world can you show me what lies outside?\" You still getting over the shock she kissed you nodded \"Sure thing Jasmine but where can we possibly go? To the ballpark? No you probably wouldn't understand the point of it,the movies nah I'll save that for some other time hey how about the mall it's just down the street from my house,I mean my parents' house....\" \"What's a mall?\" She curiously asked you carefully explain its a large outlet of stores and of course she is wanting to go see what it looks like and escort her out the front door for the first time Jasmine is awestruck by the outside world \"Oh this is really amazing Frank but how can we get to this mall from your house? Do you have a few horses we can ride?\" You shake your head and point to the strange metal object with four wheels you inform her is called a car(good thing you recently got your driver's premit)and is mostly how you and everyone else gets around nowadays Jasmine takes her time studying every inch of it like a curious child \"Oh this is such a amazing....umm invention I have never seen a horseless carriage before can you show me how it works please?\" You opened the passage side for her and escort her inside and get on the driver's side she is busy staring around the interior of the car including curiously pressing all the weird buttons and knobs on the steering wheel and entertainment section luckily the ignition was off as you sat down and started the engine and showed her how to put on her seatbelt and why it was important Jasmine stared over in awe and curiousity as she watched you hands on the steering wheel as you pull out of the driveway \"What is that you're doing?\" She asked after a while of studying how you operate the vehicle \"This particular vehicle called a car there are many difficult versions of cars and even larger vehicles Princess around in all shapes and sizes it requires a human to operate it properly unlike horses or other animals my hands are on the circular object called a steering wheel in order to move the car around on the road and both of my feet operate the small pedals on the floor one makes the car go faster and the other helps slow it to a full stop if need be.\" \"May I try it please? Can you show me how?\" She asked eagerly but you shook your head \"I'm sorry Jasmine I don't think it's a good idea right now there could be a bad accident or something might go wrong but I'll try and teach you later I promise for now I want to show you what the mall looks like.\" \"Oh alright.\" She sighed disappointed looking out the window at all the passing small buildings,electric poles and other cars on the road finally after a while you arrived at your destination:the small outlet mall of your town as the both of you get out \"So this is a mall?\" She asked clearly a bit disappointed you nodded \"Yeah and it's a lot larger on the inside trust me a lot of people go to malls especially on the weekends to buy stuff.\" \"What kinds of things can be brought here?\" Jasmine asked as she followed you to the double doors and you opened and held one for her \"All sorts of things clothes,food,things,decorations for your house you'll see when we get inside the main area there are dozens of stores....\" But she held back for a minute \"Wait I don't have any gold on me I....I can't afford....\" But you put a hand on her shoulder \"Oh we really don't use gold anymore as currency Jasmine we use these(as you pull out your wallet and show her paper money and explain who the people are on them)I'll explain the value of money later right now I'll buy you whatever you may need Jasmine.\" She looked bewildered and horrified for a moment \"Oh no I can't let you spend any of your paper money on me.....\" As you both enter into the completely crowded entrance to the mall and Jasmine's brown eyes pop open in awe and shock at everything that surrounded her \"Oh my.....this is extraordinary I never would have believed.....this is so amazing!\" \"I'll let you explore around for a bit Jasmine while I follow closely behind you alright?\" But she halfway heard you as she was already wandering out of sight soon she vanished in the thick crowds and occasionally you would catch a glimpse of her in a store glancing curiously around or examining various clothes or other man made material or just staring at people in their bizarre outfits before darting away again to another store or part of the mall finally just as you thought you lost her Jasmine reappeared suddenly behind you smiling placing a calm hand on your shoulder \"Hello Frank!\" She beamed you were amazed she wasn't tired at all she seemed to have a superhuman amount of stamina and energy to do all that wandering around for nearly two hours \"You're back? Had a fun time exploring around? Have you found anything you want to buy yet or want really badly?\" You asked looking around Princess Jasmine nodded fiercely as she spotted something she really wanted which was </span></div></div>",

First, you turn the key in that keyhole to start the car.\" You instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded and she puts the key in the keyhole and turns it to start the engine. You hear the car running and move on to the next lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you check your rear view mirrors and see if you can see what's behind you.

This is one of the reasons why. Also, when you turn the wheel while in reverese, the car will go in the opposite direction. So, be careful on that.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded in understanding and she gently let go of the brake with her foot on it. She looks behind her, turned the wheel left and the car was facing right. She's doing well so far. But now, comes the hard part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you put this handle on the letter D for it stand for drive when you want to go forward.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine pulled the handle on the letter D and is all set to go forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now, you let go of the brake and push, also gently, on the gas pedal.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the pedal on the right?\" Jasmine wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded and hits gently on the gas pedal and the car went forward. She hit the brake and looks at the street before continuing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. You always look both ways before getting out of a parking lot.\" You instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine continues on into the street and turned right. Jasmine makes sure that her eyes is on the road at all times and that she's going on the speed limit that she sees passing by. She then sees a redlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a redlight, Jasmine! Brake!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine hits the brake before going through the redlight. You begin to get impressed by how she's doing so far. Let's just hope it stays that way. The light turn green and Jasmine goes on driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jasmine. Our turns coming up. Now, you see that handle? That's the one for the turn signals. If you push it up, you're going right. If your pushing down, you're going left.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Jasmine gets the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes the handle up and the right blinker went up. She makes it to the turn and she manages to turn the car okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I must say, you're doing well for your first drive.\" You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a great and handsome teacher helping me.\" Jasmine said smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at that comment and Jasmine continues on driving.</span></div></div>",

Like being imprisioned in a dungeon?\" You come to a full stop on the side of the road and explain everything to her as the cop car is a mere feet away from you the man in his bright blue uniform and shining badge came over Jasmine tries to ask you what was that strange metal object with the stick at the end  he was pulling out of his side pocket but you quickly instruct her to keep quiet while you handle this strangely she doesn't seem offended by your harsh words <br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how fast you were going son?\" He asked you nodded <br>\r\n\"Yes I'm very sorry officer I....I was busy having a discussion with my girlfriend here and wasn't paying attention to the speed limit nor the road for that matter.\" Jasmine looked confusingly at you and whispered <br>\r\n\"Girlfriend why did you.....\" But you put a finger to her lips and she quickly clammed up the cop looked at her in turn <br>\r\n\"Cute girl but strangely outfit she's wearing but seriously kid you should have been paying more attention to the speed meter I'll let it slide this time only but next time I catch you I'll be forced to give you a speeding ticket understand?\" You nodded grateful he was so understanding and calm of the situation <br>\r\n\"Yes sir thank you sir it won't happen again!\" He turned away and began walking back to his car<br>\r\n\"See that it doesn't you two have a good day.\" As he got into his car and drove away you breathed a sigh of relief as Jasmine asked curiously <br>\r\n\"What did he mean by a speeding ticket?\" You explained it to her while you started the car and also pulled off from the side of the road and back onto the main highway following this Jasmine....</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, neither of you thought this through, because the people were running away from the tremors. Princess Jasmine was having too much fun to notice though. She kept laughing until she fell onto her back. You tickled and rubbed as much as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept tickling until a different sound appeared. It shook the whole place, making you fall over. You were confused, until you realized what it was: she was hungry. You knew she didn't eat the fly before, but you still hoped she wasn't hungry for little creatures like yourself. Before you could continue, the princess sat up and grabbed you, bringing you to her face. She definitely looked hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so much fun, but I think it's time for you to laugh.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as it doesn't involve me getting devoured.\" You respond. Jasmine is confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard your stomach, you're hungry aren't you? It's just that, . . . You could easily gulp me down without a thought.\" Jasmine put her hand to her stomach. She felt it rumbling. You realized she was trying to keep her mouth closed, but was struggling. \"Um, are you alright Princess?\" Finally, she couldn't hold it anymore. She started laughing again. It made it hard for you to stand, and you didn't know why she was laughing. It wasn't an evil laugh, which meant she wasn't about to harm you. Instead, it was as if she heard the best joke ever. \"Princess? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just . . . You thought . . . Heehee.\" She wiped a tear away. \"I'm sorry. It's just that I didn't even realize I was hungry until you said something. Even if I did, you're my friend. I wouldn't eat you, I care too much. Besides, I doubt you would be filling.\" She said, bringing one finger to you. \"Now as I said, it's time for you to laugh.\" The princess started to tickle your feet. You ended up laughing a lot, more than you expected. You couldn't stop, and the princess knew this. She had complete control over you. This went on for about 10 minutes. Finally, when she was done messing with you, . . .</span></div></div>",

You get to a store that you know really well. When you get inside, you see one of your friends working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy, how are you?\" You ask, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a great day, what about you?\" He responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My day hasn't been too bad.

We put a special ingredient that makes it pretty filling. You don't even need to heat it up, just grab and eat. That would probably be the best thing.

You're lucky, my girlfriend doesn't eat meat.\" You blush at him when he implies that Jasmine is your girlfriend. You went to the back and found the steak. You bought all of it and got your friend's help loading it in the trunk. You thanked him and paid him $100 as thanks. \"Man if she eats this much, you better hope she doesn't eat you with it.\" He giggles at his own joke. You giggled, not because his joke was funny, but because he had no idea how possible that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive back to find Jasmine waiting. She was so busy looking up at the sky, she didn't see you come back. She only noticed when you shut the car door. She lifted you up to her face so she could hear you better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, is all of that for me? That's a lot of food!\" She exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, a lot of food for a big girl. Go ahead and take as much as you want. It's all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist.\" She puts you down and grabs the steak. There's so much, she grabs two handfuls. she lifted her arms up and dropped them in her mouth. Though from your perspective, they simply disappeared, you shuddered at the thought of them violently getting mashed up before they entered the hot cavern for digesting. The fact that her belly was exposed made you shudder more. Jasmine rubbed her tummy and burped. \"Excuse me. Thank you for that though. I actually feel full. I didn't think you could have brought me anything to make me this full.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank my friend, he's the one who suggested the idea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when you see him, tell him I'm very grateful.

You quietly wake her up, hoping she'll enjoy it. When she opens her eyes, she sees you with the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is . . This for me?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Go ahead and enjoy it.\" You say. She takes it and Puts syrup on it. The princess then slowly tries a piece. You watch her chew it up and swallow. \"Well? Is it good?\" Suddenly, her eyes light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good! I must have more!\" She says and eats quicker. Once she ate one waffle, you stop her because you have an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey princess, if you want, I can feed you. I know you're an adult, but maybe it'll be fun.\" You say.

Your hand gets closer to it when Chell starts to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to help her up when she suddenly grabs you tightly. Her eyes open to reveal them glowing, Chell doesn't look happy either. Chell pins you down, and it looks like she's about to hurt you.

When your fingers wrap around it, Chell immediately looks scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>NO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HUMAN?!</i>\" Chell yells in a twisted voice. You pull on the necklace until it snaps off, causing Chell to fall backwards. She looks more terrified than ever. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Please . . Help . . .me</font>\" Chell weakly says in her normal voice. You're determined to help her, and you can tell it has something to do with this necklace. It has a shining emerald in the middle. You take into your garage. Chell follows behind, trying to get it back. You quickly throw the necklace on a table and grab a hammer. You smash the emerald as hard as you can. \"<i>NOOOO! MY VESSEL!</i>\" Chell yells in her twisted voice. A puff of smoke exits Chell's mouth and rises into the air. Suddenly, you can hear a high pitch noise. It's so loud it shatters all of the windows in the surrounding area. A bright light appears where the smoke was, filling the whole room. Then, both the light and the smoke vanish completely. The pieces of the emerald have turned dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Chell who has passed out on the ground. You walk over to her and pick her up. You take her upstairs to your bedroom and get her cozy. She looks tired so you leave her to get some rest. While she does that, you take the pieces of the gem and drive straight to the dump. You get out and chuck the fragments into a pile of garbage. They would never hurt anyone again, you knew it too since something was connected to it. You drive home and check on Chell. You get to her just in time to see her wake up. This time however, her eyes were normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where . . Am. . . I? What . . Is . .\" She starts to say, however, you walk up to her and told her to just get some rest, she was safe now. \"So . . . That demon . . . Is gone . . For good?\" She asked. You nodded. \"Thank you.\" Chell was starting to tear up now. You got her to lay back down and told her to get sleep, the two of you would talk in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went and slept on the couch. Though you weren't used to it, you knew Chell deserved her bed more. You put a hand to your neck. To think she almost chocked you tonight, it scared you a little. You decided not to worry and go to sleep. When you wake up, . . .</span></div></div>",

You also only have those clothes on your back, so we probably should get you some stuff while we're out. I'll let you borrow some of mine while we're out as wearing those might not be the best idea,\" you explained. \"Okay, so when can we go?\" Chell asks. \"I was going to fix something to eat first, then I'll help you pick out some clothes to wear, then let you get dressed,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fix some pancakes for breakfast. Chell was a bit curious about what you were fixing at first, but you told her to simply have a seat at the table so you could talk while you fixed breakfast. \"I don't think I've properly introduced myself yet. My name's Alex,\" you tell her. \"I'm Chell,\" she replies. \"Will I enjoy what you're fixing, Alex?\" she asks. \"I'm hoping so,\" you answer. \"If I enjoy this, will you teach me how to fix it?\" Chell asks. \"If I get a chance, sure,\" you answer. About a few minutes later, you had a few pancakes done for both of you. You put them on a couple of plates, then pour syrup on them and get you both some silverware. It turns out you were right. Chell did enjoy them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, you clean up and take Chell up to your room. You made sure to get your wallet, car key, and phone. \"What exactly were those things you picked up?\" Chell asked. \"How I'm going to pay for everything, how we're going to travel, and something I keep around that can be very useful,\" you tell her. You then open your dresser and pick out some clothes for you and her. \"I'll get dressed elsewhere and let you change your clothes in here,\" You tell her. You then take your clothes to the bathroom and get dressed in there. You decide to brush your teeth while you were in there. Afterwards, you head back to your room and knock on the door. Chell has changed her clothes. \"Hold on, I've one more thing I should probably do before we go,\" you tell her. You then take the laundry down to the laundry room so you'll remember to clean them later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got back to your room, you take Chell to your car and help her buckle up her seatbelt and explained why it was important.

You decide to see if you can get a response out of this girl. \"Hey are you okay?\" You ask as you shake her a little, however all this gets out of her is a mixture of a groan and a moan of what you would assume to be pain! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, you spring in to action, picking the girl up after you warn her to hold still. You lay her down on your bed as carefully as you can as to not cause more harm to her before  going to the hall bathroom to grab the first aid kit. As you work on getting the girl's green princess like dress off you notice that her back and arms are covered in scratches and what (if you had to guess) seems to be claw marks, and some of them seem fresh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Man! Did this girl get into a fight with a bear?) You ask yourself in your head as you begin working on patching the girl up, at that moment the girl suddenly regains consciousness and on instinct begins to scream in to one of the pillows on your bed! She kept it up for about 10 minutes til she passed out and you could finish up. After that you drape the covers over the girl and leave her to her sleep. As you go into the living room one of your pet wolves/dogs goes over to you and begins nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *giggle* \"I love you too Ammy..\" You say trailing off as you head into the kitchen, \"So where's your brother?\" You ask Ammy as you grab a can of food for her and her brother, she barks in response as she glances at the door leading to the front porch. \"Oh he's still guarding the house huh? Well let him know he can come in for dinner. Then we'll go to bed.\" You say as you pour some food into Ammy's bowl and her brother's Ammy barks in response as she goes to get her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grab a pillow for yourself and the quilt off of the couch you think to yourself  (Wait a second the girl I found is princess Merida from the movie Brave! Hmm, I wonder how she ended up here? I'll have to ask her tomorrow.) With that you fall asleep. The next morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A/N: Before anyone asks yes the Ammy in this story is supposed to be Amaterasu from Okami and her brother is my own character he's named Amateraku and he has black fur and blue tattoo's and is the opposite of Amaterasu so if Amaterasu is the sun wolf, Amateraku or Raku for short is the wolf of the moon)                  </span></div></div>",

As your working on breakfast you hear a familiar groan from outside the kitchen, *Groan* \"Where the heck is this place and Who are you??\" Not having to look to know who that was, you focus on cooking as you say \"Ah, my name is Jack and your in my house.

You were covered in scratches when you showed up here last night and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerida raises an eyebrow for a second at the mention of scratches but doesn't dwell on it for long as she says \"Yes much better thank you Jack.\" A look of realization crosses Merida's face suddenly as she says \"Oh!

I'm Merida the royal princess of the land of DunBroch.\" Merida says in a hurry as you nod in response chuckling, \"That's no problem Merida.

I never knew such amazing things existed mind if I try?\" As she sits down to type out random things on the screen once you show her how  just for fun before typing out your name and beaming at you then she stands up  \"Well I'm finished shall we go into your kitchen now?\" She offers her arm to you as you escort her into the small kitchen and she is beyond fascinated by how the refrigerator,stove,microwave and freezer operates examining each in turn before asking you to show her how each works then you show her into the bathroom,your bedroom and guest room where she will be staying finally Rose appears to be satisfied \"Well that was a interesting little tour you showed me Willy and I do thank you for your tremedous generosity so to show my grad...\" You shake your head \"You don't have to thank me Rose...Its  my pleasure to ser..\" \"Don't tell me what I can and can't do!\" She snapped annoyed obliviously she wasn't one for being rudely interrupted \"I actually want to thank you Willy for your kindness.\" As she reaches into one of her dress pockets you're sure for her purse \"With what money?\" You ask a bit too eagerly she raised a eyebrow then laughed merrily \"If I could I would but no I have something else in mind...\" As indeed she does pull out her incredibly small change purse but it's not money she pulls out but a tube of lipstick after a few minutes of adding a slick of lipstick onto her cherry lips then slowly steps in front of you puckering up her lips \"No with this.\" And kisses you on the cheek you blush furiously as she smiles \"You deserved that for your kindness towards me and now I'd like to ask you a personal question if you don't mind.\" You nod still unable to shake off the fact she just kissed you \"Of course ask away.\" </span></div></div>",

What a ironic twist! You're one year older than me!\" You were a tad disappointed by her reply \"Wait! You're not mad about this not being my house and all?\" She shook her head \"No though by all means I should be but somehow I knew you weren't the owner as you're a little too young and dare I say irresponsible for having such a large and wonderful home.\" She pointed out the numerous dirt spots on the carpets and cobwebs on the ceiling not to mention the number of dishes in the sink and dirt covered floor in the kitchen and bathroom \"Certainly no one like you would stoop to having such a dirty house no offense to your parents or your feelings I hope...\" She added seeing your own eyebrows raised you laugh \"None taken sorry about that my folks are out of town and leaving me in charge proved to be a mistake but I'm sure you're familiar with how boys are in your timeline.\" \"Not really I'm forced to only be around once more I mean no offense but people who can afford the finer things in life in other words very wealthy people of the highest social class(sigh) how much I hate it...\" As she sat down on the couch her face in her hands you couldn't tell whether due was crying or not but sit down beside her with your hand on her shoulder she doesn't objective to this nor attempt to throw it off \"You really must hate it don't you?\" She nods wiping her eyes on a cloth at her side \"Very much that's why I attempted once or twice to talk my fianc\u00e9e Cal' out of this wedding but needless to say my mother intervened and he won the case yes I hate it a lot but tell me what are girls like here,what is the social status here Willy can you tell me?\" You aren't sure how to answer this she senses this and takes your hand into her own tenderly smiling at you \"Come on please tell me\" \"Okay things are a lot different compared to what you're used to Rose women have a lot more advantages and are able to do more nowadays believe me when I say you won't be treated like some trophy or object by anyone here you can be your own person and no one will ever try and judge you otherwise.\" Her eyes lit up as she squeezed your hand affectedly \"Really? Then I will take your word for it!\" \"Why did you ask my age for?\" You ask she giggles cutely \"Because I am curious silly that's why!\" \"Yeah but there have to be another reason than that Rose you like me don't you?\" She gets up a bit annoyed huffing \"How absurd! I admit you are a very kind person and I do admire your company but...I barely know you so how could I have any feelings for you if we only met a few hours ago?\" \"People meet all the time and instantly fall for each other the moment they meet how's this any different?\" Rose laughed loudly covering her mouth with one mouth \"My word you are quite the intelligence person aren't you? You just don't give in! Alright I'll admit it I do sort of like you but I'm engaged you see and ohh it would never work between us and not because of the social statuses either I come from a different timeline and could never fit in here surely you understand right Willy?\" You nod fully \"Yeah didn't think of it that way sorry.\" But she places a hand on your shoulder smiling \"Don't think of it that way while I'm here you can think of me as your girlfriend and I would be honored to call myself your fiancee as I stated earlier I'm very admired by your kindness and handsomeness but please excuse me as I must rush to your bathroom for just a moment.\" \"If you're feeling uncomfortable in that dress you're wearing you can borrow one of my mom's I'm sure she won't mind as it's shorter and you'll have plenty of room to move around freely.\" Rose smiles at this \"Thank you for that but I simply need to use the little girls' room pardon my expression excuse me please.\" As she departs straight into the bathroom you think of what to do next \"Maybe I could play a harmless prank on her she seems kind enough as I'm certain she won't mind.\" But what could you do to someone like Rose without truly upsetting her?</span></div></div>",

I never was allowed to due to Cal' and mother thinking me irresponsible but I learned a bit of it..\" \"Well cars of the 21st century are a bit more complicated Rose you might have a tougher time trying to learn it all but I promise or you can remind me to teach you at a later date...you're not mad are you that I said I can't teach you right now are you?\" \"No what would make you think I am?

What's your IQ level?\" You curiously ask she thinks for a minute \"I believe it's somewhat above 150 if I'm not mistaken so yes I am incredibly intelligence but I'm certain you are too so where exactly are you taking me?\" She asked as she tried to get comfortable you show her how to adjust her seat by the small lever at her right foot \"To a fast food restaurant rather than serving gourmet food they serve things like hamburgers or French fries....\" You pause as she looks bewildered \"Hamburgers are basically smaller versions of steak and...\" \"I know I've had them before.\" She said a bit rudely then covered her mouth ashamed \"Sorry I didn't mean to shout like that but the way people talk to me often like they think I'm not as intelligence as them!

Yes I am a giant girl(she gave a small resentful chuckle at this) but I have no intention of harming any of you nor any of your possessions so if you would just be so kind to form a straight path so I may make it through your city without any senseless destruction or(gasp!)casualties there will be no reason to panic so please try to steer clear of my foot here it comes...\" Slowly she took her first step and as expected when the bare foot hit the pavement it cracked into two and sent a mild tremor radiating through the earth people screamed for mercy as everything violently shook around them and cling to anything not flying five or ten feet into the air Rose looked highly sympathetic with fear and compassion with her fee hand over her mouth  she muttered \"Oh my word! I'm terribly sorry about that is everyone alright?\" She would have bent down and grabbed a few injured people lying on the street but no doubt that would have caused more destruction so she just decided to wait for a while until the streets were clear before slowly very slowly continuing but what about you? </span></div></div>",

How am I going to explain to them that a weird portal tore up the living room and destroyed sell their stuff?\" But you had something else to worry about:mainly the girl clearly in her early teens on your couch looking blank and confused as you inched a bit nervously closer to her you noticed \"There's something really familiar about this girl but I can't put my finger on it!\" As she had dark brown eyes,green eyes you suppose it was hard to tell and was dressed in a type of ragged dress fabric of some type of material revealing her long tanned legs and bare feet you didn't recognize \"Are you okay?\" You asked her as she sat up staring confusingly at you with big eyes but didn't reply you offered your hand to her informing her you meant no harm \"Look you're perfectly safe Miss I mean you no harm.\" Then finally she spoke \"Where am I?\" You replied \"In my living room?\" \"Living room?\" She asked as she began wandering around the destroyed part of your house examining every bit of space \"Where's Jason and Brett? Are we at ORCA? Where's Charley? Where's island?\" You realize she's referring to the two boys she befriended in the show the older one Jason who eventually develop romance feelings for her in the near future and vice versa,ORCA being the futuristic marine facility their mother Diane was heading up to study mostly whales and Charley of course being her whale companion whom she had a telepathic connection to you replied \"You're far from Australia Neri you're in the United States.\" \"United States? Where's that?\" She asked curiously turning back to look at you \"It's across the sea far from Australia on the western side it's much larger than Austr...\" And you realize all this explaining is highly confusing to her being she is almost has a childlike personality but wise beyond her years at the same time and stop \"Yeah I'll explain it you later so are you alright? Are you hungry by any chance?\" Recalling the episode you just watched upon visiting the OCRA facility Neri and her younger sister had just taken a interest in eating human food such as hamburgers having survived on basically fish all this time she nodded and said \"Yes but what is your name?\" You told her what it was and rather than introduce herself or shake your hand she continued looking curiously at you as if searching for something deep within your body \"You're Neri aren't you? The extraterrestrial alien girl sent to protect the planet's oceans from pollution and such.....\" \"Extra...\" She asked curiously still looking at you studying every inch of you \"It...it means alien or not from this world but anyway what did you say you wanted to eat?\" \"Hamburger please Jason and Brett and Mother(this the name she normally called the boys' mother Diane)said hamburgers are really good.\" You nodded and went off into the kitchen luckily you had a few leftovers from Wendy's but before you could even move a weird bluish glow formed around Neri's entire body \"I feel strange,body feels funny...\" Was all that she got out little did you realize was that that portal had odd effects on people or things that came through it with Neri it was going to be one of the biggest moments of her young alien life you watched astonished as the alien princess slowly began to grow in size and height before your very eyes just how big does she end up becoming? </span></div></div>",

What kind of place could this possibly be?\" As you slowly stand up you take a really good look at the girl she appears to be either 14,15 or possibly 16 years old and seems highly familiar \"Where am I?\" The girl with long ginger hair asked again looking wildly around her bright blue eyes dart confusingly from the wall of your dad's trophies,to the busted up TV now emitting smoke,to your cellphone on the table next to her which she curiously picks up examining it closely \"What kind of strange contraption is this?\" She wonders to herself it is then that you suddenly realize who she is after taking a look at your library copy of 'A Feast Of Cows' from the Game Of Thrones' series <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sansa Stark?

Oh my who are you?\" Sansa asked still holding your cellphone you stepped forward <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is......this is my house Miss you're in right now I know you're a bit confused,okay a lot confused but I'll try to explain everything as best....\" But she cut you off <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I am? What is this place? Is it a unknown region of Westeros or.....\" But she stopped when you shook your head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's kind of the hard part you see....you're not really in Westeros at all in fact you're thousands of miles probably centuries from your home.\" Her blue eyes became ever more confused and you directed her to take a seat on the nearby couch <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't Westeros? Then where am I at?\" She quizzed you walked over and picked out something on the nearby table and brought it back over to her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is called a globe of Earth which is where you are currently,a planet called Earth or more specifically here(as you pointed out the United States Of America) it's far away from your land of Westeros....\" You explained but she appeared even more confused <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth,United States of what was it again? Ameri...kka? Bu...but how could I possibly have gotten here?\" As she examined the globe you tried explaining what some of the other countries and she appears quite fascinated \"Oh this Earth and United States Of America appears very interesting! But may I please ask you your name?\" you tell her(Your Name is _.) and outstretches your hand shyly to which she gives you a stunning sweet smile as she shook it \"Okay then_. You have a odd name but I like it ohh I apologize.... I'm Sansa Stark,middle daughter to Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn Stark of Winterfell(she gave you a honorful bow of sorts) very pleased to meet you_. and as I quite find this United States of America.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually Wyoming,one of the 50 states remember that I shown some of them to you earlier? It's a small town in Wyoming that we're in.\" You informed her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then I find this 'Wyoming' place quite fascinating!(she giggled cutely)as do I find this thing quite interesting what is it may I ask?\" As she was still holding onto your phone <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called a cellphone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cellphone? Well what do you do with it?\" She asked curiously you turned it on for her and she let out a loud gasp as the light came on and the main screen appeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! How did it do that magic?\" You shook your head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No technology,something I'll explain later anyway you use it to talk to people here I'll show you...\" And you dialed the number of someone you knew and let her listen to the person on the other end Sansa's eyes widened once she heard this <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh extraordinarily this 'cellphone' is! May I please try it?\" she begged eagerly as you showed her how to correctly dial the numbers 'Ohh quite amazing! Could you show me more of this technology please? And more of this home you live in?\" You nodded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a tour?\" Sansa immediately jumped up excitedly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes please! That is if you don't mind I'd love one!\" And tenderly took your hand into her own where were you planning to take her first?</span></div></div>",

Please tell me what that square thing is on the wall over there?\" Sansa asked pointing directly at the widescreen TV on the left side of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that's called a television Ms. Stark.\" You informed her as you picked up the small remote and pressed the red 'Power' button as soon as she saw the bright screen change color and loud noise start emerging from the strange device Sansa Stark actually leaped back in shock and let a loud gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My....my goodness! What is that?\" She cried clutching her chest in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,it's called television think of it as a way used for entertainment like..like watching a play or sword or what you might refer to as a...a knight's tournament of sorts only we watch these...magical picture boxes instead.\" You tried your best to explain while handing her the remote and teaching her how to operate it correctly after a while she got the hang of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply astonishing!\" She exclaimed as she used the channel buttons to flip through the TV like mad gasping loudly as she witnessed hundreds of colors and some of the most bizarre images one from her medieval age ever saw before turning back to you beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this 'television' is another one of your technology?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah there's plenty things like this here in what we call the modern world.

I'd love to see more of this America-United States!\" The once tortured eldest Stark child was becoming ever more happy and eager to explore more of this era.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay here you can escort me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few metres ahead of you, you see your normal self, sitting on a small chair, sighing heavily while looking at the telescope. With no intention to alert your male counterpart, you tiptoe towards your wardrobe, quietly opening and hiding behind a nearby cupboard. Male clothing surrounds you and it somehow makes you feel uncomfortable, despite the fact that you have only been a girl for a few minutes. You feel your masculinity shrinking rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to shrug off the feeling of your gender issue, you instead focus on what your next move should be. Should you come out of the closet? Maybe you should stay and remain unnoticed. Floods of different scenarios get inserted in your brain but soon enough, a scarce feeling of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hits you hard in the brain, full knowledge of what is going to happen within the five minutes stuck in your thoughts. Slowly, you open your wardrobe door, letting a little bit of your bedroom light shine on your watch. Checking your wrist, you look at the time, trying to figure out when the portal explosion will likely occur. According to your recent memories, you estimate the explosion is going to happen within 12 seconds. In preparation, you slowly count down the numbers, whispering to yourself to a noise level where no-one can hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Twelve.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Eleven.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Ten.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Nine.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Eight.\"</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounting down the numbers in your head, you soon start to get nervous gradually, resulting in your numbers being said more slowly. You take a few milliseconds of hesitation before continuing the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Seven.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Six.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Five.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Four.\"</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments before you fully finished your count, a sudden explosion booms downstairs, startling you a little. Without hesitation, you sprint down towards the living room, hiding behind a nearby sofa, patiently and anxiously waiting for something else to happen. The most important part of the portal has yet to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds go by, and your eyes stay focused at the portal as you observe someone or something step out of it. To the side of your hiding place, you can hear your male self, walking down with heavy footsteps. You ignore it easily, instead, wanting to have one question answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho came out of the portal?</span></div></div>",
